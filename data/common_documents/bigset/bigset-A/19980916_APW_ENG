Japan plans to build spaceport on Christmas Island in the Pacific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's space agency plans to build a runway on
Christmas Island in the central Pacific for landing a prototype of
an unmanned space shuttle it is now developing, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
	   It will be the first large facility built by the National Space
Development Agency of Japan on foreign soil, agency spokeswoman
Megumi Nakamura said.
	   NASDA and the government of Kiribati, of which Christmas Island
is a part, will sign an agreement clearing the way for construction
in the near future, Nakamura said.
	   NASDA had initially considered several domestic sites for a
landing field but rejected them because air traffic was too heavy
and the space shuttles would have to fly over China and the Korean
peninsula to land, Kyodo News reported.
	   NASDA, which has operated a rocket and satellite tracking
station on the island since 1976, negotiated with Kiribati about
the runway for the past three years, Nakamura said.
	   Earlier this year, the space agency decided to postpone the
first launch of the prototype space shuttle by three years to 2003
because of budgetary and technical difficulties.
	   The 20-ton unmanned craft, called the Hope-X, is designed to
carry out scientific experiments and ferry payloads of up to 3 tons
into space. It is modeled after the U.S. space shuttle.
	   The Hope-X will be lifted into orbit atop a powerful booster
rocket and then re-enter the earth's atmosphere on a pre-programmed
route for a runway landing.

	   Explaining the recent tension between Iran and Afghanistan:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LEADERS:
	   Mullah Mohammed Omar: The reclusive Taliban leader who
repeatedly has accused Iran of supporting the opposition forces.
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: Iran's supreme leader and
commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He has accused the Taliban
of massacring members of the Hazara ethnic minority in Afghanistan,
who, like most Iranians, are Shiite Muslims. The Taliban follow a
different stream of Islam, Sunnism.
	   SOURCES OF TENSION:
	   _Iran considers Afghanistan's civil war a source of instability
on its border, but the Taliban has refused Tehran's efforts to
negotiate a truce and power-sharing agreement.
	   _Iran views the Taliban's interpretation of Islam as putting
Muslim countries in a bad light. The Taliban's unusually strict
interpretation of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, bans music and
bars girls from school and women from work. In Iran, women can
vote, work and serve in Parliament.
	   _Last month, the Taliban overran the Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, an opposition stronghold, and 10 Iranian diplomats
and a journalist went missing. Last week, the Taliban admitted its
soldiers had killed nine of the Iranians.

Clashes between rival tribes kill 30 in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WASBIR HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Rival tribes wielding guns, machetes and
bows and arrows clashed in India's remote northeast, killing at
least 30 people, a top government official said Wednesday.
	   It was the latest deadly clash in the two-year tribal conflict
between the Bodo and Santhal tribespeople in the Kokrajhar district
of Assam.
	   The combatants also set nearly 800 houses on fire during the
battle Tuesday, said Pranab Bora, the Assam state chief secretary.
	   The military moved into 12 villages to control the rioting.
	   The conflict began in 1996 with the Bodos, who say they are the
original inhabitants of the area, objecting to their Santhal
neighbors. The Santhals say they have been living in the area for
150 years.
	   At least 1,000 people have died in clashes in the past two
years.
	   Tuesday's clashes followed the kidnapping and killing last week
of Satyaan Soren, a Santhal tribe leader, and his 3-year-old son,
allegedly by Bodo activists.
	   Assam state Chief Minister Prafulla Mahanta flew to the troubled
spot Wednesday morning. Officials in his office said nearly 2,000
people belonging to both tribes have fled their homes and taken
shelter in a hospital in the nearby town of Gossaigaon.
	   The worst rioting occurred in Balagaon village, where Bodos
wielding machetes killed 11 Santhals, police said.
	   The Bodos make up nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million
people. Santhals number 400,000 people.

Singapore stocks rocket higher in morning trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore stocks rocketed higher Wednesday
morning, with the benchmark index up 4 percent in the first hour
and a half of trading, as local banks lowered their lending rates.
	   At 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT), the Straits Times Index had surged
35.89 points, or 3.98 percent, to stand at 938.17.
	   A rally that began several weeks ago continued Wednesday when
Singapore's biggest financial institution, the Development Bank of
Singapore, dropped its prime lending rate _ the rate it charges its
best customers _ a quarter percentage point to 7.25 percent. That
follows a similar move by United Overseas Bank last week.
	   The cuts in the prime lending rate have been triggered by
falling interbank rates, with the benchmark three-month interbank
rate consistently below 5 percent since late August.
	   Wall Street's strong performance Tuesday also boosted the
Singapore bourse, according to dealers. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average advanced 1 percent, or 79.04, to end Tuesday at 8024.39
points.
	   Property stocks have led the Singapore index's rise. According
to market observers, the cut in the prime rate _ to which housing
loans are pegged _ is seen easing the burden on property owners,
boosting demand in the flagging residential market and helping
debt-laden property companies.
	   The Stock Exchange of Singapore Properties Index advanced 6.1
percent, or 15.12 points, to 263.09 at midmorning.

Suharto's son is banned from traveling overseas amid bank probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The billionaire second son of former
President Suharto has been banned from leaving Indonesia as
investigators prepare to question him over the collapse of a bank
partly owned by him, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Separately, Indonesia's attorney general said he and the
national police chief will be part of a three-member team that will
soon question Suharto about claims that he corruptly amassed a
fortune during his 32 years in power and stashed millions of
dollars abroad.
	   Indonesia's Justice Minister Muladi was quoted by local
newspapers as saying Bambang Trihatmodjo and other commissioners of
the failed Bank Andromeda had been prohibited from traveling
overseas while the investigation continues.
	   ``All have been barred, including Bambang Tri,'' Republika
quoted Muladi as saying.
	   Republika reported that Bambang and his associates had received
summonses from police and questioning would start on Wednesday.
	   The development follows news that President B.J. Habibie had
ordered that Suharto be questioned over allegations that he, his
family and associates illegally enriched themselves.
	   In a recent and rare television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied
allegations that he had squirreled money abroad during his time in
office.
	   The claim has been greeted with disbelief in the local media and
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The investigators are expected to meet the former leader within
the next ``one or two days,'' presidential adviser Arnold Baramuli
said Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib said he
would head the investigation team that would also include National
Police Chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi along with a senior government
finance official.
	   ``We will met the president very soon and will investigate
everything in connection with Suharto's assets and bank accounts,''
he said.
	   Soon after replacing Suharto in May, Habibie ordered an official
investigation into corruption under the previous regime.
	   But critics say Habibie, a longtime friend and subordinate of
Suharto, hasn't done enough to investigate his old mentor.
	   Suharto stepped down after a wave of riots and protests against
his authoritarian rule and economic hardship.
	   In a new wave of demonstrations over the past two weeks,
thousands of students have demanded the ex-president be put on
trial and that Habibie also resign.
	   Bank Andromeda was closed in November for allegedly violating
lending limits set by the central bank, Bank Indonesia.
	   It is one of 21 cases involving insolvent private banks that
police are investigating over possible violations of banking laws.
	   About 160 bankers are now under scrutiny.
	   Bambang has denied any wrongdoing.
	   ``I haven't amassed the fortune overseas. Most of the property
is here, and I'm not a thief,'' Republika quoted Bambang as saying.

General Motors to raise stake in Japan's Suzuki Motor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background; TRIMS

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ General Motors Corp. is strengthening its ties with
Suzuki Motor Corp., a move that will include tripling GM's stake in
Suzuki to about 10 percent from 3.3 percent.
	   The agreement, announced Wednesday, calls for the two automakers
to increase coordination of their global manufacturing operations.
	   It assigns Suzuki primary responsibility for the design and
development of small and ``mini'' passenger vehicles, particularly
in Asia. U.S.-based GM will be responsible for midsize and large
passenger vehicles.
	   The two companies also agreed to exchange information regarding
advanced technology in areas such as alternative fuels and
intelligent vehicles.
	   Suzuki is the largest producer of minicars in Japan and one of
the world's leading manufacturers of motorcycles.
	   Suzuki and GM operate a joint venture in Canada, which produces
small vehicles for North America. They have also agreed to jointly
develop compact cars for sale in Europe.
	   The move comes amid a string of mergers in the global auto
industry that has forced many smaller carmakers to consolidate.
	   In July, Daimler-Benz AG and Japan's Nissan Diesel Motor Co.
said they would jointly develop a light truck as the first step in
a broader tie-up.
	   Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. have said they will jointly
bid for the troubled South Korean automaker Kia Motors Corp.

Smooth Hackett leads 1,500 qualifying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World champion Grant Hackett
coasted to the head of a stellar 1,500-meter freestyle field
Wednesday for a final that could be the best in history.
	   Hackett will have to overcome the Kieren Perkins factor to win
Thursday's final, where six of the eight swimmers appear capable of
cracking 15 minutes.
	   The most under that barrier in one race has been three, and that
was more than seven years ago at the 1991 World Championships in
Perth.
	   Germany's Jorg Hoffmann set the then world record, edging
Perkins, while another German, Stefan Pfeiffer, also beat 15
minutes.
	   Perkins, who has won the past two Olympic titles and plans to
chase a third in Sydney in 2000, holds the world record with the
14:41.66 he recorded at the 1994 Commonwealth Games.
	   But Perkins' campaign has been set back by illness, both before
leaving home and on arrival in Kuala Lumpur. Perkins swam 15:34.75
in Wednesday's heats, qualifying sixth. He was unable to hide his
disappointment when asked if he still thought he could break 15
minutes.
	   ``Before this morning (coach) John Carew thought I could still
do it, but I'll have to speak to him about what he thinks after
that,'' Perkins said after his first international 1,500-meter swim
since the Atlanta Olympics.
	   ``That was a hard swim for me but then I always hurt in the
first race of the meet, so it's difficult for me to know if it's a
first-up swim or I truly am in trouble.''
	   Perkins' rivals have seen him play dead before. At the Atlanta
Olympics, he made the final by just .23 seconds and mauled fellow
Australian Daniel Kowalski from lane eight to win in 14:56.40.
Kowalski will also be in Thursday's field.
	   Hackett became the second fastest Australian when he won the
world title this year in 14:51.19.
	   The 1,500-meter event holds a special place for Australians, and
the final is expected to be the most watched 15 minutes of
television in the country this year.
	   That popularity has everything to do with Perkins, Australia's
most bankable athlete outside of golfer Greg Norman and U.S. Open
tennis champion Pat Rafter.
	   Hackett admitted he was once rattled by Perkins, but says he's
over it now. He also has been in good form, getting the 400-meter
silver medal behind Ian Thorpe on Tuesday.
	   ``When you get up on the blocks next to someone like Kieren
Perkins it's easy to get excited, there's such a buildup up about
it,'' Hackett said. ``Once I would have been nervous but now? Not
really. I've got used to racing him and when I get on the blocks
I've just got seven competitors.''
	   Olympic bronze medalist Graeme Smith of Scotland qualified
second fastest by setting the pace for Hackett in their heat
Tuesday.
	   ``I think I can definitely go under 15 minutes but my medal
chances depend on if the Aussies go under 15 minutes and if so how
far they go under,'' Smith said. ``If Grant's the only one who goes
under 15 then I'd be confident of winning a medal.''
	   England's Ian Wilson was third and he too is in striking
distance of 15 minutes with a best of 15:03.72. South Africa's Ryk
Neethling is the sixth swimmer who believes he is capable of
breaking the barrier.
	   Hackett has a barrier of his own to chase.
	   ``I think you'll need a 14:50 but my goal is to do a personal
best and get into the 14:40s. It would be great.''

North Korea warns Japan against reviving militarism after rocket
</HEADLINE>
launch
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with North's plans to develop a commercial satellite;
minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has warned Japan that any attempt to
use the North's recent rocket launch as a pretext to revive
militarism will have ``catastrophic'' consequences.
	   In a statement issued by its Foreign Ministry, North Korea
accused Japan of trying to use the rocket launch as an excuse to
build up its military and said Tokyo harbors a plan to ultimately
invade the North.
	   The statement, carried Tuesday by the North's official Korean
Central News Agency, also said Japan was using the launch to
deflect attention from its domestic economic crisis.
	   ``The Japanese authorities must ponder over what catastrophic
consequences will result,'' it said.
	   A North Korean radio broadcast of the statement, monitored
Wednesday by Tokyo-based Radiopress, said relations between the
countries have deteriorated to the point of placing them ``on the
verge of war.''
	   The reference to war, however, was not included in KCNA's text
of the statement.
	   The radio broadcast also indicated that the North intends to
develop a commercial satellite for sale abroad in order raise
foreign currency to help overcome its severe food shortages.
	   ``Starting with the food problem, we must solve our economic
problems alone ... by aggressively progressing in the global
advanced technology market which includes commercial satellite
launches,'' it said.
	   Many legislators in Japan are calling on the government to build
a multi-purpose spy satellite following the North's Aug. 31 launch
of a three-stage rocket that sailed over Japan.
	   The North's rocket launch was believed to have been a ballistic
missile test, but the United States announced Tuesday that experts
have determined it was probably a failed attempt to put a satellite
into orbit.
	   Asian countries are highly suspicious of any signs Japan may be
increasing its military capabilities because of its brutal conquest
of East Asia during World War II.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Rescuers flown in by helicopter
Wednesday reached a light plane that crashed three days ago north
of Mount Cook to find all three people aboard had been killed,
police said.
	   A local pilot and two Japanese women tourists apparently died
when their four-seater Cessna slammed into a rocky, snow-covered
slope at the side of the Rudolph Glacier, some 20 miles (30 km)
north of Mount Cook.
	   Alpine rescue team members spotted the tail of the plane
protruding from snow on the slope as they were airlifted in by
helicopter, homing in on the crashed plane's emergency locator
beacon.
	   Police Senior Constable Bill Apes said the rescuers saw the tail
of the wreckage at about 7,500 feet (2300m).
	   The Cessna 177 Cardinal, run by Tekapo-based Air Safaris, was
reported overdue on a scenic flight about midday Monday.
	   Pilot Bjorn Van Kessel, 28, of Tekapo, and two Japanese
tourists, Mariko Saijo, 59, of Naruto, and Yuriko Morikawa, 46, of
Tokushima, were on board.
	   Police had earlier said they did not expect the trio to have
survived the crash, and it would have been impossible for the
fixed-wing aircraft to safely land on the rocky, icy terrain.
	   Low clouds and wind gusts had hampered search and rescue efforts
for two days before the weather lifted mid-morning Wednesday.

Three sentenced to death in China for drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in southern Guangdong province have
sentenced three men to death for smuggling more than 4 tons of
marijuana from Cambodia into China, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said Wednesday.
	   The three men, who were not named, were among nine people who
were caught May 2 by marine police in Shanwei, Guangdong, when they
tried to deliver the marijuana by boat, the report said.
	   In an effort to combat drug trafficking, Chinese courts are
imposing harsh sentences for drug-related crimes.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A passenger train collided at a railway crossing
with a bus carrying a bride's family and friends to her wedding,
killing 27 people and injuring one, a newspaper said in a report
seen Wednesday in Beijing.
	   The impact of the collision, which occurred Sunday morning in
northern China's Shanxi province, pushed the bus more than 200
meters (660 feet) off the road, the Yangcheng Evening News reported
Tuesday.
	   The report said the bus was carrying about 70 people. It
provided no other details about the victims of the crash, which
occurred at one of China's many unguarded railway crossings.

Australians miss their buses after drug tests, mascots gear up for

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ At least one person can't wait for
the Commonwealth Games to end.
	   Malaysian businessman Tan Chean Chye bought a condominium in the
complex where some 6,000 athletes and officials are staying, and is
eager to move in once they leave.
	   There are 1,567 apartments at the Vista Komanwel complex on the
outskirts of the Malaysian capital, most of which were sold off
ahead of the two-week games, which end next Monday.
	   Tan, 57, plans to retire once he moves into what has been dubbed
the athletes' ``village'' and thinks he might benefit from the
temporary tenants in his apartment.
	   ``I'm very happy that someone else is testing out my house,'' he
told The Star newspaper of Kuala Lumpur. ``If there are any defects
and problems, the athletes would have complained and got them
fixed.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HAPLESS HOCKEY: The coach for a Malaysian team was not amused.
	   The men's field hockey team from the host nation turned in a
shaky performance in a 2-2 draw Tuesday with England. The Malaysian
players seemed nervous and didn't capitalize on their chances.
	   ``The team is capable of so much more. They played chicken
hockey in the first half,'' fumed German coach Paul Lisseka fter
the Group B game. ``I have lost my voice today, shouting at them to
play better.''
	   ``This is the worst moment I have had working with a team,''
Lissek told local newspapers. ``They played well below their
potential and it is not good.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEED A LIFT?: Drug tests are posing new hazards for some
athletes at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Australian competitors have been left stranded at venues at
night after random drug tests caused them to miss their shuttle
buses home, team officials said Wednesday.
	   The major night events so far have been swimming, hockey,
weightlifting and gymnastics.
	   ``We've got stranded a couple of times,'' said Don Stockins, an
Australian team director. ``But that's just a minor thing and the
venue managers will be reminded of the responsibility to get the
people concerned back to base.''
	   Team doctor Brian Sando said three swimmers were being tested
after each final _ the winner, one of the other medal winners and
one of the remaining five competitors. Australia has dominated the
pool at this year's games.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MASCOT MEET: Step aside, international track stars. Make way for
some fresh running talent.
	   Officials from three teams will dress up in their mascot
costumes and race 100 meters Saturday in the National Stadium,
which seats 100,000.
	   There's a Malaysian orangutan called Wira, a Canadian goose
named Canoose and Scotland's Super Squirrel.
	   ``We haven't really settled on a prize,'' said Jacinta
Vythilingam, a games spokeswoman. ``We'll figure that one out at
the end of the race.''
	   More conventional track events feature world-class stars Obadele
Thompson of Barbados, Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago and Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia.

Taiwan to make customers of prostitutes attend AIDS lectures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Men caught visiting prostitutes will be
forced to attend lectures on avoiding AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases, according to rules announced Wednesday by
Taiwan's Health Department.
	   Police will report patrons to local health authorities, who will
call the men in for the lectures, the department said.
	   The new policy aims to increase awareness of AIDS and instill a
greater sense of responsibility for their actions among those who
visit prostitutes, it said.
	   Taiwan has a highly developed sex industry, most of it
underground, unregulated and illegal since the closure of licensed
brothels in Taipei last year.
	   Prostitution thrives on social customs that require many men to
stay out late entertaining friends and business associates at clubs
where they are attended by female hostesses.
	   About 2,000 people in Taiwan have tested positive for HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, the department said. Most were men who
contracted the disease through unprotected sex with prostitutes, it
said.

Construction accident in Shanghai kills 6
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Six construction workers were killed and six
colleagues injured when a concrete block fell from a building site
in Shanghai, Chinese media and an official said Wednesday.
	   The workers at the high-rise building site in Shanghai's busy
city center died immediately Tuesday night from the impact of the
falling concrete, local Shanghai television reported.
	   An official with the Shanghai labor bureau said the cause of the
accident was under investigation.
	   China's breakneck pace of development and lax government
regulation has created an accident-prone building industry.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon of Trinidad qualified
fastest for the 100 meters and England and Canada excelled in the
pool as the Commonwealth Games finally opened up Wednesday after
four days of Aussie domination.
	   The fastest in the world this year with two 9.86 runs, Boldon,
who has said that Donovan Bailey's world record 9.84 could go here,
wasn't helped by being drawn in a rain-soaked lane one in the first
100m heat on track's opening day.
	   But he powered away from the other seven runners to clock 10.17,
more than half a second and six meters ahead of second place Elliot
Bunney of Scotland.
	   Frankie Fredericks, his biggest rival here, was second fastest
with a heat-winning time of 10.19 while Obadele Thompson of
Barbados, who clocked 9.87 at altitude in Johannesburg on Friday,
slowed to a modest 10.30 to cruise into the second round later
Wednesday.
	   ``Maybe 9.9 in the next round,'' Boldon said after his win. ``I
want to go faster but let's wait until the final.
	   ``That's unless they put me and Frankie and Obadele in the
semifinal,'' he said. ``Then, who knows?''
	   The semifinals and final are Thursday.
	   On the next to last day of swimming and with 17 golds from 20
finals, the Australians surprisingly finished behind English and
Canadian swimmers in Wednesday's heats.
	   England's James Hickman led qualifying for the 200-meter
butterfly and team-mate Mark Foster broke a games record with 22.68
seconds in the 50-meter freestyle. Canadians Marianne Limpert and
Joanne Malar qualified first and second for the 200 medley while
countryman Mark Versfeld, the 200-meter backstroke titlist, led the
field going into the 100 final.
	   ``There seems to be a whole host of people who can do well
tonight,'' said Hickman, who has a silver medal from the 400-meter
medley after being disqualified in the 100-meter butterfly.
	   ``I was really pleased with the way I could lift myself up
immediately and go in for the medley,'' said the Englishman. ``I'm
confident today. This (the 200) has been my main event for a long
time now.''
	   England also collected the first gold of the day in the men's
air pistol pairs with Michael Gault, who is defending titlist in
the individual free pistol event, and Nick Baxter.
	   India's Jaspal Rana, who won two golds, a silver and bronze at
the last Games in Victoria, British Columbia four years ago, teamed
up with Satendra Kumar to win the silver and the bronze went to
Canada's John Rochon and Jean-Pierre Huot.
	   In the first cricket semifinal, South Africa bowled Sri Lanka
out for 130 in 44 overs and looked in good shape to reach
Saturday's final. Australia and New Zealand meet in the other
semifinal Thursday.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire, pinch-hitting in the ninth
inning, hit his 63rd home run in the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-6 loss
to Pittsburgh on Tuesday night in a doubleheader opener.
	   McGwire moved ahead of the Cubs' Sammy Sosa in the home-run
race, ending a six-game homer drought with a solo shot off reliever
Jason Christiansen. McGwire had been 3-for-18, all singles, since
breaking Roger Maris' record.
	   He was 1-for-3 with an RBI double and a bases-loaded walk in the
Cardinals' 9-3 victory in the second game. He walked twice,
extending his NL record to 154.
	   Kevin Young's three-run homer off Donovan Osborne (4-4) snapped
a fifth-inning tie in the opener, which included two homers by
Cardinals rookie J.D. Drew. Sean Lawrence (2-1) won and Rich
Loiselle got his 19th save.
	   Manny Aybar (5-6) won the second game and Juan Acevedo got his
10th save. Jose Silva (6-5) was the loser.
 &UR; Cubs 4, Padres 2
	   In San Diego, Sammy Sosa went homerless for the second straight
game, and Mark Grace's two-run homer led Chicago, which took a
half-game lead over New York in the NL wild-card race. Sosa was
1-for-5 with two strikeouts.
	   Kevin Tapani (19-7), who won his seventh straight decision,
allowed six hits in 8 1-3 innings, and Rod Beck finished for his
47th save in 53 chances.
	   Lance Johnson went 4-for-5 for the Cubs, who overcame a 1-0
deficit in the seventh by scoring four runs off Kevin Brown
(18-7).
 &UR; Astros 6, Mets 5
 &UR; Mets 8, Astros 4
	   In Houston, John Olerud hit a three-run homer that erased a 3-2
deficit in the eighth inning as New York gained the split. In the
opener, Carlos Baerga hit a two-run homer in the ninth but Houston
won on Derek Bell's homer in the 12th off Jeff Tam (1-1).
	   Al Leiter (16-5) won the second game and Jay Powell (7-6), who
won the opener, was the loser. Craig Biggio singled in the last
inning of the doubleheader, becoming the first Houston player to
reach 200 hits.
 &UR; Braves 3, Phillies 0
	   In Atlanta, Kevin Millwood (16-8) allowed eight hits in seven
shutout innings and struck out eight. Norm Charlton pitched the
ninth for his first save this the season.
	   Tyler Green (6-11), facing a Braves lineup that included only
two everyday players in Ryan Klesko and Javy Lopez, allowed all
three runs in the third inning.
 &UR; Reds 5, Brewers 1
	   In Cincinnati, Barry Larkin and Bret Boone homered and Mike
Remlinger (8-15) allowed one run and four hits in six innings.
	   Scott Karl (9-10) winless in seven starts, gave up five runs and
13 hits in six-plus innings. Danny Graves pitched three scoreless
innings for his sixth save.
 &UR; Marlins 7, Expos 4
	   In Montreal, Randy Knorr hit a two-run triple and Mark Kotsay
went 4-for-5 with two RBIs to lead Florida to only its third win in
19 games.
	   Rafael Medina (2-4) snapped a three-game losing streak, allowing
three runs _ two earned _ seven hits and six walks in 5 1-3
innings.
	   Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero hit his 38th homer to extend his
team record.
	   Mike Thurman (3-5) allowed five runs _ four earned _ and seven
hits in five innings.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Dodgers 4
	   In Los Angeles, Darryl Kile (12-16) overcame a shaky start and
also singled to break a 3-all tie in the sixth. He allowed three
runs and 10 hits in seven innings, and Jerry Dipoto pitched the
ninth for his 19th save.
	   Chan Ho Park (13-9) pitched a seven-hitter for his second
complete game of the year. He struck out eight and walked four.

Guided tours to climb the Sydney Harbor Bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Tourists will soon be able to follow in
the footsteps of movie star Paul Hogan and high school pranksters
by climbing the landmark Sydney Harbor Bridge.
	   Guided tours of the bridge will rival New York's Statue of
Liberty and Paris' Eiffel Tower as an attraction to tourists with a
penchant for heights, predicted Carl Scully, the New South Wales
state minister who launched the scheme Wednesday.
	   He said 300,000 tourists a year are expected to pay almost
Australian dollars 100 ( U.S. dlrs 59) to climb the postcard icon,
known fondly as ``The Coathanger'' by locals.
	   The tours, called BridgeClimb, will be run by a private company
on a 20-year lease and the operators must ensure strict safety
standards to ensure no-one falls from the arch onto the road, 134
meters (yards) below at its highest point.
	   Climbers will be alcohol breath-tested, scanned for loose
objects and attached to the bridge by a static line.
	   The bridge was completed in 1932, with maintenance workers and
officially sanctioned guests the only people allowed to climb the
arch.
	   One maintenance worker was comedian Paul Hogan, who painted the
bridge as a rigger before he starred in the hit ``Crocodile
Dundee'' movie series and pursued a Hollywood career.
	   Climbing the bridge is also a common dare for university
students when they finish exams.

Pacific Island tourism recovers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A surge in visitors from the United States has
helped turn around a slump in Pacific Island tourism, which has
returned to growth after a huge downturn blamed on the Asian
financial crisis, statistics released Wednesday show.
	   Figures for 12 Pacific Island countries issued by the Tourism
Council of the South Pacific show the number of tourists during the
three months to the end of June came to 231,739, a seven percent
increase over the same period last year.
	   By contrast, figures for the first three months of 1998 showed
tourist numbers had plummeted by 20.5 percent compared to the same
period a year earlier.
	   The total number of tourists to the region in the first six
months of 1998 was about 434,000, a 2.5 percent increase over the
same period in 1997.
	   The figures do not take into account seasonal factors or tour,
accommodation and airfare prices.
	   Tourism growth was recorded in Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati,
Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Samoa. Falls were recorded for the
Cook Islands, New Caledonia, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Niue.
	   The Pacific Islands do not depend on Asian visitors as much some
other regional destinations, such as Australia, which relies
heavily on Japan and South Korea for tourists.
	   The Pacific figures show Fiji lost a small number of South
Korean visitors and French Polynesia and New Caledonia lost some
Japanese business.
	   But those losses were offset by increased numbers of
longer-staying American and European tourists and extra business
from Australians diverting from Asian destinations.
	   In the six months to the end of June, tourist traffic to the
Pacific from the United States increased by almost 13 percent, from
Britain more than 14 percent and from Australia more than 12
percent.
	   Traffic from Canada was down 7 percent, from Germany by more
than 15 percent, Japan 11 percent and other Asian countries by a
combined 30 percent.
	   Australians make up the greatest number of visitors, with almost
100,000 traveling to the Pacific Islands in the six months to June
30. Americans followed, with almost 60,000 visiting the region.

Foreign minister fears One Nation could win 20 percent of vote
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist
One Nation party could win up to 20 percent of the nationwide vote
in the Oct. 3 election, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Wednesday.
	   At the midway point of a lackluster campaign dominated by the
relatively sterile issues of economic management, tax reform and
tax rebates, Hanson's far-right views have provided much of the
fireworks in the race.
	   The independent member of Parliament for Queensland's party,
formed less than two years ago, opposes Asian immigration and
welfare for Aborigines, has lashed out at single mothers and seeks
to repeal Australia's stringent new gun control laws.
	   Hanson has also accused Aborigines of conspiring with the United
Nations to try to set up separate Aboriginal states within
Australia.
	   Her party, One Nation, has no chance of defeating either Prime
Minister John Howard's governing conservatives or their main rival,
the Labor Party led by Kim Beazley.
	   But if One Nation wins more than 14 percent of the vote in any
state, it could win Senate seats and hold the balance of power in
the Senate, where Howard's government is in the minority and relies
on two independent senators to pass legislation.
	   ``That kind of loony movement could get up to 20 percent
support'' across the country, Downer told reporters after
addressing the Foreign Correspondents Association in Sydney.
	   He noted that in conservative Queensland, One Nation won 23
percent of the vote and 11 of 89 seats in Queensland's Parliament
in a June state election.
	   Most support for One Nation came at the expense of Howard's
coalition, particularly the junior coalition partner, the
rural-based National Party.
	   But support for One Nation has fallen in recent national opinion
polls, more than halving from the mid-teens six months ago to
around 6 or 7 percent this week.
	   Labor and Howard's conservatives are running a close race and
various polls this week contradicted each other on who was ahead.
	   But Labor needs to win an additional 27 seats to win government,
a feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Rescuers flown in by helicopter
Wednesday reached a light tourist plane that crashed three days ago
north of Mount Cook to find all three people aboard had been
killed, police said.
	   A local pilot and two Japanese women apparently died when their
four-seater Cessna slammed into a rocky, snow-covered slope at the
side of the Rudolph Glacier, some 20 miles (30 km) north of Mount
Cook.
	   Alpine rescue team members spotted the tail of the plane
protruding from snow on the slope as they were airlifted in by
helicopter, homing in on the crashed plane's emergency locator
beacon.
	   The area where the plane crashed is 280 miles (450 kms)
southwest of Wellington.
	   Police Senior Constable Bill Apes said the rescuers saw the tail
of the wreckage at about 7,500 feet (2,300 meters).
	   The Cessna 177 Cardinal, run by Tekapo-based Air Safaris, was
reported overdue on a scenic flight about midday Monday.
	   Pilot Bjorn Van Kessel, 28, of Tekapo, and two Japanese
tourists, Mariko Saijo, 59, of Naruto, and Yuriko Morikawa, 46, of
Tokushima, were on board.
	   Police had earlier said they did not expect the trio to have
survived the crash, and it would have been impossible for the
fixed-wing aircraft to safely land on the rocky, icy terrain.
	   Low clouds and wind gusts had hampered search and rescue efforts
for two days before the weather lifted at mid-morning Wednesday.

Pacific Island tourism recovers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A surge in visitors from the United States has
helped turn around a slump in Pacific Island tourism, which has
returned to growth after a huge downturn blamed on the Asian
financial crisis, statistics released Wednesday show.
	   Figures for 12 Pacific Island countries issued by the Tourism
Council of the South Pacific show the number of tourists during the
three months to the end of June came to 231,739, a 7 percent
increase over the same period last year.
	   By contrast, figures for the first three months of 1998 showed
tourist numbers had plummeted by 20.5 percent compared to the same
period a year earlier.
	   The total number of tourists to the region in the first six
months of 1998 was about 434,000, a 2.5 percent increase over the
same period in 1997.
	   The figures do not take into account seasonal factors or tour,
accommodation and airfare prices.
	   Tourism growth was recorded in Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati,
Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Samoa. Falls were recorded for the
Cook Islands, New Caledonia, Tonga, the Solomon Islands and Niue.
	   The Pacific Islands do not depend on Asian visitors as much some
other regional destinations, such as Australia, which relies
heavily on Japan and South Korea for tourists.
	   The Pacific figures show Fiji lost a small number of South
Korean visitors and French Polynesia and New Caledonia lost some
Japanese business.
	   But those losses were offset by increased numbers of
longer-staying American and European tourists and extra business
from Australians diverting from Asian destinations.
	   In the six months to the end of June, tourist traffic to the
Pacific from the United States increased by almost 13 percent, from
Britain more than 14 percent and from Australia more than 12
percent.
	   Traffic from Canada was down 7 percent, from Germany by more
than 15 percent, Japan 11 percent and other Asian countries by a
combined 30 percent.
	   Australians make up the greatest number of visitors, with almost
100,000 traveling to the Pacific Islands in the six months to June
30. Americans followed, with almost 60,000 visiting the region.

Central bank says Philippines not considering currency controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Amid speculation that Indonesia may
impose some form of restrictions on the convertibility of its
currency, Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
reiterated Wednesday that no capital controls on the peso are being
considered.
	   Both the Central Bank and the Philippine government have
repeatedly stressed since Malaysia imposed curbs on the
convertibility of its currency that capital controls will not be
re-imposed in the Philippines as a means of quelling foreign
exchange volatility.
	   Singson said he understood that the Indonesian government has no
intention of following Malaysia's move.
	   On Tuesday, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie denied speculation
that he is considering currency controls and said he will continue
to let the battered rupiah float against a basket of currencies.
However, the speculation continued Wednesday on currency markets.
	   The Philippines abandoned capital controls in 1992 after nearly
four decades of exchange-rate restrictions.
	   Singson has said that capital controls are difficult to
administer and also encourage corruption and black markets.
	   Earlier this month, President Joseph Estrada also stated his
opposition to capital controls.

Cambodia opposition leader meets king for crisis talks

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh began consultations Wednesday with Cambodia's king over
the country's political crisis, which spawned a week of violent
police crackdowns on demonstrators in the streets of the capital.
	   Anti-government protesters stayed off Phnom Penh's streets as
the prince met Wednesday morning with his father, King Norodom
Sihanouk, in the northwestern province of Siem Reap. It was their
first face-to-face talk since before July's elections.
	   Thousands of people had been marching daily in support of the
opposition's contention that strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party used fraud in winning parliamentary elections held on July
26.
	   The opposition protesters, generally nonviolent, braved bullets
and beatings by baton-wielding riot police. Several fought back
with slingshots and stones.
	   At least four people were killed and more than 20 arrested in
the crackdown.
	   In recent days human rights workers have found the dumped bodies
of several persons who apparently died violently, raising the
question of whether the deaths of more people may have been covered
up.
	   Ranariddh said he wants to find a way to bring an end to the
bloodshed through dialogue, though he was previously unwilling to
talk until official election bodies gave serious consideration to
the opposition's election complaints.
	   Hun Sen-appointed election bodies dismissed more than 800
election complaints submitted by the opposition, which is now
asking for just two major issues to be considered.
	   On Monday, the ruling party and its two main opposition rivals
reached a tentative three-point tension-easing agreement.
	   It called for the cessation of demonstrations, a summit meeting
of party leaders hosted by King Sihanouk, and the convening of the
National Assembly as scheduled on Sept. 24. No date was set for the
summit meeting.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of assembly seats in the July
polls, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a new government on
its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which won the remainder of the seats _ had said they
would boycott the assembly if their complaints about election fraud
were not investigated.
	   The king's meeting with Ranariddh on Wednesday, to be followed
Thursday by separate talks with the prince's opposition ally Sam
Rainsy, are aimed at paving the way for the summit talks.
	   ``First of all we have to listen to His Majesty the King before
making any decision,'' said the prince early Wednesday. ``I will
inform him about the peaceful demonstrations that turned violent in
the brutal crackdown.''

Prime minister says lax laws, not international treaties, promote
</HEADLINE>
crime &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Increased crime is due to lax state
laws, not any Australian obligations under international treaties,
Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday.
	   Howard rejected suggestions Australians were banned from
tackling crime and discipline because of treaties such as the
U.N.'s International Covenant on the Rights of the Child.
	   Howard's conservative government has been challenged from the
right by Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, which wants to repeal
gun control laws and opposes Australian agreement to U.N. covenants
and most international treaties.
	   He said his government, campaigning for re-election at the Oct.
3 national election, had done much to make Australia safer,
especially with tighter uniform gun laws introduced in late 1996.
	   Howard announced a 50 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30
million) fund to set up a new national computer system to help
track down criminals who crossed state borders.
	   The database will hold fingerprint and DNA details of criminals,
and include a list of known pedophiles.
	   ``The success of this system in Britain has been quite
startling,'' Howard told a Perth radio station.
	   He said Australians were entitled to express concerns about the
number of burglaries and assaults in the community.
	   But it was state governments that passed soft laws which were
doing the most damage.
	   ``At its core, the bad decisions of governments on law and order
have been made by state governments,'' he said.

Greenpeace: Japanese ships flying foreign flags to bypass tuna
</HEADLINE>
treaty

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Japanese fishermen are registering
their ships in foreign countries to circumvent an international
treaty and fish for an endangered species of tuna, the
environmental group Greenpeace said Wednesday.
	   Greenpeace called on the Australian government to bring Japan
before the International Court of Justice for alleged breaches of
the Convention on the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
	   ``Japan has been devious and underhanded by disguising its own
fishing vessels by registering them in other countries,'' said
Greenpeace spokesman Darren Gladman.
	   He did not specify which countries were being used by Japanese
fishermen. But he said the extra fishing was wiping out already
depleted stocks.
	   ``While politicians waste time, this fish is being driven to
extinction,'' Gladman said.
	   Morio Kaneko, an official at the Fisheries Agency in Tokyo, said
Japan cautioned the Australian government earlier this year that a
Japanese fishing boat had registered in Honduras and that it was
trying to register in Australia.
	   But the Australian government later approved the registration of
the boat, the Koala No. 1.
	   ``There are no other similar cases reported at present,'' Kaneko
said.
	   Australia, New Zealand and Japan are parties to the convention,
which provides that fishing only be conducted with the consent of
all parties.
	   Japan has already exceeded its catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna
under the convention, saying the additional catch was experimental
and would help assess tuna stocks.
	   The Australian government earlier this month sent Japan a
diplomatic note to say that it believed its experimental fishing
program was in violation of international law.
	   Greenpeace said the World Conservation Union has declared the
Southern Bluefin Tuna a critically endangered species and
Australian scientists predict that at current fishing rates, there
is a greater than 60 percent likelihood that the adult population
will be reduced to zero by 2020.
	   ``Fish stocks are being poached from right under our nose. Japan
continues to break the law and Australia must take decisive
action,'' Gladman said.

Report: Singapore to build its own version of Silicon Valley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore is planning to develop a science park
costing up to dlrs 2.9 billion that will feature high-tech
industries, advanced educational institutions, and research and
development facilities, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Located on the island republic's western coast, Singapore's
version of Silicon Valley will occupy 810 hectares (2,000 acres),
provide an internal transportation network, and be the work place
of about 200,000 people, according to The Straits Times.
	   ``An entrepreneurial high-technology business environment will
add a new dimension to the next phase of our economic
development,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said in announcing
the plan Tuesday.
	   The relatively high cost of wages and other business costs in
Singapore have had the government scrambling to promote high-end
industries, services and infrastructure in the tiny city-state.
	   It hopes to keep ahead of its competitors, which provide
increasingly cheaper low-end manufacturing and basic services.
	   ``The present economic crisis makes it all the more urgent for
us ... to develop new economic activities and new markets which can
supplement Singapore's present role as a manufacturing base for
multinational corporations and as a services hub for the region,''
the paper quoted Tan as saying.
	   The proposed Science Hub is already home to two high-tech
businesses zones, a government research center, two major higher
education facilities, the Ministry of Education, and several
residential communities.
	   The long-term project will take 15 years or more to fully
develop, according to the report.
	   ``This will be a vibrant area where ideas and innovations can
take place,'' National Science and Technology Board chairman Teo
Ming Kian was quoted as saying. ``Not only researchers, but
businessmen, lawyers and venture capitalists will be involved.''
	   The report added that several world-class educational
institutions, including Maryland-based Johns Hopkins University,
plan to set up campuses in the hub.

	   In Phoenix, Travis Lee singled home the winning run in the 11th
inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks overcame a six-run deficit to
drop San Francisco 4 1/2 games back in the NL wild-card race.
	   With the score 6-all in the 11th, Andy Fox stretched a hit to
right field into a leadoff double and took third when Jay Bell
sacrificed against Jose Mesa (5-3). After Matt Williams struck out,
Lee lined the ball through the infield.
	   Gregg Olson (2-3) picked up the win with a one-inning stint in
which he allowed a double to Jeff Kent, the Giants' only hit after
their six-run fourth inning.

Memoir by Singapore founder infuriates Malaysians

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-9 with fresh Wednesday quotes, INSERTS
Lee's current position in 5th graf, TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian politicians have accused
Singapore's senior statesman of writing a book that promotes racism
and poisons relations between the two neighbors _ criticism the
author rejects.
	   Lee Kuan Yew's memoir, which went on sale in Singapore on
Wednesday, describes how Singapore and Malaysia merged in 1963
after independence from Britain, but split two years later after
bitter feuding.
	   Singapore, a small island state off Malaysia's southern tip, is
predominantly ethnic Chinese, while Malays make up the majority in
Malaysia.
	   The book comes as tension is rising again between the nations
over disputes involving the location of a railroad border post,
competition over ports and Singapore's purchase of Malaysian water,
among other issues.
	   In ``The Singapore Story,'' Lee, who served as prime minister
from 1959 until 1990 before taking the position of senior minister,
depicts Malaysian leaders in the 1960s as corrupt and morally lax.
	   Lee, 75, accuses Malaysia's late prime minister Tunku Abdul
Rahman of entertaining at a men's club frequented by call girls. He
also claims that after separation, the Tunku threatened to bully
Singapore through control of its water. Singapore relies on its
neighbor for much of its water.
	   Such accusations provoked harsh criticism from several Malaysian
leaders, including Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar who accused
Lee of ``manipulating facts.'' Excerpts of Lee's book were
published Sunday in a Singapore newspaper.
	   ``Racial sentiments were fanned as if he was the one who
determined our history,'' Syed said. He referred Wednesday to Lee's
collaboration with communists to gain power in Singapore in the
1950s and said Lee's speeches at the time ``have all the racial
overtones you can ask for.''
	   Transport Minister Mohd Ali Rustam said Lee made negative
references to Malaysia ``to maintain power and popularity in
Singapore, which includes his son.'' One of Lee's sons, who is
Singapore's deputy prime minister and head of the de facto central
bank, is often mentioned as a future prime minister.
	   The youth wing of Malaysia's dominant party, the United Malay
National Organization, said in a statement Tuesday that Lee's book
was an attempt to poison relations between the two countries.
	   Lee told journalists in Singapore Tuesday that he did not mean
to upset Malaysia, but he stood by his accounts.
	   ``It will be unfortunate if the book sours our relations,'' Lee
said. ``But I have an obligation to my people ... to give an
objective account of why and how Singapore sought merger with
Malaysia but in two years was asked to leave Malaysia.''
	   Lee, who in the past had repeatedly said his biggest political
regret is the failure of the merger with Malaysia, now said the
breakup was better for Singapore's prosperity.

Foreign minister fears One Nation could win 20 percent of vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SYD101
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Pauline Hanson's right-wing populist
One Nation party could win up to 20 percent of the nationwide vote
in the Oct. 3 election, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Wednesday.
	   At the midway point of a lackluster campaign dominated by the
relatively sterile issues of economic management, tax reform and
tax rebates, Hanson's far-right views have provided much of the
fireworks in the race.
	   The independent member of Parliament for Queensland's party,
formed less than two years ago, opposes Asian immigration and
welfare for Aborigines, has lashed out at single mothers and seeks
to repeal Australia's stringent new gun control laws.
	   Hanson has also accused Aborigines of conspiring with the United
Nations to try to set up separate Aboriginal states within
Australia.
	   Her party, One Nation, has no chance of defeating either Prime
Minister John Howard's governing conservatives or their main rival,
the Labor Party led by Kim Beazley.
	   But if One Nation wins more than 14 percent of the vote in any
state, it could win Senate seats and hold the balance of power in
that chamber, where Howard's government is in the minority and
relies on two independent senators to pass legislation.
	   ``That kind of loony movement could get up to 20 percent
support'' across the country, Downer told reporters after
addressing the Foreign Correspondents Association in Sydney.
	   He noted that in conservative Queensland, One Nation won 23
percent of the vote and 11 of 89 seats in Queensland's Parliament
in a June state election.
	   Most support for One Nation came at the expense of Howard's
coalition, particularly the junior coalition partner, the
rural-based National Party.
	   But support for One Nation has fallen in recent national opinion
polls, more than halving from the mid-teens six months ago to
around 6 or 7 percent this week.
	   Labor and Howard's conservatives are running a close race and
various polls this week contradicted each other on who was ahead.
	   But Labor needs to win an additional 27 seats to win government,
a feat no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

South African spinners rip Lankan batting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South African spinners Nicky Boje
and Derek Crookes devastated Sri Lanka's middle order Wednesday to
take command of their Commonwealth Games semifinal.
	   Despite a valiant 53 by opener Avishka Gunawardana, who boosted
the score to 99 before being caught behind by Mark Boucher off
Crookes, Sri Lanka slumped to 130 all out with six overs to spare.
	   The second finalist will be decided in Thursday's match between
Australia and New Zealand.
	   Aided by a turning pitch and 95 percent humidity, Boje took the
key wickets of skipper Hashan Tillekarantne (20) and struck three
times in quick succession to dismiss Indika de Saram, Upul Chandana
and Malinda Warnapura.
	   He conceded just 16 runs in nine overs.
	   Off-spinner Crookes took two wickets for 17 runs in his allotted
10 overs.
	   Gunawardana, who starred against Jamaica with a century at the
same PKNS stadium, scored his 53 in 111 minutes off 86 balls.
	   Specialist batsman Lanka de Silva was run out for seven, Russel
Arnold was bowled by Pollock for four and M. Jayawardene was also
caught by Pollock off Jacques Kallis for duck.
	   But still Sri Lanka was cruising along at four runs an over.
	   The run rate dropped and batting caved in after Tillekaratne's
bails flipped in the 32nd over while he was attempting to hit Boje.
He scored 20 runs in 45 balls.
	   After that, none of the Lankans, sent in to bat after Pollock
won toss, could settle down to the spin attack from both ends.

 &UR; Indonesian attorney general to head team to question Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general plans to
question ex-President Suharto over claims that the former leader's
family made used corruption to make a fortune during his 32 years
in power.
	   Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib told reporters Wednesday
he would head a three-member team to meet Suharto soon.
	   He gave no date or venue for the questioning, which is also to
cover allegations that Suharto stashed millions of dollars overseas
before he quit office five months ago.
	   ``We will meet the (former) president very soon and will
investigate everything in connection with Suharto's assets and bank
accounts,'' he said.
	   He said the team would also include National Police Chief Lt.
Gen. Rusmanhadi along with a senior government finance official
Soedarjanto.
	   In a recent and rare television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied
allegations that he had squirreled millions of dollars overseas
during his three decades in office while his six children built
huge business empires under his unchallenged patronage.
	   The claim has been greeted with disbelief in the local media and
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Soon after replacing Suharto in May, President B.J. Habibie
ordered an official investigation into corruption under the
previous regime.
	   But critics have said Habibie, a longtime friend and subordinate
of Suharto, hadn't done enough to hold his old mentor accountable
for corruption that contributed to Indonesia's financial mess.
	   Suharto quit the presidency in May after a wave of riots and
protests against his authoritarian rule and economic hardship
resulted in 1,200 deaths and thousands of buildings damaged and
burned.
	   In a new wave of demonstrations over the past two weeks,
thousands of students have demanded the ex-president be put on
trial and that Habibie also resign.
	   On Tuesday a close adviser to Habibie, Arnold Baramuli said the
investigators would meet Suharto within the next ``one or two
days.''
	   In another development Justice Minister Muladi has said Bambang
Trihatmodjo, the billionaire second son of Suharto, had been banned
from leaving the country as police prepare to question him and
others over the collapse of a bank party owned by him.
	   Police are currently investigating possible banking law
violations by 21 banks that have failed during the current economic
turmoil.
	   Bambang has denied any wrongdoing.

Muslim militants kill 5 in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels stormed the house
Wednesday of a former militant and shot and killed five of his male
relatives, Indian police said. The attackers wounded two other men.
	   Mohammed Yusuf Gadru, the main target, was not at home at the
time of the attack on his home in Srinagar, the capital of the
state of Jammu-Kashmir.
	   The unidentified assailants spared Gadru's female relatives and
the children in the house, which is located in a neighborhood
heavily guarded by the Indian military and paramilitary forces.
	   The men were shot at close range. Five of them died on the spot
and two were seriously wounded and hospitalized, police
investigators said.
	   Gadru is a member of the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon, a militant outfit
that surrendered to the security forces and was later armed by the
government to fight the rebels.
	   Dozens of Muslim guerrilla groups have been fighting a
separatist war in the Himalayan state since 1989 calling for either
independence or a merger with India's Islamic neighbor, Pakistan.
	   Kashmir, which provoked two of the three wars between India and
Pakistan, is presently divided between the two countries, with New
Delhi controlling two-thirds of the territory.

De La Hoya sees a fading opponent in Chavez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez knows only one way to
approach his rematch with Oscar De La Hoya.
	   It might be the only chance he has.
	   ``This time you're going to see the warrior Chavez,'' he vowed.
``I'm going to break up Oscar with punches this time.''
	   Two years after he was bloodied and beaten by De La Hoya, Chavez
gets another shot at the welterweight champion Friday night in
what, at age 36, is likely his last major fight.
	   He hasn't exactly done much to earn a rematch, except to
irritate De La Hoya to the point where he wants to fight him again.
But Chavez is still confident despite the beating and the ravages
of more than 100 ring wars in his 18-year pro career.
	   ``I don't care what's being said about me,'' Chavez said at
Tuesday's final pre-fight news conference. ``This fight will be
entirely different.''
	   Chavez and De La Hoya will both be fighting for some respect
when they meet in the scheduled 12-round bout for De La Hoya's WBC
welterweight title.
	   For Chavez, it's respect from boxing fans who believe he is over
the hill and shouldn't even be in the ring. For De La Hoya, it's
respect he believes he didn't get from Chavez for his win the first
time.
	   ``If it was up to me, this one wouldn't even be in the record
books,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm fighting for the respect he didn't
show me the first time. That's how personal this one is.''
	   Simply put, he wants Chavez to tell him that he is indeed the
better fighter, something he didn't do after the first fight.
	   ``A fighter like him will never admit he lost,'' De La Hoya
said. ``The only way for me to get him to admit defeat is a
devastating knockout.''
	   In their first fight, De La Hoya sliced open Chavez's face, then
beat him into a bloody pulp until the fight was finally stopped in
the fourth round.
	   Chavez claimed after the fight that he sustained a cut over his
eye while playing with his young son the week before the bout and
that he would have never lost if the cut had not reopened.
	   On Tuesday, Chavez backed off that story a bit, but refused to
concede anything else to De La Hoya.
	   ``De La Hoya said I didn't give him respect in the first
fight,'' Chavez said. ``I didn't give it because it was never
earned.''
	   Chavez (101-2-2, 84 knockouts) figures to be looking at his last
big payday in a career that began 18 years ago in his hometown of
Culiacan, Mexico. He's taken the fight seriously, going to the high
altitude of Colorado to train for two months to get his body into
shape.
	   Oddsmakers don't figure that will be enough against De La Hoya,
however, who is younger, stronger, faster and undefeated in 28
fights. De La Hoya, a 2-1 favorite the first time they met, is an
8-1 favorite this time.
	   ``He knows this will be his last major event,'' De La Hoya said
Tuesday. ``I really recommend he retires after this.''

Drug sales to level off as Japan's economy makes first dent in
</HEADLINE>
industry &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN GLANTON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cholesterol drugs and antidepressants are hot.
Diet drugs are not. And the global pharmaceutical industry is
beginning to show symptoms of the Asian flu.
	   In a midyear report Tuesday, health-care information company IMS
Health said worldwide sales of prescription drugs should total dlrs
308 billion this year, up 1.7 percent from 1997.
	   North America will remain the primary area of growth, with a 42
percent share of the world market, up from 34 percent in 1993.
	   But Japan will account for 13 percent of pharmaceutical sales,
compared with 20 percent in 1993 and 15 percent in 1997. Sales of
dlrs 45.4 billion last year to the Asian nation are expected to
shrink to dlrs 40 billion in 1998.
	   The financial crisis that has riddled Japan all year isn't the
only reason for the drop, said William Machtiger, vice president
for global client services at IMS. Government-ordered price cuts on
drugs took effect in April. Also, a slow regulatory process means
some drugs that are wildly popular in other nations _ including
Viagra, the blockbuster impotence drug _ are not yet available in
Japan.
	   But Japan isn't the only weak spot. Emerging economies in Latin
America, Africa and Asia, while ripe for growth, aren't likely to
contribute much to global drug sales this year, Machtiger said.
	   He said European drug companies, which tend to have more
exposure to emerging markets, may be more at risk for battered
profits than U.S. companies, which do about two-thirds of their
business in North America.
	   IMS, based in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvani, tracks sales and
prescription data.
	   Among the most successful classes of drugs in 1998 are
cholesterol drugs, up 21.8 percent from 1997, and antidepressants,
which increased 19.6 percent, IMS reported. Lipitor, a cholesterol
reducer made by Warner-Lambert Co., is the fastest-growing product
worldwide, with dlrs 1.3 billion in sales in the 12-month period
that ended in June.
	   Diet drugs have fared the worst, following the withdrawal of two
popular drugs, fenfluramine and Redux, after users complained of
heart problems. Sales of anti-obesity drugs are down 42.8 percent
compared with 1997.
	   The springtime debut of Viagra has transformed the market for
sexual dysfunction drugs, IMS officials noted. Viagra, on track to
reach dlrs 1 billion in sales in its first year, is the main driver
behind a 300-percent growth rate for that class of drugs.

Australian official says Asian crisis could improve democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with treasurer predicting upturn in 1999-2000

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Some Asian countries will probably
emerge from the financial crisis with better democracies and
economic systems, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   Their economic structures will become ``more competitive, more
transparent, more accountable'' and their governments ``more
democratic'' Downer told Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV.
	   Speaking on the same topic, opposition foreign affairs spokesman
Laurie Brereton said Indonesia's crisis also presented Australia
with a chance to help resolve unrest in East Timor.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello expressed optimism that Australia could
have a better year in 1999-2000, a year which would also bring a
turnaround in Asia.
	   ``I actually think that there is every reason to be a turning in
Asia by 1999/2000, just as the Asian crisis came on quickly it
could pass quickly, that is certainly the experience in Mexico,''
Costello told the National Press Club.
	   ``So I would say that there is every reason to think that we
could have a better year,'' he said.

	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ One of the world's last
remaining absolute monarchies prepared Wednesday to welcome Queen
Elizabeth II for her first state visit in 26 years.
	   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, have not traveled to
this oil-rich sultanate on Borneo island since 1972, more than a
decade before the Southeast Asian nation gained full independence
from the United Kingdom.
	   Buckingham Palace says the royals intend to mingle with ordinary
people during their four-day visit, perhaps to emulate the winning
style of the late Princess Diana.
	   The common folk like the idea.
	   Zamaliah, who sells ``tundung dulang'' _ brightly woven Malay
baskets used to cover fish and fruit _ has been hard at work on a
design she hopes to present to the queen when she tours the Tamu
open market Saturday.
	   ``I think she'll be very happy with this, yes?'' Zamaliah said,
showing off a large basket with the British Union Jack and Bruneian
flag woven into its round bottom.
	   ``I just want to touch her hand, she's so beautiful.''
	   The royal couple, making Southeast Asia their only overseas
destination this year, will also visit a centuries old water
village along the Brunei River and a health clinic that caters to
women and children.
	   The queen will tour the Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque,
covering her head and removing her shoes in respect of Islam, a
religion practiced by most of Brunei's 314,000 people.
	   Not that the royal couple won't be feted in grand style. On
Friday, they will attend a state banquet at the Istana Nurul Iman,
said to be the world's largest palace with 1,788 suites, hosted by
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and his two wives.
	   The dlrs 350 million palace, its grand domes covered with
22-carat gold leaf, is bigger than Buckingham Palace and the
Vatican put together.
	   The sultan _ estimated by Fortune magazine to have a personal
fortune of dlrs 37 billion _ has his own squadron of private jets.
But the British royals will arrive Thursday aboard a chartered
British Airways Boeing 777 jet.
	   Brunei, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has a
tradition of sharing its bounty since oil was discovered early this
century. Medical care and education are free and there is no income
tax. In return, the sultan, whose family has reigned since the 14th
century, demands absolute loyalty. Criticizing the royal family
borders on treason.
	   Not so in Britain, of course, where the royals are under
constant scrutiny and criticism. Since the death of Princess Diana
last year, Buckingham Palace has tried to present Queen Elizabeth
II in a more informal and friendly light.
	   The royals will head Sunday to neighboring Malaysia, for their
first state visit since 1989. There, she will visit a recording
studio and an orphanage and center for the blind. On Monday, the
queen will close the 16th Commonwealth Games, which were opened
last week by her youngest son, Prince Edward.

Myanmar's top general calls opponents traitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The leader of Myanmar's military
government has called opponents of military rule traitors who are
helping colonialists conquer the country, the state-run New Light
of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
	   General Than Shwe, the leader of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, was believed to have been referring to
opposition party the National League for Democracy and its leader
Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Than Shwe and other military leaders almost never refer to Suu
Kyi by name. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was once a British
colony. The country was isolated by its military government for 26
years from 1962-88, and its leaders still view the outside world
with suspicion.
	   ``The internal traitors with pessimistic views are paving the
way for neocolonialists to interfere in our internal affairs,''
Than Shwe told a gathering of the Union Solidarity and Development
Association, a military-run civilian organization.
	   Since May, the military has arrested 783 NLD members, including
194 members of parliament, in the largest crackdown against the
opposition since the early 1990s.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of seats in parliament in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.

Asian stock markets open mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets opened mixed Wednesday, with news
about U.S. interest rates and Japanese banking reforms boosting
some stocks and local issues depressing others.
	   By midday, Tokyo shares had gained 0.32 percent on hopes for an
agreement on urgently needed legislation to clean up Japan's ailing
banking system. Singapore's key index surged 2.3 percent as two
major banks cut their prime lending rates, and Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index was 1.4 percent higher.
	   Indonesia's key JSX Composite index, however, dropped 1.9
percent to a five-year low on continued foreign selling and
speculation that the government will implement Malaysian-style
capital controls.
	   Although the Indonesian government announced that the rupiah
would be allowed to float freely, foreign investors dumped shares,
waiting to see what will happen to the country's already battered
economy, dealers said.
	   In nearby Singapore, the stock market was boosted by
expectations that other banks will cut interest rates, too.
	   Following a similar announcement by the United Overseas Bank,
Singapore's largest banking group Development Bank of Singapore
announced it was also slashing prime lending rates by a quarter
percentage point to 7.25 percent beginning Wednesday.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues closed at
midday up 47.01 points at 14,274.38. The financial markets had been
closed Tuesday for a national holiday.
	   Reports that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan is eager for
progress on banking reform before a meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton Sept. 22 buoyed market sentiment, analysts said.
	   They said investors also were encouraged by Wall Street's 1
percent gain Tuesday _ its third straight session of progress.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese currency
amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will not cut
interest rates anytime soon.
	   The dollar bought 134.38 yen in early trading, up 1.80 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
133.90 yen overnight.
	   U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich said Tuesday that
inflation was a greater threat to the U.S. economy than deflation,
a statement interpreted to mean an interest rate cut is unlikely.
	   That contradicted an earlier impression by financial markets
that the Fed was preparing to cut interest rates to help the
economy overcome the negative effects of Asia's financial crisis.
	   In Hong Kong, investors were hopeful the Group of Seven
industrialized nations, which are meeting in London, would
recommend U.S. interest rate cuts.
	   The G-7, concerned that Asia's crisis is spreading to Russia,
Latin America and other emerging markets, is expected to offer
solutions for the world's damaged economies.
	   Hong Kong, whose currency is linked to the U.S. dollar, is
likely to follow any American rate cuts.

	   The dollar bought 134.12 yen in midafternoon trading, up 1.54
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 133.90 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national
holiday.
	   The dollar also benefited from an overnight rise on Wall Street,
traders said.
	   Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich, speaking at a global
economic conference in Pittsburgh, said on Tuesday that inflation
was a greater threat to the U.S. economy than deflation, a
statement interpreted to mean the United States was less likely to
cut interest rates.
	   That view contradicted the impression held by financial markets
that the Federal Reserve was prepared to cut interest rates if it
would help the economy overcome the negative effects of Asia's
spreading financial crisis.
	   Lower interest rates make a nation's currency less attractive to
investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices erased early gains to
close mixed as general pessimism about Japan's economy offset
bullish factors, including expectations that an agreement on
banking reform would soon be reached in Parliament.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 29.67
points, 0.21 percent, to finish the session at 14,274.38. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed up 310.39 points, or 2.23 percent.
	   ``The market's inability to rise despite an array of positive
factors illustrates the weakness of the underlying economy,'' said
Kenji Karikomi of Daiwa Securities.
	   Traders had been encouraged in the morning by reports the
government is ready to accept opposition demands for a temporary
nationalization of ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in return
for support on bills to clean up the banking system. Shares were
also supported by the overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   But later Wednesday, Japan's economic planning chief, Taichi
Sakaiya, warned that the Japanese economy could shrink 2 percent in
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   And bank shares, which were higher for most of Wednesday, were
dragged down by reports the Union Bank of Switzerland would
dissolve its business alliance with LTCB.
	   LTCB's shares sank as low as 26 yen (20 U.S. cents) in afternoon
after the reports its alliance with UBS was in trouble.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,087.50. On
Monday, the TOPIX closed up 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.770 percent, down from 0.775 on Monday,
driving its price up to 114.80 from 114.76 yen.

Sydney confident of clean drinking water for 2000 Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Australian officials are working to
resolve Sydney's water contamination crisis so drinking supplies
will be safe well before the 2000 Olympics, games' organizers said
Wednesday.
	   More than 3 million people in Sydney have been forced to boil
their drinking water after three contaminated water alerts in six
weeks.
	   Test results showed the water was contaminated with the
parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, with some reports suggesting
it could take up to six months for the problem to clear up.
	   Sydney organizing committee president Michael Knight, who is
also Olympics Minister for the state of New South Wales, told the
IOC executive board that the water problem was being addressed
urgently.
	   However, Knight stopped short of giving guarantees that the
problem would be fixed or that contingency measures would be
adopted in case of water contamination problems during the games.
	   ``I said clearly, `Yes, this is a problem. The problem is both a
surprise and an annoyance but it's a problem the New South Wales
government is committed to getting fixed,''' Knight told a news
conference.
	   ``It's important to have it fixed for the games. It's even more
important to get it fixed for the residents of the city long, long
before the games.''
	   Knight said there were no follow-up questions from the IOC
members, indicating they were satisfied with his assessment.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week he had been
assured by Sydney organizers that the water crisis would be fixed
soon and would have no impact on the games.
	   Knight was less categorical Thursday. Without giving any time
frame, he said the NSW government wanted to fix the problem ``as
quickly as possible.''
	   ``It's a matter we want to see resolved very, very quickly and
not leave it as a matter that would impact on games preparations,''
he said.
	   Knight said there was no need to make contingency plans for safe
drinking water during the games.
	   ``That would suggest we couldn't solve the problem,'' he said.
``We don't want to start with a defeatist attitude.''
	   Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board member and head of the
IOC's oversight panel on the Sydney Games, said the IOC asked for
an in-depth study of the problem.
	   ``There is plenty of time, two years still, to solve the
problem,'' he said. ``We are optimistic this will be solved. ...
The only reason we would ask for a contingency plan is if the study
indicated there is a possibility the problem could happen in the
future.''
	   On other issues, Knight said Samaranch reminded organizers that
the success of the Sydney Games will depend largely on the success
of Australian athletes.
	   Samaranch noted the recent success of Australian athletes in
world championships in rowing and triathlon and at the U.S. Open
tennis tournament, where two Aussies _ Pat Rafter and Mark
Philippoussis _ met in Sunday's final.
	   ``He (Samaranch) thought that not only were we on track in terms
of organization, but our athletes are also on track,'' Knight said.
	   Knight expressed his general backing for Australian Olympic
Committee president John Coates' proposals for stiffening laws so
that traffickers and suppliers of banned performance-enhancing
drugs could be jailed.
	   However, Knight steered clear of endorsing possible criminal
sanctions for athletes caught using drugs _ an option that is
staunchly opposed by IOC officials.
	   Rogge said the IOC is in ``total agreement'' with Coates on the
need to prosecute traffickers and dealers, but athletes should be
sanctioned by sports bodies alone.
	   Rogge said the IOC could not object to police rounding up
athletes for questioning in doping investigations, as occurred
during this summer's drug-marred Tour de France. However, he
stressed that Olympic athletes should be treated with respect and
allowed to have proper sleep, rest and training before their
competitions.

Anti-U.S. protests mark anniversary of Philippine bases rejection
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Rain-drenched leftist demonstrators
marked the anniversary of the rejection of U.S. military bases
seven years ago with rallies at the American Embassy Wednesday.
	   They used the protests to oppose an agreement that would allow a
resumption of U.S. war exercises in the Philippines.
	   Some of the demonstrators wore Monica Lewinsky or U.S. President
Bill Clinton masks. ``We have more trust in Monica Lewinsky than in
Bill Clinton and the U.S. troops,'' said Roy Alfoforo, a leader of
Pandayan, a socialist group.
	   Pandayan said Clinton's own deceptions about his relationship
with Lewinsky show that the U.S. government cannot be trusted in
the proposed Visiting Forces Agreement.
	   The embassy, where police have tightened security since the
bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, has been
the site of almost daily protests against the proposed agreement
since last week.
	   On Friday, police scuffled with members of the left-wing League
of Filipino Students, who tried to throw plastic bags filled with
red paint at the U.S. government emblem at the embassy's gate.
	   Heavy rains did little to stop Wednesday's peaceful protests,
which drew hundreds of demonstrators from nearby provinces who
later planned to march to the presidential palace.
	   Opponents of the agreement have denounced President Joseph
Estrada for pushing for its approval. Estrada was one of the
senators in 1991 who voted against a treaty that would have
extended the lease on the last U.S. military base in the
Philippines, at Subic Bay.
	   A year later, the Americans left Subic, ending nearly a century
of U.S. military presence in this former American colony.
	   Estrada says he voted against the treaty seven years ago to
uphold Philippine sovereignty but is now supporting the agreement
and closer security ties with the United States to ensure the
country's security.
	   Alfoforo dismissed the argument that the agreement would improve
the Philippines' capability to defend itself.
	   ``We have no foreign enemies,'' Alfoforo said. ``What is
frightening, however, is that with the VFA, we will become the
magnet for attacks by enemies of the United States.''
	   The VFA, which was signed in January by senior officials but
still must be approved by the Philippine Senate, would provide
legal protection to U.S. soldiers on duty in the Philippines.
	   Critics say the pact would limit the Philippine government's
right to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes in the
country, and would also promote prostitution.
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. soldiers from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.

Britain lauds Hong Kong's political progress, economic decisions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Britain lauded Hong Kong's political progress
and voiced its support for the government's recent intervention in
the financial markets to defend its currency link, a senior
diplomat said Wednesday.
	   Alan Paul, British team leader of the Joint Liaison Group,
described the first elections since the handover of this former
British colony as ``efficient and scrupulously fair.''
	   High voter turnout ``destroyed once and for all the myth that
the people of Hong Kong are not interested in democracy,'' Paul
told reporters after the group's meeting.
	   He said he also discussed human rights, freedoms and the rule of
law in Hong Kong with his Chinese counterparts.
	   ``So far, the picture is an encouraging one, but there is no
room for complacency and we will continue to follow developments in
these areas with the closest interest,'' he said.
	   The working group, which was set up to handle details of the
transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in July 1997 from Britain to
China, met in the territory over the past two days.
	   Both Paul and Wang Guisheng, the leader for the mainland Chinese
side, said the work of the group was basically complete.
	   They also reiterated their countries' support for Hong Kong's
decision to intervene in the stock market.
	   Last month, the Hong Kong government took on currency and stock
speculators, ultimately intervening and changing market rules to
close the door on what it called market manipulation.
	   Hong Kong officials say the intervention was aimed at protecting
the 14-year-old currency peg, which has come under attacks by
speculators since October.
	   The two sides, however, failed to reach a consensus on a
solution to the decades-long issue of Vietnamese refugees stranded
in the territory.
	   Paul said it was no longer Britain's direct responsibility after
the handover, but Wang disagreed.
	   ``England has an unshirkable responsibility for the final
solution,'' Wang said.
	   Since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South in
1975, ending the Vietnam war, nearly 223,000 Vietnamese have passed
through Hong Kong.
	   Most of them have been resettled in the West or repatriated to
Vietnam, but there are still about 1,000 people _ most of them
either classified as stateless or are in jail _ living here.

Chinese shops, houses burned in Indonesian fishing town riot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of damage, arrests and police comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rioting mobs burned hundreds of ethnic
Chinese-owned shops and houses in Bagansiapi-api, a fishing town on
Sumatra island, news reports and police said Wednesday.
	   Thousands of people took part in the rampage that began Tuesday
evening and ended early Wednesday, police said.
	   The official Antara news agency said about 300 houses and shops,
two hotels, mostly owned by ethnic Chinese, were set ablaze. The
local customs house was also burned.
	   There were no reports of injuries.
	   A police officer in the neighboring town of Bengkalis said
hundreds of soldiers and police were deployed from nearby towns to
quell the violence.
	   ``Dozens have been arrested and are being interrogated,'' the
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in a telephone
interview.
	   He said some rioters set fire to plastic bags containing
gasoline and hurled them onto the roofs of shops and buildings.
	   Antara quoted local residents as saying many of the rioters were
not from Bagansiapi-api, about 1,125 kilometers (700 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   The residents said mobs gathered in the town's streets amid
rumors that a local man had been killed in fight with an ethnic
Chinese man, Antara reported.
	   A similar incident occurred Saturday in Palopo and Luwu, two
neighboring towns in South Sulawesi, about 1,250 kilometers (780
miles) northeast of Jakarta, where two people were killed and 118
houses were damaged after a mass brawl.
	   Sporadic rioting has erupted in other parts of Indonesia
recently over rising prices of basic foods.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only a small fraction of Indonesia's
population. But they are successful in commerce and industry and
have been targeted in riots as scapegoats for Indonesia's economic
problems, the worst in 30 years.
	   They are particularly vulnerable to violence in small towns
where they usually dominate retailing.

Security personnel block protesters in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers and police scuffled with
protesters who tried to march to the office of Indonesia's military
commander on Wednesday.
	   Security forces blocked about 200 students, workers and
supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri at the city's
Welcome Monument fountain, about one kilometer (a half mile) from
the office of Gen. Wiranto.
	   The location is in the heart of central Jakarta and is bordered
by five-star hotels and the British Embassy.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   The group was protesting the military's involvement in the
abduction of anti-government activists up until the resignation of
former autocratic President Suharto in May.
	   Suharto quit after 1,200 people were killed during a wave of
student protests and riots triggered by the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   Wednesday's clash was the latest in a new campaign of student
demonstrations.
	   ``We will not allow them to continue the march,'' said police
officer Capt. Sudiman. About 50 soldiers and policemen armed with
rifles were on hand.
	   The protesters chanted and unfurled banners before turning back
to the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation where the
march began a few hours earlier.
	   One read: ``We demand you take responsibility general for the
missing activists.''
	   Pro-democracy groups say dozens of anti-Suharto activists were
kidnapped by the military's elite special forces, or Kopassus. They
say 14 activists are still missing. Some fear they are dead.
	   An internal military investigation resulted in the dismissal of
Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a former chief of Kopassus and Suharto's
son-in-law. Ten Kopassus soldiers are also to face courts-martials
over the kidnappings.
	   A protester, who identified himself only as Yanto, said Wiranto
should say where missing activists are.
	   Also on Wednesday about 150 protesters peacefully gathered
outside the Parliament and demanded greater workers rights.

Hungarians get a headsup on Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarians got some good news for a
change Wednesday morning as state-run radio announced that Viagra
will soon be marketed in drug stores.
	   Registration of the drug was thought to be years away. But with
the European Union giving the potency drug the green light, Tamas
Paal, head of the Hungarian National Institute of Pharmacology,
said registration procedures can be completed within three months.
	   That means Viagra under the Christmas tree in many households,
as doctors have said that about one-third of Hungary's male
population over 40 are believed to have potency disorders.
	   Earlier this month, officials seized 220 Viagra pills in a raid
on the home of a Hungarian-American, who advertised the potency
tablets which have not been certified for sale here, and sold them
for 5,000 forints (dlrs 23) a piece.
	   The average monthly salary in Hungary is 70,000 forints, or dlrs
310.
	   Making Viagra legal means the price will be knocked down to
about 2,000 forints (dlrs 16.50) per pill.

South Korea's president wants apology from Japan over war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Koreans were victims of Japanese aggression
during World War II and deserve a heartfelt apology when their
president visits Japan next month, South Korea's ambassador to
Japan said Wednesday.
	   President Kim Dae-jung will visit Japan next month to forge a
new partnership between South Korea and its former colonial ruler.
	   ``To put it simply, the South Korean people were victims,'' Kim
Suk-kyu, South Korea's ambassador to Japan said at a press
conference in Tokyo. South Korea's president ``is hoping Japan will
offer a heartfelt apology and reflect on its history,'' he said.
	   Many South Koreans have bitter memories of atrocities committed
by Japan during colonial rule from 1910-45, when Koreans were
barred from speaking their own language and forced to use Japanese
names. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Koreans were
forced into labor or prostitution for the Japanese military.
	   Japan has apologized several times, but many South Koreans feel
the apologies have fallen short of true remorse.
	   President Kim will meet Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi when he
visits Japan in early October.
	   Meanwhile, the South Korean ambassador said North Korea's Aug.
31 rocket test represented a threat to regional security even if
the object launched was a satellite, as the communist country
claimed.
	   ``Whether it was a satellite or a missile, it shows they have
the know-how to launch a two-stage rocket,'' Kim said. ``This is a
threat not only to Japan and South Korea but a threat to the
security of the entire region.''
	   The U.S. State Department on Monday said the object that North
Korea launched over Japan was likely a rocket used in a failed
attempt to lift a very small satellite into orbit. The military
implications of either a satellite launch or a missile test were
similar, the State Department said.
	   The test greatly increased uneasiness in Japan toward its
communist neighbor and reminded the country of its vulnerability to
attack. Politicians have been calling for a missile defense system
in Japan since the test.

Firings at private TV station trigger protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The new ownership of Slovakia's only
private TV station has fired 12 top staffers, prompting strong
protest and raising questions about manipulation of media 10 days
before parliamentary elections.
	   News of the Tuesday dismissals at Markiza prompted an immediate
demonstration at the station. Dismissed staff broke into the
building and broadcast a brief appeal for public backing.
	   More than 1,000 protesters responded to the call. Late Tuesday,
they remained outside the building or in the lobby, but it was
unclear who was in control of the station.
	   Opposition politicians also showed up to talk to station
officials and to give speeches to the protesters. No incidents were
reported.
	   TV Markiza, which has been broadcasting for a year has been the
only source providing independent news to Slovakia, where the state
controls all radio and TV stations with nation-wide distribution in
the country.
	   The station came under new ownership in August, but a lengthy
and murky court case prevented the new owner, Gamatex Group, from
taking control until Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who is accused of backing
Gamatex, denied he was involved in the ownership.
	   ``The government ... is not involved in what is happening in
Markiza. It is only a problem between two independent businesses,''
Meciar said Tuesday at a rally in Trnava, 52 kilometers (35 miles)
northeast of Bratislava.
	   Meciar, who is in a close race for elections, has been accused
by international officials of trampling media rights.
	   The new ownership of Markiza, gave no reason for firing the
staff _ 10 journalists, plus the news editor and general director.

	   HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) _ The Mexican government is rushing help to
1.2 million people devastated by floods in the south, struggling to
reach thousands of settlements cut off for as much as a week.
	   Thousands remained isolated Tuesday, more than five days after
rivers washed away their homes, crops and many of their neighbors.
Many people are growing increasingly angry at the pace of relief
efforts in the devastated coastal regions.
	   ``The aid that President Ernesto Zedillo offered by television
still has not arrived and we are sure it will not arrive because we
are from the PRD,'' said farmer Ramon Gutierrez, referring to the
opposition Democratic Revolution Party.
	   State and federal officials insisted they were doing all they
can and that aid would be given without regard to party
affiliation.
	   Mexico's Defense Secretariat said late Tuesday that helicopter
aid flights to isolated communities had continued despite clouds
and rain _ even though other officials told the government news
agency Notimex that some flights had been canceled.
	   ``We are doing everything possible to reach all of the
communities,'' said Lt. Col. Edgar Novelo, an army surgeon helping
oversee medical aid efforts in Huixtla, 30 miles (50 kilometers)
from the Guatemalan border.
	   But he called the medical situation ``critical.''
	   The federal Health Secretariat said it had massed 1,832 health
workers in the affected area and had seen thousands of patients _
mostly for diarrhea, parasites, eye problems, respiratory
infections and skin problems caused by polluted water.
	   It said workers were also taking action to counter feared
outbreaks of cholera, dengue and malaria.
	   Many victims were washed away _ their bodies buried in mud or
carried out to sea. Officials said they had recovered about 90
corpses. Local newspapers put the death toll at more than 200.
	   Mexico's Red Cross continued to call for donations of food and
medicine. Among those responding was Pope John Paul II, who donated
dlrs 50,000 through Catholic charities for Mexico.

Scientists researching moon's atmosphere
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Ask about the moon's atmosphere and most
people will respond: It doesn't have one! Like many things people
know, that's not quite true.
	   ``Although many people think of the moon as an object which has
no atmosphere, it is surrounded by a tenuous envelope of gas
atoms,'' explained Urs A. Mall of the Max Planck Institute for
Aeronomy in Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany.
	   Admittedly, the moon's atmosphere isn't much by our standards _
the pressure is about one-billionth that of Earth. But it's there,
and Mall is leading a group of scientists harnessing satellite
technology to try and figure out what that atmosphere is made of.
	   ``Many people tend to underestimate what we can learn by further
investigating the moon, a place so close to home,'' Mall said.
	   ``Of course this atmosphere is very tenuous,'' said Mario Acuna,
a specialist in solar-terrestrial physics at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``We want to know what the
source is of these gases we find on the moon.''
	   Acuna, who is not part of Mall's research group, said that since
gases escape easily from the moon, there has to be a constant
source for them.
	   Possibilities include vaporization of rocks caused by meteor
impacts, moonquakes releasing gases from beneath the surface and
heat-generated gases resulting from the uneven solar heating of the
moon as it rotates over the period of a month, Acuna said in a
telephone interview.
	   The Apollo manned lunar explorations during the late 1960s and
early 1970s identified argon and helium atoms in the space just
above the lunar surface. And Earth-based observations have since
added sodium and potassium to the list.
	   But those four elements constitute only about 10 percent of the
density of the moon atmosphere, so the team of German and American
researchers is using a special satellite instrument to identify
other elements that may be present.
	   So far they have identified very small amounts of oxygen,
silicon and aluminum, they report in a paper scheduled for
publication in Geophysical Research Letters.
	   They expect to identify more constituents in November, when the
WIND spacecraft _ designed to measure the solar wind emitted from
the sun _ will spend time near the moon. The spacecraft carries a
special instrument that can identify ions, forms of elements that
have gained an electric charge.
	   When an atom in the moon's atmosphere becomes ionized, it
becomes subject to an interplanetary electrical field 1,000 times
stronger than the moon's gravity. So, while ordinary forms of the
elements would simply drop back to the moon's surface, ions are
picked up by this solar wind and carried off, detectable by a
special instrument aboard the WIND spacecraft.
	   One thing they haven't found in the moon's atmosphere so far is
nitrogen, the gas that makes up more than three-quarters of the
Earth's atmosphere. But that doesn't mean there never was any.
	   ``One has to keep in mind that what the moon originally had as
an atmosphere was lost early in its history. The gravitational
field of the moon is so weak that it cannot hold most of what may
have been there at the beginning,'' Mall said in an interview
conducted by electronic mail.
	   The atoms making up the current atmosphere either originate from
the moon or are brought there from the outside, such as by
meteoroids, comets of the solar wind, he explained.
	   Mall called the moon an ``outpost'' for the Earth, allowing the
study of complicated problems under somewhat simpler conditions.
	   ``The moon with its weak atmosphere is, in principle, a
wonderful place to observe the arrival and impact of
micrometeoroids, even when the impacts are not as spectacular as in
some contemporary movies,'' he said.

Indian economy sound: says finance minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said
Wednesday that the Indian economy was strong and safe for
investment.
	   Sinha admitted that economic sanctions imposed by the United
States and other countries after India's May nuclear tests appeared
to have sapped foreign investors' confidence in India.
	   ``But the mood is changing because internationally India is now
being perceived as a stable pole in the economic field against
turbulence elsewhere,'' he said.
	   Sinha pledged to keep India's fiscal deficit at the projected
level of 5.6 percent of gross domestic product during the fiscal
year ending March 1999.
	   The finance minister said the current summer harvest was
expected to be good. The result will be more money in the hands of
farm families, which analysts expect will increase demand for
manufactured goods, kickstarting an industry beset by a demand
slowdown.
	   Sinha also called on international financial institutions not to
impose unwanted conditions on aid to needy countries.
	   ``No country can allow its national interests to be trampled on
by unchecked or undisciplined international operators,'' Sinha told
reporters in New Delhi.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Followers of ex-President Sali Berisha
ignored a deadline to hand in weapons by dawn Wednesday or face a
government crackdown.
	   However, Albania's capital appeared calm Wednesday morning as
the opposition planned another demonstration.
	   Hours before the planned 11 a.m. (0900 gmt) protest, traffic
flowed freely through the capital of Tirana. Residents headed to
work and school. Police made their presence known, patrolling
regularly on the major boulevard that passes key government
offices.
	   The deadline for handing in weapons was announced late Tuesday
during a 4 1/2-hour parliamentary session as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano reasserted control after disappearing from sight during two
days of rioting in Tirana.
	   During the parliament session, the government also passed a law
allowing the military police to operate under the Interior Ministry
and ordered an investigation which could lead to the arrest and
prosecution of Berisha and top aides for allegedly attempting a
coup during this week's rioting.
	   The decision on military police effectively places them at the
disposal of the government without having to consult or call in the
army.
	   But members of Nano's own Socialist party criticized the move,
saying it resembled Berisha's decision to call in the army during
unrest when he was president last year.
	   In an attempt to ensure support among the police, Nano this week
increased their salaries by 50 to 100 percent, the state news
agency reported. The government also said it would give police a
one-time reward of 30,000 to 50,000 leke (dlrs 200 to 340) for
protecting state institutions during the rioting.
	   Before the increase, ordinary policemen earned about dlrs 65 a
month. Members of the elite special force received dlrs 400 a
month.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Berisha handed over two army tanks seized in
the rioting Sunday and Monday, ending a standoff at his Democratic
Party headquarters in this former Communist capital.
	   Scores of heavily armed Berisha supporters had faced off with
Albanian police, who set up roadblocks around the building and
stood guard with automatic rifles.

Ruble falls as Russia awaits economic crisis plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five days after his confirmation, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was still cautiously assembling a new Cabinet on
Wednesday as the Russian currency started to show new signs of
weakness.
	   Primakov was approved last Friday, but has yet to provide
details on how he hopes to end Russia's economic crisis, regarded
as the worst since the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
	   Primakov has spoken only in general terms, saying he is
committed to economic reform. He has moved carefully in putting
together a new Cabinet, offering posts to a wide range of political
and economic factions, including the Communist Party.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency again appeared unstable. The ruble
had been regaining strength in recent days as banks pushed for a
better rate before they paid off hard currency debts to foreigners.
The ruble reached about 7.5 to the dollar early Tuesday _ only
slightly off its rate a month ago, when the crisis hit.
	   But the ruble then reversed course Tuesday afternoon and was
down to about 11-12 to the dollar in street trading Wednesday
morning.
	   The currency swings reflect the instability in the Russian
economy and concerns that the new government will resort to
printing more money to pay off billions of rubles (dollars) in back
wages, a move that could lead to hyperinflation.
	   Russian liberals and media have been critical of the new
government, saying it will represent a retreat from free-market
reforms.
	   Primakov's economic team remains incomplete and a lack of stated
policies has made it difficult to assess his aims.
	   The head of the centrist Our Home Is Russia parliament faction,
Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy prime minister in charge of
financial issues. He said another pro-reform member of his faction,
Georgy Boos, had been appointed head of the State Tax Service,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The position had been held by a top reformer in the previous
government, Boris Fyodorov, who was highly respected by the Western
investment community.
	   The prime minister met Tuesday with a delegation of officials
from the International Monetary Fund, including the IMF's top
official for Russia, John Odling Smee.
	   The Russian side ``stressed the new government's firm commitment
to the policy of market reforms, but pointed out the need for some
changes in the ways of their implementation to ensure sustainable
economic growth and to take into account all the social aspects of
the reforms.''
	   Primakov also stressed that Russia was committed to paying the
billions of dollars in debt it owes to foreign banks and
institutions, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Still, there have been indications that the government intends
to play a stronger role in the economy.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Tuesday called for
a return to the Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn
in all of their hard-currency earnings to the government.
	   The measure ``is long overdue,'' Gerashchenko said. ``That
should have been done last year,'' he said.
	   Gerashchenko also said he supported printing more money to pay
off many months' backlog of wages.
	   ``We can't do without that,'' he said.
	   However, he did not say if the increase in the money supply
would be underpinned by the Central Bank's hard currency reserves.
If the bank simply prints money that is not backed by assets, this
would erode the value of the ruble and could lead to
hyperinflation.
	   No decision on increasing the money supply will be made until
the Central Bank's new board of directors is in place, Gerashchenko
said. The board is scheduled to come up for a confirmation vote in
parliament Wednesday.

Major Japanese banks' credit ratings may be cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign of slipping international
confidence in Japan's banks, Moody's Investors Service said
Wednesday it was considering cutting its ratings on three of the
country's big lenders.
	   The U.S. credit rating agency said it was reviewing its ratings
on Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Mitsubishi Trust and Banking and Toyo
Trust and Banking for possible cuts.
	   The ratings are an assessment of the banks' ability to pay back
its debt and deposits. A lower rating is associated with higher
risk for investors and depositors and could make raising money more
expensive for the banks.
	   Moody's said the review of Dai-Ichi Kangyo, one of the world's
largest banks, was prompted by ``growing concerns that the
continuously deteriorating operating environment may further affect
DKB's asset quality and profit generating power.''
	   The review covers ratings on the bank's long-term debt and
deposits and also ratings on the debt of many affiliated companies.
	   Moody's also said it would review its ratings on Mitsubishi
Trust and Toyo Trust because ``the nation's banking crisis has
intensified as the domestic and international economies continue to
lose stability and the government has so far failed to restore
market confidence.''
	   Trust banks, which manage money for institutions and other
well-heeled investors, are particularly vulnerable, Moody's said,
because changes in regulations were expected to make the fund
management business more competitive.
	   Moody's ratings are divided into the relatively safe
``investment grade'' and the riskier ``speculative,'' or junk,
grade.
	   Moody's currently gives Dai-Ichi Kangyo an ``A3'' rating, which
is in the middle of the investment grade category. The company
rates both Mitsubishi Trust and Toyo Trust near the bottom of the
category at ``Baa1.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Ariane rocket blasted off Wednesday in the
year's sixth launch, placing a PanAmSat-7 telecommunications
satellite into orbit, officials said.
	   In mission No. 110 for Arianespace, the Ariane-4 took off from
Europe's launch site in Kourou, French Guiana on the northeastern
edge of South America at 3:31 a.m., (6:31 GMT.)
	   The satellite is to reinforce a global telecommunications system
first put in place in June 1988 with the launch of PanAmSat-1, also
by Ariane.
	   From its position above the Indian Ocean, the system covers
Africa, Saudia Arabia and Asia.
	   A further two satellites are scheduled to be sent into orbit on
Oct. 6 by Arianespace, the commercial arm of the 13-nation European
Space Agency.

Hong Kong property giant latest to join price war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A leading property developer said Wednesday it
will sell a batch of luxurious apartments at a loss, joining a
price war that analysts say could further hobble the beleaguered
property sector.
	   Katherine Hung, director for Cheung Kong Holdings, said the
company will sell the first batch of 24 units of its suburban
Paramount development at 3,468 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 445)
per square foot, a price she said would not generate profit.
	   But she declined to say how much a loss the developer will take.
	   ``This is a very small project and we have to react according to
market conditions,'' Hung said.
	   Cheung Kong, tycoon Li Ka-shing's property development and
investment flagship, became the latest to slash prices of new
apartments and condos.
	   Sluggish sales in the past few months prompted three leading
developers to cut prices for several developments by up to 30
percent last week.
	   Analysts have said they expect more developers to join the fray,
which also would drag down prices of used flats.
	   The price war is rattling the already battered confidence of
homebuyers in the market and discouraging them from buying,
analysts say, and this would delay the recovery of the property
sector, and the economy.
	   Property accounts for roughly one in 10 jobs and a third of the
territory's economy, which shrank 5 percent in the second quarter.
Job losses in the property sector are contributing to rising
unemployment, which is at a 15-year high.
	   Many homeowners are suffering under huge mortgage bills for
properties that are worth half as much as a year ago.
	   Most analysts expect prices to fall by another 20 percent to 25
percent, and U.S. investment banking giant Morgan Stanley forecast
prices would plunge 50 percent.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang earlier dismissed the forecast,
saying developers would not be willing to sell flats at a loss.
	   To stem the price fall, the government has frozen land sales and
lifted anti-speculation regulations. The legislature recently
approved funding for low-interest loans for first-time homebuyers.

Norwegian soldier wounded in shell fire in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Norwegian soldier was wounded Wednesday
when a mortar round fired by an Israeli army tank hit a U.N.
military outpost in south Lebanon, a U.N. statement said.
	   The statement said the Israeli tank fired three rounds in
southerly direction into a seven-man Norwegian patrol.
	   ``One soldier was hit with shrapnel wounds in his left hand,
resulting in the loss of one finger,'' it added. The soldier was
reported in stable condition at the U.N. field hospital in the
border town of Naqoura.
	   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, said UNIFIL has strongly protested the incident with
the Israeli army.
	   The position hit is in Blatt, a Shiite Muslim village north of
an Israeli-occupied border enclave and 10 kilometers (six miles)
west of Israel's northern Galilee panhandle.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after an Israeli invasion.
Nine nations contribute to the force: Finland, Italy, France,
Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Fiji.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body FIFA has said it
feels the next World Cup cannot be rescheduled to avoid bad weather
in host countries South Korea and Japan.
	   However, officials have asked both nations to investigate past
weather in the region between May and September to allow FIFA's
executive committee to make a final decision at a meeting on
September 24/25.
	   South Korean officials suggested earlier this year that the
competition should start in May 2002 to avoid the traditional rainy
season.
	   But FIFA's planning group said at a meeting Tuesday that the
dates for the event cannot be changed because June and July are
traditionally reserved for the World Cup.
	   The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, after the professional soccer season in
Europe and South America ends in April.
	   ``Any change of timing would severely disrupt soccer operations
around the world,'' a press release from FIFA said.
	   The host countries' organizing committees have been asked to
report the results back to FIFA within a week.
	   Meanwhile, FIFA said it has decided ticketing revenue from the
World Cup, soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia, will go
entirely to the host countries.
	   The move is an attempt by FIFA to avoid the controversy which
surrounded ticketing arrangements at this year's World Cup in
France. France had to give up a part of the proceeds, which was
why, under FIFA rules, French fans were given first call on half
the tickets, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said during his campaign
for the presidency in May.
	   Participating nations close to France argued the French ticket
distribution unfairly favored domestic supporters. They complained
bitterly that their fans weren't allocated enough tickets.

World Bank grants Ukraine nearly dlrs 1 billion in loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank is resuming its cooperation
with Ukraine and has granted the former Soviet republic dlrs 949.6
million in new loans, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.
	   Under agreements signed in Washington on Tuesday, the World Bank
loan would include dlrs 300 million to restructure its financial
sector, dlrs 300 million for industrial development and dlrs 16.4
million to develop the treasury system.
	   The projects are meant to support the government's privatization
program and the development of money markets, introduce
international accounting norms and de-regulate the economy.
	   Other goals are improvements in the banking sector, including
the closure of the least viable banks and introduction of a deposit
insurance system.
	   Ukraine also might use some of the money to pay for vital
imports and back up foreign currency markets, the bank said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Each loan is divided into three installments. The first would be
allocated immediately and the rest would be available in December
1998 and June 1999, provided that Ukraine properly implements the
programs.
	   Ukraine would also get dlrs 160 million in credits under a 1996
deal to restructure its ailing coal industry, about dlrs 150
million to back up agricultural reforms and another dlrs 23.2
million to reduce production of ozone-destroying substances.
	   The credits carry a 6 to 7 percent annual interest and would be
paid back in 15 to 20 years, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
	   Ukraine has received more than dlrs 1 billion from the World
Bank since it became a member in 1992. But the bank's cooperation
with Ukraine was suspended in March following the International
Monetary Fund's decision to freeze its aid to Ukraine over the
country's stalled economic reforms.
	   The government since has moved to take reform steps, and the IMF
approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan for Ukraine earlier this month, in
turn making the resumption of World Bank aid possible.

India wants nuclear energy technology for signing test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By K.N. ARUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ In exchange for signing a nuclear test ban
treaty, India wants the nuclear energy technology that it has been
denied because the material also has military uses, the prime
minister said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's comments to reporters in
the southern city of Madras confirmed speculation about ongoing
negotiations on India's nuclear policy between his envoy Jaswant
Singh and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   The United States, which led the world in punishing India's May
nuclear tests with economic sanctions, has called on New Delhi to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty unconditionally. Indian
officials have said they would be willing to sign an amended form
of the treaty, but changing the treaty would require an
international conference.
	   Vajpayee backed down from that demand Wednesday.
	   ``I know the treaty is not going to be changed,'' Vajpayee said.
``But certain other arrangements will be made to facilitate our
work ... particularly with regard to transfer of high technology.
We are having talks on this and other fronts.''
	   Vajpayee was clearly referring to the ``dual-use'' nuclear
technology India has been denied because it has applications in
weapons as well as in energy research.
	   Vajpayee and his aides are engaged in the delicate task of
changing public perception of the test ban treaty, which for years
was denounced in India as doing too little to encourage disarmament
while denying most of the world the chance to catch up with the
nuclear know-how Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States had developed over decades of testing. In recent months, the
government has made clear it now considers itself one of the
nuclear powers.
	   ``Whatever data we required we have collected, there is no need
for any further tests,'' Vajpayee said Wednesday. ``That is one of
the reasons why our attitude (toward the treaty) has changed.''
	   India's May test prompted tests by neighboring Pakistan, with
whom India has fought three wars. The United States and other
countries, fearing nuclear war could one day break out in this
volatile region, imposed economic sanctions on both countries and
demanded they sign the test ban treaty.
	   On Tuesday, a leading Pakistani religious university threatened
to launch a holy war against the government if it signs the treaty.
A decree issued by Dar-ul-Aloom Haqqania said signing the treaty
would leave Pakistan at a military disadvantage against India.
	   The opposition stormed out of a parliamentary debate on the
treaty Tuesday, saying the government already had decided to sign
it. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddiq Kanju said no
decision had been made.

Baltimore Orioles owner offers help to Greek Olympic baseball team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Greece is turning to the Baltimore
Orioles for help in putting together a team for the 2004 Olympics
in Athens.
	   In a country where few people have ever heard of Mark McGwire or
Sammy Sosa, Greece will struggle finding players for an Olympic
team.
	   The Orioles' Peter Angelos, who is of Greek origin, is willing
to assist.
	   Costas Bakouris, managing director of the Athens organizing
committee, said Wednesday that he met with Angelos last month
during a trip to Atlanta.
	   Bakouris said Angelos offered to help identify players of Greek
origin in the United States who could field a Greek team in 2004.
	   ``Since there is a lot of talent around the world of Greek
origin, we might have a good team,'' Bakouris said. ``He (Angelos)
believes building a team ourselves from the beginning is a naive
thing. I don't think there are any Greeks in the major leagues, but
maybe we can find players in the minor leagues who can have dual
citizenship.''
	   Bakouris said Angelos, who plans to visit Athens next month,
also promised to bring players from the Orioles organization to
Greece in the fall of 1999 or 2000 to play a series of exhibition
games.
	   Bakouris said baseball and softball, which is also on the
Olympic program, ``are not known in our country.''
	   ``In Greece, nobody has a clue who Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa
is,'' he said, referring to the St. Louis Cardinals' and Chicago
Cubs' sluggers who have both surpassed Rogers Maris' single season
record of 61 home runs.
	   Greece only just recently formed national baseball and softball
associations with the hope of putting together teams for the
Olympics.
	   Bakouris, who studied at Depaul University in Chicago and
describes himself as a White Sox fan, said the only baseball field
in Greece is a disused diamond at a former U.S. army base near the
Athens airport.
	   Athens will have to build baseball and softball stadiums and
training facilities for the Olympics.
	   With the Olympics now open to professional players, Bakouris
said he is optimistic that major leaguers will compete in the
Athens Games.
	   Major leaguers will not be playing in Sydney in 2000 because the
games take place in late September, conflicting with the crucial
final weeks of the regular season.
	   The Athens Olympics are scheduled for August, when it might be
more feasible for major league teams to release players.
	   Bakouris was in Seoul for the Athens organizing committee's
first report to the IOC executive board since the Greek capital was
awarded the games a year ago.
	   IOC director general Francois Carrard said the board was
``extremely impressed'' with the presentation.
	   Board member Jacques Rogge, head of the IOC oversight panel for
the Athens Games, urged the oganizing committee to hire more staff.
	   Committee president Stratis Stratigis said he has only 10
people, including secretaries, on the staff now but plans to
increase the number to 70.

Security personnel block protesters in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail of second protest grafs 14-16 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers and police scuffled with
protesters who tried to march to the office of Indonesia's military
commander on Wednesday.
	   Security forces blocked about 200 students, workers and
supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, at the
city's Welcome Monument fountain, about one kilometer (a half mile)
from the office of Gen. Wiranto.
	   The fountain is in the heart of central Jakarta and is bordered
by five-star hotels and the British Embassy.
	   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
	   The group were protesting the military's involvement in the
abduction of anti-government activists up until the resignation of
former autocratic President Suharto in May.
	   Suharto quit after 1,200 people were killed during a wave of
student protests and riots triggered by the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   Wednesday's clash was the latest in a new campaign of student
demonstrations.
	   ``We will not allow them to continue the march,'' said police
officer Capt. Sudiman. About 50 soldiers and policemen armed with
rifles were on hand.
	   The protesters chanted and unfurled banners before turning back
to the office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, where the
march began a few hours earlier.
	   One banner read: ``We demand you take responsibility general for
the missing activists.''
	   Pro-democracy groups say dozens of anti-Suharto activists were
kidnapped by the military's elite special forces, or Kopassus. They
say 14 activists are still missing. Some fear they are dead.
	   An internal military investigation resulted in the dismissal of
Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a former chief of Kopassus and Suharto's
son-in-law. Ten Kopassus soldiers are also to face courts-martials
over the kidnappings.
	   A protester, who identified himself only as Yanto, said Wiranto
should say where missing activists are.
	   Also Wednesday, about 300 students peacefully gathered outside
the Parliament, protesting higher food prices and demanding
lawmakers who got their seats unfairly be forced out of the House.
	   ``Habibie's rise to power was unconstitutional,'' some of the
students shouted as they left for the office of the Legal Aid
Foundation.
	   Earlier about 150 protesters rallied outside the legislature and
demanded greater workers' rights.

FIFA says World Cup can't be rescheduled for weather

feels the next World Cup cannot be rescheduled to avoid bad weather
in host countries South Korea and Japan.
	   However, officials have asked both nations to investigate past

Police : Two `Chinese spies' arrested at Dalai Lama's headquarters

<TEXT>
	   CHANDIGARH, India (AP) _ Two men believed to be Chinese spies
who had detailed information on the Dalai Lama's security
arrangements have been arrested at the seat of the Tibetan leader's
government-in-exile in northern India, police said Wednesday.
	   The men, identified only by their first names as Chomphil, 29,
and Migmar, 30, were arrested late Tuesday with maps, sketches and
other documents related to the multilayered security ring thrown
around the Dalai Lama by Indian forces, Superintendent of Police
K.C. Sadyal said by telephone from Kangra town in northern Himachal
Pradesh state.
	   Chomphil was arrested near the residence of the Dalai Lama, and
Migmar was detained elsewhere in Dharmsala, a Himachal Pradesh town
300 miles (480 kilometers) north of New Delhi. Dharmsala has been
the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile since the Dalai Lama
fled from Tibet in 1959 after an abortive anti-China uprising.
	   Sadyal said Chomphil had sketches of an area closed to tourists
and pilgrims where the Dalai Lama lives.
	   Police said the two arrested men could be followers of Dorje
Shugden, a Tibetan deity whose worship was banned by the Dalai Lama
in 1996. Tibetan officials have indicated that the Dalai Lama
believes the spirit of Dorje Shugden is working against him,
hampering his goal of winning autonomy for Tibet from China.
	   Sadyal said Chomphil, who has received training from the Chinese
Army, arrived in Dharmsala disguised as a Tibetan refugee and was
under police surveillance for weeks following intelligence reports
about him.
	   Indian police tightened the Dalai Lama's security earlier this
year after receiving intelligence reports that attempts could be
made on his life by rivals within the Tibetan community trained in
China, a police source said on condition of anonymity. The Tibetan
leader's security is similar to that afforded an Indian cabinet
minister.

FIFA officials believe 2002 World Cup cannot be rescheduled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to add overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body FIFA has said it
feels the next World Cup cannot be rescheduled to avoid bad weather
in host countries South Korea and Japan.
	   However, officials have asked both nations to investigate past
weather in the region between May and September to allow FIFA's
executive committee to make a final decision at a meeting on
September 24/25.
	   South Korean officials suggested earlier this year that the
competition should start in May 2002 to avoid the traditional rainy
season.
	   But FIFA's planning group said at a meeting Tuesday that the
dates for the event cannot be changed because June and July are
traditionally reserved for the World Cup.
	   The quadrennial, month-long competition traditionally has
started around June 10, after the professional soccer season in
Europe and South America ends in April.
	   ``Any change of timing would severely disrupt soccer operations
around the world,'' a press release from FIFA said.
	   The host countries' organizing committees have been asked to
report the results back to FIFA within a week.
	   Meanwhile, FIFA said it has decided ticketing revenue from the
World Cup, soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia, will go
entirely to the host countries.
	   The move is an attempt by FIFA to avoid the controversy which
surrounded ticketing arrangements at this year's World Cup in
France. France had to give up a part of the proceeds, which was
why, under FIFA rules, French fans were given first call on half
the tickets, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said during his campaign
for the presidency in May.
	   Participating nations close to France argued the French ticket
distribution unfairly favored domestic supporters. They complained
bitterly that their fans weren't allocated enough tickets.

Deadline for claim of abandoned apartments extended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
mediator has extended the deadline for refugees to reclaim their
property in the Muslim-Croat federation, officials said Wednesday.
	   The former deadline for refigees to reclaim abandoned houses and
apartments in the federation was Oct. 4. But Carlos Westendorp
decided to extend the period until April 4, because of continuing
oproblems faced by refugees.
	   Westendorp informed the federal prime minister, Edhem Bicakcic,
of his decision in a letter Thursday.
	   ``I must register my continuing concerns about the substantial
obstacles'' in the process, Westendorp said in the letter, obtained
by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Westendorp said that many municipal authorities across the
federation are reacting slowly or misinforming refugees who try to
reclaim their pre-war property.
	   Late Tuesday, Bicakcic responded to Westendorp with a public
letter, claiming there were no obstacles in the process. In his
letter, Bicakcic told Westendorp that his decision is ``stretching
his authority'' in Bosnia.
	   Western powers gave Westendorp authority to impose almost a
protectorate in Bosnia. He can impose laws and remove officials.

Indonesian attorney general to head team to question Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES extraneous `made' in lead &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Suharto Son

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general plans to
question ex-President Suharto over claims that the former leader's
family used corruption to make a fortune during his 32 years in
power.
	   Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib told reporters Wednesday
he would head a three-member team to meet Suharto soon.
	   He gave no date or venue for the questioning, which is also to
cover allegations that Suharto stashed millions of dollars overseas
before he quit office five months ago.
	   ``We will meet the (former) president very soon and will
investigate everything in connection with Suharto's assets and bank
accounts,'' he said.
	   He said the team would also include National Police Chief Lt.
Gen. Rusmanhadi along with a senior government finance official
Soedarjanto.
	   In a recent and rare television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied
allegations that he had squirreled millions of dollars overseas
during his three decades in office while his six children built
huge business empires under his unchallenged patronage.
	   The claim has been greeted with disbelief in the local media and
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Soon after replacing Suharto in May, President B.J. Habibie
ordered an official investigation into corruption under the
previous regime.
	   But critics have said Habibie, a longtime friend and subordinate
of Suharto, hadn't done enough to hold his old mentor accountable
for corruption that contributed to Indonesia's financial mess.
	   Suharto quit the presidency in May after a wave of riots and
protests against his authoritarian rule and economic hardship
resulted in 1,200 deaths and thousands of buildings damaged and
burned.
	   In a new wave of demonstrations over the past two weeks,
thousands of students have demanded the ex-president be put on
trial and that Habibie also resign.
	   On Tuesday a close adviser to Habibie, Arnold Baramuli said the
investigators would meet Suharto within the next ``one or two
days.''
	   In another development Justice Minister Muladi has said Bambang
Trihatmodjo, the billionaire second son of Suharto, had been banned
from leaving the country as police prepare to question him and
others over the collapse of a bank party owned by him.
	   Police are currently investigating possible banking law
violations by 21 banks that have failed during the current economic
turmoil.
	   Bambang has denied any wrongdoing.

Ruble unstable as Russians await economic crisis plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 7-8 with Yeltsin speaking to Helmut Kohl. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five days after his confirmation, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was still cautiously assembling a new Cabinet on
Wednesday as the Russian currency displayed new signs of weakness.
	   Primakov was approved last Friday, but has yet to provide
details on how he hopes to end Russia's economic crisis, regarded
as the worst since the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
	   Primakov has spoken only in broad terms, saying he is committed
to economic reform. He has moved carefully in putting together a
new Cabinet, offering posts to a wide range of political and
economic factions, including the Communist Party.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency again appeared unstable. The ruble
had been regaining strength in recent days as banks pushed for a
better rate before they paid off hard currency debts to foreigners.
The ruble reached about 7.5 to the dollar early Tuesday _ only
slightly off its rate a month ago, when the crisis hit.
	   But the ruble then reversed course Tuesday afternoon and was
down to about 11-12 to the dollar in street trading Wednesday
morning.
	   The currency swings reflect the jittery nature of the Russian
economy and concerns that the new government will resort to
printing more money to pay off billions of rubles (dollars) in back
wages, a move that could lead to hyperinflation. Inflation was 36
percent in the first week of September.
	   In another development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke by
phone with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl about the crisis in
Russia. The Russian leader told Kohl that the economic situation in
Russia was getting better, Interfax reported.
	   Yeltsin has made few appearances during the crisis and has not
said specifically what should be done, aside from general
pronouncement encouraging reforms.
	   Primakov's economic team remains incomplete and a lack of stated
policies has made it difficult to assess his aims. Russian liberals
and media have been critical of the new government, saying it will
represent a retreat from free-market programs.
	   The head of the centrist Our Home Is Russia parliament faction,
Alexander Shokhin, was named deputy prime minister in charge of
financial issues. He said another pro-reform member of his faction,
Georgy Boos, had been appointed head of the State Tax Service,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The position had been held by a top reformer in the previous
government, Boris Fyodorov, who was highly respected by the Western
investment community.
	   The prime minister met Tuesday with a delegation of officials
from the International Monetary Fund, including the IMF's top
official for Russia, John Odling Smee.
	   The Russian side ``stressed the new government's firm commitment
to the policy of market reforms, but pointed out the need for some
changes in the ways of their implementation to ensure sustainable
economic growth and to take into account all the social aspects of
the reforms.''
	   Primakov also stressed that Russia was committed to paying the
billions of dollars in debt it owes to foreign banks and
institutions, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Still, there have been indications that the government intends
to play a stronger role in the economy.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko on Tuesday called for
a return to the Soviet-era practice of requiring exporters to turn
in all of their hard-currency earnings to the government.
	   The measure ``is long overdue,'' Gerashchenko said. ``That
should have been done last year,'' he said.
	   Gerashchenko also said he supported printing more money to pay
off many months' backlog of wages.
	   ``We can't do without that,'' he said.
	   However, he did not say if the increase in the money supply
would be underpinned by the Central Bank's hard currency reserves.
If the bank simply prints money that is not backed by assets, this
would erode the value of the ruble and could lead to
hyperinflation.
	   No decision on increasing the money supply will be made until
the Central Bank's new board of directors is in place, Gerashchenko
said. The board is scheduled to come up for a confirmation vote in
parliament Wednesday.

Dollar rises against yen, Japanese stocks close mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WRAPS up with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Signs that the United States will not lower
interest rates to protect its economy from the global financial
crisis boosted the U.S. dollar against the yen Wednesday. Japanese
stock prices closed mixed.
	   The dollar bought 134.92 yen in late afternoon trading, up 2.34
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 133.90 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national
holiday.
	   The dollar also benefited from an overnight rise on Wall Street,
traders said.
	   Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich, speaking at a global
economic conference in Pittsburgh, said on Tuesday that inflation
was a greater threat to the U.S. economy than deflation, a
statement interpreted to mean the United States was less likely to
cut interest rates.
	   That view contradicted the impression held by financial markets
that the Federal Reserve was prepared to cut interest rates if it
would help the economy overcome the negative effects of Asia's
spreading financial crisis.
	   Lower interest rates make a nation's currency less attractive to
investors.
	   Sentiment was also growing among investors that the dollar's
long downward trend of more than 15 yen over the past several weeks
may finally be over, traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 133.85 yen and 134.10 yen in
Wednesday's trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices erased early gains to
close mixed as general pessimism about Japan's economy offset
bullish factors, including expectations that an agreement on
banking reform would soon be reached in Parliament.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 29.67
points, 0.21 percent, to finish the session at 14,274.38. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed up 310.39 points, or 2.23 percent.
	   ``The market's inability to rise despite an array of positive
factors illustrates the weakness of the underlying economy,'' said
Kenji Karikomi of Daiwa Securities.
	   Traders had been encouraged in the morning by reports the
government is ready to accept opposition demands for a temporary
nationalization of ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in return
for support on bills to clean up the banking system. Shares were
also supported by the overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   But later Wednesday, Japan's economic planning chief, Taichi
Sakaiya, warned that the Japanese economy could shrink 2 percent in
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   And bank shares, which were higher for most of Wednesday, were
dragged down by reports the Union Bank of Switzerland would
dissolve its business alliance with LTCB.
	   LTCB's shares sank as low as 26 yen (20 U.S. cents) in afternoon
after the reports its alliance with UBS was in trouble.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,087.50. On
Monday, the TOPIX closed up 12.68 points, or 1.18 percent.
	   An estimated 385 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 363.29 million shares
Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 578 to 535, while
162 issues were unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.775 percent up from 0.755 on Monday,
driving its price up to 114.92 from 114.76 yen.

Bangladesh seeks dlrs 330 million in aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh has asked for another dlrs
130 million in emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund
to help alleviate food shortages caused by devastating monsoon
floods, officials said.
	   Bangladesh needs 2 million tons of food grains to supplement a
domestic stock of 700,000 tons, planning ministry officials said.
	   The government initially asked for dlrs 200 million from the
World Bank. It requested another dlrs 130 million from the IMF to
improve the balance-of-payment position. Bangladesh's foreign
exchange reserves are around dlrs 1.3 billion.
	   Finance Secretary Akbar Ali Khan is currently in Washington
meeting officials of the two lending agencies.
	   The Bangladeshi government also has issued an international
appeal for relief worth dlrs 880 million, including dlrs 112
million in food.
	   The flood situation improved considerably Wednesday with the
water level receding in major rivers. But the drainage of flood
water from Dhaka, the capital city of 9 million people, was slow
because drains were clogging by plastic bags.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development announced an
additional dlrs 6.5 million aid to help 250,000 flood victims. This
raises the total U.S. food assistance to dlrs 71 million.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ General Motors Corp. is strengthening its ties with
Suzuki Motor Corp., a move that will include tripling GM's stake in
Suzuki to about 10 percent from 3.3 percent.
	   The agreement, announced Wednesday, calls for the two automakers
to increase coordination of their global manufacturing operations.
	   It assigns Suzuki primary responsibility for the design and
development of small and ``mini'' passenger vehicles, particularly
in Asia. U.S.-based GM will be responsible for midsize and large
passenger vehicles.
	   The two companies also agreed to exchange information regarding
advanced technology in areas such as alternative fuels and
intelligent vehicles.
	   Suzuki is the largest producer of minicars in Japan and one of
the world's leading manufacturers of motorcycles.
	   Suzuki and GM operate a joint venture in Canada, which produces
small vehicles for North America. They have also agreed to jointly
develop compact cars for sale in Europe.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economic planning chief warned Wednesday
that the economy could shrink by considerably more than 1 percent
in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999.
	   ``I think it is quite possible that (GDP) could well exceed
minus 1 percent,'' Economic Planning Agency Director General Taichi
Sakaiya said in Parliament, adding added that a contraction of 2
percent was possible.
	   Sakaiya said that in order for Japan to avoid a GDP contraction
for fiscal 1998, the economy would have to grow by about 5 percent
in the third quarter. He said that figure ``would be very
difficult, given the current situation.''
	   Japan is in the grip of its worst recession in decades and
government efforts to stimulate the economy with tax cuts and
public spending have so far done little to lift the country's
gloomy outlook.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Sakaiya cautioned against the danger of
delaying the passage in Parliament of banking bills to clean up
Japan's tottering financial system.
	   Sakaiya said that further delay in approving the bills ``could
raise the costs to society,'' causing more bankruptcies and higher
unemployment.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said Tuesday that the bad loans in the country's
banking system remain manageable.
	   ``There is a crisis and our banks are being affected - that
can't be denied.'' Singson said in a television interview. Still,
he added, the damage has so far been ``minimal'' compared to other
countries in the region.
	   Latest data show the ratio of non-performing loans among all
Philippine banks averaged 9.7 percent in June, down from 10.4
percent in the previous month.
	   The ratio for the commercial banking system, which includes
universal banks but not thrift and savings institutions, was 8.94
percent in June, down from 9.44 percent in May.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Eva Airways Corp. has decided to cancel
plans to purchase some Airbus Industrie passenger planes due to a
slump in the Asian airline industry, an official at the Taiwanese
airliner said Wednesday.
	   ``It's not the right time to buy planes. The airline industry
isn't good now,'' K.W. Nieh, EVA's senior deputy vice president,
said.
	   Last year, EVA signed a letter of intent with Airbus to buy 12
A340-500 or A340-600 planes.
	   Taiwan's airline industry is suffering one of its worst years,
due to both a slump in tourism amid the Asian financial turmoil and
a February crash at its biggest carrier, China Airlines, which
killed all on the board - including Taiwan's central bank governor.
	   EVA Airways said Tuesday that it will expand its code-sharing
relationship with Ansett Australia and Air New Zealand to make
better use of air carriers and reduce operating costs.
	   The code-sharing expansion comes after EVA announced Monday
pre-tax losses of NT dlrs 584 million (dlrs 17 million) in the
first half of this year.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Korea Industrial Development Co., a
unit of South Korea's leading conglomerate Hyundai Group, said
Wednesday it will merge with furniture maker Hyundai Livart Co. as
of Dec. 31.
	   Under the merger, investors holding one share of Hyundai Livart
will receive 0.10571 of Korea Industrial Development stock, the
construction company said.
	   A meeting of shareholders will be held on Oct. 28 for the
approval of the merger.
	   In June, the Financial Supervisory Commission deemed Hyundai
Livart, along with 54 other companies, to be non-viable.
	   Stocks of Korea Industrial Development lost 50 won (3.6 cents)
to close at 5,050 won (dlrs 3.7) on volume of 1,570 shares.
	   Those of Hyundai Livart rose by the day's limit high of 60 won
(4.4 cents) to end at 595 won (43 cents) on 93,060 stocks.

Moscow mayor introduces price controls on staple foods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With the ruble losing value once again, Moscow's
mayor has imposed price controls on some staple goods in the
capital.
	   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov decreed Tuesday that city retailers may not
mark up basic products such as sugar, matches, salt, soap, or eggs
by more than 20 percent.
	   Moscow is already one of the world's most expensive cities, and
the latest crisis has seen prices on some basic goods double and
triple.
	   Authorities will impose the controls on a case-by-case basis,
and other goods, such as luxury items and imports, will not be
affected, said the deputy head of Moscow's consumer department,
Svetlana Korolyova, according to the Moscow Times newspaper.
	   ``We do understand what a free market economy is, so the measure
is only temporary and is aimed to calm the situation down,'' she
told the paper.
	   Korovlyova said any retailers found deliberately boosting prices
could be punished with fines.
	   Other regions around Russia have taken similar steps as the
nation's economic crisis has unleashed inflationary pressures.
	   Prices had been rising less than 1 percent a month, but they
soared 15 percent in August and 36 percent in the first week of
September.

Official: Taiwan should not be admitted to WTO before China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong supported Taiwan's application for
the World Trade Organization, but the island's accession should not
come ahead of mainland China's, a top Hong Kong official said
Wednesday.
	   In a written reply to a legislator's question, Regina Ip,
secretary for security, said ``Hong Kong has long supported Chinese
Taipei's application.''
	   But the territory, a founding member of the WTO, would abide to
an understanding that China's accession should come before that of
Taiwan, Ip wrote.
	   She was referring to an understanding reached in 1992 by the
general council of the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. A government spokeswoman elaborated that the
understanding had extended to the WTO.
	   Ip added the timing of Taiwan's accession ``hinges on the
progress of the overall negotiation and examination process
necessary for'' its entry.
	   Ip's declaration was in line with that stance of China, which
regained Hong Kong's sovereignty in July 1997.
	   Although economic relations between the two sides have warmed up
considerably, China _ which views Taiwan as a renegade province _
has said the island must not be admitted to the WTO ahead of it.
	   Relations across the Taiwan Strait have often been hostile since
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a civil
war to Mao Tse-tung's Communists in 1949.
	   Earlier this month, Taiwan and the United States signed a
bilateral agreement for the island's accession to the trade
organization. To date, the island has signed trade agreements with
23 out of the 26 organization members that requested bilateral
talks.
	   Hong Kong, Canada and the European Union still need to sign with
Taiwan.
	   Taiwan has successfully negotiated with all members that
objected to its bid to join the 132-member trade body. Taiwanese
officials said they hope to enter the WTO early next year, but much
depends on China's attitude.
	   The WTO is the main international body governing global trade
relations and setting fair trade rules. There is general agreement
China should join the organization and be bound by its
responsibilities, but no agreement yet on the price for this.
	   Beijing wants to enter as a developing country, meaning it would
have to take only gradual measures to cut barriers to imports of
goods and services.
	   The United States, which has a big trade deficit with China,
says the entry terms should be tougher as the Chinese economy is
already well developed.

Share prices higher on massive buying of China-backed stocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices closed higher Wednesday for the
third consecutive session, buoyed by massive buying of China-backed
stocks and domestic interbank interest rates, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index surged 1.6 percent, or 127.21
points, to 7,860.68, adding to Tuesday's 0.9-percent rise.
	   Volume was a thin 4.98 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 638
million), slightly lower than the Tuesday's 5.55 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 712 million).
	   China-backed shares accounted for over 35 percent of the
turnover as investors raked in these shares amid persistant rumors
of an interest rate cut in China and signs of favorable economic
growth since the floods have ended, said Alex Tang, associate
director at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   But Howard Gorges, director of South China Brokerage, said
nevertheless, that ``trading remains thin as investors are
cautious,'' following recent moves by the government to tighten
regulations governing market activities.
	   Several of the government's new measures have prompted
speculation that market activity will be drawn away from the
territory.
	   Traders also said recent action of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, the territory's de facto central bank, to assure
adequate liquidity in the banking system has helped to ease
interbank rates, which helped drive up the market.
	   The overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate is quoted at 9.00
percent, up from 7.25 percent late Tuesday but down from 9.25
percent earlier in the session.
	   The benchmark three-month rate is quoted at 10.0 percent, down
slightly from 10.25 percent Tuesday.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holding rebounded after several sessions
of losses, ending 1.0 Hong Kong dollar higher at 148.0. Its
affiliate, Hang Seng Bank, rose 0.4 to 47.30.
	   Leading Hong Kong developer Cheung Kong Holdings rose 0.8 to
34.40, despite news that the developer will sell the first batch of
units in a new luxury residential project at a loss. Its rival Sun
Kung Kai Properties gained 0.10 to 26.30.

President Kumaratunga removes police officer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ President Chandrika Kumaratunga has
transferred a top police detective in hopes of quelling and
increasingly contentious fight between the judiciary and the
police, officials said Wednesday.
	   Kumaratunga removed Bandula Wickremasinghe as head of the
Criminal Investigations Department on Tuesday following weeklong
demonstrations by hundreds of attorneys protesting the arrest last
week of a judge who was critical of police and the government.
	   The attorneys blamed Wickremasinghe for the arrest last week of
Mahanama Tillekeratne, a judge of Colombo's High Court. He was
later released on bail.
	   Tillekeratne surrendered to authorities after police said he
tried to murder a neighbor. Tillekeratne denied the allegation.
	   The magistrate released him on bail after he signed a 1,500
rupee (dlrs 22.75) bond.
	   A few hours later, 30 policemen, led by Wickremasinghe, reached
the judge's house and arrested him, despite being shown documents
that the arrest warrant had been revoked.
	   The judge spent the night at police headquarters. He was
released on bail the next day by another magistrate.
	   The protesting judges and lawyers said the original complaint
against Tillekeratne filed on June 1 alleged that his son had
beaten up the neighbor, a military sergeant.
	   But three months later, the sergeant changed his statement and
said that during a scuffle the judge had shot at him but missed.
Judges in Sri Lanka were provided revolvers for personal security.
	   The Bar Association of Sri Lanka and some ruling party lawmakers
condemned the arrest. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jeyraj
Fernandopulle called it ``a despicable act.''

Deadline for claim of abandoned apartments extended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
mediator has extended the deadline for refugees to reclaim their
property in the Muslim-Croat federation, officials said Wednesday.
	   The former deadline for refigees to reclaim abandoned houses and
apartments in the federation was Oct. 4. But Carlos Westendorp
decided to extend the period until April 4, 1999 because of
continuing of problems faced by refugees.
	   Westendorp informed the federal prime minister, Edhem Bicakcic,
of his decision in a letter Thursday.
	   ``I must register my continuing concerns about the substantial
obstacles'' in the process, Westendorp said in the letter, obtained
by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Westendorp said that many municipal authorities across the
federation are reacting slowly or misinforming refugees who try to
reclaim their pre-war property.
	   Late Tuesday, Bicakcic responded to Westendorp with a public
letter, claiming there were no obstacles in the process. In his
letter, Bicakcic told Westendorp that his decision is ``stretching
his authority'' in Bosnia.
	   Western powers gave Westendorp authority to impose almost a
protectorate in Bosnia. He can impose laws and remove officials.

Kidnappers demand ransom for Taiwanese family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers have demanded 5 million
pesos (dlrs 116,000) for the release of four people, including
three members of a Taiwanese family, seized in the southern
Philippines seven days ago, police said Wednesday.
	   Police said the unidentified kidnappers claimed they were
holding Wang Tau Chu Yang, 80, her daughter-in-law, a granddaughter
and a Filipino maid and were asking a ransom for their freedom. The
four were kidnapped in Guiwan village, just outside Zamboanga, on
Sept. 9.
	   Relatives of the Yang family, who own a chain of resorts and
hotels in Zamboanga, said they have been trying to negotiate with
the kidnappers but did not elaborate.
	   The Yangs are among several groups of people kidnapped in the
southern Philippines since last week. Also among those kidnapped
was an Italian priest, Luciano Benedetti.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was abducted Sept. 8 from a
church in the remote village of Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte
province, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos were later
freed unharmed in nearby Siraway.
	   On the same day, three Chinese businessmen from Hong Kong were
seized and forced into a boat by armed men in Sitangkai in the
southernmost island province of Tawi-Tawi.
	   While police and military troops continued efforts to rescue the
victims, a Filipino businessman was abducted Tuesday in Zamboanga
city by suspected Muslim rebels wearing police uniforms.
	   Because of the kidnappings, President Joseph Estrada is
considering a suspension of peace talks with the country's largest
Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
	   The military has said it suspects Muslim rebels were involved in
the kidnappings. But Estrada spokesmen said the government is not
blaming the MILF.
	   The MILF is one of two Muslim rebel groups fighting the
government to establish an independent Islamic state in the
southern region of Mindanao. Although the rebels engage in
on-and-off talks with officials, they have continued sporadic
attacks on civilian and government targets.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Flooding and torrential rains in northern
and central Sudan have driven 30,000 people from their homes and
left 25 people dead, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Col. Wagie Alla el-Tayeb, a government civil defense official,
was quoted in the daily Akhbar al-Sa'a as saying 455 villages have
been wiped out by the Nile River flooding in recent days.
	   Other dailies quoted health officials as saying pools of
stagnant water from the floods were causing serious problems with
disease. One report said cases of malaria have increased by 26
percent in Khartoum hospitals.
	   El-Tayed said the floods have destroyed 32 million acres of
crops and killed 400 cattle, Akhbar al-Sa'a reported. It quoted him
as saying about 325 schools and government buildings had been
destroyed.
	   Sudanese officials have expressed fears this year's Nile flood
could be the worst ever. River levels have gone above the worst
floods in 1988, which caused dlrs 300 million in damage.
	   This year's flood already has caused 40 billion Sudanese pounds
(dlrs 19 million) in damage to homes and farms. Last week officials
reported 200,000 people driven from their homes in eight states.
	   Wednesday's news reports said the flooding had spread to 12
states, including the capital Khartoum.

Wakanohana keeps sole lead at 4-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana narrowly beat
lower ranked Asahiyutaka and grabbed the sole lead with four
victories against no defeats Wednesday, the fourth day of the
15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   One victory behind Wakanohana at 3-1 are 11 wrestlers, including
two yokozunas Takanohana and Hawaiian-born Akebono, ozeki
(champion) Musashimaru, also from Hawaii, and sekiwake (junior
champion) Chiyotaikai.
	   Wrestling at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena, Wakanohana
averted No. 3 maegashira Asahiyutaka's driving attempts at the
ring's edge and twisted him down, leaving Asahiyutaka at 2-2.
	   In the day's final bout, Takanohana charged No. 2 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Kotonowaka with a leg trick and forced him out.
Kotonowaka is 2-2.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, attacked winless No. 2 maegashira
Minatofuji with a series of hand thrusts and pushed him down.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, bulldozed Chiyotaikai out.
	   In other major bouts, No. 1 maegashira Kaio charged Takanonami
with pushes against his throat, toppling him. Both Kaio and
Takanonami are 2-2.
	   No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
charged komusubi (junior champion second class) Musoyama and tried
to drive him out.
	   But Musoyama slapped him down for his second victory against two
defeats. Kyokushuzan is 1-3.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, was pushed out by No. 8-ranked Chiyotenzan (4-0) for his
second defeat against two victories.
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
sent out by No. 9-ranked Tomonohana (3-1) for his third defeat
against one victory.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma,
or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from Sao Paulo, was toppled down by No.
44-ranked Konoryu for his first defeat against one victory.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori from Sao Paulo, thrust down
No. 4-ranked Tenichi and remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Board and Australian players' union agree to terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and
an association representing its top players have resolved a pay
dispute that had threatened to disrupt international matches.
	   The ACB said Wednesday that it and the Australian Cricketers
Association signed a three-year memorandum of understanding Tuesday
detailing player remuneration and formalizing the working
relationship between the organizations.
	   The ACB will contribute 250,000 Australian dollars (150,000 US
dlrs) annually to the players' association.
	   The association will get 20 percent of cricket revenue up to a
certain amount, and 25 percent of any extra income. The first year
is expected to earn the association about 13 million Australian
dollars (7.8 million US dlrs).
	   The ACB has 20 players contracted but will expand that to at
least 25 because of the new policy of picking separate test and
limited-overs sides.
	   It has been more than a year since former ACB chief executive
and sports management consultant James Erskine first flew to
England to brief the Australian players on their log of claims.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at the Commonwealth Games,
limited-overs captain Steve Waugh said he was relieved to see the
end of the dispute.
	   ``It's a relief for everyone, we can just get on with playing
cricket now,'' Waugh said.
	   ``It's had its time and been resolved so it's great we can get
back on with playing cricket and they (the ACB) can get back on
with running the game. Everybody is happy with that.'' (djp)

Lesotho protesters block Parliament over vote fraud charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) - The government of this tiny, mountain
kingdom on Wednesday appeared increasingly helpless in the face of
unrest over charges of fraud in the May elections, reports said.
	   Youths blocked the entrances to Parliament, preventing Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, cabinet ministers and government
officials from gaining gain entry to their offices, South African
Press Association said.
	   Many civil servants also stayed away from work, Sapa said.
	   Opposition party demonstrators took to the streets for a second
day, demanding the release of a report into the alleged fraud.
	   The said their intention was to make the Mosisili administration
ungovernable because it was in power illegally.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe were called on to mediate
the election dispute, and produced the report. An aide to South
Africa's deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, told Sapa on Wednesday that
officials were working out the logistics of releasing the report.
He did not say when it would come out.
	   In a new turn Tuesday, soldiers came to the aid of young
opposition party supporters who took to the streets and seized
government vehicles, police said. Police and the military have been
subject to tensions in the past.
	   In an apparently unrelated matter, the defense chief was forced
to step down last week by mutinous officers, and his successor, Lt.
Gen. Anthony Thibedi, appeared not to be in control of the army,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Opposition supporters have been protesting for weeks about
election results.
	   Lesotho, a country of 2 million people located within the
borders of South Africa, has a history of political upheaval and
coups.

Fighting in Kosovo extends to previously unharmed north

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded 12
villages in the north of Kosovo Wednesday, bringing the crackdown
on ethnic Albanian rebels to a previously calm area of the
strife-torn province, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   ``We see this as a tendency for Serb offensive operations to
extend further north,'' said Muhamet Hamiti, a spokesman for the
pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``This means more than half
of Kosovo has been directly affected by the Serb offensive of the
last seven months.''
	   No statement from Serb forces was immediately available and the
reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Hamiti said Serb police and the Yugoslav army started at dawn
Wednesday shelling villages about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian
politicians in the area saw smoke billowing from three villages
Wednesday, he said.
	   The fighting in the region, close to the Stari Trg mine, began
Tuesday when an ethnic Albanian father and son were killed, said
Hamiti. Serb sources reported four Serb policemen were injured in
fighting near the mine Wednesday.
	   Late Monday and early Tuesday, Serb and Yugoslav security forces
ousted the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army from villages in the
Drenica region of western Kosovo, considered the KLA's last major
holdout in Kosovo.
	   According to a fighter near Cirez, four guerrillas were killed
in the action early Tuesday. No reports of Serb casualties were
immediately available.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominate republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Tuesday's attacks sent hundreds of Albanian refugees fleeing to
Cirez, where they joined about 10,000 to 15,000 people have been
taking refuge for more than a month.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people forced to
flee the fighting in Kosovo won't make it through the harsh winter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from 40
percent, to all but a few patches, mostly in the mountains. The
Serb offensives that started on Feb. 28, fighting has concentrated
mostly in the east and west of Kosovo.

Dennis Ross meets Crown Prince on peace process

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross met with
Crown Prince Hassan on Wednesday and discussed efforts to restart
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
	   Ross flew by helicopter from Jerusalem to Marka air base in
Amman's suburbs, where he was escorted to the meeting with Hassan,
who is acting as regent while King Hussein is receiving cancer
treatment in the United States.
	   He did not make an arrival statement.
	   Officials said Ross would brief Hassan on his efforts to restart
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which broke down for the second
time in January when Israel rejected a U.S. proposal calling for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from a further 13.1 percent of the West
Bank.
	   A week into his Mideast mission, Ross gave little sign Tuesday
that the Palestinians and Israel were any closer to an accord.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
eager for a swift Palestinian-Israeli settlement to ease opposition
among its predominantly Palestinian population to its own peace
treaty with its neighbor.

South Africa squeak through to finals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with South African innings, result &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A gritty 35-run partnership by
tailenders helped South Africa overcome Sri Lanka and squeak
through to the finals of the Commonwealth Games cricket tournament
Wednesday.
	   Chasing a target of 131, South Africa was struggling at 96 for
nine on a turning pitch when Nicky Boje and Alan Dawson saved the
day, pulling out a one-wicket victory.
	   In a game that see-sawed until the final moments, Boje made 20
while Dawson made 15 runs as the team touched 131 for nine in 47
overs.
	   Boje was clearly the hero of the day, having also claimed four
wickets for 16.
	   In the gold medal game, scheduled Saturday, South Africa plays
the winner of Thursday's semifinal between Australia and New
Zealand.
	   With Sri Lanka playing without its stars and with skipper Hashan
Tillekaratne the only Test player on the side, the team's spinners
put up tough resistance and dominated the match until Dawson and
Boey came in.
	   ``We did not play to our potential,'' said Tillekaratne.
	   South Africa got off to a good start, scoring four runs an over,
and at one stage in the 5th, Mark Rindell was getting a run a ball.
	   But off-spinner Tilan Samaraweera began an onslaught with Andrew
Hudson's wicket. Hudson, attempting to hit to the on-side, had his
off-stump uprooted.
	   Derek Crookes began with a flourish, but was carried away into
charging into a shot, only to be stumped by Lanka De Silva with the
score at 38.
	   After that, wickets fell in quick succession. Rindle (25) was
run out after a mix-up with Jacques Kallis and Upul Chandana's
throw hit wicket.
	   And then Kallis was run out for 10 with the scoreboard reading
61 for five.
	   Skipper Shaun Pollock appeared to be stabilizing the innings but
was gone for seven having faced 33 balls. He was caught at
midwicket by a diving Russel Arnold off Malinda Warnapura.
	   Warnapura, using the turn to the fullest, struck again soon,
dismissing Mark Boucher with the score at 93 for eight in the 34th
over.
	   Steve Elworthy fell to a controversial stumping decision when
third umpire Javed Akhtar judged that his foot wasn't grounded
behind the crease when De Silva threw the bails off.
	   Earlier, South African spinners Boje and Derek Crookes
devastated Sri Lanka's middle order.
	   Despite a valiant 53 by opener Avishka Gunawardene, who boosted
the score to 99 before being stumped by Mark Boucher off Crookes,
Sri Lanka slumped to 130 all out with six overs to spare.
	   Aided by a turning pitch and 95 percent humidity, Boje took the
key wicket of skipper Hashan Tillekarantne (20) and struck three
times in quick succession to dismiss Indika de Saram, Upul Chandana
and Malinda Warnapura.
	   He conceded just 16 runs in nine overs.
	   Off-spinner Crookes took two wickets for 17 runs in his allotted
10 overs.
	   Gunawardene, who starred against Jamaica with a century at the
same PKNS stadium, scored his 53 in 111 minutes off 86 balls.
	   Specialist batsman de Silva was run out for seven, Russel Arnold
was bowled by Pollock for four and M. Jayawardene was also caught
by Pollock off Jacques Kallis for a duck.
	   But still Sri Lanka was cruising along at four runs an over.
	   The run rate dropped and batting caved in after Tillekaratne's
bails flipped in the 32nd over while he was attempting to hit Boje.
He scored 20 runs in 45 balls.
	   After that, none of the Lankans, sent in to bat after Pollock
won the toss, could settle down to the spin attack from both ends.

Paper says Kuwait trying to stop charity money reaching terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government is taking steps to ensure that
donations collected by Kuwaiti Islamic charities are not used to
finance terrorism, the daily Al-Watan said Monday.
	   News reports in the United States alleged last month that some
of these charities had links with terrorists responsible for the
Aug. 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed more than 250 people.
	   A meeting between state officials and representatives of Kuwaiti
charity organizations that operate locally and abroad is scheduled
for the beginning of November, the daily quoted a well-informed
source as saying.
	   Al-Watan, which is close to fundamental organizations, did not
identify the source.
	   The purpose of the meeting will be to ``reach a common work plan
... that would prevent any charity money (collected by) Islamic
committees in Kuwait from being used'' in terrorism that Kuwait
strongly denounces, the paper said.
	   Kuwaiti officials have not confirmed the American accusations,
but the crown prince of this oil-rich state, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, has said Kuwait was cooperating with Washington to fight
terrorism.
	   Several charities run by Muslim fundamentalists are active in
Africa, Asia and eastern Europe.

Report: India, Pakistan exaggerated size, number of nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Both India and Pakistan exaggerated the size
and number of nuclear weapons they detonated in separate tests
earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
	   Quoting the findings of an independent study, the newspaper
reported that the two South Asian rivals overstated the power of
their atomic bombs by a factor of four.
	   In late May, Pakistan claimed it detonated six devices in
response to India's detonation of five nuclear devices two weeks
earlier. Both acts were condemned by nations around the world amid
fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in their
dispute over Kashmir, which is split between them.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   But two of the nuclear tests India claimed may not have taken
place at all and only two of the explosions Pakistan announced
actually involved atomic bombs, the Times reported.
	   ``This is quite clearly a case where governments tested for a
political reason rather than scientific reasons, so we have to be
suspicious of what they say,'' said Terry Wallace of the University
of Arizona, an expert on the use of seismology to analyze nuclear
explosions.
	   Wallace's study was published Wednesday in Seismological
Research Letters. His work, believed to be the first independent
scientific accounting of the tests, was based on seismic shock
waves released by the explosions.
	   Wallace concluded that India and Pakistan misled each other _
and the world _ about the tests conducted last spring.
	   ``Seismology provided a microscope into what happened and we
were able to learn a lot about these explosions,'' Wallace said.
``It has given us a reality check on government pronouncements.''

Eales to play 60th test match Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian captain John Eales reaches
another career landmark on Friday when he lines up against one of
the few established rugby union nations he has yet to play.
	   The second rower will become Australia's most capped forward
when he plays his 60th test in the Wallabies' opening rugby World
Cup Pacific qualifying match against Fiji at Parramatta Stadium in
west Sydney. Western Samoa plays Tonga in the other match Friday at
the same venue.
	   The 28-year-old Queenslander will eclipse the 59 tests set by
flanker Simon Poidevin, one of his 1991 World Cup final teammates.
	   ``When you start playing you don't really think about how many
tests you'll play, but obviously to eclipse someone like Poido's
record is a huge honor,'' Eales said Wednesday.
	   Three of Eales' other former teammates, winger David Campese
(101), five eighth Michael Lynagh (72) and halfback Nick Farr-Jones
(63) are the only Australians to have made more test appearances.
	   With the Australian Rugby Union planning at least 10 tests a
year, Eales could reach the century mark should his fitness hold
up.
	   ``I don't think that much about it, you just take it game to
game, season to season,'' Eales said.
	   Fiji represents a new opponent for Eales as it played the last
of its 15 tests against Australia 13 years ago.
	   Eales should add yet another country to his record in
Australia's second qualifier against Tonga, who Australia last
played in 1993 when Eales was injured.
	   Meanwhile, Fiji coach Brad Johnstone said the timing of the
four-nation round-robin tournament favored Australia, a claim that
was denied by Australian coach Rod Macqueen.
	   While the Australians have been playing and training together
for much of the last three months, Fiji, along with Tonga and
Western Samoa, have called back overseas players in the last few
days and spent little time together.
	   ``It's all in Australia's favor _ they timed it very nicely for
Australia and it certainly works against Samoa and Fiji,''
Johnstone said.
	   But Macqueen said Australia was not responsible for the timing
of the tournament.
	   ``We would have been very happy not to have this game at this
time,'' Macqueen said. ``From our point of view it's nothing to do
with the Australian Rugby Union, it's all to do with the
International Rugby Board.''
	   The bulk of the Fijian team arrived in Sydney on Wednesday
morning, with three members of the silver medal-winning
Commonwealth Games sevens team joining them in the afternoon.
	   Australia and Western Samoa are expected to take two of the
three direct qualifying spots for next year's World Cup, but
Johnstone took issue with the notion Fiji would have to fight it
out with Tonga for the third place.
	   ``I think we're competitive with both Samoa and Tonga. We beat
Samoa 60-0 two years ago and we haven't got any worries about
having a show against Samoa.'' (djp)

Opposition gives up tanks; leaders could be charged

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Berisha press conference; no pickup &QL;

 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, ex-President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the government from jail
if necessary if police try to arrest him.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,000 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting slogans against Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom they blame for the weekend assassination
of popular politician Azem Hajdari.
	   Chanting ``death to Fatos Nano,'' Berisha's supporters marched
off toward the city's main Skanderbeg Square for another rally.
Berisha urged them to demonstrate peacefully.
	   Hajdari's slaying Saturday touched off two days of rioting which
has plunged this impoverished Balkan nation into its second major
crisis in 18 months.
	   Late Tuesday, the government demanded that Berisha's followers
surrender their remaining arms by dawn Wednesday or face a
crackdown. The party responded to an earlier demand by handing over
a pair of tanks seized during riots Monday.
	   But Berisha's bodyguards brandished semi-automatic rifles inside
party headquarters Wednesday, hours after the latest deadline for
surrendering them had passed.
	   Parliament late Tuesday also ordered a criminal investigation of
Berisha and his top aides for allegedly trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha told the Wednesday press
conference. ``I'm prepared to continue my battle in any situation.
I will always be in the country alive or dead, in my house or
elsewhere.''
	   Outside party headquarters, Berisha's followers, listening to
his remarks from a loudspeaker, chanted ``Fatos Nano, you bastard.
You are Greek, not an Albanian.'' Berisha said his followers _ who
helped topple Albania's Communist regime in 1992 _ would oust the
``dictatorship of the terrorists,'' meaning Nano.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of nationwide unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that
struck Albania last year following the collapse of shady pyramid
schemes that cost many people their life's savings.
	   Berisha was president during the pyramid investment crisis and
elections in its aftermath led to his ouster from power and the
rise of Nano's Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also the widespread
disappointment with the government's inability to revive the
economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   But the government appears committed to standing firm against
Berisha's challenge. Late Tuesday, parliament also enacted a law
transferring military police and some commando units from control
of the army to the Interior Ministry.
	   The decision on military police and commandos means the
government could use them to maintain order without having to call
in the army. But members of Nano's own Socialist party criticized
the move, saying it resembled Berisha's decision to call in the
army during unrest when he was president last year.
	   In an attempt to ensure support among the police, Nano this week
increased their salaries by 50 to 100 percent, the state news
agency reported. The government also said it would give police a
one-time reward of 30,000 to 50,000 leke (dlrs 200 to 340) for
protecting state institutions during the rioting.
	   Before the increase, ordinary policemen earned about dlrs 65 a
month. Members of the elite special force received dlrs 400 a
month.

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ In a step towards easing Cambodia's
political turmoil, a top opposition leader said Wednesday his party
would not boycott the convening of a new parliament to protest
alleged election fraud.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh confirmed his followers would join the
legislature and drop the boycott threat as part of a pact between
the government and opposition struck on Monday.
	   The decision is a further move towards quelling tensions that
reached fever pitch over the past week with violent police
crackdowns on pro-opposition demonstrators in the capital.
	   ``We are now entering a new phase, a negotiation phase instead
of confrontation,'' Ranariddh told reporters.
	   Thousands of people had been marching daily in support of the
opposition's contention that strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party cheated in winning parliamentary elections held on July 26.
	   Opposition supporters heeded Ranariddh's call not to stage
demonstrations as the prince met Wednesday with King Norodom
Sihanouk _ his father _ in the northwestern province of Siem Reap
for their first face-to-face talk since before July's elections.
	   Ranariddh described the outcome of the 4 1/2-hour meeting as
``positive and satisfactory enough.''
	   ``But the way toward peace is still long,'' he said.
	   On Monday, the ruling party and its two main opposition rivals
reached a tentative three-point tension-easing agreement.
	   It called for the cessation of demonstrations, a summit meeting
of party leaders hosted by King Sihanouk, and the convening of the
National Assembly as scheduled on Sept. 24. No date was set for the
summit meeting.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of assembly seats in the July
polls, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a new government on
its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which won the remainder of the seats _ had said they
would boycott the assembly if their complaints about election fraud
were not investigated.
	   Hun Sen-appointed election bodies dismissed more than 800
election complaints submitted by the opposition, which is now
asking for just two major issues to be considered.
	   Ranariddh said Wednesday that his party would stick to its
demands for a reconciliation of spoiled and unused ballots and a
review of the formula to allocate parliamentary seats.
	   ``His Majesty the King advised us that the best way is to attend
the first session while keeping our reservations,'' said Ranariddh.
``We have to fight in another framework, which I fear is the
National Assembly. We will negotiate, attend the National Assembly
and continue the struggle.''
	   Ranariddh said the National Assembly would be convened by the
king at his palace in Siem Reap, and afterwards the members of
parliament would go to the famous Angkor Wat temple nearby to be
sworn in.
	   He said FUNCINPEC would also seek guarantees of safety for its
people and an investigation into those responsible for the recent
crackdown and arrests.
	   The opposition protesters, generally nonviolent, braved bullets
and beatings by baton-wielding riot police. Several fought back
with slingshots and stones.
	   At least four people were killed and more than 20 arrested in
the crackdown.
	   In recent days human rights workers have found the dumped bodies
of several people who apparently died violent deaths, raising the
question of whether other killings have been covered up.
	   The king's meeting with Ranariddh will be followed Thursday by
separate talks with the prince's opposition ally Sam Rainsy.

Arafat urges Arab support for creation of Palestinian state

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday urged Arab and Muslim leaders to support the formation of
a Palestinian state, saying he feared a military attack by Israel
if he declares statehood.
	   Arafat spoke to the opening session of an Arab League meeting
expected to take up Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's plea for Arabs
to ignore the U.N. flight ban on Libya as well as the growing
Turkish-Israel alliance seen as a threat by Arabs.
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa criticized Turkey's
military cooperation with Israel, saying it was an impediment to
regional peace.
	   Arafat told the gathering that the Palestinian leadership will
``conduct Arab and Islamic campaigns to gather needed support for a
Palestinian state.''
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said that it would go forward
with plans for a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next May if
Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, continues to
stall peace negotiations.
	   He noted Israel's intention to oppose such a move and charged
that ``The Israeli army has begun ... to get ready against this
subject and has already begun training to storm the Palestinian
territories.''
	   Earlier, Arafat met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak near
the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and later told reporters that
Israel must accept the U.S. peace initiative calling for the Jewish
state to withdraw its troops from 13 percent of the West Bank's
land.
	   Israel has balked, saying it needs more security guarantees from
the Palestinians. U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was in Jordan on Wednesday
briefing Crown Prince Hassan on his latest, unfruitful talks with
both sides.
	   Al-Sharaa warned about deepening Israeli-Turkish military
activities in remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting.
	   ``What the region needs is not setting up a coalition'' between
Turkey and Israel ``but having a just and comprehensive peace,''
al-Sharaa said.
	   This, he said, requires Israel to withdraw from all the
territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East War, including the
Golan Heights taken from Syria and the Palestinian-populated West
Bank.
	   The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation _ which includes joint
maneuvers, cooperation in training and Turkish upgrading of Israeli
jets _ is ``a serious threat to the Arab national security,''
al-Sharaa said.
	   He is chairing the two-day meeting of foreign ministers because
Syria holds the rotating presidency of the 22-member Arab League.
	   Libya has sent a memorandum to the league asking the Arabs to
follow the lead of the Organization of African Unity, which earlier
this year said it would no longer abide by the U.N. ban on air
travel to the North African country.
	   The sanctions _ which also include limits on the sale of oil
equipment and a freeze on some assets _ were imposed in 1992 to try
to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in connection with
the bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people.
	   Libya has agreed a joint American and British proposal for a
trial in the Netherlands but hasn't turned the men over, saying it
needs clarifications about their legal rights and safety.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the league's secretary-general, told the
opening session that ``We confirm our strong solidarity with Libya
in its fair demand for guarantees for arrangement and measures for
a fair trial ... and we hope that the United States and Britain
will cooperate.''
	   On the question of Iraq, al-Sharaa said that the suffering of
the Iraqi people should be ended with a phasing out of the U.N.
trade embargo, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   But he also called on Iraq to implement U.N. Security Council
resolutions that mandate the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The league also was expected to discuss last month's U.S.
missile attack on a factory in Sudan, which was in retaliation for
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   Sudan has called for an international fact-finding mission to
investigate Washington's claims that the factory manufactured
precursors for chemical weapons. Sudan insists it made
pharmaceuticals.

Hamas leader issues veiled threats against Israeli leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a veiled threat against Israeli
leaders, the founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
Wednesday that those who ordered the killings of two top Hamas
fugitives ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   The fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot dead
last week when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout. The
brothers had been involved in plotting terror attacks in Israel.
	   In response to killing of the Awadallahs, Hamas said it would
detonate suicide bombings in Tel Aviv in retaliation. The group
which hopes to wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, has
killed scores of Israelis in more than a dozen attacks since 1994.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, the
Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, appeared to
be raising the level of threats against Israel by singling out
those who ordered the killings of the Awadallahs.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said.
	   Asked whether he was referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, Yassin
said Hamas was not targeting the Israeli prime minister
specifically.
	   Yassin noted that Netanyahu ``lives in a high tower,'' an
apparent reference to the tight security surrounding the prime
minister.
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said. ``The occupiers
should expect anything from us.''
	   Israel has buried the Awadallah brothers in an unmarked grave at
a cemetery reserved for the ``enemies of Israel.''
	   The Awadallah family has demanded that the bodies be handed over
for a Muslim burial. Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, on Tuesday called the Israeli burial ``an inhumane
decision and a risky step.''
	   Tibi said any Israeli plan to use the bodies as bargaining chips
in possible exchanges with Hamas would backfire and was ``an
indirect invitation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.''

First round canceled in U.S.-Japan intercollegiate golf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TANAGURA, Japan (AP) _ The first round of Topy Cup, an annual
U.S.-Japan intercollegiate golf championship, was canceled
Wednesday due to Typhoon Stella and floods that hit central Japan.
	   Organizers said the 54-hole event will be reduced to 36 holes.
	   In the men's competition, four U.S. and eight Japanese teams
will compete. Two U.S. and four Japanese teams are entered in the
women's division.
	   American men's teams include the University of Nevada, Las
Vegas, winner of the NCAA golf championship in May.
	   U.S. women's teams are Arizona State University, winner of the
NCAA Division 1 women's golf team title in June, and the University
of Arizona.
	   Arizona State is spearheaded by sophomore Grace park, winner of
the 98th U.S. Women's Amateur Championship last month.
	   In the team event, each team will have five players with the
best four scores counted. In 15 previous events, U.S. men's teams
have won nine trophies, while U.S. women's teams won a majority of
eight.
	   There also will be individual contests both for men and women.

Rugby bidding for Olympic return, says IRB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ International Rugby Board chief
Vernon Pugh, buoyed by a successful debut for the sport at the
Commonwealth Games, is confident of its return to the Olympics.
	   ``I see a reasonable prospect of the game being included in the
2004 Olympics,'' Pugh told the Malaysian news agency Bernama on
Wednesday. ``We are having very positive discussions with the
International Olympic Committee in this regard.''
	   The 15-a-side form of rugby was last played at the 1924
Olympics, where the United States won the gold medal. It was
dropped because it was considered too violent.
	   Sevens rugby made its bow at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games
and the three-day program, won by New Zealand and including stars
like Jonah Lomu and David Campese, played to packed houses.
	   ``Now rugby is played in Asian, African and Commonwealth games
and has become very popular,'' Pugh said. ``Therefore, its
inclusion in a multi-disciplinary event like the Olympics is
justified.''

Funding problems keep Mir's next mission in limbo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's financial problems have left the launch
date uncertain for the flight that will take the last crew to the
Mir space station, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Russian space officials still do not know when they will send up
the French and Slovak astronauts, along with a Russian commander,
because of delays in the production schedule of the spaceship
needed to take them, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The launch has been tentatively scheduled for February. The
12-year-old year Mir is expected to remain in orbit until about
June, when it will be abandoned and allowed to burn up in the
earth's atmosphere.
	   But the Energia corporation, which builds the Soyuz-TM spaceship
that takes crew members to the Mir, cannot pay its suppliers, who
are withholding some components as a result, Interfax said.
	   The previous mission to the Mir was also delayed because cash
problems prevented Russian space officials from paying electricity
bills for use of the cosmodrome in Kazakstan. Local authorities
responded by turning off power to the cosmodrome for two weeks.

Bodies of trapped miners recovered in Philippines

<TEXT>
	   BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) _ Rescue workers on Wednesday
recovered the bodies of two miners who died when a gold mine shaft
collapsed in the central Philippines.
	   Rogel Cabauatan, a spokesman for Philex Gold Philippines Inc.,
said Fortunato Bastida, 54, and Estanislao Bariquit, 57, appeared
to have died instantly when the shaft collapsed last Thursday.
	   Jose Anievas, Philex vice president and resident manager,
earlier said eight meters (26 feet) of loose soil crashed down on
the miners inside the 70-meter (229-foot) shaft in Bulawan in
Negros Occidental province, about 570 kilometers (355 miles) south
of Manila.
	   He said the two men were working on setting rock bolts to
support the shaft's walls when the cave-in occurred.

Thai banks must change to compete: central banker governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank governor said
Wednesday Thai-owned commercial banks need to become ``more
international'' in facing competition from foreign-owned domestic
banks.
	   Chatu Mongol Sonakul told a press conference that he expects at
least a few more foreign banks will soon become majority owners in
Thai commercial banks.
	   ``They have to change their thinking,'' he said. ``They cannot
simply think they are Thai banks and will stay in the country
serving only Thai people.''
	   The Bank of Thailand on Tuesday named Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and Company as the financial advisor on the planned sale of Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank and Siam City Bank, two banks nationalized early
this year.
	   Chatu Mongol said Wednesday these two banks are likely to become
foreign-owned after the sale, expected at the end of this year.
	   Two Thai banks have already become foreign-majority owned.
	   Netherland's ABN AMRO Holding has purchased a 75 percent stake
in Bank of Asia, while Development of Singapore has bought a 50.3
percent in Thai Danu Bank.
	   Chatu Mongol said newly-created state-owned Radhanasin Bank,
which is merging with Laem Thong Bank, is also looking for foreign
partners. The government has said Radhanasin would maintain its
title after the completion of the merger expected at the end of
next month.
	   Chatu Mongol said this is the first time in the banking history
of Thailand the financial sector is opening up for foreign
ownership.
	   ``Previously we competed with foreigners by limiting the
competition,'' he said. ``We did not allow them to open branches
and so on. Now they can come in and compete with Thai banks on
equal basis.''
	   The governor said, however, he could not tell Thai-owned
commercial banks what to do in facing competition. But he noted
that the previous efforts by some Thai commercial banks to go
international had failed.
	   ``Now, they have to start thinking what they need to do to make
them able to compete with foreign banks,'' he said.

Hamas leader issues veiled threats against Israeli leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a veiled threat against Israeli
leaders, the founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
Wednesday that those who ordered the killings of two top Hamas
fugitives ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   The fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot dead
last week when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout. The
brothers had been involved in plotting terror attacks in Israel.
	   In response to the Awadallahs' killing, Hamas said it would
detonate suicide bomb in Tel Aviv. The group, which hopes to wreck
the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, has killed scores of
Israelis in more than a dozen attacks since 1994.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, the
Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, appeared to
be raising the level of threats against Israel by singling out
those who ordered the brothers' killed.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said.
	   Asked whether he was referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, Yassin
said Hamas was not targeting the Israeli prime minister
specifically.
	   Yassin noted that Netanyahu ``lives in a high tower,'' an
apparent reference to the tight security surrounding the prime
minister.
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said. ``The occupiers
should expect anything from us.''
	   Israel buried the Awadallah brothers in an unmarked grave at a
cemetery reserved for the ``enemies of Israel.''
	   The Awadallah family has demanded that the bodies be handed over
for a Muslim burial. Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, on Tuesday called the Israeli burial ``an inhumane
decision and a risky step.''
	   Tibi said any Israeli plan to use the bodies as bargaining chips
in possible exchanges with Hamas would backfire and was ``an
indirect invitation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.''

Le Pen's wife ready to replace him in European elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The wife of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen says
she will take her husband's place in next year's European
Parliament elections if a court upholds a two-year ban on his
running for office -- punishment for attacking a Socialist
politician.
	   Jany Le Pen, in an interview published Wednesday by the
newspaper Le Parisien, is quoted as saying that she is ``not a
political woman,'' but that her husband would need a
``standard-bearer'' if barred from running.
	   A Versailles court has convicted Le Pen for physically attacking
candidate Annette Peulvast-Bergeal on May 30, 1997, in the working
class town of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris, where she was
campaigning for a seat in the French National Assembly. Le Pen was
there lending his daughter, Marie-Caroline, support in her bid for
a seat.
	   Le Pen ended up in a scuffle with a handful of people protesting
his presence, among them Peulvast-Bergeal. Television footage
showed Le Pen shoving her in the chest.
	   ``It's inconceivable that his momentum can be shattered by a
ridiculous jostle on a street corner,'' Mrs. Le Pen was quoted as
saying. ``My husband needs a standard-bearer. He knows that I'll be
there, like a symbol.''
	   Le Pen, leader of the National Front, denies the attack, and has
said the conviction is a ``politically-motivated infamy.'' He has
appealed his conviction, but the appeals court has yet to rule.
	   The Versaille court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, meaning he can neither hold office, run for office, nor
vote.
	   That would force him to give up his seat in the Strasbourg-based
European Parliament and his post as regional counselor in the
Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern France. It would
also keep him from taking part in the June 1999 European vote.
	   The court also handed down a suspended three-month prison
sentence and a fine of 23,000 francs (dlrs 3,700).
	   Mrs. Le Pen said she and her husband had agreed to campaign
together if he is banned from politics. But she stressed any
political career would be short-lived.
	   ``I hope I'd soon be forgotten and that I'd be allowed to get
back to looking after my roses,'' she said.
	   Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Megret, said last month that he should
run if Le Pen is ineligible for the European elections, prompting
an angry response from Le Pen, and suggestions of a near-schism
within the party.
	   However, Mrs. Le Pen told Le Parisien that Megret had given her
his backing.
	   Wives of other National Front officials, including Megret, have
replaced their husbands in elections. Catherine Megret was elected
mayor of the southern town of Vitrolles.

Singapore stocks rocket higher in sustained rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with market developments, closing figures

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore stocks rocketed higher on Wednesday,
with the benchmark index soaring nearly 5 percent as another major
local bank lowered its lending rate.
	   The Straits Times Index surged 44.47 points above Tuesday's
close of 902.28 to finish at 946.75 points, up 4.93 percent.
	   A rally that began several weeks ago continued Wednesday when
Singapore's biggest financial institution, the Development Bank of
Singapore, or DBS, dropped its prime lending rate _ the rate it
charges its best customers _ a quarter point to 7.25 percent.
	   The cut by DBS was preceded by a similar move last week by
United Overseas Bank. A third ``big four'' bank _ Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. _ followed suit shortly after the markets closed
Wednesday, also dropping their rate to 7.25 percent.
	   The cuts in the prime lending rate have been triggered by
falling interbank rates, with the benchmark three-month interbank
rate consistently below 5 percent since late August.
	   Wall Street's rise Tuesday also boosted the Singapore bourse,
according to dealers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1
percent, or 79.04, to end Tuesday at 8024.39 points.
	   Property stocks have led the Singapore index's rise. According
to market observers, the cut in the prime rate _ to which housing
loans are pegged _ is seen easing the burden on property owners,
boosting demand in the flagging residential market and helping
debt-laden property companies.
	   The Stock Exchange of Singapore Properties Index jumped 20.63
points, or 8.3 percent, to 268.60 at the close.

Camels, horses told to `take a walk' from Giza Plateau
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CAI101-102 of Sept. 14 &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The days of tourists having their pictures
taken atop camels and horses beside the Great Pyramids are
numbered: Antiquities authorities are banning the beasts from the
Giza plateau.
	   As the number of animals has increased, so have complaints about
harassment by those overly eager to rent their mounts _ and about
camel droppings all over the footpaths.
	   ``Visitors never have an opportunity to look at the pyramids
alone, without distraction,'' said Zahi Hawass, the government
archaeologist in charge of the pyramids. ``But more important is
that we have to stop the pollution of the site.''
	   To this end, Egypt has built new stables in a valley a mile (1.6
kilometers) south of the pyramids, and Hawass said the camels and
riding horses will be moved there by the end of October.
	   They'll be allowed to take tourists on rides in the desert and
take photos for the tourists' scrapbooks. ``But the pyramids will
be a distant backdrop,'' Hawass said.
	   The shift is part of a long-term program to preserve the
4,500-year-old pyramids at Giza on Cairo's outskirts while
maintaining access to thousands of visitors a day.
	   Just how many animals are out there is unclear. Some 445 camels
and horses are licensed to work at the pyramids. Tourist police
say, however, that up to 1,500 others show up, especially on
Egyptian holidays.
	   Despite what tourists are told, camels and horses were not known
in Egypt when the pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus built
their burial pyramids at Giza. The horse arrived about 1,200 years
later, and was put to use pulling royal chariots. Camels, native to
the Arabian peninsula, started showing up around the first century
B.C.
	   These days, camels and horses, generally decked out in red
saddle blankets with multicolored pompons on their halters, are a
colorful attraction for some, a nuisance to others.
	   Tourists walking among the pyramids are repeatedly approached by
competing owners and asked if they want a ride. Quarrels over
prices are so frequent that it's a standing joke at Giza that it
costs 5 pounds (dlrs 1.50) to get on a camel and 50 pounds (dlrs
14.70) to get off.
	   Even worse, it costs the government dlrs 30,000 a year to clean
up the horse and camel droppings, Hawass said.
	   The Egyptians who earn their livings renting out camels and
horses are not pleased about the move, despite assurances from the
government that there will be big parking and picnic areas for
visitors near the new stable grounds.
	   Mohammed Farag, who has spent 35 of his 50 years leading
tourists around the pyramids on his camels, argues that ``we're not
the ones causing pollution _ it's the cars and buses that
pollute.''
	   He supports his mother, wife and seven children with earnings
from his camel, which he calls Kentucky Fried Chicken, and worries
that his income will drop significantly.
	   ``I don't think it is good for the tourists, and it certainly
won't be good for me,'' Farag said.
	   Elhamy el-Zayat, chairman of Emeco Travel, the largest tourist
agency in Egypt, said a priority should be given to preserving the
ancient monuments _ and satisfying foreign visitors.
	   ``There have been animals there for thousands of years,''
el-Zayat said. ``I'm not sure if they pose a serious risk for the
environment.''
	   He added: ``But the cars and buses, with all that exhaust and
the vibrations. Yes, they should definitely go after these _ reduce
them or ban them.''
	   He may not have long to wait.
	   Hawass says within a year, Egypt hopes to consign tour buses and
private cars to a ring road around the Giza plateau and to outlying
parking lots. Tourists will walk or ride special, electric-powered
vehicles among the monuments.

Transport strike affects Rolling Stones, Champions League match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Tens of thousands of fans preparing to
head to a Rolling Stones concert and Champions League match
Wednesday were forced to make alternative travel plans because of a
six-hour mass transit strike.
	   Trolley drivers walked off the job at 10 a.m., followed by
subway and bus drivers at noon, leaving only some urban buses
running during the afternoon rush hour, when most fans are expected
to head for the concert.
	   Authorities appealed through local media to the estimated 60,000
people due to head to the capital's main Olympic Stadium for the
concert to pool their cars if possible.
	   The strike was also affecting about 25,000 soccer fans heading
to a Champions League match between Athens' Panathinaikos and
Dynamo Kiev in a western Athens suburb.
	   The soccer match was originally scheduled to be held at the
Olympic Stadium, and Panathinaikos club officials have repeatedly
expressed their dismay at being thrown off their home turf by the
Rolling Stones.

Norwegian soldier wounded in shell fire in south Lebanon

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Norwegian soldier was wounded Wednesday
when a mortar round fired by an Israeli army tank hit a U.N.
military outpost in south Lebanon, a U.N. statement said.
	   The statement said the Israeli tank fired three rounds in
southerly direction into a seven-man Norwegian patrol.
	   ``One soldier was hit with shrapnel wounds in his left hand,
resulting in the loss of one finger,'' it added. The soldier was
reported in stable condition at the U.N. field hospital in the
border town of Naqoura.
	   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, said UNIFIL has strongly protested the incident with
the Israeli army.
	   In Israel, the army said an Israeli tank had fired at what it
termed ``suspicious movement'' on the eastern side of Israel's
so-called security zone.
	   It said the commander of Israeli troops in the area ordered an
inquiry when he learned the movement was by U.N. troops and one
peacekeeper was wounded. Results of the inquiry are expected next
week.
	   The position hit is in Blatt, a Shiite Muslim village north of a
border enclave occupied by Israeli troops in south Lebanon. The
area is 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Israel's northern Galilee
panhandle.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after an Israeli invasion.
Nine nations contribute to the force: Finland, Italy, France,
Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Fiji.

Myanmar's top general calls opponents traitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS new government statement, including release of one NLD
member &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The leader of Myanmar's military
government has called opponents of military rule traitors who are
helping colonialists conquer the country, the state-run New Light
of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
	   General Than Shwe, the leader of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, was believed to have been referring to
opposition party the National League for Democracy and its leader
Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   Than Shwe and other military leaders almost never refer to Suu
Kyi by name. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was once a British
colony. The country was isolated by its military government for 26
years from 1962-88, and its leaders still view the outside world
with suspicion.
	   ``The internal traitors with pessimistic views are paving the
way for neocolonialists to interfere in our internal affairs,''
Than Shwe told a gathering of the Union Solidarity and Development
Association, a military-run civilian organization.
	   Since May, the military has arrested 783 NLD members, including
194 members of parliament, in the largest crackdown against the
opposition since the early 1990s.
	   The government said Wednesday it had released one of the NLD
members, 85-year-old Thakin Khin Nyunt.
	   ``It is hoped that with the cooperation and goodwill of the NLD
leadership, the rest of the NLD members will soon be home,'' said a
government spokesman on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Most of the arrests in the current crackdown came during the
last two weeks as the military blocked an attempt by the NLD to
convene parliament.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of seats in parliament in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.
	   In defending the government's action, the spokesman said that
several countries which had recently attempted rapid transitions to
democracy had plunged into ``rioting, looting, violent death and
even civil war.''
	   ``If the basic peace and stability the country has achieved are
lost, the ground work for democracy may be lost,'' he said.
	   He said it would be dangerous for the country for the NLD to
attempt to convene Parliament before a constitution is written.
	   ``Without a constitution, the Parliament would be unable to
government effectively. That, the government fears, would lead not
to a stable democracy, but to institutional confusion, social chaos
and genuine political crisis,'' he said.
	   A military-run convention has been attempting to draft a
constitution since 1993. It has not met since March 1996.
	   The NLD was allotted only 15 percent of the seats at the
convention, despite winning 82 percent of the seats in parliament.
The party pulled out of the convention in 1995 saying it was
undemocratic.
	   The convention has already drafted clauses that bar Suu Kyi from
elected office and guarantee the military the leading role in
politics.
	   The NLD contends that the elected parliament should be the body
that draws up a new constitution.

Lincoln Center gets dlrs 25 million gift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A new board member is giving Lincoln Center for
the Performing Arts dlrs 25 million, its largest single gift ever
from an individual, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
	   The lump sum grant will be divided among artistic programs and
the center's 12 constituent members, such as the Metropolitan Opera
and the Juilliard School, Lincoln Center officials said Tuesday.
	   The largest share will go to members through grants. Some of the
money will help underwrite new series, center president Nathan
Leventhal told the Times.
	   The donor, Julian Robertson Jr., 66, is chairman and chief
executive officer of Tiger Management, a multibillion-dollar
investment fund. The gift was meant to be a surprise for his wife,
Josie, for whom the center's fountain plaza will be renamed.
	   The Revson Fountain, named after a 1962 Revlon Foundation gift
in honor of cosmetics executive Charles Revson, will retain its
name.
	   Lincoln Center's second-largest gift, which came nearly 10 years
ago, was dlrs 15 million from Fred Rose of real estate developers
Rose Associates.

Arafat urges Arab support for creation of Palestinian state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday urged Arab and Muslim leaders to support the formation of
a Palestinian state, saying he feared a military attack by Israel
if he declares statehood.
	   Arafat spoke to the opening session of an Arab League meeting
expected to take up Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's plea for Arabs
to ignore the U.N. flight ban on Libya as well as the growing
Turkish-Israel alliance seen as a threat by Arabs.
	   Arafat told the gathering that the Palestinian leadership will
``conduct Arab and Islamic campaigns to gather needed support for a
Palestinian state.''
	   Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said that it would go forward
with plans for a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next May if
Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, continues to
stall peace negotiations.
	   He noted Israel's intention to oppose such a move and charged
that ``the Israeli army has begun ... to get ready against this
subject and has already begun training to storm the Palestinian
territories.''
	   Earlier, Arafat met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak near
the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and later told reporters that
Israel must accept the U.S. peace initiative calling for the Jewish
state to withdraw its troops from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   Israel has balked, saying it needs more security guarantees from
the Palestinians. U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was in Jordan on Wednesday
briefing Crown Prince Hassan on his latest, unfruitful talks with
both sides.
	   Before the meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
criticized the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey as an
impediment to regional peace.
	   ``What the region needs is not setting up a coalition'' between
Turkey and Israel ``but having a just and comprehensive peace,''
al-Sharaa said.
	   This, he said, requires Israel to withdraw from all the
territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East War, including the
Golan Heights taken from Syria and the Palestinian-populated West
Bank.
	   The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation _ which includes joint
maneuvers, cooperation in training and Turkish upgrading of Israeli
jets _ is ``a serious threat to the Arab national security,''
al-Sharaa said.
	   He is chairing the two-day meeting of foreign ministers because
Syria holds the rotating presidency of the 22-member Arab League.
	   Libya has sent a memorandum to the league asking the Arabs to
follow the lead of the Organization of African Unity, which earlier
this year said it would no longer abide by the U.N. ban on air
travel to the North African country.
	   The sanctions _ which also include limits on the sale of oil
equipment and a freeze on some assets _ were imposed in 1992 to try
to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in connection with
the bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people.
	   Libya has agreed to a joint American and British proposal for a
trial in the Netherlands but hasn't turned the men over, saying it
needs clarifications about their legal rights and safety.

Prosecution asks for two years for friend of Rabin's assassin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A friend of Yitzhak Rabin's assassin who
failed to alert police to the killer's plans should serve the
maximum penalty of two years, prosecutors told a court Wednesday.
	   Defendant Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, had testified that Yigal Amir
boasted to her that he was planning to assassinate Rabin in order
to stop the handing over of land to the Palestinians.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for killing Rabin at a Tel Aviv
peace rally in November 1995. Har-Shefi was convicted in June of
failing to prevent a crime.
	   Prosecutor Pnina Guy asked the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court on
Wednesday to sentence Har-Shefi to the maximum penalty.
	   ``If Yigal Amir had been arrested before the event, Yitzhak
Rabin would not have been killed,'' Guy said.
	   ``She knew of his intentions to set up an underground, of his
two previous aborted attempts to kill Rabin, and of a cache of
weapons hidden at the Jewish settlement of Beit El.''
	   Har-Shefi's defense lawyer, Yosef Elon, said his client should
not serve any time in prison.
	   ``She did not have a crumb of knowledge about the specific
event. Nobody knew Yigal Amir would do it, or how, or where. How
could she have prevented the murder?'' Elon said.
	   Judge Nira Lidski replied: ``By informing the police, or at
least their rabbi.''
	   No character witnesses testified, as is the norm for this
portion of the sentencing hearing. Har-Shefi, who wore a striped
shirt and a khaki skirt and looked at the floor, declined the
opportunity to address the court.
	   Lidski, however, reprimanded Har-Shefi for her behavior during
the trial, which included tardiness, not standing when speaking and
talking out of turn.
	   `` I expect better behavior from a former law student,'' Lidski
said.
	   Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 27.

Firings at private TV station trigger protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters gathered
outside Slovakia's main independent TV station for a second day
Wednesday, objecting to staff firings they say are aimed at
manipulating news coverage ahead of upcoming parliamentary
elections.
	   The protest outside influential TV Markiza follows the new
ownership's announcement Tuesday that it was firing 12 news
executives and journalists.
	   The move prompted an angry outcry among opposition politicians
and their supporters and produced banner headlines in Slovakia's
newspapers Wednesday. Rallies were scheduled in seven other Slovak
cities.
	   The staff members refused to accept their dismissals, remaining
in control of the station's broadcasts Wednesday and appealing to
the public to keep rallying against the actions.
	   After more than a thousand people came to the suburban TV
building on Tuesday to show their support for the ousted staff, one
of the two new owners, Marian Kocner, pledged not to interfere with
the broadcasts and said nine of the dismissed journalists could
keep their jobs.
	   But at least three news executives, including the general
director and news director, must leave, he said.
	   Opposition politicians and other Slovaks who attended an
all-night protest at the station complained that media freedoms
were being trampled.
	   TV Markiza, which has been broadcasting since 1996, is the only
source of independent television news throughout Slovakia. The only
other broadcast received nationwide is state-run TV.

Liberal Iranian newspaper closed down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A liberal Iranian newspaper was closed down
Wednesday for publishing articles detrimental ``to the country's
national interests and security,'' the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   The judiciary ordered the Tous newspaper closed until further
notice pending an investigation, the agency said.
	   The closure came a day after Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei
called on the judiciary to deal with newspapers abusing the
country's press freedoms.
	   Tous angered hardliners for it's anti-war stance. The newspaper
has been calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict with the
Taliban in Afghanistan and suggesting dialogue with the Islamic
militia instead of military strikes.
	   Anti-Taliban feelings are running high in Iran since the militia
admitted on Thursday to killing eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist. Demonstrators, newspapers and officials have been
calling for revenge against the Taliban, whose forces killed the
Iranians after capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug.
8.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners because it questioned the
authority of Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide, and asked how an
unelected person could wield more power than the president.
Moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who won more than 20
million votes in elections last year, has limited powers.
	   The real power is in the hands of the hard-line clergy led by
Khamenei, who controls the armed forces, the judiciary, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network.
	   Tous began as the daily, Jameah, but was closed down in July by
hard-liners. When the paper changed its name to Tous and continued
publishing, authorities again ordered it to close, but later
rescinded the order.
	   Tous's editor, Mahmoud Shams, was beaten last month by militants
allied with the hard-liners.

Hungarian leader bashes Western Europe for Russia's problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Western European nations are partly to
blame for Russia's economic crisis because they failed to invest in
the economy, Hungarian Prime Minister was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
	   ``Nobody invested in the real economy there, everyone just
speculated ... knowing that by doing so the massive profits
achieved on the Russian stock market had no economic basis
whatsoever,'' Viktor Orban was quoted as saying in the
Hamburg-based weekly paper Die Woche.
	   Orban, elected prime minister last July, also criticized Western
European policies towards other eastern neighbors _ including his
own country. He accused Western Europe of giving scant help to
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic during their transition
from communism to capitalism and democracy.
	   All three nations have been accepted for NATO membership and are
negotiating to join the 15-nation European Union, though membership
is still some years away.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria will ask France to extradite a
German national suspected in a deadly attack on OPEC headquarters
in 1975, justice ministry officials said Wednesday.
	   Austria has started the legal procedure to request extradition
of Hans-Joachim Klein, who has been living in France for two
decades, Dr. Gert Felsenstein, a justice ministry spokesman told
the Associated Press.
	   French police arrested Klein on Sept. 8 in a cafe in the
northern French village of Sainte-Honorine-la-Guillaume.
	   Klein is wanted for involvement in the OPEC attack, in which
three people were killed and 70 taken hostage. Orders for the
attack are believed to have come from Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the
man known as Carlos the Jackal, who is in a French jail serving a
life sentence for three other murders.
	   On Tuesday, the German Federal Crime Office in Wiesbaden
requested Klein's extradition. Germany is interested not only in
what Klein might have to say about Carlos' terror network, but also
about activities at the time of the Stasi, the East German secret
police.
	   French authorities will decide where Klein will be tried once
Austria's extradition request becomes official in the coming days.

Martin beats Fitz-Gerald for Commonwealth squash gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a contest between the two best
women squash players in the world, No. 2 Michelle Martin upset the
top-ranked Sarah Fitz-Gerald to win the gold in an all-Australian
final Wednesday at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Martin, who won 9-0, 9-6, 9-5, overpowered her opponent in the
first half of the match. Constantly on the defensive, Fitz-Gerald
scrambled, fumbled and lunged and only won her first point at 0-5
in the second game after 15 minutes of play.
	   As the match wore on, 30-year-old Fitz-Gerald began to dominate
more points and dictated some of the pace but Martin, 31, kept up a
steady barrage of drives and tight angles.
	   Both women had breezed through the early rounds, winning all
their matches by a margin of 3-0. Martin, winner of six consecutive
British Open titles, had recently beat Fitz-Gerald.
	   The losing semifinalists in the women's competition, Cassie
Jackman and Sue Wright, both of England, share the bronze medal.
	   World No. 1 Peter Nicol of Scotland and No. 3 Jonathon Power of
Canada were paired up in the men's final later Wednesday.
	   In the men's, the bronze medal winners were Paul Johnson of
England and Alex Gough of Wales.

India wants nuclear energy technology for signing test ban treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 3-4 with report tests were exaggerrated. &QL; 
 &UR; By K.N. ARUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ In exchange for signing a nuclear test ban
treaty, India wants the nuclear energy technology that it has been
denied because the material also has military uses, the prime
minister said Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's comments to reporters in
the southern city of Madras confirmed speculation about ongoing
negotiations on India's nuclear policy between his envoy Jaswant
Singh and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Also Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times said a new scientific
study concluded both India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and
strength of their underground nuclear tests in May. U.S. officials
had earlier raised such questions, but the U.S. newspaper quoted an
unnamed state department official as saying the tests, whether or
not they were as extensive as claimed, nonetheless contributed to a
regional arms race and had global implications.
	   India's foreign office refused to comment on the newspaper
report. Efforts to reach officials at India's Atomic Energy
Commission, which also oversees nuclear weapons programs, were not
immediately successful.

Bavarian governor to boycott German Unity Day over communist hymn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The governor of Bavaria state says he
will boycott a German Unity Day ceremony if organizers insist on
including part of former communist East Germany's national anthem
in the musical program.
	   A nine-note passage from the defunct communist state's anthem
shows up three times in the composition commissioned for the Oct. 3
festivities marking the 1990 reunification of east and west
Germany.
	   Gov. Edmund Stoiber, fresh from a re-election victory in his
home state, was quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on
Wednesday as saying the communist anthem stood for 40 years of
division and repression.
	   Stoiber echoed previous charges from federal government
officials that including the communist-era passage would mock the
memory of all who suffered under East Germany's government.
	   This year's ceremony is to be held in the Lower Saxony state
capital of Hanover. Despite the controversy, state officials insist
the 15-minute composition by Bardo Henning will be played as
planned. The piece also includes passages from Germany's own
national anthem and a hymn sung by concentration camp inmates.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Norwegian soldier was wounded Wednesday
when a mortar round fired by an Israeli army tank hit a U.N.
military outpost in south Lebanon, a U.N. statement said.
	   The statement said the Israeli tank fired three rounds in
southerly direction into a seven-man Norwegian patrol.
	   ``One soldier was hit with shrapnel wounds in his left hand,
resulting in the loss of one finger,'' it added. The soldier was
reported in stable condition at the U.N. field hospital in the
border town of Naqoura.
	   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, said UNIFIL has strongly protested the incident with
the Israeli army.
	   In Israel, the army said an Israeli tank had fired at what it
termed ``suspicious movement'' on the eastern side of Israel's
so-called security zone.
	   It said the commander of Israeli troops in the area ordered an
inquiry when he learned the movement was by U.N. troops and one
peacekeeper was wounded. Results of the inquiry are expected next
week.
	   The position hit is in Blatt, a Shiite Muslim village north of a
border enclave occupied by Israeli troops in south Lebanon. The
area is 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Israel's northern Galilee
panhandle.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after an Israeli invasion.
Nine nations contribute to the force: Finland, Italy, France,
Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Fiji.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets opened mixed Wednesday, with news
about U.S. interest rates and Japanese banking reforms boosting
some stocks and local issues depressing others. By midday, Tokyo
shares had gained 0.32 percent on hopes for an agreement on
urgently needed legislation to clean up Japan's ailing banking
system. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed at midday up 47.01
points at 14,274.38. Singapore's key index surged 2.3 percent as
two major banks cut their prime lending rates, and Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index was 1.4 percent higher. Indonesia's key JSX Composite
index, however, dropped 1.9 percent to a five-year low on continued
foreign selling and speculation that the government will implement
Malaysian-style capital controls. Although the Indonesian
government announced that the rupiah would be allowed to float
freely, foreign investors dumped shares, waiting to see what will
happen to the country's already battered economy, dealers said.
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese currency amid
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will not cut
interest rates anytime soon. The dollar bought 134.38 yen in early
trading, up 1.80 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five days after his confirmation, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was still cautiously assembling a new Cabinet on
Wednesday as the Russian currency displayed new signs of weakness.
Primakov has spoken only in broad terms, saying he is committed to
economic reform to stave off an economic crisis. He has moved
carefully in putting together a new Cabinet, offering posts to a
wide range of political and economic factions, including the
Communist Party. Meanwhile, Russia's currency again appeared
unstable. The ruble reached about 7.5 to the dollar early Tuesday _
only slightly off its rate a month ago, when the crisis hit. But
the ruble then reversed course Tuesday afternoon and was down to
about 11-12 to the dollar in street trading Wednesday. The currency
swings reflect concern that the new government will print more
money to pay back wages, which could increase inflation that was at
36 percent in the first week of September. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general plans to
question ex-President Suharto over claims that the former leader's
family used corruption to make a fortune during his 32 years in
power. Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib told reporters
Wednesday he would head a three-member team to meet Suharto soon.
He gave no date or venue for the questioning, which is also to
cover allegations that Suharto stashed millions of dollars overseas
before he quit office five months ago. In a recent and rare
television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied allegations that he had
squirreled millions of dollars overseas during his three decades in
office while his six children built huge business empires under his
unchallenged patronage. The claim has been greeted with disbelief
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years. (INDONESIA-CORRUPTION)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton made his most forceful
comments yet about the global financial crisis, and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan is signaling a willingness to cut interest
rates to prevent a U.S. recession. Financial markets, always on
edge when Greenspan speaks, will be even more alert this time
around, waiting to see if the Fed chief hints further on when the
central bank might decide to cut interest rates to give the U.S.
economy a boost. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the Clinton
administration's economic crisis manager, and Greenspan were to
appear Wednesday before the House Banking Committee to provide
their latest views on what more can be done. Some Republicans in
Congress, upset that more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts
organized by the International Monetary Fund have not been enough
to stabilize the situation, charge that the administration and
global monetary officials have bungled the containment effort.
(US-FINANCIAL CRISIS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The United States is prepared to suffer massive
trade deficits with Asian nations, including Japan, to help the
ailing region cope with its yearlong financial turmoil, U.S.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday. ``We're
prepared to bear that responsibility. It is a severe
responsibility. We're prepared to bear it because we think that's
one of the contributions we can make,'' he said while visiting
Tokyo with U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
Barshefsky began talks with Japanese trade officials Wednesday to
pressure Tokyo to import more and rein in its ballooning trade gap
with the United States, expected to reach dlrs 70 billion this
year. The purpose of the U.S. officials' visit is to discuss such
trade issues ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi set for next Tuesday in
New York. (US-JAPAN-TRADE)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Followers of ex-President Sali Berisha
ignored a deadline to hand in weapons by dawn Wednesday or face a
government crackdown.However, Albania's capital appeared calm
Wednesday morning as the opposition planned another demonstration.
The deadline for handing in weapons was announced late Tuesday
during a 4 1/2-hour parliamentary session as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano reasserted control after disappearing from sight during two
days of rioting in Tirana. During the parliament session, the
government also ordered an investigation which could lead to the
arrest and prosecution of Berisha and top aides for allegedly
attempting a coup during this week's rioting. (ALBANIA)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of Iranian men and women
demonstrate Wednesday against Afghanistan's Taliban militia,
chanting ``Death to Taliban'' and ``Death to the U.S.'' as tensions
between the two neighbors run high over the killing of nine
Iranians. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Parliament warned that
the situation in Afghanistan ``will turn into a regional and
trans-regional crisis'' and urged Islamic nations to counter the
threat, IRNA said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ordered the military and top civilian officials put on full alert
amid heightened tension with Afghanistan. Tensions between the two
neighbors have been running high since Thursday, when the Taliban
admitted to killing eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist last
month. Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths. In Washington, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United States
understands the anger of the Iranian government over the killing of
its diplomats, but urged the Tehran government not to use force.
(IRAN-AFGHANISTAN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded 12
villages in northern Kosovo on Wednesday, bringing the crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels to a previously calm area of the strife-torn
province, ethnic Albanian sources said. No statement from Serb
forces was immediately available, and the reports could not be
independently confirmed. Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population. Late Monday and early Tuesday, Serb
and Yugoslav security forces ousted the Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army from villages in the Drenica region of western Kosovo,
considered the KLA's last major holdout in Kosovo. Since July, the
Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from 40 percent, to all but
a few patches, mostly in the mountains. The Serb offensive started
on Feb. 28, with fighting concentrated mostly in the east and west
of Kosovo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday urged Arab and Muslim leaders to support the formation of
a Palestinian state, saying he feared a military attack by Israel
if he declares statehood. Arafat spoke to the opening session of an
Arab League meeting expected to take up Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's plea for Arabs to ignore the U.N. flight ban on Libya as
well as the growing Turkish-Israel alliance seen as a threat by
Arabs. Arafat's Palestinian Authority has said that it would go
forward with plans for a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next
May if Israel's hard-line prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
continues to stall peace negotiations. Earlier, Arafat met Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak near the Mediterranean city of Alexandria
and told reporters that Israel must withdraw troops from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank, as outlined in a U.S. peace
initiative. Israel has balked, saying it needs more security
guarantees from the Palestinians. (ARAB LEAGUE)
	   MADRAS, India (AP) _ In exchange for signing a nuclear test ban
treaty, India wants the nuclear energy technology that it has been
denied because the material also has military uses, the prime
minister said Wednesday. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
comments confirmed speculation about ongoing negotiations on
India's nuclear policy between his envoy Jaswant Singh and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. The United States, which
led the world in punishing India's May nuclear tests with economic
sanctions, has urged New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. India's test prompted tests by neighboring Pakistan, with
whom India has fought three wars. The United States and other
countries, fearing nuclear war could one day break out in this
volatile region, imposed economic sanctions on both countries and
demanded they sign the test ban treaty. (INDIA-NUCLEAR)

Key figures in Albania's latest crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Albania &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Here are thumbnail sketches of the two
key figures in Albania's latest political crisis:
	   -0-
	   FATOS NANO
	   Fatos Nano, 46, is from the southern Albanian town of Lunxheria
near the city of Gjirokastra. He became prime minister first in
1991 in a transition government which included Communists. That
government collapsed in 1992 after Sali Berisha's Democratic Party
pulled out of the coalition, paving the way toward new elections in
March 1992 which swept the Socialists from power. The following
year, Nano was sentenced to 12 years in prison on charges of
falsifying documents and misappropriating funds. International
watchdog groups said the conviction was politically motivated.
	   Nano was held in a high-security prison in southern Albania
until violence broke out in the region in early 1997. He was
transferred to a prison in Tirana, where a mob freed him and about
600 other prisoners in March 1997.
	   He became prime minister in internationally-supervised elections
later that year.
	   -0-
	   SALI BERISHA
	   Sali Berisha, 53, is a cardiologist and professor from the
northern city of Tropoja. He was a Communist Party member for 25
years, but turned against it as communist systems began to topple
throughout eastern Europe. In December 1990, Berisha turned a
student movement into a nationwide anti-communist uprising that
forced Albania's first multiparty elections. The newly named
Democratic Party lost elections in 1991 but won the following year,
and on April 9, 1992, he was appointed president.
	   Berisha lost his grip after the pyramid schemes collapsed in
January 1997. Following his party's defeat in elections, he
resigned the presidency on Aug. 22, 1997, a year before his term
expired. Berisha retained his seat in Parliament and said he would
work to ensure a market economy and Albania's acceptance in Western
economic and military organizations.
	   He never stopped criticizing his rival Prime Minister Fatos
Nano, accusing his government of corruption and incompetence.

Report: India, Pakistan exaggerated size, number of nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Indian foreign office refusing comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Both India and Pakistan exaggerated the size
and number of nuclear weapons they detonated in separate tests
earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
	   Quoting the findings of an independent study, the newspaper
reported that the two South Asian rivals overstated the power of
their atomic bombs by a factor of four.
	   In late May, Pakistan claimed it detonated six devices in
response to India's detonation of five nuclear devices two weeks
earlier. Both acts were condemned by nations around the world amid
fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in their
dispute over Kashmir, which is split between them.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   But two of the nuclear tests India claimed may not have taken
place at all and only two of the explosions Pakistan announced
actually involved atomic bombs, the Times reported.
	   ``This is quite clearly a case where governments tested for a
political reason rather than scientific reasons, so we have to be
suspicious of what they say,'' said Terry Wallace of the University
of Arizona, an expert on the use of seismology to analyze nuclear
explosions.
	   In New Delhi, the Indian Foreign Office refused to comment on
the report in the Times. Officials at the Atomic Energy Commission,
which also oversees nuclear weapons program, did not immediately
return phone calls.
	   Wallace's study was published Wednesday in Seismological
Research Letters. His work, believed to be the first independent
scientific accounting of the tests, was based on seismic shock
waves released by the explosions.
	   Wallace concluded that India and Pakistan misled each other _
and the world _ about the tests conducted last spring.
	   ``Seismology provided a microscope into what happened and we
were able to learn a lot about these explosions,'' Wallace said.
``It has given us a reality check on government pronouncements.''

Yeltsin fills key cabinet posts, but economic plan still unclear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW throughout with Yeltsin appointing new Cabinet members. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin filled several top posts
in the Cabinet Wednesday, but the new government's strategy for
tackling the economic emergency remained fuzzy and the ruble
displayed new signs of weakness.
	   The president issued a stream of appointments, and has now given
new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov four deputy premiers _ three of
them considered moderate reformers and one a Communist technocrat.
	   After years of feuding between the president and his rivals in
parliament, the new government is shaping up as an attempt to
accommodate Russia's disparate political factions.
	   However, the president and the premier have yet to spell out
their plan for easing Russia's economic crisis, regarded as the
worst since the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
	   Two top economic officials in the new government appeared to
disagree on whether to print more rubles to pay millions of workers
owed several months of overdue wages. The government has said its
top priority will be to end this chronic problem.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said Tuesday he
favored expanding the money supply so the government could pay
frustrated workers and pensioners. But Alexander Shokhin, a
reformer named deputy prime minister in charge of financial issues,
said he opposed the idea.
	   ``I'm not rejecting the possibility of printing money, but I am
against the viewpoint that simply cranking up the money printing
presses will solve all our problems,'' Shokhin told a news
conference Wednesday. ``If we manage to restore popular confidence
in the government, that will allow us to avoid printing money.''
	   Meanwhile, Russia's currency again appeared unstable. The ruble
had been regaining strength in recent days as banks pushed for a
better rate before they paid off hard currency debts to foreigners.
The ruble reached 7.5 to the dollar Tuesday _ only slightly off its
rate a month ago, when the crisis hit.
	   But the ruble reversed course Tuesday afternoon and was down to
about 11-12 to the dollar in street trading Wednesday.
	   The currency swings reflect the jittery nature of the Russian
economy and concerns that the new government will resort to
printing more money to pay off back wages, a move that could lead
to hyperinflation.
	   Inflation already is soaring. Less than 1 percent a month before
the crisis hit in August, it was 36 percent in the first week of
September.
	   While supporting reforms, Primakov has said that he opposes the
``wild capitalism'' that has emerged in Russia, and indicated that
the government intends to play a stronger role in the economy.
	   His four deputies include, Shokhin a reformer who will handle
Russia's dealings with the International Monetary Fund and other
international financial institutions, the Russian media reported
Wednesday.
	   Two other deputy prime ministers appointed Wednesday were also
seen as moderate reformers _ Vladimir Ryzhkov, a parliamentary
leader of a pro-government faction, and Vladimir Bulgak, who was
Science and Technology minister in the previous government.
	   The fourth deputy premier, Yuri Maslyukov, is a Communist
technocrat, but he also served in the previous Yeltsin
administration as industry minister.
	   In another development, Yeltsin spoke by phone with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl about the crisis in Russia. The Russian
leader told Kohl that the economic situation in Russia was getting
better, Interfax reported.
	   Yeltsin has made few appearances during the crisis and has not
said specifically what should be done, aside from general
pronouncements encouraging reforms.
	   Russian liberals and media have been critical of the new
government, saying it will represent a retreat from free-market
programs.
	   Primakov said media speculation about ``Communist revenge'' and
the ``end of reforms'' was unfounded, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Primakov met Tuesday with a delegation of officials from the
International Monetary Fund and said Russia was committed to paying
the billions of dollars in debt it owes to foreign banks and
institutions,
	   Shokhin said another pro-reform figure, Georgy Boos, had been
appointed head of the State Tax Service, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The position has been held by a top reformer in the previous
government, Boris Fyodorov, who was highly respected by the Western
investment community and also served as a deputy premier.
	   Fyodorov's status was unclear Wednesday. Alexandra Ivashchenko,
a spokeswoman for the tax service, said it was likely that Fyodorov
would be leaving the government, but there had not been an official
announcement from Yeltsin's office.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, ex-President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the government _ from
jail if necessary if police try to arrest him.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,500 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting slogans against Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom they blame for the weekend assassination
of popular politician Azem Hajdari.
	   Chanting ``death to Fatos Nano,'' Berisha's supporters marched
off toward the city's main Skanderbeg Square for another rally,
which ended peacefully. Berisha claimed thousands of others were
prevented by police from reaching the square.
	   He called for another rally Thursday and urged followers to
break through police barricades if necessary to attend.
	   Hajdari's slaying Saturday touched off two days of rioting which
has plunged this impoverished Balkan nation into its second major
crisis in 18 months.
	   Late Tuesday, the government demanded that Berisha's followers
surrender their remaining arms by dawn Wednesday or face a
crackdown. The party responded to an earlier demand by handing over
a pair of tanks seized during riots Monday.
	   But Berisha's bodyguards brandished semi-automatic rifles inside
party headquarters Wednesday, hours after the latest deadline for
surrendering them had passed.
	   Parliament late Tuesday also ordered a criminal investigation of
Berisha and his top aides for allegedly trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha told the Wednesday press
conference. ``I'm prepared to continue my battle in any situation.
I will always be in the country alive or dead, in my house or
elsewhere.''
	   Outside the headquarters, Berisha's followers, listening to his
remarks from a loudspeaker, chanted ``Fatos Nano, you bastard. You
are Greek, not an Albanian.'' Berisha said his followers _ who
helped topple Albania's Communist regime in early 1990s _ would
oust the ``dictatorship of the terrorists,'' meaning Nano.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of nationwide unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that
struck Albania last year following the collapse of shady pyramid
schemes that cost many people their life's savings.
	   Berisha was president during the pyramid investment crisis and
elections in its aftermath led to his ouster from power and the
rise of Nano's former Communist's in the Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also the widespread
disappointment with the government's inability to revive the
economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   But the government appears committed to standing firm against
Berisha's challenge. Late Tuesday, parliament also enacted a law
transferring military police and some commando units from control
of the army to the Interior Ministry.
	   The decision on military police and commandos means the
government could use them to maintain order without having to call
in the army. But members of Nano's own Socialist party criticized
the move, saying it resembled Berisha's decision to call in the
army during unrest when he was president last year.
	   In an attempt to ensure support among the police, Nano this week
increased their salaries by 50 to 100 percent, the state news
agency reported. The government also said it would give police a
one-time reward of 30,000 to 50,000 leke (dlrs 200 to 340) for
protecting state institutions during the rioting.
	   Before the increase, ordinary policemen earned about dlrs 65 a
month. Members of the elite special force received dlrs 400 a
month.

Report: dlrs 672,000 legal bill for Diana's sons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Prime Minister John Major has run up a
400,000 pound (dlrs 672,000) legal bill while acting as guardian of
the inheritance due to Princess Diana's sons, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The bill was submitted by a London law firm, Boodle Hatfield,
that Major hired to handle the will _ under which Prince William,
16, and Prince Harry, 14, stand to inherit 12.9 million pounds
(dlrs 21.7 million) when they turn 25.
	   The Mirror said legal wrangles to safeguard the boys' rights in
the highly profitable Diana memorabilia industry and an abandoned
attempt to avoid death duties led to the massive litigation bill,
according to The Mirror.
	   Major, now a rank-and-file member of Parliament, was appointed
as financial guardian of the princes three months after Diana's
death on Aug. 31 last year.
	   Queen Elizabeth II and Major's successor, Prime Minister Tony
Blair, approved the appointment, made because Charles and Diana
were divorced. It was agreed the boys' legal bill would be paid
from their mother's estate.
	   Major apparently had no idea of the costs being run up by the
law firm until a final accounting was turned over to him five
months ago, the newspaper said. Major has only recently shown the
bill to Charles, the newspaper said.
	   Buckingham Palace, calling it ``a private family matter,'' and
the law firm refused to comment. Major's office did not return a
phone call.

Ex-circus artist wins three men's gymnastics golds for Australia

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Andrei Kravtsov, a
former circus artist, won three gold medals in four events
Wednesday, helping his adopted country maintain its dominance in
gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games.
	   The Russian-born Kravtsov won the floor exercises (9.325),
pommel horse (9.487) and parallel bars (9.637). The 27-year-old
gymnast already had won the men's individual all-round gold and was
part of the silver medalist men's team.
	   ``I didn't come here to get gold medals or anything. I just
wanted to please myself and please the audience and ended up with
these golds,'' said Kravtsov, who is known to his teammates as
``Red'' because of his Russian background.
	   This was the first time one athlete has taken three gold medals
in the apparatus events at the Commonwealth Games. The previous
best was two by Canadian Curtis Hibbert in 1990.
	   Kravtsov could have well taken the gold on the high bar _ his
speciality during his circus years of 1989-92 _ but a bad landing
prevented that.
	   The awkward ending after four perfect hand-stand pirouettes and
two release series with firm catches was the only mistake he made
Wednesday. It gave him 8.662, not even good enough for a bronze.
	   ``I was so tired up there. I wasn't really caring,'' said
Kravtsov, who had performed 16 times during the last week at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Georgian-born Alexander Jeltkov of Canada won on the high bar
(9.425). Another Canadian, Kris Burley (9.000), took the silver.
	   Kravtsov, still struggling with a shoulder injury sustained in
training last week, opted out of the vault and did not compete in
the rings.
	   South Africans Simon Hutcheon and Christian Brezeanu won the
vault gold and silver.
	   Australia's Pavel Mamine edged England's Andrew Atherton 9.337
to 9.325 on the rings.
	   Kravtsov said he will ``probably have a drink and an early
night'' to sleep away the weeks of tension and nervousness.
	   Kravtsov, who used to live in the town of Kursk outside Moscow,
had quit gymnastics at age 19 and joined the Royal London Circus.
While performing in Kuala Lumpur in 1992, he flew to Australia for
a holiday with his Australian girlfriend, a dancer in the circus,
and stayed there for good.
	   He joined a gymnastics club and got into the sport full time,
never returning to Russia.

Norwegian soldier wounded in shell fire in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Norwegian soldier was wounded Wednesday
when a mortar round fired by an Israeli army tank hit a U.N.
military outpost in south Lebanon, a U.N. statement said.
	   The statement said the Israeli tank fired three rounds in
southerly direction into a seven-man Norwegian patrol.
	   ``One soldier was hit with shrapnel wounds in his left hand,
resulting in the loss of one finger,'' it added. The soldier was
reported in stable condition at the U.N. field hospital in the
border town of Naqoura.
	   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, said UNIFIL has strongly protested the incident.
	   In Israel, the army said an Israeli tank had fired at what it
termed ``suspicious movement'' on the eastern side of Israel's
so-called security zone. The commander of Israeli troops in the
area ordered an inquiry.
	   The position hit is in Blatt, a Shiite Muslim village north of a
border enclave occupied by Israeli troops in south Lebanon. The
area is 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of Israel's northern Galilee
panhandle.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after an Israeli invasion.
Nine nations contribute to the force: Finland, Italy, France,
Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Fiji.

Malaysian police chief threatens Anwar with prosecution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy premier
will face charges if he keeps holding public rallies without
permission, and more of his associates will be arrested, the
national police chief said Wednesday.
	   ``If there is no permit, he cannot (hold rallies),'' Inspector
General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor was quoted as saying by the
official Bernama news agency.
	   The threat was made against Anwar Ibrahim, who was fired from
his posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister on Sept. 2.
Since then, he has held nearly daily rallies of thousands of
supporters to call for political reform.
	   Authorities are cracking down on him and his allies. Anwar said
Wednesday the man who had been his private secretary at the deputy
prime minister's office was arrested, bringing the number of
arrested associates to five.
	   The former secretary, Mohamed Azmin Ali, had gone to the federal
police headquarters with his attorney when called for questioning,
but was arrested when he arrived, Anwar said.
	   Abdul Rahim said several more arrests would take place in the
next few days, even if those sought were in Anwar's house, Bernama
reported.
	   When he was asked if police would arrest Anwar himself, Abdul
Rahim replied, ``Be patient.''
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged with any crime, he
has been accused of leaking state secrets, sedition, tampering with
police investigations and having sex with several women and a man.
	   Anwar has said the police are not arresting him now because they
do not want an embarrassing incident during the Commonwealth Games
and the visit, from Sept. 21, of Queen Elizabeth II. Yet, he said,
associates are detained and are pressured to give evidence against
him.
	   ``I don't know if it's (the) East German system or the Shabak
(Shin Bet) or Mossad,'' Anwar said.
	   The Shin Bet security service, also known by its acronym,
Shabak, deals with internal Israeli security, while the Mossad is
Israel's intelligence agency, dealing with external security.
	   Abdul Rahim reacted angrily to the comparison to Israelis.
Malaysia's government is frequently critical of Israel and has even
opposed visits by Israeli leaders to neighboring Singapore. The
prime minister blamed Jewish currency traders, bankers and
investors last year for some of Malaysia's financial market
troubles.
	   ``We can no longer tolerate it when he accuses us of being
similar to Israel,'' Abdul told local reporters. ``If he had
accused us of being similar to pirates, then we could accept that.
But not that he equates us with Israel, because Israel is a
sensitive word in this country.''

Fighting in Kosovo extends to previously unharmed north

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with six Albanians and one Serb policeman killed, more
fighting confirmed by Serb sources
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded 12
villages in the north of Kosovo Wednesday, bringing the crackdown
on ethnic Albanian rebels to a previously calm area of the
strife-torn province, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   ``We see this as a tendency for Serb offensive operations to
extend further north,'' said Muhamet Hamiti, a spokesman for the
pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``This means more than half
of Kosovo has been directly affected by the Serb offensive of the
last seven months.''
	   Serb police confirmed the fighting, saying one of their officers
was killed and four were injured Tuesday. ``Strong groups of
Albanian extremists were destroyed and six of their members were
killed,'' Serb police said in a statement, released by the pro-Serb
Media Center in Pristina.
	   Hamiti said Serb police and the Yugoslav army started at dawn
Wednesday shelling villages about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
northwest of the provincial capital Pristina. Ethnic Albanian
politicians in the area saw smoke billowing from three villages
Wednesday, he said.
	   The fighting in the region, close to the Stari Trg mine, began
Tuesday when an ethnic Albanian father and son were killed, said
Hamiti. The Serb police statement reported continued clashes in the
region Wednesday.

Eleven Ukrainian teenagers hospitalized with belladonna poisoning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Eleven teenagers from a boarding school in
Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have been hospitalized in the second
case of belladonna poisoning in a month, emergency officials said
Wednesday.
	   The youths, aged 13 to 15, were taken to the Bakhchysarai
regional hospital from their school in the village of Sokolyne on
Tuesday. Four of them were in serious condition, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said.
	   Some Ukrainian youngsters in search of a high have taken to
eating seeds from the poisonous belladonna plant. In mid-August, 13
youths vacationing at a summer camp in the eastern Donetsk region
were hospitalized after eating belladonna seeds at a dance party in
a village near the camp.
	   Belladonna, a plant which is the source of atropine, can produce
hallucinations but may also cause disruptions of sight, convulsions
and loss of consciousness.

Martin beats Fitz-Gerald for Commonwealth squash gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Martin quotes, other detail. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a contest between the two best
women squash players in the world, No. 2 Michelle Martin upset
top-ranked Sarah Fitz-Gerald to win the gold in an all-Australian
final Wednesday at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Martin, who won 9-0, 9-6, 9-5, overpowered her opponent in the
first half of the match. Constantly on the defensive, Fitz-Gerald
scrambled, fumbled and lunged and only won her first point at 0-5
in the second game after 15 minutes of play.
	   As the match wore on, 30-year-old Fitz-Gerald began to dominate
more points and dictated some of the pace but Martin, 31, kept up a
steady barrage of drives and tight angles.
	   ``That first game was a huge boost for my confidence,'' Martin
said. ``You've just got to stay on top and keep edging forward.''
	   A tearful Fitz-Gerald, who is sharing a suite with Martin and
one other athlete in the condominium complex where Commonwealth
competitors are lodged, said she was disappointed.
	   Both women had breezed through the early rounds, winning all
their matches by a margin of 3-0. Martin, winner of six consecutive
British Open titles, has beaten Fitz-Gerald five out of six times
this year.
	   The women face a tough schedule in the next two months, with two
tournaments in Egypt, three in the United States and the world
championships in Germany. Ironically, Martin said, professional
squash players often don't perform their best in the high-profile
events.
	   ``Because of all the tension that's in your system, all the
adrenaline that's rushing around, it doesn't really enable you to
play the best squash that you're capable of,'' she said.
	   The losing semifinalists in the women's competition, Cassie
Jackman and Sue Wright, both of England, share the bronze medal.
	   World No. 1 Peter Nicol of Scotland and No. 3 Jonathon Power of
Canada were paired up in the men's final later Wednesday.
	   In the men's, the bronze medal winners were Paul Johnson of
England and Alex Gough of Wales.

Thai court drops malfeasance suit against former prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai Supreme Court has dismissed a
malfeasance lawsuit against former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun
on grounds of insubstantial evidence, a court officer said
Wednesday.
	   The lawsuit was brought against the ex-premier by a judge whom
Anand had failed to promote.
	   Retired Supreme Court Senior Judge Prawit Khamparat filed the
case against Anand in January 1993, charging that he had failed to
carry out in a timely fashion a resolution by the Judicial
Commission, the judges' administrative body, that would have given
him a promotion.
	   Also sued were the justice ministry's senior civil servant, the
supreme court president and the justice minister who served under
Anand in 1992.
	   The high court said the plaintiff had failed to provide solid
evidence for his malfeasance claim.
	   Anand was regarded as among the most honest prime ministers
Thailand has ever had.
	   Even though the high court dropped the lawsuit, the case was
significant because it was regarded as part of a long-running
struggle for power in the country's judiciary.
	   It is unusual for Thai courts to agree to hear cases brought
against senior government figures, serving or retired, in
connection with their official duties.
	   Anand served two terms as an interim appointed prime minister,
in 1991 after a coup d'etat, and in 1992 after the forced
resignation of his successor.
	   He expressed sympathy for the plaintiff, who he said had
misunderstood his actions. Prawit did not attend the proceedings.

Ukraine president sets up fund to compensate for lost bank savings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has
established a state fund intended to compensate people for savings
lost in banks, a top aide said Wednesday.
	   The fund, which is to accumulate money in a special Central Bank
account, would repay people in case the bank that kept their
savings went bankrupt or became insolvent, deputy presidential
chief of staff Pavlo Haidutsky said.
	   Although the fund is to compensate only for deposits amounting
to 500 hryvna (dlrs 180) or less, it would cover about 90 percent
of Ukrainians who have bank deposits, Haidutsky noted.
	   Kuchma's decree is among some 70 measures the government has
approved in recent weeks in an attempt to prevent the spillover of
Russia's financial crisis into Ukraine.
	   The fund would initially receive a single, 20 million hryvna
(dlrs 7.2 million) deposit from the central bank and then would be
supported by regular payments from commercial banks.
	   Haidutsky said the fund would help increase public confidence in
the banking system and prevent bank runs in times of financial
instability.
	   Ukrainians have seen their bank savings practically wiped out
twice in the last eight years, once following the 1991 Soviet
collapse and again with hyperinflation in 1993.

Firings at private TV station trigger protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS to CORRECT election date in 8th graf &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters gathered
outside Slovakia's main independent TV station for a second day
Wednesday, objecting to staff firings they claim are aimed at
manipulating news coverage ahead of upcoming parliamentary
elections.
	   The protest outside influential TV Markiza follows the new
ownership's announcement Tuesday that it was firing 12 news
executives and journalists.
	   The move prompted an angry outcry among opposition politicians
and their supporters and produced banner headlines in Slovakia's
newspapers Wednesday. Rallies were scheduled in seven other Slovak
cities.
	   The staff members refused to accept their dismissals, remaining
in control of the station's broadcasts Wednesday and appealing to
the public to keep rallying against the actions.
	   After more than a thousand people came to the suburban TV
building on Tuesday to show their support for the ousted staff, one
of the two new owners, Marian Kocner, pledged not to interfere with
the broadcasts and said nine of the dismissed journalists could
keep their jobs.
	   But at least three news executives, including the general
director and news director, cannot retain their positions, he said.
	   Opposition politicians and other Slovaks who attended an
all-night protest at the station complained that media freedoms
were being trampled. Some accused the authoritarian government of
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar of being behind the moves.
	   Meciar, whose ruling party is involved in a close race in Sept.
25-26 elections, has been accused by international officials of
thwarting press freedoms.
	   ``This is about freedom of speech and freedom of the media, and
also about access to information in a democratic state,'' Pavol
Hamzik, vice chairman of the opposition Party of Civic
Understanding, said early Wednesday. He spoke after addressing the
crowd of mostly young protesters standing in the rain outside the
TV building in suburban Zahorska Bystrica.
	   TV Markiza, which has been broadcasting since 1996, is the only
source of independent television news throughout Slovakia. The only
other broadcast received nationwide is state-run TV.
	   The station came under new ownership in August, but a lengthy
and murky court case prevented the new owners, Gamatex Group, from
taking control until Tuesday. They gave no public reason for the
dismissals.
	   Meciar, who is accused of backing Gamatex, denied he was
involved in the ownership.
	   ``The government ... is not involved in what is happening in
Markiza. It is only a problem between two independent businesses,''
Meciar said Tuesday night at a rally in Trnava, 52 kilometers (35
miles) northeast of Bratislava.

Asylum seekers get extended stay in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Asylum seekers from the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo whose applications to stay in Switzerland have
been rejected can remain until next spring, Swiss justice minister
Arnold Koller said Wednesday.
	   The decision to extend the period until the end of April next
year was taken because of the situation in the province, Koller
said.
	   Serb security forces pounded 12 villages in the north of Kosovo
Wednesday, bringing the crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels to a
previously calm area, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   Switzerland had previously said unsuccessful asylum seekers
could stay until the end of July pending a review.
	   The decision will affect more than 14,000 people.
	   Germany and Switzerland are the two countries with most Kosovo
asylum seekers.

New Zealand nominates former prime minister Mike Moore For WTO
</HEADLINE>
Position &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand on Wednesday
nominated former prime minister Mike Moore as a candidate for the
position of director-general of the World Trade Organization.
	   ``Mike Moore has the experience to provide firm, even-handed and
far-sighted leadership to the WTO that is appropriate for the
times,'' Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said.
	   The position will become vacant in 1999, when the first
director-general, Renato Ruggiero, completes his term.
	   Moore, 49, a former leader of the center-left Labor Party, was
prime minister in 1990 and remains a member of Parliament and
opposition foreign affairs spokesman.
	   Shipley said New Zealand's decision to field a candidate
``wasn't lightly taken,'' but the country placed a great deal of
importance on the role of international trade to generate global
employment and income growth.
	   ``We think at the moment we've got a very good chance and the
effort's going to go in to pursue that chance,'' she said.
	   Other nominations for the position include the deputy prime
minister of Thailand, Canada's former minister of international
trade, and there may also be nominations from Morocco and Brazil.
	   Nominations close on Oct. 1.
	   The WTO holds New Zealand in high regard for its pro-free trade
stance and its willingness to lead by example, but New Zealand is
also well regarded by smaller states who identify with countries
that do not have much international clout.
	   Moore said the director-general was chosen by a consensus among
nations and the decision would hopefully be made by the end of the
year.
	   The nomination comes ahead of an expected announcement by
Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon that he will seek the
position of secretary-general of the Commonwealth.

Villagers protest Shell Oil in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Villagers from southeastern Nigeria's
Ogoni lands staged a noisy street protest against Shell Oil, which
residents believe is trying to reestablish operations on the
disputed lands.
	   The protest which began Tuesday afternoon, went on into the
evening, local reporters in the area said Wednesday.
	   Shell was forced to halt its operations in Ogoni tribal
territory in the Niger River delta area several years ago after
violent protests erupted against the government and oil companies
in the area.
	   Clad in black shirts and chanting the name of Ken Saro Wiwa _
the late Ogoni author and activist _ protesters waved placards and
leafy tree branches while denouncing Shell.
	   Saro Wiwa, a leading Ogoni civil liberties proponent was hanged
by the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha in November 1995 after being
accused of treason.
	   Ogoni leaders have long accused the government and oil companies
of robbing their territories of rich oil reserves, while doing
little to help the impoverished people of the area.
	   They also accuse the oil industry of polluting Ogoni land.
	   Shell has instituted large scale social and economic development
programs throughout Nigeria's oil-rich delta.
	   Anti-government protests in 1994 culminated with a de facto
declaration of independence when Ogoni leaders set out their own
bill of rights and produced a national anthem.
	   The government cracked down, but not before several Shell Oil
facilities were attacked.
	   Nwoloam Nwaoko, an official with the Movement for the Survival
of Ogoni People, on Wednesday accused Shell of secretly visiting
their idle facilities with a eye on restarting operations.
	   ``Shell instead of showing remorse for the strife in Ogoniland
has surreptitiously reappeared in Ogoni,'' Nwaoko said. ``Shell
should be ready to pay us our royalty as clearly stated in the
Ogoni bill of rights.''

England, Canada crash Aussie pool party

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with finals; will be updated with later

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Empire strikes back.
	   England and Canada gatecrashed Australia's pool party at the
Commonwealth Games Wednesday, and changed the music.
	   England's James Hickman surged out hard and managed to bring
home a national record in winning the 200-meter butterfly, while
compatriot Mark Foster won the 50-meter freestyle gold.
	   Canada's Olympic silver medalist Marianne Limpert won the
women's 200-meter individual medley from compatriot Joanne Malar.
	   Hickman and Limpert said they were sick of Australia's national
anthem, which had played 17 times for 20 events on the opening four
days at the pool.
	   ``That feels really good because for once we don't have to
listen to Advance Australia Fair,'' Limpert said after clocking 2
minutes, 15.05 seconds.
	   ``Australia's dominated this meet so much that anytime you can
beat them it's a great feeling.''
	   Hickman admitted he almost blew his brave charge in the
butterfly, which netted him a record in 1:57.11.
	   ``It was a bit tough,'' said Hickman. ``I think everyone thought
I was going to stop in the last 10 meters, including myself.''
	   He went out so hard that silver medalist Bill Kirby of Australia
remembered seeing the Englishman pull out in front and thinking
``I'm having a shocker.''
	   Kirby finished in 1:59.57, unable to catch up over the final 25
meters. England's Stephen Parry claimed a bronze to match another
bronze by compatriot Sue Rolph in the women's medley.
	   Foster, who has the English flag, a red rose and the Olympic
rings tatooed over his heart, earned his turn to enjoy ``God Save
the Queen'' by clocking 22.58 seconds for the 50 meters.
	   ``I walked out on the track in front of so many thousand people
and said to myself: `If I can do this, it will not be a problem
winning this race,''' said Foster.
	   He was not delighted with his time but added, ``The object is to
win the gold and there is pressure there.''
	   ``I did get a very good start and if I'm ahead at 35 meters then
they've got to catch me,'' Foster said.
	   South Africa's Bredon Dedekind took the silver medal in 22.70
while world bronze medalist Michael Klim was third in 22.86.

Report: Thirteen turbine vanes stolen from Ukrainian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police have arrested five people suspected
of stealing 13 turbine vanes from Ukraine's second-largest nuclear
power plant but failed to prevent five of them from being sold
abroad, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The unusual investigation began a week ago when a guard saw
several people using a crane to load heavy objects onto two trucks
parked in a courtyard of a technical shop attached to the Yuzhnaya
power plant.
	   The guard reported the incident to her bosses, the daily
Segodnya reported. Officials soon found out that 13 two-ton turbine
vanes, altogether worth about 2 million hryvna (dlrs 714,000), were
missing from warehouses.
	   The vanes, made of valuable metal alloys, were meant to provide
water for a small hydroelectric plant being constructed at
Yuzhnaya, 280 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital Kiev,
said Volodymyr Pchelinov, city police chief in nearby
Yuzhnoukrainsk.
	   Pchelinov said it took police a day to locate a company at the
southern port of Mykolayiv that had bought the vanes for 160 hryvna
(dlrs 57) each. Seven vanes still were at the company's warehouses
and one was intercepted aboard a Ukrainian ship preparing to sail
abroad, he said.
	   ``Five vanes ... went abroad long ago and are now in Greece and
Turkey. Our people are preparing to go there,'' Pchelinov told the
newspaper, adding that five people who took part in the theft have
been arrested.
	   The police chief noted that the initial five vanes were stolen
nearly two months ago, but nobody reported their disappearance from
the nuclear plant.
	   Yuzhnaya, which has three Soviet-designed VVER-1000 light-water
reactors, is tightly guarded. However, security at its affiliated
technical shops and warehouses apparently leaves much to be
desired.

Ukrainian scientists protest financing cuts, delays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hundreds of scientists from the Ukrainian
National Academy of Sciences demonstrated at presidential and
parliament headquarters on Wednesday to protest financing cuts and
delays.
	   The academy has received only 60 percent of its funding so far
this year and just a quarter of the funds due in July-August,
according to scientists' union leader Anatoly Shirokov.
	   The workers are due 20 million hryvna (dlrs 7.2 million) in back
wages for 1996-97. In addition, the cash-strapped government has
introduced budget cuts affecting the academy and has decided to
reduce its staff by about 5 percent or 2,715 people, Shirokov told
the Interfax news agency.
	   Some 500 protesters who gathered in central Kiev early Wednesday
said the government's policies amounted to a ``genocide against
science.''
	   Ukraine's Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin, himself
a former rocket scientist, met with the protesters and promised
that the government would cover its debts for July-August.
	   But Shirokov noted that the revised budget provides only for 11
million hryvna (dlrs 3.9 million) in monthly allocations for the
academy, which he said was not enough even to pay the scientists'
wages.
	   ``The people are thinking of going from economic to political
demands,'' including demands for the resignation of President
Leonid Kuchma and his government, he said.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with parliament to give Berisha a chance to
answer allegations against him before moving to lift his immunity &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, ex-President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the government _ from
jail if necessary if police try to arrest him.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,500 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting slogans against Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, whom they blame for the weekend assassination
of popular politician Azem Hajdari.
	   Chanting ``death to Fatos Nano,'' Berisha's supporters marched
off toward the city's main Skanderbeg Square for another rally,
which ended peacefully. Berisha claimed thousands of others were
prevented by police from reaching the square.
	   He called for another rally Thursday and urged followers to
break through police barricades if necessary to attend.
	   Hajdari's slaying Saturday touched off two days of rioting which
has plunged this impoverished Balkan nation into its second major
crisis in 18 months.
	   Late Tuesday, the government demanded that Berisha's followers
surrender their remaining arms by dawn Wednesday or face a
crackdown. The party responded to an earlier demand by handing over
a pair of tanks seized during riots Monday.
	   But Berisha's bodyguards brandished semi-automatic rifles inside
party headquarters Wednesday, hours after the latest deadline for
surrendering them had passed.
	   Parliament late Tuesday also ordered a criminal investigation of
Berisha and his top aides for allegedly trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed. The head of a parliamentary
commission looking into the case, Spartak Braho, said parliament
would give Berisha the chance to appear before the full assembly
and answer the allegations before moving to lift his immunity.

Fastest qualifier Boldon doubts world record chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with 100m second round &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon cruised into the
semifinal of the Commonwealth Games 100 meters with a fastest time
of 10.05 seconds Wednesday and then said he doubted that he was
running on a world record track.
	   Surprised that no one had gone below 10 seconds in two rounds of
heats, the Trinidad sprint star admitted that he might fall short
of his bid to break Donovan Bailey's world mark of 9.84 in
Thursday's final.
	   Boldon had said earlier he thought the ``Caribbean-style'' heat
and humidity of Kuala Lumpur were ideal for a world record
performance.
	   But after watching big rival Frankie Fredericks run 10.15 and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados clock 10.09, he believed the brand new
track at the 100,000-capacity National Stadium might not be fast
enough.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track. It's not just
me, it's the times the other guys are running,'' said Boldon, who
runs the semifinals and final on Thursday.
	   ``I think Frankie should have run faster so I'm having a few
questions about whether it's a world record track.
	   ``If I'm going to have a chance for it I must aim for a very
good semifinal tomorrow.''
	   Waving to his fan club in the stands, Boldon, who is world
champion at 200 meters and has twice run 9.86 for the 100 this
season, said he was still targeting a first Commonwealth Games gold
medal.
	   ``I've having fun, seeing the sights and talking to you guys,''
he told reporters. ``Tomorrow's all business.''
	   Fredericks' modest 10.15 resulted from a poor start.
	   ``I was a little slow out. That's not a problem today. But I
can't afford to do it in the final,'' he said.
	   The Namibian only decided to compete in the Games Sunday night.
He threatened to pull out after hearing Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob no longer considered him the nation's top sportsman.
	   ``I was upset. But I thought it was the best thing to come here
and compete for my country,'' the two-time Olympic 200 silver
medalist said.
	   With his country dominating the Games in other sports, notably
swimming, Australia's Matthew Shirvington ran a personal best 10.13
to win his heat and follow Boldon and Thompson as third fastest
qualifier. Fredericks was fourth. But countryman Damien Marsh
pulled out of the second round with an Achilles tendon injury.
	   Of the Canadian trio, running in the absence of world and
Olympic champion and world record holder Donovan Bailey and
countryman Bruny Surin, Bradley McCuaig was only 12th fastest,
Glenroy Gilbert was the slowest qualifier and O'Brian Gibbons
didn't make it.
	   With four going through from each heat, Gibbons finished fifth
even though his time of 10.32 was much faster than Gilbert's, whose
10.42 got him fourth behind Shirvington.
	   In the first round of the women's 100 meters, Chandra Sturrup of
the Bahamas clocked a fast 11.14 seconds as fastest qualifier, with
Canada's Philomena Mensah winning her heat in 11.20.
	   The first medals on the opening day of athletics were in the
women's hammer and the men's 10,000 meters, later Wednesday.

Accused ``taken aback'' by body disposal joke, court told
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ A 17-year-old man charged with the
murder of a Japanese tourist was ``taken aback'' by a joking
suggestion that he had disposed of her body, his employer told the
state Supreme Court on Wednesday.
	   Warren Ellis was testifying in the trial of the man, who cannot
be named, who is accused of the murder of 22-year-old Michiko
Okuyama in September 1997.
	   The brutal slaying, at a time when right-wing member of
Parliament Pauline Hanson was campaigning against Asian
immigration, made some Asians fear for their safety in Australia.
	   Okuyama disappeared while shopping in the city. Her body was
found in a Cairns swamp 14 days later.
	   Her parents, Toshie and Hideo Okuyama, have flown to Cairns to
watch the trial and reportedly intend to establish a permanent
memorial to their daughter.
	   During questioning by prosecutor Jim Henry, Ellis said the only
time he saw the man react to questions was when a co-worker heard
about the case on radio and asked where he had put the body.
	   ``That is the first time I ever saw any reaction from him: he
was obviously choked, taken aback,'' Ellis said.
	   The prosecutor has said evidence against the suspect included
Okuyama's blood found in a warehouse where he worked alone; that he
was seen pushing a heavily laden wheeled garbage bin which was
emitting a foul smell from the warehouse to the swamp where the
body was found; and that bloodstained clothing belonging to the
victim were found in his caravan.
	   The evidence would show that she choked on her own blood after
suffering facial fractures from being beaten with enough force to
knock out some of her teeth, he said.
	   The accused's name has been withheld on legal grounds because
was aged 16 at the time of the offense.

U.N. human rights envoy in Cambodia sounds alarm on detainees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A top U.N. human rights official
expressed concern Wednesday over arrests, disappearances and
discoveries of bodies in and around Cambodia's capital since a
recent government crackdown on opposition protesters.
	   ``During the past week at least two people have been killed in
demonstrations, while the bodies of 16 others have been found
floating in rivers, in irrigation ditches, and in shallow graves
around the capital,'' said a written statement from Thomas
Hammarberg.
	   The two-page statement from Hammarberg, the United Nations
special representative for human rights in Cambodia, said many of
the bodies had signs of torture or other violence, including bullet
wounds and strangulation marks.
	   ``Several of the bodies had their hands tied behind their backs
and were gagged and blindfolded,'' he said.
	   While the U.N.'s human rights office in the capital had examined
just four bodies, it had detailed descriptions from multiple
witnesses of 12 others, including three women and two people in the
clothing of Buddhist monks, Hammarberg wrote.
	   The one positively identified corpse was that of 19-year-old
high school student Sath Sopheatra, said the statement. His body
had been found with that of another unidentified man, both riddled
with bullets and showing signs of beatings.
	   According to the human rights office, witnesses said the two men
had apparently been in the custody of plain-clothes police and were
executed by district military police.
	   It said Sath Sopheatra was reported to have taken part in the
anti-government demonstrations, which protested the July 26
election victory of strongman Hun Sen.
	   Police were cited as saying that the two dead men had been
robbers.
	   The statement noted that while the government has acknowledged
the arrests of just 22 persons, Hammarberg had received ``credible
reports of scores of demonstrators being arrested, including
students and Buddhist monks.''
	   ``Numerous other people have been reported missing by
relatives,'' it added.
	   Expressing serious concern that no other arrests have been
acknowledged, the statement said a list of missing persons and
reported arrests would soon be submitted to the government.
	   Hammarberg called on the government to publicly acknowledge all
instances of arrests and detention, list prisoners' names and
whereabouts and clarify the charges against them.
	   Persons without credible charges against them should be
released, he wrote.
	   Political leaders, security forces, demonstrators and the public
should refrain from using violence and turn to dialogue as a means
of resolving their differences, Hammarberg wrote.
	   ``Violence can only nurture the desire for revenge and provoke
still more violence,'' he wrote.

 &UR; US envoy gives NATO grim picture of humanitarian situation in
Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb forces pounded villages in
northern Kosovo Wednesday, the NATO envoys were given a grim
picture of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the
independence-minded Serbian province.
	   The search for peace is hampered by violence on the ground,
Christopher Hill, the American envoy to Kosovo, said after briefing
the NATO envoys on the worsening humanitarian situation in Kosovo
where months of Serb attacks and bombardments have created a flood
of of some 300,000 refugees.
	   With the approval of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, Hill is trying to forge an
interim settlement granting Kosovo self-rule. The hardline Kosovo
Liberation Army opposes this for it falls short of its goal of
independence.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Hill gave no inkling his peace
efforts were getting anywhere.
	   ``We very much support the idea of a political solution (for
Kosovo but) the search for peace is being made difficult by the
ongoing violence on the ground,'' he said.
	   In recent days, American and European officials have signaled a
growing in NATO capitals readiness to take military action against
Serbia even without prior approval from the United Nations.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic
Albanians there. Russia could veto military measures.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in German television
Tuesday military action could come ``in three to five weeks'' if
Serb forces maintain their crackdown.
	   NATO has developed three basic options for military action
ranging from a preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania
along the border with Kosovo to air strikes against Serb targets to
the deployment of ground troops to support a cease-fire or a peace
agreement, if any.

China `positively' considering 2008 bid; Samaranch pushes support
</HEADLINE>
for anti-doping agency &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Five years after its bitter defeat in
the race for the 2000 Olympics, China gave a strong indication
Wednesday that it is ready to bid for the 2008 games.
	   ``If we have a chance, then we will bid for the Olympic Games,''
said Wu Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee. ``We
are now actively, positively considering this matter. We are
looking at 2008.''
	   Wu told reporters that Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, capital
of the southern province of Guangdong, were the Chinese cities
being considered for a possible bid.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who made a brief stopover
in China last Sunday on is way to Seoul for Olympic meetings, said
he also had been told by Wu that China was ``positively studying''
a 2008 candidacy.
	   Samaranch has encouraged China to bid for the games ever since
Beijing lost the 2000 contest to Sydney by two votes at the 1993
IOC session in Monaco. The Beijing bid was dogged by opposition
from human rights groups, especially in the United States.
	   China chose not to bid for the 2004 games, which were awarded
last year to Athens.
	   Cities have until February 2000 to submit bids to the IOC, which
will then select the host city in 2001.
	   ``We have plenty of time to consider the bid,'' Wu said.
	   The declared candidates so far for 2008 are Toronto and Osaka,
Japan. Bids are also expected from previous candidates Istanbul,
Turkey; Seville, Spain, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Paris is
weighing a possible candidacy.
	   A Chinese bid would have a major impact on the race for both the
2008 and 2012 games.
	   China would provide a major challenger for 2008 front-runner
Toronto. That would be welcomed by the United States, which is
planning a bid for the 2012 games.
	   If Toronto gets the 2008 games, a U.S. city would have virtually
no chance of winning the 2012 contest because the IOC would not
send the Olympics back to North America four years later.
	   On another issue, Samaranch said Wednesday that he hopes the
proposed Olympic anti-doping agency could be up and running by the
end of next year.
	   The agency, which would coordinate drug-testing around the
world, is expected to be approved at the Feb. 2-4 anti-doping
summit in Switzerland.
	   Samaranch said the agency, which would be based in Lausanne and
run under the aegis of the Olympic movement, could be operating
five to six months after the conference.
	   Preparations for the February meeting, which was called in the
wake of this summer's drug scandals at the Tour de France, was the
main topic of the three-day IOC executive board meeting that ended
Wednesday.
	   Samaranch said he hopes all international summer and winter
sports federations will endorse the drug-testing agency at a
meeting in Lausanne, Switerland, on Oct. 27. The federations will
also be asked to approve a single IOC medical code providing for
unified rules, procedures and sanctions.
	   ``We need to go to this conference in Febuary united,''
Samaranch said.
	   He said the conference will seek ways to encourage government
involvement in cracking down on drug traffickers and unifying
anti-doping legislation.
	   ``We think at the moment what is going on is dangerous for the
future of sport,'' he said. ``If one country develops one law and
another country has another law with different sanctions, this is
not good for the future.''
	   IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz of the United States, who is
chairing a working group of athletes for the February meeting, said
she was inviting former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses and speedskater
Johann Olav Koss _ among others _ to take part.
	   Also Wednesday, Sydney organizers said Australian officials are
working to resolve the city's water contamination crisis so
drinking supplies will be safe well before the 2000 Olympics.
	   More than 3 million people in Sydney have been forced to boil
their drinking water after three contaminated water alerts in six
weeks.
	   ``I said clearly, `Yes, this is a problem. The problem is both a
surprise and an annoyance but it's a problem the New South Wales
government is committed to getting fixed,''' Olympics Minister
Michael Knight said.

Drunk camel driving charge thrown out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COOBER PEDY, Australia (AP) _ A man charged with drunken camel
driving had one charge thrown out of court Wednesday on the grounds
that he had no way of controlling the beast, drunk or sober.
	   Ricky Wilson Hall, 36, of Alice Springs was originally charged
with two counts of driving a camel while under the influence of
alcohol, as well as assaulting a police officer, resisting police
and using offensive language.
	   In Coober Pedy Magistrates Court, defense lawyer Pat Amey asked
Chief Magistrate Alan Moss to dismiss one of the drunk driving
charges against Hall on the grounds that Hall had no rein or nose
peg to control the camel.
	   Moss ruled Wednesday that Hall did not have control, regardless
of whether he was drunk or sober, when he jumped onto a young
camel.
	   The magistrate said he had no reason to believe that Hall was
anything but a ``hopeful passenger'' while he was on the camel's
back and holding on by the fur of its hump.
	   After dismissing the charge, he determined that Hall did have a
case to answer in the other three charges.
	   Hall pleaded guilty to the charge of offensive language.
	   The prosecution alleged earlier this week that Hall was driving
a wagon pulled by camels outside the remote town of Oodnadatta in
September 1997 when Sgt. Garry Griffiths observed he was drunk and
warned him not to operate the camel team.
	   It was alleged Hall ignored the warning and when later warned a
second time, he assaulted the police officer.
	   The court was told Hall then untied a young camel from the wagon
and tried to ride off, but the camel returned to the older ones at
the wagon.
	   Hall then leaped ``John Wayne style'' onto the back of one of
the other camels and tried to ride off shouting ``Yahoo!''
	   Hall testified Wednesday that he did not jump ``John Wayne''
style onto the second camel.
	   He said he had had about five beers between 12:30 p.m. and when
Griffiths stopped him at 4:50 p.m. but was not affected at all by
alcohol.
	   The case continues.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ More than half the people in
South Africa's main cities have been victims of crime in the past
five years, a major study published Wednesday shows.
	   Proportionately more blacks fear being victims of crime than
whites, according to the survey by the Institute for Security
Studies.
	   Two-thirds of Johannesburg's black residents and 87 percent of
mixed race people felt unsafe in their neighborhoods at night,
compared to 58 percent of whites, according to the survey. The
results were published in Business Day and The Star of
Johannesburg.
	   In Cape Town, the fear factor for blacks was 50 percent, and 20
percent for whites.
	   Crime has become one of the main issues in this country four
years after free elections ended the apartheid system. The topic
dominates newspapers, radio talk shows and dinner table
conversations.
	   Johannesburg was rated the most dangerous city, with 63 percent
of those surveyed saying they had been victims of crime there since
1993. The rate was 60 percent in Durban, 55 percent in Pretoria and
50 percent in Cape Town. The survey covered the four cities.
	   Among the 14,000 people surveyed, blacks were more
proportionately more likely to be victims in all the cities except
for Johannesburg.
	   The study is the largest of its kind in South Africa, said
researcher Antoinette Louw. No margin of error was available.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces pounded 12
villages in northern Kosovo on Wednesday, bringing the crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels to a previously calm area of the strife-torn
province, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   ``We see this as a tendency for Serb offensive operations to
extend further north,'' said Muhamet Hamiti, a spokesman for the
pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center. ``This means more than half
of Kosovo has been directly affected by the Serb offensive of the
last seven months.''
	   Serb police confirmed the fighting, saying one of their officers
was killed and four were injured Tuesday. ``Strong groups of
Albanian extremists were destroyed and six of their members were
killed,'' Serb police said in a statement, released by the pro-Serb
Media Center in Pristina.
	   Serbian forces are trying to crush rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, who demand independence for the southern province,
most of whose residents are ethnic Albanian. Fighting in Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, has killed hundreds of people
and created an estimated 265,000 refugees since February.
	   Hamiti said Serb police and the Yugoslav army at dawn Wednesday
started shelling villages about 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest
of the provincial capital, Pristina. Ethnic Albanian politicians in
the area saw smoke billowing from three villages Wednesday, he
said.
	   The fighting in the region, close to the Stari Trg mine, began
Tuesday when an ethnic Albanian father and son were killed, said
Hamiti. The Serb police statement reported continued clashes in the
region Wednesday.

Russian, Japanese musicians to perform for Yeltsin, Hashimoto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Mstislav Rostropovich and Japan's Seiji Ozawa
take turns conducting at a gala musical performance Wednesday
night, former Japanese Prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will be in the audience.
	   The concert at the Grand Hall of the Russian Conservatory of
Music is part of a celebration of Russian-Japanese friendship. Even
though the two countries don't have much history as friends, both
Yeltsin and Hashimoto and Ozawa and Rostropovich enjoy warm
relations.
	   Yeltsin and then-Prime Minister Hashimoto had a warm informal
summit in Japan in April, and addressed each other as ``Boris'' and
``Ryu.''
	   ``And I thought: Why shouldn't the great Japanese conductor
Seiji Ozawa and I also show our friendship, our bridge from heart
to heart,'' Rostropovich was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The celebration, called ``Heart to Heart: The Russian-Japanese
bridge,'' will include the performance of ``War Requiem'' by
British composer Benjamin Britten on Wednesday night, and
Rostropovich and Ozawa will take turns conducting.
	   Ozawa is later to lead the Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra in
four days of concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
	   Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named
special foreign policy advisor by his successor, Keizo Obuchi.
Obuchi served as foreign minister under Hashimoto.
	   Relations between Russia and Japan have long been strained. The
countries have fought two wars in this century, and are still at
odds over Russia's World War II claim to the Kuril Islands off the
southern Japanese coast.

Myanmar opposition convenes parliament of ten representatives
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from BC-Myanmar-Top General &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and
nine top members of her political party have formed a committee
representing arrested members of parliament and have adopted
resolutions in their names, the party said Wednesday.
	   The move appeared to be an attempt to hold a session of the
459-member parliament with only ten people, although a party leader
contacted by phone would not comment on whether that was the
intention of the committee.
	   Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy has been saying it would
convene the parliament elected in 1990, in which it won 82 percent
of the seats. The military has refused to recognize the result of
that election for the last eight years.
	   To prevent the NLD from convening the assembly, the military has
arrested 783 opposition members, including 194 elected
representatives.
	   The new committee claimed it had the mandate of the arrested
lawmakers.
	   ``The committee to represent the elected representatives of the
1990 multi-party democracy general elections was formed with the
mandate of the 251 NLD representatives elect out of the 459
surviving candidates of the 1990 election,'' the NLD statement
read.
	   The opposition has said that 181 other NLD lawmakers have either
died, been imprisoned, driven into exile, stripped of their
parliamentary status by the military-controlled election commission
or been pressured into resigning by the authorities.
	   NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, a member of the committee, said it
would reveal what resolutions it had adopted on Thursday. He was
vague in answering whether the committee constituted parliament.
	   Also on the committee are Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, NLD Chairman Aung Shwe and Aye Tha Aung, who is
representing ethnic parties whose leaders have been arrested.
	   Neither Suu Kyi nor Tin Oo ran in the 1990 elections because
they were under arrest by the military government at the time for
their pro-democracy activities.
	   The military government has warned the NLD leadership that
attempting to convene parliament is illegal.
	   Gen. Than Shwe, the leader of the government, called Suu Kyi and
her colleagues traitors in comments published in Wednesday's
state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   ``The internal traitors with pessimistic views are paving the
way for neocolonialists to interfere in our internal affairs,''
Than Shwe said.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, was once a British colony. The
country was isolated by its military government from 1962-88, and
its leaders still view the outside world with suspicion.
	   In defending the government's arrest of opposition members, a
spokesman said that several countries which had recently attempted
rapid transitions to democracy had plunged into ``rioting, looting,
violent death and even civil war.''
	   ``If the basic peace and stability the country has achieved are
lost, the ground work for democracy may be lost,'' he said on
customary condition of anonymity.

Defending champion Stephen wins three golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defending champion Marcus Stephen
of Nauru swept all three gold medals Wednesday in the 62-kilogram
division of Commonwealth Games weightlifting.
	   Three lifters divided up the golds at 56 kilograms _ Australia's
Mehmet Yagci won the snatch, India's Dharmaraj Wilson the clean and
jerk, and India's Arumugam K. Pandian the total. Pandian took
silvers in the individual lifts.
	   Stephen snatched 125 kilograms and lifted 167.5 in the clean and
jerk for a total of 292.5.
	   Australia's Yurik Sarkisian, who won all three silver medals in
the division, matched Stephen at 125 in the snatch, but the Nauran
took the gold because of his lighter body weight. Sarkisian had a
clean and jerk of 157.5 and total of 282.5.
	   India took all three bronzes _ Murugesa Arun for clean and jerk
and total, and Ganapathy Gnanasekar for the snatch.
	   At 56 kilograms, Yagci and Pandian both lifted 107.5 in the
snatch, but the gold went to the Australian because of his lighter
body weight.
	   ``I could quit now and die a happy man,'' said Yagci, who had
not eaten for four days before the competition and had shed 5
kilograms in the sauna to make the weight.
	   Pandian's 137.5 was second to Wilson's 140 in the clean and
jerk, but he edged his compatriot 245 to 242.5 for the overall
title.

Hong Kong property giant latest to join price war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS legislature passed motion to relax mortgage ceiling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A leading property developer said Wednesday it
will sell a batch of luxurious apartments at a loss, joining a
price war that analysts say could further hobble the beleaguered
property sector.
	   Katherine Hung, director for Cheung Kong Holdings, said the
company will sell the first batch of 24 units of its suburban
Paramount development at 3,468 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 445)
per square foot, a price she said would not generate profit.
	   But she declined to say how much a loss the developer will take.
	   ``This is a very small project and we have to react according to
market conditions,'' Hung said.
	   Cheung Kong, tycoon Li Ka-shing's property development and
investment flagship, became the latest to slash prices of new
apartments and condos.
	   Sluggish sales in the past few months prompted three leading
developers to cut prices for several developments by up to 30
percent last week.
	   Analysts have said they expect more developers to join the fray,
which also would drag down prices of used flats.
	   The price war is rattling the already battered confidence of
homebuyers in the market and discouraging them from buying,
analysts say, and this would delay the recovery of the property
sector, and the economy.
	   Property accounts for roughly one in 10 jobs and a third of the
territory's economy, which shrank 5 percent in the second quarter.
Job losses in the property sector are contributing to rising
unemployment, which is at a 15-year high.
	   Many homeowners are suffering under huge mortgage bills for
properties that are worth half as much as a year ago.
	   On Wednesday, legislators also approved a motion by a 31-17 vote
to relax a 70 percent ceiling on mortgages. James Tien of the
pro-business Liberal Party, who sponsored the motion, said it would
lift the property market by allowing banks more flexibility.
	   But Rebecca Lai, acting secretary for financial services, told
legislators allowing higher mortgage levels could lead to
unacceptably high risk for banks.
	   The motion has no legal effect but puts the government under
pressure to follow the legislators' wishes to some extent.
	   Most analysts expect prices to fall by another 20 percent to 25
percent, and U.S. investment banking giant Morgan Stanley forecast
prices would plunge 50 percent.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang earlier dismissed the forecast,
saying developers would not be willing to sell flats at a loss.
	   To stem the price fall, the government has frozen land sales and
lifted anti-speculation regulations. The legislature recently
approved funding for low-interest loans for first-time homebuyers.

Israel marks peace accords with report on anti-Semitism in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the 20th anniversary of its breakthrough
peace accord with Egypt, Israel on Wednesday issued a report on
what it said was pervasive anti-Semitism in the Egyptian media.
	   The 11-page document by the Government Press Office said
anti-Semitic stereotypes, comparisons of Israel with Nazi Germany
and the denial of the Holocaust were recurring themes in the
official Egyptian press.
	   The report contained quotes from Egyptian newspapers and
reprints of cartoons, including several with Nazi swastikas used to
symbolize Israel. The authors of the Israeli document noted that
the peace accords ask both sides to refrain from hostile
propaganda.
	   In September 1978, Israel and Egypt signed the Camp David
accords brokered by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter, laying the
groundwork for a full peace treaty signed a year later.
	   Relations between Egypt and Israel, cool since the signing of
the treaty, have worsened since the Benjamin Netanyahu's election
as prime minister in 1996. Egypt has joined other Arab countries in
blaming Netanyahu for the stalemate in Arab-Israeli negotiations.

Transport strike affects Rolling Stones, Champions League match

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Subway workers suspended the last hours of
a 12 hour strike to help tens of thousands of fans reach a Rolling
Stones concert, their union said.
	   Subway and bus drivers who walked off the job at noon as part of
a mass transit strike said they would return at 5 p.m. to help an
estimated 60,000 Rolling Stones fans reach Athens' Olympic Stadium
in time for the concert at 8 p.m.
	   The strike suspension was also affecting about 25,000 soccer
fans heading to a Champions League match between Athens'
Panathinaikos and Dynamo Kiev in a western Athens suburb.
	   The soccer match was originally scheduled to be held at the
Olympic Stadium, and Panathinaikos club officials have repeatedly
expressed their dismay at being thrown off their home turf by the
Rolling Stones.

Yugoslav Airlines to reconsider Airbus deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Faced with a European Union flight
ban, Yugoslav Airlines will reconsider its plans to purchase eight
Airbus A319 jets by 2005 in a dlrs 330 million deal, the national
carrier's sources said Wednesday.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
since the preliminary deal with Airbus was signed in March, the
Yugoslav Air Transport (JAT) is faced with the EU flight ban which
jeopardizes its financial stability.
	   ``The management will likely have to reconsider its
modernization plans by the end of September,'' a source said. ``And
political aspects of purchasing European-made jets amid the EU ban
could be considered.''
	   The EU last week banned flights by JAT to its 15 member
countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb forces
on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's southern
Kosovo province.
	   However, Britain said it will implement the ban in a year while
Greece said it will be done in six months.
	   Meanwhile, JAT on Tuesday displayed two refurbished DC-9-32 jets
including new interiors and hush kits for their noisy engines.
Unable to purchase new planes, JAT plans to renovate all of its
nine DC-9s, which are 27 years old, and eight Boeing 727 jets.
	   JAT's current aging fleet consists mainly of Boeing and Douglas
airplanes. The Airbus deal would mean that JAT buys new planes for
the first time in more than ten years.

Melbourne and Adelaide join Sydney in water quality scares
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The New South Wales state government on
Wednesday labeled an opposition call to fast-track upgrading of
Sydney's water system a political stunt, while the latest tests
showed low levels of contamination in the city's reservoirs.
	   The latest health scare, which officials have reportedly said
could last as long as six months, has been a major embarrassment to
the city playing host to the 2000 Olympic Games.
	   The government has been unable to isolate the source of the
contamination, and officials today called an emergency meeting of
international tourism operators to consider strategies to minimize
the damage to Sydney's image.
	   Meanwhile, Melbourne's water supply received the all-clear,
allaying early fears of a Sydney-style contamination by the
parasites giardia and cryptosporidium.
	   But South Australians faced their second contamination scare in
as many weeks with a report of a herbicide found in Adelaide's
Barossa Valley reservoir.
	   New South Wales conservative opposition Leader Peter Collins
proposed emergency legislation to fast-track a long-term solution
to the water crisis, saying meetings with water companies on Monday
had shown any upgrade would take two years to complete and cost up
to 800 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million).
	   But Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Craig Knowles labeled
Collins' comments a ``knee-jerk reaction in an attempt to get some
media.''
	   ``The government will do everything necessary to solve this
problem,'' he said.
	   ``We will do what other people say should be done and that is
use the experts to provide the solutions, and of course we won't be
falling for political stunts like this,'' Knowles said.
	   Knowles said he hoped the water alert will be lifted Friday as
scheduled, but the all-clear would first have to be given by the
panel of experts monitoring the contamination.
	   In a series of on again-off again warnings over the past five
weeks, more than 3 million people in Sydney have been cautioned to
boil tap water for at least one minute before ingesting it or risk
illness.
	   The New South Wales Health Department said Sydney's water
continued to show low levels of parasitic contamination.
	   A cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1993 was
blamed for the deaths of about 100 people and for making about
400,000 people ill.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.
	   There has been no statistical increase in illness during the
latest Sydney outbreaks, and some scientists have argued that the
bugs are harmless algae.
	   Melbourne's water supply has been tested and declared free of
parasitic contamination after fears earlier this week it may have
been infected with the parasites causing havoc with Sydney's water.
	   The Barossa Valley scare followed revelations last week that
Adelaide's Hope Valley reservoir had been closed since July because
of the presence of the giardia parasite, the same one partly
responsible for Sydney's ongoing water crisis.

PAL union reverses decision to accept agreement offered by airline
</HEADLINE>

substitutes word in quote in 16th graf; Stands as 2nd Ld-Writethru

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The ground crew union of ailing
Philippine Airlines on Wednesday reversed its decision to accept an
agreement aimed at helping the carrier survive, officials said.
	   PAL vice president Manolo Aquino said the board of directors of
the PAL Employees Association decided to reject the offer by
company chairman and majority owner Lucio Tan.
	   In a statement, PAL management said it ``deeply laments'' the
union leadership's decision, which has become ``a cause of worry''
for the airline's creditors and prospective investors.
	   ``The reversal is a big blow to the efforts of all those working
to keep PAL afloat, including the government, stockholders,
employees, creditors, suppliers and ordinary citizens,'' the
statement said.
	   The offer rejected on Wednesday would have given workers three
board seats and PAL stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement. The proposal had been
described as a last-ditch move to prevent the closure of the
57-year-old airline.
	   Calls to union president Alex Barrientos were unanswered late
Wednesday.
	   ``The members said they were prepared to face the consequence of
this action,'' Barrientos said in a television interview.
Barrientos had faced criticism from union members and leaders of
other unions for initially going along with the proposal.
	   Aquino said no immediate decision to close the company has been
reached and officials were to meet later Wednesday on the matter.
	   Under the proposal made last week, Tan offered to give 20
percent ownership of the company to its employees, which would
allow them three seats on the airline's 15-member board of
directors.
	   Each employee would receive 60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000
pesos (about dlrs 6,900) from the Tan group's shareholdings in PAL.
They would not be allowed to sell their shares until their
retirement.
	   The company also pledged to refrain from cutting salaries and
medical benefits, and to rehire retrenched union members who have
not received separation pay.
	   A majority of PALEA's 21 board members earlier voted to accept
the proposal.
	   Filemon Lagman, a leader of a labor federation that counseled
PALEA in dealing with PAL and later criticized PALEA's decision to
accept Tan's offer, said in a statement that the company should
instead specify parts of the collective bargaining agreement that
should be suspended.
	   Lagman said those provisions should then be renegotiated ``in
the light of the present financial difficulties of the company.''
	   The airline lost 2.2 billion pesos (dlrs 51 million) in the
first three months of the fiscal year beginning April 1, mainly
because of work stoppages.
	   A 22-day pilots' strike in June caused the heaviest damage,
creating revenue losses of about 200 million pesos (dlrs 4.6
million) a day, PAL says.
	   In the previous fiscal year, the carrier reported a loss of 8.08
billion pesos (dlrs 185 million).

Iranian demonstrators condemn Taliban, Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of men and women demonstrated
against Afghanistan's Taliban militia Wednesday, chanting ``death
to Taliban'' and ``Death to the U.S.'' as tensions between the two
neighbors run high over the Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   A day earlier, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
put the military on full alert, and both the public and newspaper
have been calling for avenging the murders of eight diplomats and a
journalist in Afghanistan.
	   The protesters gathered in front of Tehran University and
condemned Pakistan and its government, chanting ``Nawaz Sharif
shame on you,'' in reference to Pakistan's prime minister.
	   Pakistan is believed to provide the Taliban with military and
other support while Iran is suspected of backing the opposition
which represents Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The demonstrators read out a statement which accused the United
States of interfering in Afghanistan.
	   ``Once again the dirty hands of the U.S. created a militant
group from the Stone Ages which does not hesitate to kill innocent
children and women.''
	   Iran's government also has blamed the United States for
supporting the Taliban, ignoring the U.S. condemnation of the
murders of the diplomats and a recent air raid on bases belonging
to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden on Taliban territory.
	   The fundamentalist Taliban militia admitted on Thursday to
killing the eight diplomats and the journalist for Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency last month.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The bodies of seven of the nine slain diplomats arrived in
Tehran Monday.
	   IRNA also reported that one of two missing diplomats who escaped
and returned home, Allah-Dad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, witnessed the
``barbaric killings of the Iranians'' when the Taliban attacked
Iran's consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   It said Qare_Husseini was injured. The other diplomat, Hussein
Akbari, was not in the embassy during the raid, the agency said.

EU Commission rejects Italian plan to expand Malpensa airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The European Commission on Wednesday
rejected a plan by the Italian government to expand Milan's
Malpensa airport, ruling in favor of nine non-Italian airlines who
argued the plan discriminates against them.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive body ``had no option but to
reach the decision it did today,'' the EU's Transport Commissioner
Neil Kinnock told a news conference in Strasbourg.
	   He said there had been ``almost incessant'' contacts over the
past week between the Commission and the Italian authorities to try
and break the deadlock. But ``these efforts have been to no
avail,'' Kinnock said.
	   Last week, the EU Commission had ruled that the plan as it
stands violates the EU's fair competition rules. The Commission
gave the Italian government a week to come up with a new proposal.
	   Under the plan, foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan
would be obliged to move next month from Linate airport, just 10
kilometers (6 miles) from downtown, to Malpensa which is 53
kilometers (33 miles) from the city center.
	   Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights between Rome
and Milan would be allowed to stay at Linate.
	   Nine European airlines complained have that the poor road and
rail links from Malpensa to downtown Milan would make their
passengers switch to Alitalia.
	   On Tuesday, Kinnock held lengthy bilateral talks with Italian
Transport Minister Claudio Burlando on the margin of a meeting of
EU transport ministers in Austria, in a last ditch effort to
resolve the dispute.
	   ``That proved to be fruitless too,'' Kinnock said. He said he
remains open to any new proposals the Italian government wishes to
put forward.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Less than two weeks from election day,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl got some extra inspiration Wednesday from
his mentor _ the late Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.
	   According to the wishes of Adenauer's family, a portrait of the
former chancellor was hung in the room where Kohl meets with his
Cabinet. The oil painting shows the former chancellor sitting on a
chair in front of a hedge, a pose designed to suggest his love of
nature.
	   Adenauer, Germany's first chancellor after World War II, ruled
for four terms. It is this record Kohl wants to break by winning an
unprecedented fifth term.
	   When Adenauer's daughter died, her will stipulated that the
portrait be loaned to the government. Kohl ordered it hung so the
chancellor's image could ``look'' out the window toward the
Schaumburg Palace where he lived until he left office in 1963.
	   No matter who wins on Sept. 27, Kohl or Social Democrat
challenger Gerhard Schroeder, the portrait stays in the chancellery
_ unless the government tries to relegate it to storage. In that
case, the loan agreement stipulates that it be returned to the
Adenauer family.

Suharto's son is banned from traveling overseas amid bank probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with postponement of questioning, grafs 5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The billionaire second son of former
President Suharto has been banned from leaving Indonesia as
investigators prepare to question him over the collapse of a bank
partly owned by him, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Separately, Indonesia's attorney general said he and the
national police chief will be part of a three-member team that will
soon question Suharto about claims that he corruptly amassed a
fortune during his 32 years in power and stashed millions of
dollars abroad.
	   Indonesia's Justice Minister Muladi was quoted by local
newspapers as saying Bambang Trihatmodjo and other commissioners of
the failed Bank Andromeda had been prohibited from traveling
overseas while the investigation continues.
	   ``All have been barred, including Bambang Tri,'' Republika
quoted Muladi as saying.
	   Bambang was to have been interrogated Wednesday but police
postponed the questioning because they were still focusing their
investigation on two other directors of the bank. Lt. Col. Saleh
Saaf, a police spokesman, said the interrogation was rescheduled
for next week.
	   The police have already questioned some of the bank's directors,
including Chinese tycoon Prayogo Pangestu.
	   The development follows news that President B.J. Habibie had
ordered that Suharto be questioned over allegations that he, his
family and associates illegally enriched themselves.
	   In a recent and rare television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied
allegations that he had squirreled money abroad during his time in
office.
	   The claim has been greeted with disbelief in the local media and
by many Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet amid soaring
inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty resulting from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The investigators are expected to meet the former leader within
the next ``one or two days,'' presidential adviser Arnold Baramuli
said Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib said he
would head the investigation team that would also include National
Police Chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi along with a senior government
finance official.
	   ``We will met the president very soon and will investigate
everything in connection with Suharto's assets and bank accounts,''
he said.
	   Soon after replacing Suharto in May, Habibie ordered an official
investigation into corruption under the previous regime.
	   But critics say Habibie, a longtime friend and subordinate of
Suharto, hasn't done enough to investigate his old mentor.
	   Bank Andromeda was closed in November for allegedly violating
lending limits set by the central bank, Bank Indonesia.
	   It is one of 21 cases involving insolvent private banks that
police are investigating over possible violations of banking laws.
	   About 160 bankers are now under scrutiny.
	   Bambang has denied any wrongdoing.
	   ``I haven't amassed the fortune overseas. Most of the property
is here, and I'm not a thief,'' Republika quoted Bambang as saying.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said
Wednesday that some progress was achieved during his Middle East
mission, but that more needs to be done to restart Israel's peace
talks with the Palestinians.
	   ``One thing that's come true is that we've made progress in some
areas,'' Ross said after a two-hour meeting with Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while Hussein is receiving cancer
treatment in the United States.
	   ``But there are some other areas in the initiative that we have
launched that we see there remain differences and we have to find
ways to overcome those differences,'' he told a small group of
reporters at Hassan's rose garden in a hilltop Amman palace.
	   He declined to elaborate, but stressed that he continue his
effort to bridge the gaps between Israel and the Palestinians ``as
I stay in the region for a couple more days.''
	   Ross later returned to Jerusalem.
	   In the remarks, Ross said he briefed Hassan and Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh on efforts to restart Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, which broke down for the second time in January when Israel
rejected a U.S. proposal calling for an Israeli troop withdrawal
from a further 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   He said he has ``found a real, strong intent on both sides to
try to find ways to overcome differences and I think it is
important that they continue the effort and that we continue the
effort.''
	   ``One can never give up on peace,'' he said.
	   Asked whether he was disappointed with his Middle East mission,
he said: ``I have not finished this visit.''
	   On a French-Egyptian initiative to convene a parley to salvage
the peace process, Ross appeared hesitant to say if this crossed
with the American effort.
	   ``What is important for the Palestinians and Israelis is that
the relationship between the two improves,'' he said.
	   In Jerusalem on Tuesday _ a week into his Mideast mission _ Ross
gave little sign that the Palestinians and Israel were any closer
to an accord.
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
eager for a swift Palestinian-Israeli settlement to ease opposition
among its predominantly Palestinian population to its own peace
treaty with its neighbor.

Two Albanians from Kosovar arrested by police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Police confirmed Wednesday they arrested
two Kosovo Albanians after security forces recaptured the state
television station from supporters of former President Sali
Berisha.
	   The two _ identified Dritan Gjeci, 33 of Podujeva and Agron
Pashuni, age unknown, from Junik _ were arrested Monday inside the
television station, said Artan Bizhga, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry.
	   Both men had automatic rifles, Bizhga said.
	   The arrests confirmed that Albanians from Kosovo province in
neighboring Yugoslavia were part of Berisha's supporters who rioted
for two days in a bid to topple the government.
	   Berisha backs independence for Kosovo and publicly supports the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting Yugoslav police in the
province.
	   At a protest rally Tuesday at Berisha's Democratic Party
headquarters, two men in the crowd of about 500 wore KLA patches
and others wore KLA t-shirts.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon and Armenia signed agreements
Wednesday to avoid double taxation and to increase cooperation in
tourism and higher education.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri signed the agreements with his
visiting Armenian counterpart, Armen Darbinyan, during a ceremony
at Hariri's office.
	   Hariri and Darbinyan also exchanged the texts of a friendship
and cooperation pact that they had signed during Hariri's visit to
Yerevan earlier this year.
	   Darbinyan arrived in Beirut earlier in the day on a three-day
official visit. He is accompanied by a large delegation, including
several ministers and a number of Armenian businessmen.
	   Members of the delegation are expected to sign other agreements
on encouraging private investment in the two countries.
	   Darbinyan said in an arrival statement that his talks with
Lebanese leaders aim at strengthening existing political and
economic ties between Armenia, a former Soviet republic, and
Lebanon.

Le Pen's wife ready to replace him in European elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in last three grafs details of other wives standing in
elections, trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The wife of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen says
she will take her husband's place in next year's European
Parliament elections if a court upholds a two-year ban on his
running for office.
	   Jany Le Pen, in an interview published Wednesday by the
newspaper Le Parisien, is quoted as saying that she is ``not a
political woman,'' but that her husband would need a
``standard-bearer'' if barred from running.
	   A court has convicted Le Pen for physically attacking candidate
Annette Peulvast-Bergeal on May 30, 1997, in the working class town
of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris, where she was campaigning for a
seat in the French National Assembly. Le Pen was lending his
daughter, Marie-Caroline, support in her bid for a seat.
	   Le Pen ended up in a scuffle with a handful of people protesting
his presence, among them Peulvast-Bergeal. Television footage
showed Le Pen shoving her in the chest.
	   ``It's inconceivable that his momentum can be shattered by a
ridiculous jostle on a street corner,'' Mrs. Le Pen was quoted as
saying. ``My husband needs a standard-bearer. He knows that I'll be
there, like a symbol.''
	   Le Pen, leader of the National Front, denies the attack, and has
said the conviction is a ``politically-motivated infamy.'' He has
appealed his conviction, but the appeals court has yet to rule.
	   The Versaille court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two
years, meaning he can neither hold office, run for office, nor
vote.
	   That would force him to give up his seat in the European
Parliament and his post as regional counselor in the
Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern France. It would
also keep him from taking part in the June 1999 European vote.
	   Mrs. Le Pen said she and her husband had agreed to campaign
together if he is banned. But she stressed any political career
would be short-lived.
	   ``I hope I'd soon be forgotten and that I'd be allowed to get
back to looking after my roses,'' she said.
	   Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Megret, said last month that he should
run if Le Pen is ineligible for the European elections, prompting
an angry response from Le Pen, and suggestions of a near-schism
within the party.
	   However, Mrs. Le Pen told Le Parisien that Megret had given her
his backing.
	   It wouldn't be the first time the wife of a National Front
politician has stood for election to get around a ban.
	   Catherine Megret was elected mayor of the southern town of
Vitrolles after her husband was declared ineligible due to vote
fraud.
	   Cendrine Le Chevallier also won an election in Toulon earlier
this year after her husband, Jean-Marie, was found guilty of
breaking financing rules.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Namibian President Sam Nujoma and
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano disagree on military
intervention in Congo, but pledged to strengthen their country's
ties.
	   During a three-day state visit, Nujoma said Tuesday that
Namibian troops will stay in Congo as long as Congolese leader
Laurent Kabila needs them.
	   ``We have to come to the aid of any of us who falls victim to
internal upheaval or external aggression,'' Nujoma said.
	   Troops from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola are backing Kabila
against a six-week-old rebel insurrection.
	   Chissano said at a banquet that he opposes military
intervention.
	   ``Dialogue is the most appropriate path for a solution and for a
rapid return to peace in Congo,'' Chissano said.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The governing party is blasting the
U.S. ambassador, accusing him of interfering in domestic politics
following his remarks on the upcoming general elections.
	   ``The American ambassador is convinced he has the right to give
lessons to Mozambique through the press,'' said Manuel Tome, the
general secretary of the FRELIMO party.
	   The flap started when Curran was quoted as saying the 1999
elections will not be free and fair if the opposition doesn't take
part.
	   The former rebel movement RENAMO and 15 other opposition
political parties boycotted local elections in June, claiming they
were fraudulent. FRELIMO won.
	   ``For next year's elections to be fair, democratic, transparent
and serious, it is necessary that all opposition parties take part
in the process,'' Curran was quoted Sunday as saying in the Maputo
newspaper Domingo.
	   The ambassador also was quoted as saying he doubted his
government would provide any funding for the elections if the
opposition boycotted them.
	   Tome told the Maputo daily paper Noticias that Curran should
``refrain from sending messages, of whatever nature, through the
press'' and use diplomatic channels.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing human rights
abuses committed under white rule granted amnesty Wednesday to a
man who made illegal T-shirts with anti-apartheid slogans on them.
	   Robin Houston Holmes, 53, made the T-shirts at a time when the
white-run government cracked down on all forms of support for black
liberation fighters.
	   Holmes printed slogans in support of slain black activists like
Steve Biko. Other shirts referred to anti-apartheid campaigners
with the phrase ``We are Everywhere, Even in your Kitchen.''
	   Holmes was charged under apartheid laws with producing and
distributing prohobited material. The case was not pursued.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up in 1995, a
year after all-race elections ended apartheid. People from all
sides of the struggle against white rule can apply for amnesty for
crimes committed during apartheid.
	   ------
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ An environmental group called
Wednesday on the utility company Eskom to release details of
shut-downs of two units of a nuclear power station near Cape Town.
	   Earthlife Africa spokesman Davin Chown said the group is
concerned that Cape Town residents were in danger despite
assurances from Eskom that the shutdown at the Koeberg station
posed no threat.
	   Eskom national energy manager Brian Statham said the shutdown of
two units was ``perfectly safe, and there is no question of
meltdown or anything like that.''
	   The first fault occurred on Sunday. The second was discovered
Tesday, while technicians and engineers were still struggling to
repair the first turbine.
	   ------
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Roman Catholic Bishops meeting in the
southwestern city of Ibadan have called for an investigation into
the human rights record of late Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha's security apparatus.
	   The church leaders want security agents found guilty of abusing
their power to be dismissed to ward off a return to the
overwhelming repression that marked Abacha's five years in power,
the Lagos-based Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Abacha's military rule was reinforced with a network of shadowy
secret police, informants and domestic intelligence services.
	   ``There is the need to sanitize our security and law enforcement
agencies,'' the bishops said in a statement.
	   Abacha died of an apparent heart attack in June and was swiftly
replaced with another military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
who has promised to return power to civilian leaders next year.
	   ------
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ A media watchdog group said Wednesday press
freedom is threatened in Namibia following President Sam Nujoma's
accusations that the media is misinforming the public on the Congo
situation.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola have sent troops to aid embattled
Congo President Laurent Kabila.
	   In a nationally televised state of the nation address, Nujoma
accused the local and international media of distorting facts and
spreading pro-Tutsi propaganda on behalf of the rebels who are
fighting to overthrow Kabila.
	   The Media Institute for Southern Africa issued an international
press alert, indicating Nujoma's statements pose a potential threat
to press freedom.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ A ruling party leader has dismissed
the fuss over U.S. President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   Writing in the weekly newspaper Domingo on Tuesday, top FRELIMO
party official Sergio Vieira shrugged off reports that Clinton had
lied.
	   ``Did he lie about a financial crisis in the markets? Did he lie
about peace?'' Vieira wrote.
	   On a continent where African men often have several wives,
Vieira's comments reflected commonly held reactions to the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A regional offensive against car theft
and the movement of stolen vehicles across borders has had limited
success, according to Interpol.
	   The southern African bureau of the international police
organization said 671 stolen vehicles have been recovered this
year. They were recovered in joint operations to trace cars stolen
mainly in South Africa and Zimbabwe and smuggled between countries
in the 14-nation Southern African Development Community.
	   Police Commissioner Frank Msutu said Tuesday an average of 8,000
vehicles were stolen in the southern African region every month.

Liberal Iranian newspaper closed down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with arrest of paper's editor, director, ADDS details,
minor editing. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran closed down a liberal Iranian newspaper
Wednesday and arrested its editor and the managing director of its
publishing company, news reports said.
	   Tous was ordered shut for publishing articles detrimental ``to
the country's national interests and security,'' the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Its editor Mahmoud Shams and Hamid Reza Jalaipur, director of
its publishing company, were taken to the Islamic Revolution Court
to hear the accusations against the paper, the official state radio
said. They were accompanied by officials from the prosecutor
general's office.
	   The case will be decided in court at a later date, said the
radio, adding the newspaper was ordered closed until further notice
pending an investigation.
	   The closure came a day after Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei
called on the judiciary to deal with newspapers abusing the
country's press freedoms.
	   Tous angered hard-liners for it's anti-war stance. The newspaper
has been calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict with the
Taliban in Afghanistan and suggesting dialogue with the Islamic
militia instead of military strikes.
	   Anti-Taliban feelings are running high in Iran since the militia
admitted on Thursday to killing eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist. Demonstrators, newspapers and officials have been
calling for revenge against the Taliban, whose forces killed the
Iranians after capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug.
8.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners because it questioned the
authority of Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide, and asked how an
unelected person could wield more power than the president.
Moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who won more than 20
million votes in elections last year, has limited powers.
	   Tous began as the daily, Jameah, but was closed down in July by
hard-liners. When the paper changed its name to Tous and continued
publishing, authorities again ordered it to close, but later
rescinded the order.
	   Editor Shams was beaten last month by militants allied with the
hard-liners.

Indonesian poverty rises as economic crisis grinds on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hard-hit by its worst economic crisis
in 30 years, Indonesia now has almost 80 million people _ about 40
percent of the population _ living in poverty, the government said
Wednesday.
	   Social Justice Minister Justika Bahajar announced the grim
figures after President B.J. Habibie urged his Cabinet to contain
the growing percentage of poor, which is now almost four times what
it was two years ago.
	   Justika told reporters the government would continue to provide
subsidized food to millions of poverty-stricken families and would
try to train young poor people in job skills.
	   The National Bureau of Statistic has set the poverty line at
individuals earning 52,470 rupiahs (dlrs 3.50) a month in urban
areas or 41,588 rupiahs (dlrs 2.70) month in rural areas.
	   The criteria also include those who cannot afford food with a
nutritional value of more than 2,010 calories a day, a figure akin
to a weight-loss diet in more affluent countries.
	   Indonesia's once booming economy had been hit badly by Asia's
financial meltdown. A dramatic 80 percent drop in the value of the
rupiah last year has resulted in soaring inflation and mass
unemployment in the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   Big hikes in food prices have triggered a spate of sporadic
riots in Indonesia. Outbreaks of looting are reported daily and
student protests against the government have become more frequent.
	   There are fears that civil unrest might worsen unless the
economy turns around.
	   The price of rice, the staple food of the sprawling Southeast
Asian nation, has more than tripled. Earlier this week another
government minister said more than 17 million families were facing
dire food shortages ahead of a possible famine later this year.
	   Justika said official figures showed that 79.4 million people
had slipped under the official poverty line out of a total
population of 202 million.
	   She said that among the most desperate were 23,000 homeless
children, including 6,000 who roam the streets of the capital,
Jakarta.
	   About 10,000 people scour garbage dumps in Jakarta and the
nearby city of Bandung for food and resalable items, she said.
	   Until the crisis hit in July 1997, Indonesia had a commendable
record on reducing poverty, which in 1996 stood at only 11 percent.

Fighting in Kosovo extends to previously unharmed north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav army blocking roads, refugees fleeing
area, Serb reports with six more bodies found at alleged mass
grave, U.S. envoy warns NATO of humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb
security forces pounded 12 villages in a previously calm area in
north Kosovo Wednesday, while a U.S. envoy warned NATO of the
province's impeding humanitarian disaster.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb police and
the Yugoslav army started shelling villages at dawn Wednesday about
30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the provincial capital
Pristina. Ethnic Albanian politicians in the area saw smoke
billowing from three villages Wednesday, he said.
	   Serb police confirmed the fighting, saying one of their officers
was killed and four were injured the day before.
	   ``Strong groups of Albanian extremists were destroyed and six of
their members were killed,'' Serb police said in a statement,
released by the pro-Serb Media Center in Pristina.
	   Yugoslav soldiers blocked off all roads into the areas between
the towns of Podujevo and Mitrovica, refusing access to observers
and reporters. A few hundred refugees who fled the fighting said
the violence had reached within a few kilometers (miles) from
Podujevo, on Kosovo's northern border with Serbia.
	   Muhamet Hamiti, a spokesman for the Albanian information center,
said the fighting, close to the Stari Trg mine, began Tuesday when
three ethnic Albanian civilians were killed, said Hamiti.
	   ``We see this as a tendency for Serb offensive operations to
extend further north,'' Hamiti said. ``This means more than half of
Kosovo has been directly affected by the Serb offensive of the last
seven months.''
	   Meanwhile in Brussels, NATO envoys were given a grim picture of
the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the independence-minded
Serbian province where months of Serb attacks have created a flood
of nearly 300,000 displaced.
	   The search for peace is hampered by violence on the ground,
American mediator Christopher Hill, said after briefing the NATO
envoys on the worsening humanitarian situation in Kosovo.
	   Hill, who is trying to forge an interim settlement granting
Kosovo self-rule, spoke at a news conference but gave no inkling
his peace efforts were getting anywhere.
	   In recent weeks, American and European officials have signaled a
growing NATO readiness to take military action against Serbia even
without prior approval from the United Nations.
	   Late Monday and early Tuesday, Serb and Yugoslav security forces
ousted the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army from villages in the
Drenica region of western Kosovo, considered the KLA's last major
holdout in Kosovo.
	   According to a fighter near Cirez, four guerrillas were killed
in the action early Tuesday. No reports of Serb casualties were
immediately available.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominate republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Tuesday's attacks sent hundreds of Albanian refugees fleeing to
Cirez, where they joined about 10,000 to 15,000 people have been
taking refuge for more than a month.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people forced to
flee the fighting in Kosovo won't make it through the harsh winter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from 40
percent, to all but a few patches, mostly in the mountains. The
Serb offensives that started on Feb. 28, fighting has concentrated
mostly in the east and west of Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb Media Center said Wednesday that
investigators found additional six bodies near the western Kosovo
village of Glodjane, bringing the total found in the past week to
34.
	   Police accused the KLA of using the site as execution grounds of
their Serb civilian prisoners.
	   However, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has so far
refuses to comply with international requests to allow
international forensic investigators to the scene.

China urges Britain to resolve Vietnamese refugee problem
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China has urged Britain to help resettle the
more than 1,000 Vietnamese refugees living in Hong Kong, a Chinese
diplomat said Wednesday.
	   Wang Guisheng, China's senior representative to the Joint
Liaison Group, told reporters after the group's meeting that
Britain ``has an unshirkable responsibility'' in settling the
refugee problem.
	   There are 1,100 remaining Vietnamese refugees in the territory.
	   Wang also expressed concern about the 1.16 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 150 million) debt that United Nations High Commission on
Refugees still owes Hong Kong for the care of refugees in the
territory.
	   The commission has asked that the government write off the debt,
citing difficulties in fund raising.
	   But Alan Paul, the senior British representative to the group,
said it was no longer Britain's direct responsibility after the
handover, but that the country will do whatever it can in support
of the efforts of Hong Kong and China.
	   The working group, which was set up to handle details of the
transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in July 1997 from Britain to
China, met in the territory over the past two days.
	   The two sides agreed that the bulk of the group's work has been
completed, but some residual matters, including the Vietnamese
refugee issue, have not been resolved.
	   Since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South in
1975, ending the Vietnam war, nearly 223,000 Vietnamese have passed
through Hong Kong, most arriving by boat.
	   The government has deported nearly 13,000 refugees under the
government's forced repatriation policy introduced in 1991.
	   In January, Hong Kong abolished its 23-year old policy of
offering temporary asylum to the Vietnamese, and shut down the last
government-run camp for them in May.
	   Most of the stranded refugees are either classified as stateless
or are in jail.
	   Paul also reiterated Britain's praise for Hong Kong's political
progress, and said the legislative elections in May, the first one
under Chinese rule, were ``efficient and scrupulously fair.''
	   Wang and Paul also reiterated their countries' support for the
Hong Kong government's recent intervention in the financial markets
to defend its currency link.
	   Last month, the Hong Kong government took on currency and stock
speculators, ultimately intervening and changing market rules to
close the door on what it called market manipulation.
	   Hong Kong officials say the intervention was aimed at protecting
the 14-year-old currency peg, which has come under attacks by
speculators since October.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, ex-President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the Albanian government,
even if he is jailed.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,500 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting for the death of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom they blame for the weekend
assassination of popular politician Azem Hajdari. The killing
Saturday touched off two days of rioting in the impoverished Balkan
nation, where a failed pyramid investment scheme led to months of
unrest last year.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Parliament late Tuesday also ordered a criminal investigation of
Berisha and his top aides for allegedly trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha told the Wednesday press
conference. ``I'm prepared to continue my battle in any situation.
I will always be in the country alive or dead, in my house or
elsewhere.''
	   The government demanded that Berisha's followers surrender their
remaining arms by dawn Wednesday or face a crackdown. The party
already handed over a pair of tanks seized Monday during riots, but
hours after the Wednesday deadline Berisha's bodyguards still
brandished semi-automatic rifles inside party headquarters.
	   On Wednesday, Berisha's supporters held another peaceful rally
in the Tirana's main Skanderbeg Square, but the opposition leader
claimed police prevented thousands from reaching the square.
	   Berisha called another rally for Thursday and urged followers to
break through police barricades to attend, if necessary.
	   Berisha said his followers _ who helped topple Albania's
Communist regime in early 1990s _ would oust the ``dictatorship of
the terrorists,'' meaning Nano. Berisha has demanded that Nano
resign in favor of a ``technical government'' to arrange new
elections.
	   Berisha was president last year when pyramid investment schemes
collapsed, costing many their entire savings. Elections in its
aftermath led to Berisha's ouster and the rise of Nano's former
Communists in the Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also the widespread
disappointment with the government's inability to revive the
economy and restore confidence in the nation's future.
	   But the government appears to be standing firm.
	   Late Tuesday, parliament enacted a law transferring military
police and some commando units from control of the army to the
Interior Ministry. The decision gives the government the ability to
maintain order without calling in the army.
	   In an attempt to ensure support among the police, Nano this week
increased their salaries by 50 to 100 percent, the state news
agency reported. The government also said it would give police a
one-time reward of 30,000 to 50,000 leke (dlrs 200 to 340) for
protecting state institutions during the rioting.
	   Before the increase, ordinary policemen earned about dlrs 65 a
month. Members of the elite special force received dlrs 400 a
month.

Hamas leader issues veiled threats against Israeli leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction by Netanyahu adviser, earlier Yassin
quote to Spanish TV &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a threat against Israeli
leaders, the founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
Wednesday that those who ordered the killings of two top Hamas
fugitives ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   The fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot dead
last week when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout. The
brothers had plotted terror attacks in Israel.
	   In retaliation for the killing of the Awadallahs, Hamas said it
would detonate suicide bombings in Tel Aviv. The group trying to
wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords has killed scores of
Israelis in more than a dozen attacks since 1994.
	   In a Wednesday interview with The Associated Press, the Hamas
founder and spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, appeared to raise
the level of threats against Israel by singling out those who
ordered the killings of the Awadallahs.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said.
	   Asked whether he was referring to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Yassin said Hamas was not targeting the Israeli prime
minister specifically.
	   Yassin noted that Netanyahu ``lives in a high tower,'' an
apparent reference to the tight security surrounding the prime
minister.
	   On Tuesday, Yassin was asked by the Spanish TV station Antena-3,
whether Netanyahu had anything to fear from Hamas. Yassin said that
``those whose hands are stained with the blood of the Palestinian
people ... must be afraid of us,'' but did not name Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said it was
``regrettable that instead of fighting terrorism, the Palestinian
leaders level threats of murder against Israeli leaders.''
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said. ``The occupiers
should expect anything from us.''
	   Israel has buried the Awadallah brothers in an unmarked grave at
a cemetery it reserves for enemies of the state.
	   The Awadallah family has demanded that the bodies be handed over
for a Muslim burial. Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, on Tuesday called the Israeli burial ``an inhumane
decision and a risky step.''
	   Tibi said any Israeli plan to use the bodies as bargaining chips
in possible exchanges with Hamas would backfire and was ``an
indirect invitation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.''

Italians hope Clinton stays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP ) _ If Bill Clinton were the president of Italy, his
job would probably be secure.
	   The Clinton scandal is front-page news in Italy, where the media
has almost gleefully reported the most salacious details. But
Clinton is also seen as a worthy president and public sympathy is
strongly on his side.
	   In a poll released this week, more than 88 percent of the
respondents said they don't want him to quit or be impeached.
	   The poll, by the Milan-based Institute for Public Opinion
Studies, was conducted Monday evening by telephone. The institute
said 400 adults were questioned nationwide. The margin of error was
5 percent.
	   Newspapers, prominent public figures and commentators seem
stunned at the possibility that the leader of the world's most
powerful nation might be brought down by a sex scandal.
	   In an interview Wednesday in the daily La Repubblica, the
worldly, immensely wealthy industrial baron Gianni Agnelli, said
the United States seemed caught in a ``hellish'' tangle of politics
and morals.
	   The Clinton scandal, he said, ``has torn to pieces the concept
of privacy.''
	   Europeans, he said, ``are different.'' The French, for example,
weren't scandalized by the fact that the late President Francois
Mitterand had a mistress and an illegitimate daughter. ``It's
better this way,'' said Agnelli.
	   He called the release of the Starr report on the Internet
``monstrous'' and said he hoped Clinton would remain in office.
	   At the other end of Italy's political and cultural spectrum
Nobel prize-winning playwright Dario Fo, compared Clinton's plight
to a political assassination. In Italy, he said, ``at least he'd
have a trial behind closed doors.''

Nicol edges Power, Martin beats Fitz-Gerald for Commonwealth squash
</HEADLINE>
gold &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's final. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland survived the precise volleys and petulant outbursts of
Canada's Jonathan Power to win the gold medal in squash Wednesday
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   In a contest that lasted the maximum five games, Nicol edged the
third best player in the world, 3-9, 9-2, 9-1, 2-9, 9-2.
	   In the women's final, world No. 2 Michelle Martin upset
top-ranked Sarah Fitz-Gerald in straight games in an all-Australian
contest.
	   In the middle of his match, Nicol settled into the cool,
methodical routine that he has used to easily dismantle his foes
throughout the tournament.
	   At other times, he struggled against the hard-hitting Power, who
mixed up his game with soft backhand volleys that curled into the
corners and left the Scot flatfooted.
	   In the final points, Nicol pumped his fist as he sensed the
victory was his. He won on a stroke, when Power blocked his way and
was penalized a point.
	   The flamboyant Power, a bandanna with a maple leaf logo wrapped
around his head, sparred constantly with the referee. He cadged for
replays or free points if he thought Nicol was in his way, but the
umpire didn't always agree.
	   So Power yelled, grinned in disbelief, lay motionless on the
ground for several seconds and even lobbed his racket over the
glass wall of the court after losing one game.
	   Martin, who won 9-0, 9-6, 9-5, overpowered her opponent in the
first half of the match. Constantly on the defensive, Fitz-Gerald
scrambled, fumbled and lunged and only won her first point at 0-5
in the second game after 15 minutes of play.
	   As the match wore on, 30-year-old Fitz-Gerald began to dominate
more points and dictated some of the pace but Martin, 31, kept up a
steady barrage of drives and tight angles.
	   ``That first game was a huge boost for my confidence,'' Martin
said. ``You've just got to stay on top and keep edging forward.''
	   A tearful Fitz-Gerald, who is sharing a suite with Martin and
one other athlete in the condominium complex where Commonwealth
competitors are lodged, said she was disappointed.
	   Both women had breezed through the early rounds, winning all
their matches by a margin of 3-0. Martin, winner of six consecutive
British Open titles, has beaten Fitz-Gerald five out of six times
this year.
	   The women face a tough schedule in the next two months, with two
tournaments in Egypt, three in the United States and the world
championships in Germany. Ironically, Martin said, professional
squash players often don't perform their best in the high-profile
events.
	   ``Because of all the tension that's in your system, all the
adrenaline that's rushing around, it doesn't really enable you to
play the best squash that you're capable of,'' she said.
	   The losing semifinalists in the women's competition, Cassie
Jackman and Sue Wright, both of England, share the bronze medal.
	   In the men's, the bronze medal winners were Paul Johnson of
England and Alex Gough of Wales.

Germany requests extradition of terror suspect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Austria also wants Klein, details from Stern interview &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ German and Austrian prosecutors have
requested the extradition of a terrorist suspect arrested last week
in France after 23 years on the run.
	   Germany wants to try Hans-Joachim Klein, a former leftist
radical, for alleged involvement in a 1975 attack on an OPEC
conference in Vienna in which three people were killed. State
prosecutors in Hesse made the extradition request Tuesday.
	   Austria has also started the legal procedure to request
extradition of Klein, Gert Felsenstein, a justice ministry
spokesman in Vienna said.
	   Klein, believed to be a former accomplice of Cold War terrorist
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also known as ``Carlos the Jackal,'' has
been sought on an international arrest warrant for 23 years. He was
arrested in a town in southern France where he had lived for the
last five years.
	   An alleged Red Army Faction member, Klein invited reporters from
the Hamburg-based newsmagazine Stern to interview him before his
arrest, telling them that he planned to give himself up to German
authorities, the magazine said Tuesday.
	   That matches his lawyer Eberhard Kempf's assertion that he had
been negotiating with authorities to have Klein turn himself in,
although details were still being worked out at the time of the
arrest.
	   Klein told the magazine that he had not ``provably killed
anyone.''
	   During the interview, Klein portrayed himself as a man living in
fear of being discovered. He did not hold a regular job, working
instead as a farm hand or renovating houses.
	   ``The fear was always there,'' Stern quoted Klein as saying.
``In principle, I only left the house alone on Saturday afternoons
to shop and on Mondays and Fridays for karate training. Otherwise I
never left the house alone.''
	   While living on the lam, he met a teacher from Chartres, with
whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. The couple split
after 12 years.
	   Klein said the strain of his life in hiding brought thoughts of
suicide, but he decided not to follow through because of his
children, Stern said.
	   ``I somehow came to the end of the road, and had to make a
decision,'' Stern quoted Klein as saying. ``I don't want to go to
jail after all these years. But I'm doing it so I can begin a new
life.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Susie O'Neill won the
ninth gold medal of her Commonwealth Games career Wednesday,
matching compatriot Mike Wenden's record for most victories by any
swimmer in games' history.
	   Australia, England and Canada got two gold medals apiece on the
fourth night of competition, with Australia maintaining its huge
lead in the gold medal standings. Australia has 19, Canada four and
England three.
	   With their triumphs, England and Canada gatecrashed Australia's
pool party, and temporarily changed the music.
	   England's James Hickman surged out hard and managed to bring
home a national record in winning the 200-meter butterfly, while
compatriot Mark Foster won the 50-meter freestyle gold.
	   Canada's Olympic silver medalist Marianne Limpert won the
women's 200-meter individual medley from compatriot Joanne Malar,
while Mark Versfeld claimed a backstroke double, coming from sixth
at halfway to win the 100-meter event.
	   Australian Rachel Harris won a surprise 800-meter gold and
O'Neill swam the freestyle leg of Australia's 4x100-meter team,
capturing her fifth gold of these games after one in Auckland in
1990 and three in Victoria four years ago.
	   Wenden's tally of nine golds was believed to be a record for all
athletes in Commonwealth Games sports, but this could not be
confirmed by the Commonwealth Games Federation because of poor
record keeping.
	   ``It's really a huge relief to equal nine, to know I've done as
well as Michael Wenden now and I can put it out of my head,'' said
O'Neill.
	   O'Neill has a chance to break Wenden's record and equal Canadian
Graham Smith's swimming record of six at one games (1978) when she
contests the women's 200-meter butterfly Thursday.
	   She is Olympic champion in the event and said, ``The win means
more to me than the medal tally. It's my main event so I want to do
well.''
	   Hickman and Limpert said they were sick of Australia's national
anthem, which had played 17 times for 20 events on the opening four
days at the pool.
	   ``That feels really good because for once we don't have to
listen to Advance Australia Fair,'' Limpert said after clocking 2
minutes, 15.05 seconds in the medley. ``Australia's dominated this
meet so much that anytime you can beat them it's a great feeling.''
	   Hickman admitted he almost blew his brave charge in the
butterfly, which netted him a record in 1:57.11.
	   ``It was a bit tough,'' said Hickman. ``I think everyone thought
I was going to stop in the last 10 meters, including myself.''
	   Bill Kirby of Australia finished in 1:59.57, unable to catch up
over the final 25 meters. England's Stephen Parry claimed a bronze
to match another bronze by compatriot Sue Rolph in the women's
medley.
	   Foster, who has the English St. George cross, a red rose and the
Olympic rings tatooed over his heart, earned his turn to enjoy
``God Save the Queen'' by clocking 22.58 seconds for the 50 meters.
	   ``I walked out on the track in front of so many thousand people
and said to myself: `If I can do this, it will not be a problem
winning this race,''' said Foster.
	   He was not delighted with his time but added, ``The object is to
win the gold and there is pressure there. ``I did get a very good
start and if I'm ahead at 35 meters then they've got to catch me.''
	   South Africa's Bredon Dedekind took the silver medal in 22.70
while world bronze medalist Michael Klim was third in 22.86.
	   Klim's time was .39 seconds slower than his world championship
effort.
	   ``The thing that I was dreading this morning was missing the
start and that's what I did,'' Klim said. ``As I said, if you make
a mistake it's all over.''
	   Versfeld found himself near the rear of the pack when he turned
for home in the backstroke.
	   ``I saw it on the scoreboard and thought I'd better get a move
on,'' Versfeld said.

independence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The Armenian parliament granted amnesty
Wednesday to more than 1,000 people serving time in prisons or
forced labor camps.
	   The amnesty was granted in conjunction with the seventh
anniversary of Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union, and
was aimed especially at women, teen-agers, the disabled and
veterans of Armenia's conflict over the disputed province of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   In all, it will affect 920 prison inmates and 150 people
assigned to forced labor. In addition, the order reduces the
sentences of 240 prisoners.
	   The amnesty will not apply to anyone who committed serious
crimes, with sentences longer than five years, or those who have
been granted amnesty in the past.

Iranian demonstrators condemn Taliban, Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of Iranians demonstrated against
Afghanistan's Taliban militia Wednesday, chanting ``death to
Taliban'' and ``death to the U.S.'' amid high tension between the
two neighbors over the Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   A day earlier, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
put the military on full alert, and both the public and newspapers
have been calling for avenging the slaying of eight diplomats and a
journalist in Afghanistan.
	   Protesters gathered in front of Tehran University and condemned
Pakistan and its government, chanting ``Nawaz Sharif shame on
you,'' in reference to Pakistan's prime minister.
	   Pakistan is believed to be providing the Taliban with military
and other support while Iran is suspected of backing the
opposition, which represents Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The demonstrators read out a statement which accused the United
States of interfering in Afghanistan.
	   ``Once again the dirty hands of the U.S. created a militant
group from the Stone Ages which does not hesitate to kill innocent
children and women.''
	   Iran's government also has blamed the United States for
supporting the Taliban _ despite U.S. condemnation of the killing
of the diplomats and a recent missile attack on bases suspected of
belonging to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden on Taliban territory.
	   The Taliban said Wednesday it was ready to negotiate with Iran
but warned that it has Scud missiles in its arsenal to defend its
borders if necessary.
	   Hakim Mujahed, the Taliban delegate to the United Nations, told
The Associated Press: ``It is up to the United Nations to come up
with a plan for mediation. We are ready to meet Iran anywhere.''
	   The Taliban admitted Thursday to killing the eight diplomats and
the journalist for Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
last month.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and there have been widespread calls in the country
for a strike on the Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after
capturing the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to the border
region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   IRNA reported that one of two missing diplomats who escaped and
returned home, Allah-Dad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, witnessed the
``barbaric killings of the Iranians'' when the Taliban attacked
Iran's consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   It said Qare-Husseini was injured. The other diplomat, Hussein
Akbari, was not in the consulate during the raid, the agency said.

Melbourne and Adelaide join Sydney in water quality scares
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The New South Wales state government on
Wednesday dismissed an opposition call to fast-track upgrading of
Sydney's tainted water system as a political stunt, while the
latest tests showed low levels of contamination in the city's
reservoirs.
	   The latest health scare, which officials have reportedly said
could last as long as six months, has been a major embarrassment to
the city playing host to the 2000 Olympic Games.
	   The government has been unable to isolate the source of the
contamination, and officials today called an emergency meeting of
international tourism operators to consider strategies to minimize
the damage to Sydney's image.
	   Meanwhile, Melbourne's water supply received the all-clear,
allaying early fears of a Sydney-style contamination by the
parasites giardia and cryptosporidium.
	   But South Australians faced their second contamination scare in
as many weeks with a report of a herbicide found in Adelaide's
Barossa Valley reservoir.
	   In a series of on again-off again warnings over the past five
weeks, more than 3 million people in Sydney have been cautioned to
boil tap water for at least one minute before ingesting it or risk
illness.
	   The New South Wales Health Department said Sydney's water
continued to show low levels of parasitic contamination.
	   New South Wales conservative opposition Leader Peter Collins
proposed emergency legislation to fast-track a long-term solution
to the water crisis, saying meetings with water companies on Monday
had shown any upgrade would take two years to complete and cost up
to 800 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million).
	   But Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Craig Knowles labeled
Collins' comments a ``knee-jerk reaction in an attempt to get some
media.''
	   ``The government will do everything necessary to solve this
problem,'' he said.
	   ``We will do what other people say should be done and that is
use the experts to provide the solutions, and of course we won't be
falling for political stunts like this,'' Knowles said.
	   Knowles said he hoped the water alert will be lifted Friday as
scheduled, but the all-clear would first have to be given by the
panel of experts monitoring the contamination.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.
	   There has been no statistical increase in illness during the
latest Sydney outbreaks, and some scientists have argued that the
bugs are harmless algae.

Fastest qualifier Boldon doubts world record chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first medals _ women's hammer and men's 10,000m &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon cruised into the
semifinal of the Commonwealth Games 100 meters with a fastest time
of 10.05 seconds Wednesday and then said he doubted that he was
running on a world record track.
	   Surprised that no one had gone below 10 seconds in two rounds of
heats, the Trinidad sprint star admitted that he might fall short
of his bid to break Donovan Bailey's world mark of 9.84 in
Thursday's final.
	   Boldon had said earlier he thought the ``Caribbean-style'' heat
and humidity of Kuala Lumpur were ideal for a world record
performance.
	   But after watching big rival Frankie Fredericks run 10.15 and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados clock 10.09, he believed the brand new
track at the 100,000-capacity National Stadium might not be fast
enough.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track. It's not just
me, it's the times the other guys are running,'' said Boldon, who
runs the semifinals and final on Thursday.
	   ``I think Frankie should have run faster so I'm having a few
questions about whether it's a world record track.
	   ``If I'm going to have a chance for it I must aim for a very
good semifinal tomorrow.''
	   The opening day of athletics saw Kenyans 1-2 in the men's 10,000
meters, with Simon Maina beating William Kalya and Australia's
Steve Moneghetti taking bronze to gain a medal for the fourth
Commonwealth Games in a row.
	   Maina ran virtually alone for the last 6,000 meters after making
a break and he won the race by some 250. Moneghetti, usually a
marathon expert, threatened to take silver with a late burst but
Kalya held on.
	   Australia's Deborah Sosimenko made a little bit of Games history
by winning the first women's hammer with a heave of 66.56 meters
ahead of England's Lorraine Shaw, who threw 62.66, and Canada's
Caroline Wittrin, who had 61.67.
	   Waving to his fan club in the stands, Boldon, who is world
champion at 200 meters and has twice run 9.86 for the 100 this
season, said he was still targeting a first Commonwealth Games gold
medal.
	   ``I've having fun, seeing the sights and talking to you guys,''
he told reporters. ``Tomorrow's all business.''
	   Fredericks' modest 10.15 resulted from a poor start.
	   ``I was a little slow out. That's not a problem today. But I
can't afford to do it in the final,'' he said.
	   The Namibian only decided to compete in the Games Sunday night.
He threatened to pull out after hearing Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob no longer considered him the nation's top sportsman.
	   ``I was upset. But I thought it was the best thing to come here
and compete for my country,'' the two-time Olympic 200 silver
medalist said.
	   With his country dominating the Games in other sports, notably
swimming, Australia's Matthew Shirvington ran a personal best 10.13
to win his heat and follow Boldon and Thompson as third fastest
qualifier. Fredericks was fourth. But countryman Damien Marsh
pulled out of the second round with an Achilles tendon injury.
	   Of the Canadian trio, running in the absence of world and
Olympic champion and world record holder Donovan Bailey and
countryman Bruny Surin, Bradley McCuaig was only 12th fastest,
Glenroy Gilbert was the slowest qualifier and O'Brian Gibbons
didn't make it.
	   With four going through from each heat, Gibbons finished fifth
even though his time of 10.32 was much faster than Gilbert's, whose
10.42 got him fourth behind Shirvington.
	   In the first round of the women's 100 meters, Chandra Sturrup of
the Bahamas clocked a fast 11.14 seconds as fastest qualifier, with
Canada's Philomena Mensah winning her heat in 11.20.

Warburg Dillon Read, Nikko Securities cut staff in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Joining the ranks of other Asian financial
crisis victims, two international investment banks on Wednesday cut
70 staff members from their offices in Hong Kong and Asia.
	   Warburg Dillon Read Ltd., the investment banking unit of banking
giant UBS AG of Switzerland, cut 13 percent of its equities
research and sales staff from a team of 320 in Asia, said Glendy
Chu, a spokeswoman in the Hong Kong office.
	   The staff were from offices in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia,
South Korea, India, the Philippines and Indonesia, she said.
	   Renate Boerner, joint-head of corporate communications at
Warburg in Hong Kong, said some U.S.-based employees that sell and
trade Asian shares would also be laid off.
	   Boerner said the job cuts resulted from the merger of Swiss Bank
Corp. with UBS earlier this year, as well as the economic crisis
that has ravaged the Asian region.
	   ``This is in line with prevailing market conditions. Everyone
knows what's going on (in the Asian markets) ... We're responding
to that change,'' Boerner said.
	   Warburg was formed when Swiss Bank Corp. and UBS merged to form
the banking giant UBS AG earlier this year.
	   The Asian financial crisis and subsequent mergers also hit
Japanese investment bank Nikko Securities Co. (Asia) Ltd., which
slashed about 20 percent from its Hong Kong-based team of about
150.
	   More job cuts are planned in the Singapore office, Dow Jones
Newswires quoted a source close to the firm as saying.
	   The firm cut jobs in the research, sales, fixed-income and
settlement divisions.
	   Staff at the firm had been expecting the cuts for several weeks,
following Nikko's comprehensive tie-up with the Travelers Group,
which included the establishment of an investment banking joint
venture in Japan. In late August, Nikko bought 51 percent of
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney Japan Ltd.
	   Thousands of market analysts and equities brokers in Asia have
lost their jobs due to the financial crisis that hit Asian markets
more than a year ago. More job cuts are expected.

Indian men trounce Trinidad and Tobago, women lose to Aussies

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ India's men trounced Trinidad and
Tobago 8-0 but its women lost 4-0 to the Australians Wednesday in
the field hockey competition of the Commonwealth Games.
	   With the ball rarely leaving Indian sticks, star forward Dhanraj
Pillai, Baljit Singh and P. Laxmanan scored two goals each while V.
Selvaraj and Gagan Ajit Singh had one each in the Group A match.
	   The previously unbeaten Indian women, however, were no match for
the Australians, who now top Group A and are the favorites to win
the gold.
	   For Australia, striker Shelley Andrews scored in the 10th and
62nd minutes and Katrina Powell in the 12th and 22nd.
	   The Indian women might have lost by a wider margin had a
second-half goal been allowed. The umpires appeared not to realize
that the ball went through a hole in the middle of the goal netting
and Australian pleas and protests went in vain.
	   The Australian women already had won their first three games by
a total of 29 goals to none, against Scotland, Malaysia and
Jamaica.
	   They had earned 49 penalty corners to one (unconverted) and
rained 102 shots on goal to just seven against them.
	   They have just one easy group match against Trinidad and Tobago
Thursday before Saturday's semifinal.
	   In Group B, New Zealand moved closer to a semifinal berth by
edging Canada 2-1.
	   Canada scored first when skipper Laurelee Kopeck flicked the
ball in off a short corner rebound in the 23rd minute.
	   Mandy Smith scored the equalizer and Robbie Matthews put in the
winner in the 40th minute.

German president confident of South Korea's economic recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ German President Roman Herzog said
Wednesday his country will expand investment in South Korea to help
the Asian nation recover from its financial crisis.
	   Shortly after the president's commitment, German officials
pledged to provide South Korea with dlrs 200 million in export
credit, Foreign Ministry officials said.
	   South Korean exporters will use the loans to cover the period
between sending the goods abroad and receiving payment, the
officials said.
	   With banks tightening credit, it has become increasingly
difficult for South Korean exporters to find such loans.
	   ``We are confident that South Korea will recover from the
current economic crisis, and Germany will support South Korea by
expanding investment,'' Herzog was quoted as telling Park June-kyu,
speaker of South Korea's legislative National Assembly.
	   Herzog began his five-day trip to South Korea by meeting with
President Kim Dae-jung on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday, Herzog also attended a forum where scholars and
businessmen from both countries discussed ways to boost cultural
and economic exchanges.
	   With its economy in its worst slump in years, South Korea is
wooing foreign investors. German investment in South Korea totalled
dlrs 1.1 billion as of late last year.
	   Some 30 German businessmen were accompanying the German
president to discuss trade and investment opportunities with their
South Korean counterparts.

Sudan claims 50 Ugandans, rebels killed in clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army has repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in southern Sudan, killing more than 50
Ugandans and Sudanese rebels, a government newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Three Sudanese government soldiers were also killed and five
others injured in Tuesday's clashes in Liria, Torit and Jabalain in
the province of Eastern Equatoria, which borders Uganda, the
official Al-Anbaa daily said.
	   It quoted a military statement as saying Ugandan forces and
southern Sudanese rebels used heavy artillery and tanks in their
attacks.
	   ``These intensive battles, in which your gallant armed forces
fought bravely'' claimed the lives of more than 50 people, mostly
Ugandan troops, the statement quoted Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim
as saying.
	   He said government troops destroyed three tanks, three armored
cars, a truck loaded with ammunition, and other supplies for the
Ugandan armed forces.
	   ``Fierce battles are still raging in some places, with the aim
of clearing them of the filth of these aggressive troops,''
Sirul-Khatim said.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   At the same time, Ugandan rebels, with the support of the
Sudanese government, are fighting southern Sudanese rebels in an
attempt to open routes to northern Uganda.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
the each other's insurgents.

Turkish court arraigns plane hijacker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRABZON, Turkey (AP) _ After a day of police questioning, a
court on Wednesday arraigned the man who hijacked a Turkish
jetliner with a toy gun and ordered him imprisoned pending trial.
	   Ihsan Akyuz, 26, hijacked a Turkish Airlines jet with 76
passengers aboard shortly after takeoff from Ankara airport Monday
and diverted the plane to this Black Sea port city.
	   He said he was protesting a ban on Islamic head scarves at
universities and the war in Chechnya and demanded to be flown
there.
	   The two-hour hijack ordeal ended after authorities at Trabzon
convinced him to surrender and release all passengers.
	   No trial date has been set yet.
	   On the urging of the staunchly-secular military which regards
scarves a political symbol, universities have been refusing to
register women students this fall unless they submit ID photographs
with bared hair. The move has led to protests from pro-Islamic
circles.
	   News reports said the hijacker told police he had been working
on his own and was not part of any organization. He was reportedly
also suffering from depression.
	   A pilots' organization on Tuesday demanded stiff punishment for
the hijacker, saying he had engaged in a terrorist act, even if he
was armed with a toy gun.
	   Turkish Airlines' last hijack was in February, when a man
claiming to have a teddy bear packed with explosives commandeered a
flight. The claim was found false and the man was deemed mentally
ill. His trial is continuing.

U.S. firm complains of Ukrainian government obstructing its
</HEADLINE>
business &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A U.S. partner in a Ukrainian armament
utilization joint venture has accused the former Soviet republic's
government of obstructing its business, a news agency reported
Wednesday.
	   Alliant Techsystems Inc., a co-founder of the
Ukrainian-U.S.-British joint venture Alliant Kiev, said Ukraine's
Defense Ministry had recently banned the company from exporting
used munitions, demanded that it make unscheduled payments to the
ministry's accounts, and refused to sign a new contract with the
venture, Interfax reported.
	   Company officials said the venture's work was practically halted
at the beginning of September after the Defense Ministry deprived
it of a primary source of revenue: selling the used armaments
abroad.
	   Alliant Techsystems holds a 39 percent stake in Alliant Kiev,
which was assigned by the Defense Ministry in 1993 to dismantle
220,000 tons of outdated armaments.
	   Alliant Kiev, which receives no financing from the Ukrainian
government, was then permitted to export the processed shells and
other ammunition to earn money to support itself and make new
investments.
	   Since 1993, the joint venture has invested dlrs 20 million in
construction of two factories in Ukraine for utilizing artillery
shells and gunpowder.
	   Ukrainian companies hold a 51 percent stake in the venture, and
British partners own 10 percent.
	   Alliant Kiev is among a half-dozen American companies that have
complained for years about bureaucratic hurdles and corruption they
ran into while doing business in Ukraine. The Ukrainian side has
said recently that practically all the thorny issues have been
resolved.
	   Alliant Techsystems said it has already forwarded its complaints
to the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. agency that helps
American companies finance projects in other countries, mostly
through loan guarantee and risk protection.
	   The company told OPIC it plans to demand compensation in case
the Defense Ministry's ``erroneous'' acts would force the joint
venture to suspend its work, according to Interfax.

Unemployment falls to near 20-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unemployment in Britain fell to 4.6 percent last
month, the lowest level in nearly two decades, the government
reported Wednesday.
	   The number of people claiming welfare fell by 16,400 to 1.3
million, down 0.7 percent, and the lowest figure since the summer
of 1980.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose north England
parliamentary district has been hit by closures of two electronic
component plants, said there was nothing his Labor Party government
could do about the effects of world economic upheaval.
	   ``We can't, as a government, do much about the twists and turns
of world markets in an increasingly globalized economy,'' Blair
said, during a vist to his constituency, Sedgefield.
	   He met employees from the Fujitsu plant in the area, which is to
close, along with a Siemens plant.
	   Referring to financial woes in Asia, Blair said, ``Let us not
kid ourselves. In certain sectors there will be an impact.''

Ex-circus artist wins three men's gymnastics golds for Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's finals &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian Andrei Kravtsov, a
former circus acrobat, won three gold medals in four events
Wednesday, helping his adopted country maintain its dominance in
gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Australian women won two more medals, taking the country's total
haul in the 14 gymnastics events to nine golds, five silvers and
seven bronzes.
	   The Russian-born Kravtsov won the floor exercises (9.325),
pommel horse (9.487) and parallel bars (9.637) while another
Australian, Pavel Mamine, edged England's Andrew Atherton 9.337 to
9.325 on the rings for the fourth gold.
	   The 27-year-old Kravtsov already had won the men's individual
all-round gold and was part of the silver medalist men's team.
	   ``I didn't come here to get gold medals or anything. I just
wanted to please myself and please the audience and ended up with
these golds,'' said Kravtsov, who is known to his teammates as
``Red'' because of his Russian background.
	   This was the first time one athlete has taken three gold medals
in the apparatus events at the Commonwealth Games. The previous
best was two by Canadian Curtis Hibbert in 1990.
	   Kravtsov could have well taken the gold on the high bar _ his
speciality during his circus years of 1989-92 _ but a bad landing
prevented that.
	   The awkward ending after four perfect hand-stand pirouettes and
two release series with firm catches was the only mistake he made
Wednesday. It gave him 8.662, not even good enough for a bronze.
	   ``I was so tired up there. I wasn't really caring,'' said
Kravtsov, who had performed 16 times during the last week at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Georgian-born Alexander Jeltkov of Canada won on the high bar
(9.425). Another Canadian, Kris Burley (9.000), took the silver.
	   Kravtsov, still struggling with a shoulder injury sustained in
training last week, opted out of the vault and did not compete in
the rings.
	   South Africans Simon Hutcheon and Christian Brezeanu won the
vault gold and silver.
	   Kravtsov said he will ``probably have a drink and an early
night'' to sleep away the weeks of tension and nervousness.
	   Kravtsov, who used to live in the town of Kursk outside Moscow,
had quit gymnastics at age 19 and joined the Royal London Circus.
While performing in Kuala Lumpur in 1992, he flew to Australia for
a holiday with his Australian girlfriend, a dancer in the circus,
and stayed there for good.
	   He joined a gymnastics club and got into the sport full time,
never returning to Russia.
	   In the women's individual apparatus finals, Lisa Skinner won the
gold on uneven bars and Trudy McIntosh on balance beam. The vault
gold was taken by Lisa Mason of England and the silver went to
McIntosh. On the floor, England's Annika Reeder took the gold with
9.675, just ahead of silver medalist Allana Slater with 9.587. The
bronze went to Zeena McLaughlin of Australia.

Zambia denies it carried out executions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government on Wednesday denied
opposition claims that eight Zambian convicts were executed earlier
this month.
	   In a statement, the Home Affairs Ministry in charge of prisons
said there were no recent executions.
	   Furthermore, the ministry said President Frederick Chiluba had
not been asked to sign death warrants as alleged by the United
National Independence Party, the biggest opposition group.
	   In Zambia, those convicted of murder, violent robbery or treason
can be sentenced to death by hanging, but executions are rare.
	   Mwangala Zaloumis, a legal affairs official for the opposition
party, had
	   alleged at a weekend human rights seminar that eight convicts
were hanged in Mukobeko maximum security prison in central Zambia
two weeks ago.

Americans win final game of series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Katie Smith scored 17 points Wednesday
as the United States ended a five-game series with the Australian
women's basketball team with a 71-53 win.
	   It was the Americans' second consecutive win after losing the
opening three matches.
	   The Americans led 34-28 at halftime by using a smothering screen
which contained the Australians and jolted them out of their usual
attacking routine.
	   A three-minute spell midway through the first half saw the
Americans score nine unanswered points to give them a 13-point
lead.
	   Nikki McCray added 12 points for the Americans while Rachael
Sporn also scored 12 to lead Australia. (djp)

First member of Ulster Volunteer Force released early from prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The first imprisoned member of
the Ulster Volunteer Force gained early release Wednesday under the
terms of Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The release of Simon Corry, a member of the Protestant group who
had served 5 1/2 years of a 12-year sentence for illegally
possessing firearms, means all paramilitary groups who declared
cease-fires before the accord have now had members freed early.
	   Corry was one of seven inmates released Wednesday from the
top-security Maze prison southwest of Belfast.
	   Authorities began the early releases Friday, and up to 200
prisoners are expected to be let out by the end of the year.
	   April's accord specified that more than 400 UVF, Ulster Defense
Association and Irish Republican Army prisoners should be freed by
mid-2000 in reward for those groups' continuing cease-fires.
	   The IRA called a cease-fire in July 1997, while the UDA and UVF
jointly called off their campaign of killing Catholics in October
1994.
	   Authorities in the Irish Republic, where a few dozen convicts
from the IRA and other anti-British paramilitary groups are
imprisoned, have moved faster than the British in issuing early
paroles under terms of the accord.
	   They released six IRA inmates Aug. 1, then a week later freed
the IRA man convicted of killing Lord Mountbatten, the great-uncle
of Prince Charles, in a 1979 bombing.

Turkish government moves to end undeclared economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In an effort to get an idea of the size of
Turkey's notorious untaxed economy, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
asked people on Wednesday to deposit undeclared wealth in banks for
just one day, on Sept 30.
	   Yilmaz assured them that the cash, checks, stocks and bonds
declared on Sept. 30 would not be taxed and that they would
withdraw the assets the next day.
	   ``Our citizens will not be taxed in any way,'' Yilmaz told a
news conference.
	   The move is seen as an amnesty for holders of undeclared wealth.
But those who fail to declare their assets could face problems when
tax authorities invoke a new law giving them the right to make
people prove the source of income used in any transaction.
	   ``It is an opportunity for our citizens to officially prove
their assets,'' Yilmaz said.
	   The untaxed economy in Turkey is huge, by some estimates equal
to the dlrs 190 billion annual gross national product.

Newsmakers: Two key figures in Albania's latest crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Albania &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Here are thumbnail sketches of the two
key figures in Albania's latest political crisis:
	    &UR; ___
	   FATOS NANO
	   Fatos Nano, 46, is from the southern Albanian town of Lunxheria.
He became prime minister first in 1991 in a transition government
that included Communists. That government collapsed in 1992 after
Sali Berisha's Democratic Party pulled out of the coalition, paving
the way toward new elections in March 1992 that swept the
Socialists from power. The following year, Nano was sentenced to 12
years in prison for falsifying documents and misappropriating
funds. International watchdog groups said the conviction was
politically motivated.
	   Nano was held in a high-security prison in southern Albania
until violence broke out in the region in early 1997. He was
transferred to a prison in Tirana, where a mob freed him and about
600 other prisoners in March 1997.
	   He became prime minister in internationally supervised elections
later that year.
	    &UR; ___
	   SALI BERISHA
	   Sali Berisha, 53, is a cardiologist and professor from the
northern city of Tropoja. He was a Communist Party member for 25
years, but turned against the party as communist systems began to
topple throughout eastern Europe. In December 1990, Berisha turned
a student movement into a nationwide anti-communist uprising that
forced Albania's first multiparty elections. The newly named
Democratic Party lost elections in 1991 but won the following year,
and on April 9, 1992, he was appointed president.
	   Berisha lost his grip on the country after pyramid schemes
collapsed in January 1997, causing nationwide rioting. Following
his party's defeat in elections, he resigned the presidency on Aug.
22, 1997, a year before his term expired. Berisha retained his seat
in Parliament and said he would work to ensure a market economy and
Albania's acceptance in Western economic and military
organizations.
	   He has never stopped criticizing his rival, Prime Minister Fatos
Nano, accusing his government of corruption and incompetence.

Nicol edges Power, Martin beats Fitz-Gerald for Commonwealth squash
</HEADLINE>
gold &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Nicol, Power. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland survived the precise volleys and petulant outbursts of
Canada's Jonathan Power to win the gold medal in squash Wednesday
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Nicol triumphed 3-9, 9-2, 9-1, 2-9, 9-2 to break a six-match
losing streak against the third best player in the world.
	   In the women's final, world No. 2 Michelle Martin upset
top-ranked Sarah Fitz-Gerald in straight games in an all-Australian
contest.
	   At times, Nicol struggled against Power, who mixed up his game
with deft volleys that curled into the corners and left the Scot
flatfooted. Still, despite a comfortable edge in points, the
Canadian had to labor for his games.
	   ``I did a lot of work but I knew I hurt him,'' Nicol said. ``I
knew at some point he was going to get very tired.''
	   In the middle of the match, Nicol settled into the cool,
methodical routine that he has used to easily dismantle his foes
throughout the tournament. It was the first time squash has
featured in the Commonwealth Games, which are held every four
years.
	   The flamboyant Power, a bandanna with a maple leaf logo wrapped
around his head, sparred constantly with the referee as he cadged
for replays or free points if he thought Nicol was in his way.
	   The umpire didn't always agree, admonishing Power: ``You must go
for the ball, not the man.''
	   So Power yelled, grinned in disbelief, lay motionless on the
ground for several seconds and even lobbed his racket over the
glass wall of the court after losing one game.
	   ``In the end, you've got to be a bit more solid mentally than
Jonathan Power to win a major championship,'' said Nicol, who won
the British Open this year.
	   ``He worked really hard. I didn't have enough fight,'' said a
dejected Power.
	   Martin, who won 9-0, 9-6, 9-5, overpowered her opponent in the
first half of the match. Constantly on the defensive, Fitz-Gerald
scrambled, fumbled and lunged and only won her first point at 0-5
in the second game after 15 minutes of play.
	   Then 30-year-old Fitz-Gerald began to dominate more points and
dictated some pace but Martin, 31, kept up a steady barrage of
drives and tight angles.
	   ``That first game was a huge boost for my confidence,'' Martin
said. ``You've just got to stay on top and keep edging forward.''
	   The two women, who breezed through the early rounds, share a
suite at the condominium complex where thousands of Commonwealth
competitors are lodged.
	   Martin, winner of six consecutive British Open titles, has
beaten Fitz-Gerald five out of six times this year.
	   The women face a tough schedule in the next two months, with two
tournaments in Egypt, three in the United States and the world
championships in Germany. Ironically, Martin said, professional
squash players often don't perform their best at high-profile
events.
	   ``Because of all the tension that's in your system, all the
adrenaline that's rushing around, it doesn't really enable you to
play the best squash that you're capable of,'' she said.
	   The losing semifinalists in the women's competition, Cassie
Jackman and Sue Wright, both of England, shared the bronze medal.
	   In the men's, the bronze winners were Paul Johnson of England
and Alex Gough of Wales.

Britain's finance minister says G-7 nations should boost domestic
</HEADLINE>
demand

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The industrialized nations of the world _ including
Japan _ need to boost domestic demand to support economies
suffering from financial crisis, Britain's finance minister said
Wednesday.
	   ``All industrialized countries _ in Europe and Japan as well as
North America _ must bear their fair share of the adjustment,''
British Chancellor of the Exchequers Gordon Brown said.
	   ``No one country can either escape its responsibility to play
its part in sustaining global demand or be required to bear the
whole burden,'' he added.
	   Brown said central bankers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations are now focused on the need to support
domestic demand to stabilize the global economy.
	   The key issue for Japan remains restoring stability to the
financial system, he said.
	   ``Here in Japan, the restoration of financial stability is a top
priority in order to ensure that efforts to stimulate the economy
can be effective. I hope financial reform legislation can be passed
quickly,'' he said.
	   Brown also stressed the need for further efforts to promote
transparency both in the release of economic data and in
policy-making process.
	   The British finance minister singled out the commitment shared
by the international community to helping Russia, as long as Moscow
displays a ``genuine commitment to both stabilization and
structural reform.''

Two men, including former scout leader, jailed for raping minors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAR-LE-DUC, France (AP) _ Two men, including a former boy scout
leader, have been sentenced to up to 18 years in jail for raping
and molesting young boys, officials said Wednesday.
	   Daniel Prieur, 35, a scout leader between 1985 and 1994, was
sentenced to 18 years in prison late Tuesday for raping and
molesting more than a dozen young boys over a 10-year period in
this northeastern French city.
	   He was was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment by a judge
who conducted the trial behind closed doors.
	   In a separate case in Colmar, eastern France, Remy Horacek was
given a 14-year-sentence for raping a child and molesting four
others between 1988 and 1996. His victims included a seven-year-old
boy.
	   Horacek apologized to his victims who were present in the
courtroom and wore a tatoo on his arm that read ``Forbidden Love.''
	   Judicial sources, who requested anonymity, said scout leader
Prieur threatened his young victims before molesting them. Many of
the acts were committed at his home.
	   Court sources said he also told the victims that they and their
families risked injury, even death, if they revealed what had
happened.
	   Prieur was arrested in 1996 after one of the victims told his
father about what had happened.

Lukashenko cracks down on food exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ In a desperate effort to control the
crumbling economy, the Belarusian government has supplemented price
controls and food rationing with a crackdown on food exporters,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has resisted
free-market reforms and relied on Soviet-era price and currency
controls to manage the economy of the former Soviet republic of 10
million.
	   Fixed prices have spurred exports to neighboring Russia, where
food now is up to three times more expensive, draining the domestic
market.
	   Lukashenko responded last weekend by issuing an order calling
for the confiscation of all goods exported without a license, along
with the truck or car used to transport them.
	   The decree said that exporters should apply for a license to the
ministry of agriculture, although it didn't provide any figures on
the eligible amount of exports.
	   The Belarusian Interior Ministry said that last week alone it
stopped food worth 245 billion Belarusian rubles (dlrs 4.75 million
according to official exchange rate) from crossing the border with
Russia, the official daily Zvezda reported on Wednesday.
	   Lukashenko has also introduced so-called sales norms that amount
to a form of rationing.
	   One customer is allowed to buy no more than 2 kilograms (4.4
pounds) of meat, 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sausage, 2 chickens,
400 grams (a pound) of cheese, and 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of
sugar at a time. However, there is nothing to stop customers from
returning for more.

North Korea warns Japan against reviving militarism after rocket
</HEADLINE>
launch
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with cabinet spokesman comment in graf 9-10; Defense
chief comment in graf 12-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea has warned Japan that any attempt to
use the North's recent rocket launch as a pretext to revive
militarism will have ``catastrophic'' consequences.
	   In a statement issued by its Foreign Ministry, North Korea
accused Japan of trying to use the rocket launch as an excuse to
build up its military and said Tokyo harbors a plan to ultimately
invade the North.
	   The statement, carried Tuesday by the North's official Korean
Central News Agency, also said Japan was using the launch to
deflect attention from its domestic economic crisis.
	   ``The Japanese authorities must ponder over what catastrophic
consequences will result,'' it said.
	   A North Korean radio broadcast of the statement, monitored
Wednesday by Tokyo-based Radiopress, said relations between the
countries have deteriorated to the point of placing them ``on the
verge of war.''
	   The reference to war, however, was not included in KCNA's text
of the statement.
	   The radio broadcast also indicated that the North intends to
develop a commercial satellite for sale abroad in order raise
foreign currency to help overcome its severe food shortages.
	   ``Starting with the food problem, we must solve our economic
problems alone ... by aggressively progressing in the global
advanced technology market which includes commercial satellite
launches,'' it said.
	   In Tokyo, Japanese government officials said Wednesday that
Japan will maintain its sanctions against North Korea.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said that the government
``is not considering at all'' lifting the sanctions _ freezing of
food aid, charter flights and bilateral talks to establish
diplomatic ties, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The North's rocket launch was believed to have been a ballistic
missile test, but the United States announced Tuesday that experts
have determined it was probably a failed attempt to put a satellite
into orbit.
	   Also Wednesday, Japanese Defense Agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga
told a TV Asahi program, recorded for broadcast on Friday, that he
plans to send experts to the United States to help determine what
Pyongyang really launched, Kyodo said.
	   ``We are taking the matter seriously, whether it was a missile
or satellite, because it flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific
without advance notice,'' Kyodo quoted Nukaga as saying.
	   Many legislators in Japan are calling on the government to build
a multi-purpose spy satellite following the North's Aug. 31 launch
of a three-stage rocket that sailed over Japan.
	   Asian countries are highly suspicious of any signs Japan may be
increasing its military capabilities because of its brutal conquest
of East Asia during World War II.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Unemployment in Britain fell last month to 4.6
percent, the lowest level in nearly two decades, the government
reported Wednesday.
	   The number of people claiming welfare dropped by 16,400 to 1.3
million, bringing the percentage of claimants down to the lowest
level since June 1980. Unemployment stood at 4.7 percent in July.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose north England
parliamentary district has been hit by closures of two electronic
component plants, said there was nothing his Labor Party government
could do about the effects of world economic upheaval.
	   ``We can't, as a government, do much about the twists and turns
of world markets in an increasingly globalized economy,'' Blair
said, during a vist to his constituency, Sedgefield.
	   He met employees from the Fujitsu plant in the area, which is to
close, along with a Siemens plant.
	   Referring to financial woes in Asia, Blair said, ``Let us not
kid ourselves. In certain sectors there will be an impact.''

Iraq's food imports reach seven million tons under oil deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has imported nearly 7 million tons
(7.7 million short tons) of food under the oil-for-food program
since its beginning in December 1996, the U.N. World Food Program
said Wednesday.
	   Iraq has paid dlrs 2.2 billion for the imports, the WFP said in
figures released to The Associated Press.
	   Under the program, Iraq is permitted to bypass the sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited
quantities of oil to buy food and humanitarian goods.
	   The figures show that Iraq has imported 4.4 million tons (4.84
short tons) of wheat, 900,000 tons (990,000 short tons) of rice,
952,000 tons (1,047,000 short tons) of sugar and 343,000 tons
(377,000 short tons) of vegetable oil.
	   The agency said Iraq planned to import 10,000 tons (11,000 short
tons) of cheese and 14,000 tons (15,400 short tons) of full cream
milk powder to enhance the rations doled out to its citizens.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell parted with her
pop diva wardrobe and other memorabilia at a Sotheby's auction
Wednesday, raising almost 145,000 pounds (dlrs 242,150) for a
children's cancer charity.
	   The famous Union Jack dress worn by Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice,
for a performance at last year's Brit Awards was the highlight,
fetching 41,320 pounds (dlrs 69,000).
	   Halliwell, 26, who quit the group in June, stood by the
auctioneer to see the dress sold to Peter Morton of the Hard Rock
Hotel in Las Vegas.
	   Other items sold included an 1967 MGB roadster, bought by
Halliwell with her first royalty check, which fetched 8,050 pounds
(dlrs 13,440).
	   An Elvis-style rhinestone-studded outfit worn at the 1997
Billboard awards brought 4,140 pounds (dlrs 6,910), and a pair of
stars-and-stripes platform ankle boots were bought for 2,990 pounds
(dlrs 4,990).
	   Proceeds from the sale of the 88-item lot will benefit Sergeant
Cancer Care for Children.
	   ``Thank you so much,'' Halliwell, dressed demurely in contrast
to her former Spice Girl regalia, told the Sotheby's crowd. ``I
really appreciate this. I am sure the children do and all their
families.''

Sudan claims 50 Ugandans, rebels killed in clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army has repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in southern Sudan, killing more than 50
Ugandans and Sudanese rebels, a government newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Three Sudanese government soldiers were also killed and five
injured in Tuesday's clashes in Liria, Torit and Jabalain in the
province of Eastern Equatoria, which borders Uganda, the official
Al-Anbaa daily said.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
each other's insurgents.
	   Al-Anbaa quoted a Sudanese military statement as saying Ugandan
government forces and southern Sudanese rebels used heavy artillery
and tanks in their attacks.
	   ``These intensive battles, in which (Sudan's) gallant armed
forces fought bravely'' claimed the lives of more than 50 people,
mostly Ugandan troops, the statement quoted Gen. Abdul-Rahman
Sirul-Khatim as saying.
	   He said Sudanese government troops destroyed three tanks, three
armored cars, a truck loaded with ammunition, and other supplies
meant for the Ugandan armed forces.
	   ``Fierce battles are still raging in some places,'' Sirul-Khatim
said.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   At the same time, the Sudanese government is reportedly helping
Ugandan rebels who are fighting the southern Sudanese rebels.

Hindu guru wants ban on plastic to stop deaths of holy cows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A prominent Hindu guru demanded a ban on
plastic Wednesday, saying hundreds of cows _ passionately revered
as mothers by millions of Hindus _ were choking to death after
eating plastic bags as they sauntered on Indian streets looking for
food.
	   ``Not only cows, one day this plastic will kill us humans ...
plastic should be banned,'' Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati said at a
news conference organized by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World
Hindu Council. ``It doesn't decay, it doesn't burn, there's no way
to destroy it.''
	   Hundreds of cows die in New Delhi alone every year when they
choke on plastic bags while trying to eat vegetable waste stuffed
in the garbage bags, activists say.
	   Autopsies of cows in the capital have found their stomachs
stuffed with as much as 110 pounds (50 kilos) of plastic. The
animals die a slow, painful death from convulsions, a recent
government study said.
	   At least 40,000 cows roam the streets of the Indian capital.

the Orix BlueWave at Kobe on Wednesday.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, drove the first run
with a grounder in the four-run first inning and drew a
bases-loaded walk in the six-run fifth inning.
	   The Fighters are .001 percentage points ahead of the
second-place Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, who extended their winning streak
with a 6-4 victory over the Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome.
	   Tadahito Iguchi smashed a three-run home run in the four-run
sixth inning and a home run in the ninth for the Hawks. Iguchi has
18 homers.
	   At Osaka Dome, Phil Clark hit a home run in the sixth and
Norihiro Nakamura belted a three-run home run in the bottom of the
ninth as the Kintetsu Buffaloes beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 5-3.
	   Rob Mattson, formerly with a Mexican League team, held the
Marines to seven hits for his eighth victory against five defeats.
	   Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 29 homers and
Nakamura 25 homers.
	   In the Central League, Hideki Matsui belted a home run in the
two-run third inning and Daisuke Motoki singled home the winning
run in the eighth as the Yomiuri Giants edged the front-running
Yokohama BayStars 3-2 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Matsui has 31 homers and leads the league.
	   The BayStars still are 2 1/2 games ahead of the second-place
Chunichi Dragons, who beat the Yakult Swallows 5-2 at Tokyo's Jingu
Stadium. Takeshi Yamasaki doubled home two runs in the four-run
seventh inning for the Dragons.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Akira Etoh hit a home run against Darrel May
in the three-run second inning as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp edged the
Hanshin Tigers 5-4.
	   The Carp's starter Nathan Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red
Sox, gave up nine hits and struck out four for his 14th victory
against nine defeats.
	   Etoh has 24 homers and May, formerly with Anaheim Angels, gave
up eight hits and three runs over seven innings and took the loss.
He is 14-9.

Russia launches ICBM in test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia successfully launched an intercontinental
ballistic missile Wednesday in a military exercise, news agencies
reported.
	   The RS-12M Topol missile was launched from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome in northern Russia and hit a target in the Kamchatka
area in the Russian Far East, according to ITAR-Tass and Interfax,
citing the Strategic Missile Command.
	   ``This launch once again convincingly proved the high combat
readiness of the force and the reliability and technical readiness
of intercontinental ballistic missiles of this type,'' Interfax
quoted the command's press service as saying.
	   The command said it was the 58th straight successful launch of
the Topol ICBM system.

Amnesty: Algeria report a whitewash, failed to address
</HEADLINE>
fundamentals &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to RAISE criticism of report &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Amnesty International on Wednesday called
a report by a U.N. fact-finding team to Algeria a whitewash, saying
it failed to address key human rights abuses.
	   The U.N. report, made available Tuesday, acknowledged that the
U.N. team had neither the means nor the mandate to conduct
investigations into the six-year wave of violence that has
overwhelmed the country.
	   Amnesty particularly criticized the panel members for failing to
address conclusions of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which has
condemned grave violations by government forces including torture,
disappearances and extrajudicial executions.
	   ``The tendency in the report to repeat the government analysis
of `terrorism' and to gloss over human rights abuses by government
forces further undermines its credibility,'' the human rights
organization said in a statement.
	   Human rights groups had feared that the U.N. team would not take
a strong enough stand against charges that the government was
involved in the violence that has wracked the country since 1992.
	   Diplomats and some U.N. officials have suggested that a less
critical report was perhaps the best way to enter into a dialogue
with the Algerian government.
	   A Muslim insurgency began after the army canceled parliamentary
elections in January 1992 that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, an estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   While the government blames Muslim insurgents for the massacres,
human rights groups say the government has carried out atrocities
as well.
	   ``From a human rights perspective the visit of this U.N. panel
was a whitewash and is no substitute for an independent
investigation into the human rights crisis in the country, which is
long overdue,'' Amnesty International said.
	   Algeria had long resisted any outside investigation into the
violence, claiming it was an internal matter. The government
relented in July, and the U.N. panel, headed by a Mario Soares,
former president of Portugal, visited Algeria in July and August.
	   The report condemned terrorism as a whole and made a few
recommendations, such as urging the government to rein in its
security forces.
	   It urged a ``change of mentality'' in Algeria's police, army,
judiciary and human rights institutions following reports of human
rights violations by both the government and insurgents.
	   Amnesty said implementing these recommendations would go ``some
way'' to addressing the human rights crisis.
	   Amnesty faulted team members for only meeting with one prisoner
accused of ``terrorism,'' during a visit to the notorious Serkadji
Prison, where Amnesty said 96 prisoners were massacred in 1995.
	   ``Such an approach is astonishing especially given that no
international organization or human rights expert had previously
been allowed into this or any other prison,'' Amnesty said.
	   The team said the Algerian government barred meetings with key
opposition officials.
	   Also in the U.N. team were former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, Donald McHenry; former Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral; former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti;
Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako; and former French Health
Minister Simone Veil.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Typhoon Stella, packing winds up to 108 kilometers
(65 miles) per hour, swept through northern Japan on Wednesday,
killing at least four people and injuring 25 others.
	   More than 1,600 trains were canceled in Tokyo areas and northern
Japan, affecting about 820,000 people, said Akito Hirata, a
spokesman of JR East Japan.
	   Stella, the season's fifth typhoon, landed in central Japan
early Wednesday and swept through northern Japan, triggering floods
and landslides and paralizing transportation before leaving for the
Sea of Okhotsk in northern Pacific.
	   The national police agency said in a statement that a
64-year-old man fell from a roof while repairing and died in Chiba
near Tokyo.
	   One person died in Yamanashi prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, and
two others died in Hokkaido on Japan's northernmost main island of
Hokkaido, the police agency said. Details of the deaths were not
immediately known.
	   More than 3,000 houses were flooded in 17 prefectures and
landslides were reported at 180 sites, the national police agency
said.
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said Stella, with winds up to
90 kilometers (54 miles), was located 80 kilometers (48 miles) west
of Nemura city on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido as
of 9 p.m. (1200gmt).
	   Stella was heading northeast at 70 kilometers (42 miles) per
hour, the weathermen said.
	   Two of those injured were power company workers in Shizuoka
knocked to the ground by the high waves, said prefectural police
spokesman Kenji Nomura.
	   Katsumi Inamoto, 46, suffered a skull fracture, and Masashi
Suzuki, also 46, sustained bruises to his body. Both men were
treated at a hospital in Higashiizu, a coastal hot spring resort
150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Tokyo, Nomura said.
	   In Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo, 60-year-old Haruo Igari
was hospitalized for pains in his hip after being blown from his
roof while trying to patch a leak, a police spokesman said.
	   In late August, the season's fourth typhoon, Rex, lingered over
the Pacific south of Japan's main island of Honshu, bringing record
rainfalls to central Japan that caused 16 deaths and injured 46.

Fastest qualifier Boldon doubts world record chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Lewis dominating heptathlon, fixes no pb for Shirvington &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ato Boldon cruised into the
semifinal of the Commonwealth Games 100 meters with a fastest time
of 10.05 seconds Wednesday and then said he doubted that he was
running on a world record track.
	   Surprised that no one had gone below 10 seconds in two rounds of
heats, the Trinidad sprint star admitted that he might fall short
of his bid to break Donovan Bailey's world mark of 9.84 in
Thursday's final.
	   Boldon had said earlier he thought the ``Caribbean-style'' heat
and humidity of Kuala Lumpur were ideal for a world record
performance.
	   But after watching big rival Frankie Fredericks run 10.15 and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados clock 10.09, he believed the brand new
track at the 100,000-capacity National Stadium might not be fast
enough.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track. It's not just
me, it's the times the other guys are running,'' said Boldon, who
runs the semifinals and final on Thursday.
	   ``I think Frankie should have run faster so I'm having a few
questions about whether it's a world record track.
	   ``If I'm going to have a chance for it I must aim for a very
good semifinal tomorrow.''
	   The opening day of athletics saw Kenyans 1-2 in the men's 10,000
meters, with Simon Maina beating William Kalya and Australia's
Steve Moneghetti taking bronze to gain a medal for the fourth
Commonwealth Games in a row.
	   Maina ran virtually alone for the last 6,000 meters after making
a break and he won the race by some 250. Moneghetti, usually a
marathon expert, threatened to take silver with a late burst but
Kalya held on.
	   Australia's Deborah Sosimenko made a little bit of Games history
by winning the first women's hammer with a heave of 66.56 meters
ahead of England's Lorraine Shaw, who threw 62.66, and Canada's
Caroline Wittrin, who had 61.67.
	   Waving to his fan club in the stands, Boldon, who is world
champion at 200 meters and has twice run 9.86 for the 100 this
season, said he was still targeting a first Commonwealth Games gold
medal.
	   ``I've having fun, seeing the sights and talking to you guys,''
he told reporters. ``Tomorrow's all business.''
	   Fredericks' modest 10.15 resulted from a poor start.
	   ``I was a little slow out. That's not a problem today. But I
can't afford to do it in the final,'' he said.
	   The Namibian only decided to compete in the Games Sunday night.
He threatened to pull out after hearing Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob no longer considered him the nation's top sportsman.
	   ``I was upset. But I thought it was the best thing to come here
and compete for my country,'' the two-time Olympic 200 silver
medalist said.
	   With his country dominating the Games in other sports, notably
swimming, Australia's Matthew Shirvington ran 10.13 to win his heat
and follow Boldon and Thompson as third fastest qualifier.
Fredericks was fourth. But countryman Damien Marsh pulled out of
the second round with an Achilles tendon injury.
	   Of the Canadian trio, running in the absence of world and
Olympic champion and world record holder Donovan Bailey and
countryman Bruny Surin, Bradley McCuaig was only 12th fastest,
Glenroy Gilbert was the slowest qualifier and O'Brian Gibbons
didn't make it.
	   With four going through from each heat, Gibbons finished fifth
even though his time of 10.32 was much faster than Gilbert's, whose
10.42 got him fourth behind Shirvington.
	   In the first round of the women's 100 meters, Chandra Sturrup of
the Bahamas clocked a fast 11.14 seconds as fastest qualifier, with
Canada's Philomena Mensah winning her heat in 11.20.
	   England's Denise Lewis looked well on course to holding on to
her heptathlon title, holding an 85-point lead over her rivals
after winning two of the first four events, the high jump and shot
put.

O'Meara looks to continue year of success at Lancome Trophy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) _ Mark O'Meara begins his
defense Thursday of the Lancome Trophy, on the same course where he
was accused last year of cheating his way to the title by his
closest rival.
	   ``It is always enjoyable to return to a tournament that you have
won before,'' O'Meara told reporters Wednesday on the eve of the
pounds 800,000 (dlrs 1.32 million) competition.
	   ``You have good memories and you can use that as positive
reinforcement.''
	   In beating Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin by a single shot in 1997,
video evidence appeared to show O'Meara replacing his ball less
than an inch closer to the hole on a 2 1/2-foot (75 centimeter)
putt at the 15th green.
	   Sandelin, who is also back to battle for this year's Lancome
Trophy, demanded an apology from O'Meara.
	   ``Mark either has to own up to the fact that he made the mistake
as the winner of the tournament or he gives back the trophy and
says he doesn't want to win that way,'' the extrovert Swede said
earlier this year.
	   ``If he does the first I think people will still wonder whether
this has happened before?'' Sandelin said. ``And if he chooses the
second option he has for sure clouded his name for everyone.''
	   Organizers took no action over the matter and O'Meara angrily
denied the charge.
	   Last year's Lancome success spurred O'Meara to some of his best
ever form.
	   The 41-year-old American lifted his first major titles _ the
U.S. Masters in April and British Open in July _ and is currently
number five in the world rankings.
	   ``To win two major championships in one year is incredible. If
there is one thing I have shown it is that you can still play
competitive golf at 41,'' O'Meara said.
	   O'Meara faces four other top ten players over the par-71
6,311-meter (6,903-yard) course in Saint-Nom-La-Breteche, 20
kilometers (12 miles) west of Paris.
	   They include Scotland's Colin Montgomerie who, boosted by
Sunday's British Masters success, continues his challenge for a
sixth successive European No. 1 title.
	   The Masters win put the burly Scotsman within 34,446 pounds
(dlrs 58,076) of leader Lee Westwood of England _ who has racked up
pounds 614,464 (dlrs 1,032,300) this season _ and pounds 25,050
(dlrs 42,234) shy of second-placed Darren Clarke of Northern
Ireland on the European money list.
	   Clarke, who led the British Masters after two rounds, managed
only 20th place, while Westwood finished 12th.
	   With only four events to play this year, the pounds 133,330
(dlrs 224,794) winning prize at the Lancome Trophy, which ends
Sunday, could provide a key twist in the three-way battle for
Europe's top spot.
	   World No. 2 David Duval, the 1997 U.S. tour champion and biggest
money winner this year, is looking for his first European success
here, while world No. 10 Fred Couples, who has spent the weekend
honeymooning in Paris after getting married last weekend, is also
expected to mount a strong challenge.
	   Other competitors include Nick Faldo, taking a rare break from
the U.S. tour where he has struggled this season, Ian Woosnam, a
two-time Lancome winner, and Bernhard Langer.

Polish foreign minister says Polish-Ukrainian border to remain
</HEADLINE>
open &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
assured Ukrainian officials on Wednesday that the border between
the two countries would remain open for Ukrainians.
	   ``The border shall be as open as Ukrainian-Polish relations,''
the visiting minister said.
	   Ukraine is concerned that visa requirements for its citizens
would be toughened if Poland is accepted into the European Union.
	   Ukraine and Poland have signed agreements on visa-free movement
and on readmission of illegal migrants. But Poland already has
restricted the entry for Russians and Belarusians out of concern
that it is becoming a transit point for illegal migration to the
West.
	   Polish officials say Warsaw will introduce visas for its eastern
neighbors if the EU demands that as a condition for Poland's
membership.
	   Geremek also told Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Volodymyr
Horbulin that Ukraine must control the border so as not to make it
transparent for organized crime, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The Polish minister arrived here on Tuesday. Apart from
Horbulin, he met with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko and Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk.
	   Geremek's talks with Ukrainian leaders focused on border
arrangements and economic issues. He assured Ukraine that it could
only benefit from Poland's NATO and EU membership.
	   In talks with Pustovoitenko, Geremek said Poland was interested
in the Ukrainian project of transporting Caspian Sea oil from its
Black Sea port of Odessa to the West, particularly to Gdansk in
Poland.
	   During the visit, Geremek also spoke of Ukraine as a ``very
interesting partner'' in possible projects involving modernization
of Polish weaponry.
	   If Poland joins the European Union, Geremek said, economic ties
would receive an additional boost.
	   Trade turnover between the two countries amounted to dlrs 1.7
billion in 1997 and grew by 12 percent in the first half of 1998
against the same period last year. Polish exports to Ukraine,
however, account for two-thirds of that turnover.
	   Pustovoitenko told Geremek that Ukraine might set up several
free economic zones on the border to increase trade turnover.
	   The sides also discussed Russia's economic crisis, which is
negatively affecting their economies. Geremek noted that the
Russian crisis has led to ``psychological pressure'' on Polish
investors but said the government was keeping the situation under
control.

Liberal Iranian newspaper closed down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with editor, managing director arrested,
taken to court. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran closed down a liberal Iranian newspaper
Wednesday and arrested its editor and the managing director of its
publishing company, news reports said.
	   Tous was ordered shut for publishing articles detrimental ``to
the country's national interests and security,'' the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The closure came a day after Iran's supreme leader, Ali
Khamenei, called on the judiciary to deal with newspapers abusing
the country's press freedoms.
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The newspaper
has been calling for a diplomatic solution to Iran's conflict with
the Taliban in Afghanistan, suggesting dialogue instead of military
strikes.
	   Tous editor Mahmoud Shams and Hamid Reza Jalaipur, director of
its publishing company, were taken to the Islamic Revolution Court
to hear the accusations against the paper, official state radio
said. They were accompanied by officials from the prosecutor
general's office.
	   The case will be decided in court at a later date, the radio
said, adding that the newspaper was ordered closed until further
notice pending an investigation.
	   Anti-Taliban feelings are running high in Iran since
Afghanistan's religious militia admitted Thursday to killing eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist. Demonstrators, newspapers and
officials in Iran have been calling for revenge against the
Taliban, whose forces killed the Iranians after capturing the
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners because it questioned the
authority of Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide, and asked how an
unelected person could wield more power than the president.
Moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who won more than 20
million votes in elections last year, has limited power.
	   Tous began as the daily Jameah but was closed down in July by
hard-liners. When the paper changed its name to Tous and continued
publishing, authorities again ordered it to close, but later
rescinded the order.
	   Shams, the editor, was beaten last month by militants allied
with the hard-liners.

Cambodia opposition leader says no boycott of parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ A top Cambodian opposition leader
said Wednesday his party would not carry out a threat to boycott
the new parliament, and instead would pursue its allegations of
election fraud from inside the government.
	   The decision by Prince Norodom Ranariddh was a step towards the
easing of political tensions that reached fever pitch over the past
week with violent police crackdowns on pro-opposition demonstrators
in the capital.
	   ``We are now entering a new phase, a negotiation phase instead
of confrontation,'' Ranariddh told reporters after a 4 1/2-hour
meeting with King Norodom Sihanouk, his father.
	   Thousands of people had been marching daily in support of the
opposition's contention that strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party cheated in winning parliamentary elections held on July 26.
	   Ranariddh said Wednesday that his party would stick to its
demands for a reconciliation of spoiled and unused ballots and a
review of the formula to allocate parliamentary seats.
	   ``His Majesty the King advised us that the best way is to attend
the first session while keeping our reservations,'' said Ranariddh.
``We have to fight in another framework, which I fear is the
National Assembly. We will negotiate, attend the National Assembly
and continue the struggle.''
	   Opposition supporters heeded Ranariddh's call not to stage
demonstrations as the prince met Wednesday with King Sihanouk in
the northwestern province of Siem Reap for their first face-to-face
talk since before July's elections.
	   The United Nations special representative for human rights in
Cambodia meanwhile expressed concern Wednesday over unacknowledged
arrests, reports of disappearances, and discoveries of unidentified
bodies in and around the capital since the crackdown on opposition
protests began.
	   ``During the past week at least two people have been killed in
demonstrations, while the bodies of 16 others have been found
floating in rivers, in irrigation ditches, and in shallow graves
around the capital,'' said a written statement from Thomas
Hammarberg.
	   The two-page statement said many of the bodies had signs of
torture or other violence, including bullet wounds and
strangulation marks.
	   Hammarberg called on the government to publicly acknowledge all
instances of arrests and detention, list prisoners' names and
whereabouts and clarify the charges against them.
	   Ranariddh said Wednesday that his FUNCINPEC party would seek
guarantees of safety for its people and an investigation of the
violent crackdown.
	   The opposition protesters, generally nonviolent, were met with
bullets and beatings by baton-wielding riot police. Several fought
back with slingshots and stones. At least four protesters were
killed and more than 20 arrested.
	   Ranariddh described the outcome of his meeting with the king as
``positive and satisfactory enough.''
	   ``But the way toward peace is still long,'' he said.
	   On Monday, the ruling party and its two main opposition rivals
reached a tentative three-point tension-easing agreement.
	   It called for the cessation of demonstrations, a summit meeting
of party leaders hosted by King Sihanouk, and the convening of the
National Assembly as scheduled on Sept. 24. No date was set for the
summit meeting.
	   Hun Sen's party won a majority of assembly seats in the July
polls, but not the two-thirds necessary to form a new government on
its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party _ which won the remainder of the seats _ had said they
would boycott the assembly if their complaints about election fraud
were not investigated.
	   He said the National Assembly would be convened by the king at
his palace in Siem Reap, and afterwards the members of parliament
would go to the famous Angkor Wat temple nearby to be sworn in.

UNCTAD: Asian financial crisis behind slowdown in world growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EMBARGOED until 2201 GMT, Sept. 16, 1998 &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis is worse than first
thought and will cause overall world output to drop by at least 1
percent, the United Nations said Thursday.
	   The region's crisis slowed world trade, that grew in volume by
9.5 percent in 1997, the second highest rate in two decades, said a
229-page study by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.
	   ``For 1998, expectations are for a reduced expansion of world
trade,'' the report said. ``The outcome, however, is clouded by
uncertainties, especially those relating to an export-led recovery
in Asia.''
	   Perhaps the worst possible outcome of the Asian turmoil, the
study said, is possible further bouts of financial instability in
emerging markets, a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy and
prolonged recession in East Asian countries and Japan.
	   This could in turn force the world economy into deep recession
and provoke further havoc-wreaking trade conflicts.
	   The crisis' impact on the United States is expected to increase,
with U.S. growth slowing significantly by the end of 1998 and a
likely substantial increase in the U.S. trade deficit.
	   That could limit the United States' ability to serve as the
engine rekindling the Asian economies by maintaining imports from
the region, the report said.
	   It is unlikely strong demand in Europe and Japan, whose
economies are in surplus, could compensate for a U.S. shortfall, it
said.
	   Rubens Ricupero, UNCTAD's secretary-general, told a news
conference in Geneva European economies are expanding and the
United States cannot remain the world's only source of import
demand. ``Japan and Europe should provide this stimulus,'' Ricupero
said.
	   In the European Union, apart from Britain, growth has so far
depended on exports and the Asian crisis is expected to reduce both
output and export growth by more than 0.5 percentage points.
	   On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a speech on the
world economy that one-fourth of the globe was currently in
recession and ``the balance of risks has now shifted'' from
inflation, the economic bugaboo of the past three decades, to the
need to contain a spreading economic crisis coming out of Asia.
	   Ricupero agreed, saying the world economy's central problem and
threat is no longer inflation but deflation, recession and
unemployment.
	   He said a vigorous pro-growth policy is needed with reduced
interest rates in the United States and elsewhere.
	   Japanese growth is expected to remain negative for the year even
though the rest of Asia depends on its recovery, the study said.
	   With the exception of China and Taiwan, no country in the region
can expect to register satisfactory growth this year.
	   Despite the Russian financial crisis, the report said Central
and Eastern European economies as a whole are expected to register
a moderately positive growth rate, although ``considerable
uncertainty'' surrounds prospects for the Russian Federation.

US envoy gives NATO grim picture of humanitarian situation in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ As Serb forces pounded villages in
northern Kosovo Wednesday, the NATO envoys were given a grim
picture of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the
independence-minded Serbian province.
	   The search for peace is hampered by violence on the ground,
Christopher Hill, the American envoy to Kosovo, said after briefing
the NATO envoys on the worsening humanitarian situation in Kosovo
where months of Serb attacks and bombardments have created a flood
of of some 300,000 refugees.
	   Also attending the NATO meeting was U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
	   His presence, officials said, showed how serious things have
become and that the allies _ after months of waffling _ are moving
toward using force to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``Washington sent a very high-level delegation to NATO at a very
crucial juncture'' in events in Kosovo, said one official, who
asked not to be named.
	   With the approval of Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova, Hill is trying to forge an interim settlement
granting Kosovo self-rule.
	   The hardline Kosovo Liberation Army opposes this. It seeks
independence for Kosovo.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Hill gave no inkling his peace
efforts were getting anywhere. ``We very much support the idea of a
political solution (for Kosovo but) the search for peace is being
made difficult by the ongoing violence on the ground,'' he said.
	   In recent days, American and European officials have signaled a
growing exasperation in allied capitals with Milosevic and a
willingness to use force against him.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said on German television
Tuesday military action could come in a matter of weeks.
	   ``When the attacks against the civilian population continue then
the readiness grows in the west to put a halt to these by military
force in the next three to five week,'' he said on the ZDF network.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action. Russia could embarrass NATO by vetoing
such action.
	   Officials at NATO have said in Washington's view military action
can legally be taken without a U.N.-mandate if the allies invoke
the notion that fighting in Kosovo threatens stability in
neighboring countries.
	   NATO has developed three basic options for military action
ranging from a preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania
along the border with Kosovo to air strikes against Serb targets to
the deployment of ground troops to support a cease-fire or a peace
agreement, if any.

Harrison marches on

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ English super heavyweight Audley
Harrison scored an 8-3 points decision over New Zealand favorite
Faii Falamoe Wednesday to move into the semifinals of the
Commonwealth Games competition.
	   The Englishman enjoyed a healthy weight and reach advantage over
the Kiwi, who is ranked No. 3 in the world and No. 1 in the
Commonwealth in the 91kg and over division.
	   Southpaw Harrison was the better boxer Wednesday and he troubled
Falamoe with his right fist.
	   Falamoe is planning a pro career and was hoping to launch it in
style with a gold medal here.
	   ``He never troubled me. I wasn't hurt at any time,'' Falamoe
said. ``I was trying to force him to come out because he kept
moving away. I think his trainers read me the last time I had a
fight (in Liverpool, England).''
	   England had three winners from as many fights Wednesday with
Andrew McLean (60kg) and Gary Jones (48kg) also advancing to the
semis.
	   McLean fought a gripping 15-14 win over Malaysia's Muru
Balakrishnan after letting leads of 4-1 and then 6-3 slip away.
	   ``If it was 14-all I think I would have won on the countback, I
threw more punches than he did,'' said McLean.
	   South Africa's opening ceremony flagbearer Elvis Makama crashed
out of the 60kg division, beaten by Giovanni Frontin of Mauritius.
Makana, ranked No. 10 in the world, was beaten 18-13.
	   Kenyan fighter Moses Kinyua had the biggest win of the
tournament so far when he thrashed Sole Mou of Lesotho 40-16 in the
48kg category.
	   Kinyua sent Mou staggering into the ropes in the first round of
the light flyweight bout and in the second Mou went into his shell,
allowing the Kenyan to score at will.
	   ``I was right on target from the first round that helped me to
score more points,'' said Kinyua. ``For me every bout is a new
experience and I fight according to a plan.''
	   Ghana's boxers were told to fight for knockouts after Tuesday's
defeat of Abdulai Amidu in the 51kg category.
	   Team manager A.K. Johnson lodged a protest against the
refereeing but it was ignored by officials.
	   ``I have given a new order to my boxers to go for knockouts,''
Johnson said.
	   The call had mixed success with Ghana winning two of four bouts
Wednesday; and none were by knockout.

Couple charged with prostituting their daughters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ A couple who allegedly prostituted
their three underage daughters were denied bail on Wednesday.
	   The girls' biological mother and their stepfather allegedly sold
the sexual services of the girls over a three-year period _ when
they were as young as nine, 12 and 15 _ for as little as 20 rands
(dlrs 5.55 at the 1995 exchange rate).
	   A 17-year-old youth and seven men who were arrested on rape
charges in connection with the case were scheduled to appear in
court on Friday.
	   The 39-year-old biological mother and 28-year-old stepfather _
whose names weren't released to keep the girls' identities private
_ were told they could apply for bail at their next court
appearance on September 21.
	   After the hearing, about 30 protesters sang songs outside the
courthouse and displayed placards saying ``Protect the child not
the abuser,'' and ``No bail for child abuser.''
	   The girls are in protective custody.

reforms &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An international observer commended
Croatia for progress towards democratic reform Wednesday, while
stressing a need to encourage further Serb refugee returns, as well
as media and electoral reform.
	   Tim Guldimann, head of the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe mission in Croatia, told reporters at a
news conference Wednesday, Croatia had made progress since severe
criticism of the organization four months ago.
	   ``There is a more positive momentum in the political development
... and cooperation'' with international powers, Guldimann said.
	   He also welcomed a steadily climbing trend of returning Serb
refugees and a seeming willingness on behalf of the government to
reform state-run television and a pro-government electoral
legislation. ,000 were forced to flee an army offensive which
reclaimed the areas. About 45,000 have returned, mostly in the last
few months.
	   Guldimann also noted that Croatian radio and television, HRT,
was under the direct influence of the ruling party and in need of
an overhaul. HRT is the sole source of information for about
three-quarters of the population,
	   Although the next nationwide elections are not scheduled until
mid-1999, Guldimann said that adjustments were also necessary to
the existing electoral legislation which favors the ruling party.
	   ``These three areas are immediate issues and ... a keen interest
has been expressed by the international community to adopt them as
the next steps,'' Guldimann told reporters.

<TEXT>
	   MESSINA, South Africa (AP) _ A farmer allegedly killed and hung
39 stray donkeys from trees on his property near the Zimbabwe
border, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Samson Singo of Bali Farm is to appear in magistrates court on
Oct. 1 to answer charges that he tied the animals to trees and
stabbed them with a panga _ a large knife used mostly by rural
residents, the South African Press Association said.
	   The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it
would investigate the killings, which reportedly happened last
month in Northern Province.
	   ``If the donkeys had been trespassing, there are legal and
acceptable means of resolving the issue with their owners,'' said
spokeswoman Morgane James.
	   Donkeys provide transport throughout rural South Africa.
	   Last month, another Northern Province farm was the scene of the
killing of 86 hunting dogs that belonged to alleged poachers.

India to privatize domestic and international carriers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Indian government plans to sell
stock of its domestic and international airlines, which have been
losing money, the civil aviation minister said Wednesday.
	   The government is likely to accept recommendations that it
divest 60 percent of the stock in Air-India to a private joint
venture and to the public, said minister Ananth Kumar.
	   The recommendation of the government's privatization agency has
to be approved by the council of ministers.
	   Kumar told a meeting of economic reporters in New Delhi that he
wants to push through the disinvestment in one year.
	   The government plans to sell 51 percent of the domestic airline,
Indian Airlines, he said. He did not give further details.
	   The government also is willing to allow up to 74 percent direct
investment in all airport projects. Special approval could be
granted for totally foreign-owned projects, he said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of the International Maritime
Organization will travel to Southeast Asia next month to address
the rise in piracy and other violent attacks on the seas, the
agency said Wednesday.
	   It will be the first of a series of missions and seminars in
various countries by the U.N. agency that deals with the safety of
shipping and prevention of marine pollution by ships.
	   Reported incidents of piracy have risen steadily since 1984, the
IMO said. The Malacca Strait and South China sea remain problem
areas. In the first six months of 1998, 91 incidents were reported
worldwide.
	   The first IMO mission, to Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta is
scheduled for Oct. 4-11. Experts seek to examine the problem and
establish a regional approach to dealing with it, the agency said.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Martin's win record over Fitz-Gerald to 7-6, sted
6-5, in graf 16. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland survived the precise volleys and petulant outbursts of
Canada's Jonathan Power to win the gold medal in squash Wednesday
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Nicol triumphed 3-9, 9-2, 9-1, 2-9, 9-2 to break a six-match
losing streak against the third best player in the world.
	   In the women's final, world No. 2 Michelle Martin upset
top-ranked Sarah Fitz-Gerald in straight games in an all-Australian
contest.
	   At times, Nicol struggled against Power, who mixed up his game
with deft volleys that curled into the corners and left the Scot
flatfooted. Still, the Canadian had to labor for his games.
	   ``I did a lot of work but I knew I hurt him,'' Nicol said. ``I
knew at some point he was going to get very tired.''
	   In the middle of the match, Nicol settled into the cool,
methodical routine that he has used to easily dismantle his foes
throughout the tournament. It was the first time squash has
featured in the Commonwealth Games, which are held every four
years.
	   The flamboyant Power, a bandanna with a maple leaf logo wrapped
around his head, sparred constantly with the referee as he cadged
for replays or free points if he thought Nicol was in his way.
	   The umpire didn't always agree, admonishing Power: ``You must go
for the ball, not the man.''
	   So Power yelled, grinned in disbelief, lay motionless on the
ground for several seconds and even lobbed his racket over the
glass wall of the court after losing one game.
	   ``In the end, you've got to be a bit more solid mentally than
Jonathan Power to win a major championship,'' said Nicol, who won
the British Open this year.
	   ``He worked really hard. I didn't have enough fight,'' said a
dejected Power.
	   Martin, who won 9-0, 9-6, 9-5, overpowered her opponent in the
first half of the match. Constantly on the defensive, Fitz-Gerald
scrambled, fumbled and lunged and only won her first point at 0-5
in the second game after 15 minutes of play.
	   Then 30-year-old Fitz-Gerald began to dominate more points and
dictated some pace but Martin, 31, kept up a steady barrage of
drives and tight angles.
	   ``That first game was a huge boost for my confidence,'' Martin
said. ``You've just got to stay on top and keep edging forward.''
	   The two women, who breezed through the early rounds, share a
suite at the condominium complex where thousands of Commonwealth
competitors are lodged.
	   Martin, winner of six consecutive British Open titles, has
beaten Fitz-Gerald six out of seven times this year.
	   The women face a tough schedule in the next two months, with two
tournaments in Egypt, three in the United States and the world
championships in Germany. Ironically, Martin said, professional
squash players often don't perform their best at high-profile
events.
	   ``Because of all the tension that's in your system, all the
adrenaline that's rushing around, it doesn't really enable you to
play the best squash that you're capable of,'' she said.
	   The losing semifinalists in the women's competition, Cassie
Jackman and Sue Wright, both of England, shared the bronze medal.
	   In the men's, the bronze winners were Paul Johnson of England
and Alex Gough of Wales.

Sri Lanka's soldiers rescue wounded baby elephant in war zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A baby elephant wounded in Sri Lanka's
civil war and rescued by soldiers is the center of attraction in
the capital.
	   Dozens of people in Colombo crowded around the five-month-old
elephant on Wednesday while conservation workers fed it milk from a
bottle, days after a military patrol found it in the northern
rainforest.
	   Soldiers found the jumbo on Saturday, limping from a bullet
wound in its left hind leg, said Nandana Atapattu, deputy director
of the wildlife department. Atapattu's team then removed a rifle
bullet from its leg, and about a half-gallon (two liters) of pus
from the 5-day-old infection.
	   ``He was lucky. The bullet did not damage any bones, and we are
confident he will recover,'' said Atapattu.
	   The three-feet-tall (meter-tall) male, named Senadhi, or
Captain, was scheduled to be sent to an elephant transit home in
the south, where it will stay at least two years, until it is large
enough to be released to the wild in a safer part of the country.
	   Officials believe the elephant's mother was killed by either
soldiers or guerrillas near the town of Cheddikulam where it was
found, 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Colombo.
	   A 15-year war between ethnic Tamil rebels and the island's
majority Sinhalese has so far killed 54,000 people.
	   The country's wildlife often gets caught in the crossfire
between troops and Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a homeland in
the northeast. In January, Atapattu successfully returned to the
wild a Ceylon sloth bear that had been blinded in one eye by a
grenade explosion.
	   Sri Lanka's elephant population has been dwindling steadily due
to loss of habitat, and less than 2,000 are believed to be
surviving, half of whom are privately owned by businessmen and
Buddhist temples, which consider the animals a symbol of prestige.

EU Commission warns Russia against protectionnism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The president of the European Union
Commission Jacques Santer on Wednesday urged Russia's new Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov not to resort to protectionism to try and
solve his country's economic crisis.
	   ``There is a real risk that the wrong choices are made. I'm
thinking in particular of certain ideas circulating in Moscow
regarding currency issuance and the adoption of protectionist
measures,'' Santer said.
	   Santer, who heads the EU's executive body, was addressing the
European parliament in Strasbourg ahead of a joint meeting of
Russian and EU deputies.
	   Primakov was approved as Russia's new premier last Friday and is
still forming his cabinet. Russian liberals and media have been
critical of the new government, saying it will turn its back on
free-market programs.
	   The EU's Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den Broek, who
addressed the joint EU-Russia parliamentary committee later
Tuesday, urged Russia's politicians to solve their differences and
get to work on the economy.
	   ``A basic consensus between the government, the Duma (the lower
house of the Russian parliament) and regional authorities is now
urgently needed in Russia to find a way out of the current
impasse,'' he said.
	   He said the Commission's Tacis program for aid and development
to the former Soviet republics and Mongolia stands ready to offer
technical and financial expertise where it is needed.
	   ``We have in mind the public finance area and commercial bank
restructuring,'' he said.
	   Reforming Russia's tax and legal system should be a priority, he
said. This is a necessary condition for foreign investors to feel
they are operating in a secure business environment, Van den Broek
noted.
	   The Commission has repeatedly pledged support for Russia over
the past few weeks, but stopped short of offering more cash,
arguing that Russia needs to tackle its structural problems first.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Cara Honeychurch beat
her nearest rival by 378 pins _ and the top male bowler by 360 _ as
she won the women's singles tenpin bowling gold medal of the
Commonwealth Games Wednesday.
	   Honeychurch, the dominant bowler of the games, came out with
gold in every event she entered. She also was on the winning

	   She slowed down Wednesday from her 260 average in qualifying,
but still managed a 241.58 average for the 10 games of qualifying
and 16 of the match play final round.
	   With her 2,559 from qualifying and bonus points for 12 matches
won, the Asian champion reached a total of 6,406. That included a
perfect 300 game in qualifying and a 299 Wednesday.
	   Compatriot Maxine Nable, her partner for the women's doubles
gold medal, took the singles silver medal with 6,028, averaging
226.85.
	   Malaysia's Kenny Ang won the men's gold with 6,046, averaging
228.31 for the 26 games of qualifying and final match play. He won
11 of his 16 matches as he added the singles title to his men's
doubles gold.
	   Rowe took the men's silver with 5,946. He won 12 of his matches
Wednesday, and averaged 224.08 overall.
	   Canada's Warren Rennox, who also won 12 matches, won the bronze
with 5,850. He averaged 220.38 for the qualifying and final round.
	   Tenpin bowling made its Commonwealth Games debut here, at the
request of the Malaysian hosts.

UNHCR accommodates Kosovo refugees in former Coca-Cola factory

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of angry refugees
stood in lines that wrapped around the United Nations' refugee
agency in Sarajevo Wednesday, waiting for accommodation and food
supplies.
	   According to the United Nations' refugee agency, some 3,000
people from Kosovo have fled to Bosnia since fighting broke out
between Serb security forces and successionist Albanian rebels in
Kosovo seven months ago.
	   Already strapped for financial resources to care for thousands
of Bosnian refugees, the agency Tuesday began housing the most
desperate cases in an abandoned Coca-Cola bottling factory in the
western Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici.
	   Afrim Misini, a 25-year-old ethnic Albanian from Urosevac, in
Kosovo, is one of some 250 refugees now living in the factory that
has been standing idle since Bosnia's own 3,{-year war.
	   ``Finally we have a roof under our heads,'' he said, Wednesday,
lying on a mattress lined up in the dingy hall. Since leaving
Kosovo a few weeks ago, Misini has been camped out in an abandoned
boxcar behind Sarajevo's railway station.
	   While unregistered refugees _ estimated to be as many as 15,000
_ live in abandoned and destroyed houses, those who come to the
U.N. agency have been provided with shelter either in two camps or
at private accommodations across the country.
	   ``We know it is only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Ariane
Quentier, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency in Sarajevo.
The influx of Kosovo refugees is expected to continue increasing,
she said.
	   Some 250 Kosovars were sent to Hadzici on Tuesday. Another 150
are expected to arrive Wednesday. Outside the agency offices in
Sarajevo, some of the Kosovo refugees have been waiting for days.
	   Mehmed Hamza, 62, stood in line, a blank expression on his face.
He has been in Bosnia for three weeks, together with his wife and
four other members of his family. In Kosovo, Yugoslav army burned
all his property.
	   ``We are here to save our own heads. Unfortunately, it is
obvious that UNHCR isn't happy to see us,'' Hamza said.
	   Muhamed Veseljaj, 43, stood nearby. He would like to take his
large family to western Europe.
	   ``I know that Bosnia is exhausted with its own war and that they
can't help us,'' he said.
	   Inside the factory, exhausted refugees laid down on mattresses
or aimlessly strolled around, happy for a place to rest.
	   ``I hope that we will finally have a chance to take a bath after
two weeks,'' said Minisi.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ben Sharpe scored a hat-trick
Wednesday, including a last minute winner, as England beat Pakistan
3-2 to advance to the semifinals of the Commonwealth Games hockey
tournament.
	   England fought back from 1-0 and then 2-1 down and Sharpe broke
a 2-2 deadlock when he angled in a 69th-minute shot.
	   The match was marred by frayed tempers, the sending off of
Pakistan goalkeeper Ahmed Alam and a controversial decision.
	   Pakistan took an early lead when forward Ali Raza hammered a
pass that skimmed in the right side of the goal. Soon after, a
diving Sharpe equalized by deflecting a penalty corner shot into
the goal with a snooker-like jab at the ball.
	   But Muhammad Khalid came back in the second half to take
Pakistan into the lead again.
	   England stepped up the pressure and Sharpe tied the game in the
62nd minute before his final goal.
	   Pakistan's cause suffered when Alam was ordered to leave the
field after he threw a tantrum over a controversial penalty corner
decision, tossing his stick and gloves and gesticulating at the
umpire.
	   In a Group A tussle, South Africa crushed Wales 6-1. For the
African team, Greg Nicol scored four times while Gregg Clark and
Emile Smith got one each. Owen Griffiths-Jones scored the lone
Welsh goal.
	   The Indian men's team trounced Trinidad and Tobago 8-0 in a
Group A match but the women lost 4-0 to Olympic champions
Australia.
	   With the ball rarely leaving Indian sticks, star forward Dhanraj
Pillai, Baljit Singh and P. Laxmanan scored two goals each while V.
Selvaraj and Gagan Ajit Singh had one each in the Group A match.
	   The previously unbeaten Indian women, however, were no match for
the Australians, who now top Group A and are the favorites to win
the gold.
	   For Australia, striker Shelley Andrews scored in the 10th and
62nd minutes and Katrina Powell in the 12th and 22nd.
	   The Indian women might have lost by a wider margin had a
second-half goal been allowed. The umpires appeared not to realize
that the ball went through a hole in the middle of the goal netting
and Australian pleas and protests went in vain.
	   The Australian women already had won their first three games by
a total of 29 goals to none, against Scotland, Malaysia and
Jamaica.
	   In those three matches, they had earned 49 penalty corners to
one (unconverted) and rained 102 shots on goal to just seven
against them.
	   They have just one easy group match against Trinidad and Tobago
Thursday before Saturday's semifinal.
	   In Group B, New Zealand moved closer to a semifinal berth by
edging Canada 2-1.
	   Canada scored first when skipper Lauralee Kopeck flicked the
ball in off a short corner rebound in the 23rd minute.
	   Mandy Smith scored the equalizer and Robbie Matthews put in the
winner in the 40th minute.
	   In a one-sided Group A affair, South Africa crushed Namibia
12-0. Pietie Coetzee scored half a dozen goals while Susan Wessels
bagged three.
	   In a Group B tie, English women beat Wales 6-0. Tina Cullen
scored three of those goals.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An international observer commended
Croatia for progress towards democratic reform Wednesday, while
stressing a need to encourage further Serb refugee returns, as well
as media and electoral reform.
	   Tim Guldimann, head of the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe mission in Croatia, told reporters at a
news conference Wednesday, Croatia had made progress since severe
criticism of the organization four months ago.
	   ``There is a more positive momentum in the political development
... and cooperation'' with international powers, Guldimann said.
	   He also welcomed a steadily climbing trend of returning Serb
refugees and a seeming willingness on behalf of the government to
reform state-run television and a pro-government electoral
legislation.
	   Guldimann noted, however, that in order to maintain a positive
spirit, the OSCE member nations expected deeper and more radical
steps to promote wider and swifter changes in these areas.
	   He said that alterations to a government repatriation program
were required to ensure equal treatment before the law and
financial assistance for returned Serbs, would inspire even higher
numbers of returnees.
	   Croatia's Serbs rebelled against the country's independence in
1991, seizing a third of its territory. But in 1995, some 180,000
were forced to flee an army offensive which reclaimed the areas.
About 45,000 have returned, mostly in the last few months.
	   Guldimann also noted that Croatian radio and television, HRT,
was under the direct influence of the ruling party and in need of
an overhaul. HRT is the sole source of information for about
three-quarters of the population,
	   Although the next nationwide elections are not scheduled until
mid-1999, Guldimann said that adjustments were also necessary to
the existing electoral legislation which favors the ruling party.
	   ``These three areas are immediate issues and ... a keen interest
has been expressed by the international community to adopt them as
the next steps,'' Guldimann told reporters.

Crime specter extends to all in South Africa

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Over barbecues in fancy white
suburbs, in starched-shirt chamber of commerce meetings and at
government planning offices, the specter of crime hangs heavy.
	   It is topic No. 1 -- and the loudest voices are white.
	   Now a new study, the most comprehensive look at crime victims in
South Africa, finds the greater fear of murder and mayhem resides
among blacks.
	   In Johannesburg, one of the world's most dangerous cities,
two-thirds of Johannesburg's black residents and 87 percent of
colored, or mixed race, people felt unsafe in their neighborhoods
at night, according to a survey by the Institute for Security
Studies. That compares to 58 percent of whites.
	   In Cape Town, the fear factor for blacks was 50 percent, 53
percent for coloreds, and 16 percent for whites. The margins were
similar for Pretoria, though higher for whites in Durban.
	   ``Personally, I've never been a victim, but I'm afraid,'' said
Helen Mosholi, 27, a lab technician living in the black township of
Soweto. ``You can never go from point A to point B without being
afraid of being mugged, raped or stabbed, or having your jewelry
stolen,'' she said.
	   Like most things in this country, four years into democracy
after decades of white minority rule under apartheid, the debate
over crime has a racial undercurrent.
	   The study hit the front pages Wednesday after some scathing
remarks by President Nelson Mandela two days earlier.
	   He was asked by reporters about opinion polls suggesting fear of
crime is the main reason behind white South African emigration.
	   ``Some of the people have been frightened by the high level of
crime,'' Mandela said, blaming white newspapers for making it an
issue.
	   ``But we are convinced that real South Africans are being sorted
out ... . (They) are saying, `This is my country. I am not going to
run away from the troubles in my country. I am here to serve my
country.' ''
	   The study's author, Antoinette Louw, took issue with the view
that blacks were not rebelling against crime.
	   With the euphoria of the 1994 all-race elections wearing off,
``black people certainly have had enough (of crime) as well, but
you don't hear their voices,'' she said.
	   Under apartheid, crime in black communities was ignored as a
public issue and given little shrift by police. More attention is
being paid now, but policing often is still better in white
neighborhoods.
	   Blacks also tend to be the more likely crime victims, the study
showed, except for Johannesburg, where 70 percent of whites had
been hit by crime in the past four years, compared to 58 percent of
blacks.
	   Crime has become more than just the usual social ill.
	   It worries investors, has slowed the growth of tourism and
turned neighborhoods into fortress towns of walls, razor wire,
electronic gates and panic buttons.
	   According to Interpol statistics, South Africa's murder rate was
third highest in 1997, at 56.9 per 100,000 people, behind Swaziland
and Colombia.
	   In 1995, it had the second highest robbery and violent theft
rate, behind Puerto Rico, at 64 per 100,000.
	   Researchers randomly surveyed 14,000 people in the country's
four main cities, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Pretoria. No
margin of error was available.

Museveni: Ugandan troops will stay in Congo for security reasons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan troops will remain in neighboring
Congo to protect the East African nation's security interests,
despite protests from Kinshasa, President Yoweri Museveni said
Wednesday.
	   ``Our troops will remain there until there is a regionally
agreed model for peace,'' Museveni told parliament in a rambling,
two-hour lecture he said was intended to address concerns raised by
legislators about the role of the Ugandan armed forces in the
Congolese rebellion that broke out Aug. 2.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila claims Uganda and Rwanda are
behind the revolt. Both countries deny direct involvement in the
uprising of disgruntled military officers, including ethnic Tutsis
from Congo who were instrumental in carrying out an earlier,
eight-month rebellion against dictator Mobutu Sese Seko that put
Kabila in power in May 1997.
	   The current rebels, who include intellectuals and opposition
politicians, are trying to oust Kabila, whom they accuse of
nepotism, corruption and betraying the country he was supposed to
save.
	   Museveni, himself the leader of a five-year bush war that
brought him to power in 1986, expressed scorn for Kabila's falling
back on Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to save the capital, Kinshasa,
from capture by the rebels.
	   ``We have been facing a lot of problems during our time in
power, but we never called in foreigners,'' he said. ``The
propensity of such foreign involvement in Congo is directly
proportional to the internal weaknesses in that country.''
	   ``Ideologically, it's repugnant to have foreign troops defending
another country. To ask foreign forces to defend oneself is to
promulgate a motion of no-confidence in yourself.''
	   Ugandan troops originally moved into northeastern Congo about a
year ago with Kabila's agreement to flush out Alliance of
Democratic Forces rebels camped at the base of the Rwenzori
Mountains who were attacking western Uganda.
	   Both Uganda and Rwanda have sharply criticized Kabila for
failing to clean out the rebels from eastern Congo who are
attacking them.
	   ``The weaknesses within Congo are forcing neighboring countries
to be drawn in,'' Museveni said. ``If the neighbor's house catches
fire, other houses also get burned.''
	   ``Rwanda installed Kabila in power,'' he said. ``Now, it's
Angola. I tried to advise Kabila not to heavily rely on Rwandan
troops, but he insisted on Rwanda to help. It's now amazing to hear
him say that the Rwandans are aggressors.''
	   Museveni said the only solution to the current unrest in Congo
is for Kabila to sit down with the rebels and talk peace, something
he has refused to do.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwean troops drove rebels from southwestern
Congo and saved Kinshasa. The government now claims it has brought
the war to the east with attacks on Kisangani and the rebel
stronghold of Goma.
	   Rebels deny the claims and say the eastern region is still under
their control.

Defector confirms Tehran's involvement in 1992 embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Confirming longstanding Israeli suspicions, an
Iranian defector said in an interview published Wednesday that
senior Iranian government officials plotted the 1992 bombing of the
Israeli Embassy in Argentina.
	   The defector, Ahmad Rezaei, is the eldest son of Maj. Gen.
Mohsen Rezaei, a hardline policymaker and former commander of
Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
	   The younger Rezaei left Iran in February and has been living in
Los Angeles where he granted an interview to the Yediot Ahronot
daily, his first to an Israeli publication.
	   Rezaei said he used to accompany his father on several of his
missions, including meetings with leaders of the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Hezbollah at their bases in Lebanon.
	   ``The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was planned
in Tehran,'' Rezaei told Yediot. ``This is what my father told me
when he was the commander of the Revolutionary Guards.''
	   Israel, Argentina and the United States have blamed pro-Iranian
groups for the 1992 blast and a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community
center in Buenos Aires. The two bombs killed 114 people. Tehran has
denied involvement.
	   Rezaei described a chain of command in which terror attacks were
planned in Tehran and carried out by Hezbollah with the knowledge
of Syria, the main power in Lebanon.
	   Rezaei said a hand-picked group of senior officers from the
Revolutionary Guards traveled to Hezbollah bases in Lebanon and
supervised military exercises before the attacks were carried out.
	   The officers, who would move in groups of 20, each had different
areas of expertise, from piloting helicopters to working with
explosives, Rezaei said.
	   The decision to carry out an attack was made by a group of top
Iranian government officials known as the ``center'' - comprised of
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the information minister, a
military representative, the head of intelligence, a Revolutionary
Guards representative.
	   In the excerpts of the interview published Wednesday, Rezaei did
not say which specific attacks were plotted in this way.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni, must also give his
approval, Rezaei said.
	   The liaison between Hezbollah and Iran is the information
officer in the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Rezaei said.
``Everything was done with the full knowledge of the Syrian
president,'' Rezaei told Yediot.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of men and women demonstrated
against Afghanistan's Taliban militia Wednesday, chanting ``death

Wednesday for maneuvers announced Sept. 12, the official Islamic

EU Commission rejects air-traffic share out at Malpensa airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs on Italy's options; other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The European Commission on Wednesday
rejected a planned share out of airline traffic between Milan's two
airports, ruling in favor of nine non-Italian airlines who had
argued the plan discriminates against them.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive, ``had no option but to reach
the decision it did today,'' EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock
told a news conference.
	   To keep plans for the expansion of Milan's Malpensa airport
alive, Italy can now draft new proposals or ask the 15 EU
governments to overrule the Commission.
	   Under the EU's `weighted vote' system, it must get an
overwhelmingly majority of governments behind its Malpensa airport
project _ a dim prospect given that nine major EU airlines oppose
it.
	   Kinnock said there had been ``almost incessant'' contacts in the
past week with Italian authorities to find a solution but ``these
efforts have been to no avail.''
	   Last week, the Commission ruled the planned expansion of the
Malpensa Airport violates the EU fair competition rules.
	   Under that plan, foreign airlines flying in and out of Milan
would be obliged to move next month from Linate airport, just 10
kilometers (6 miles) rom downtown, to Malpensa which is 53
kilometers (33 miles) from the city center.
	   Only the Italian carrier Alitalia's shuttle flights between Rome
and Milan would be allowed to stay at Linate. Nine European
airlines complained that poor road and rail links from Malpensa to
downtown Milan would make their passengers switch to Alitalia.
	   ``Any airline forced to Malpensa on the basis of the existing
arrangements may legally oppose the transfer,'' the Commission said
in a statement.
	   Wednesday's decision brings the Commission a step closer to
legal action against Italy or reopening the Alitalia state aid
file. Last year, the Commission authorized a massive bailout for
the Italian air carrier.
	   In the past week, Kinnock held lengthy talks with Italian
Transport Minister Claudio Burlando. Those talks continued in the
margin of an meeting of EU transport ministers in Austria on
Tuesday.
	   ``That proved to be fruitless too,'' Kinnock said.
	   The nine airlines that have filed a complaint against Italy's
plans for Malpensa are British Airways, Iberia, TAP, Sabena,
Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic Airways, Austria Airlines and SAS.
	   In a statement, British Airways congratulated the Commission on
its ``firm position on the issue.'' It added Italy's plans would
create a forced distortion of the market place that ``could only
harm the interests of consumers.''

Officers seize more than 100,000 pirated video compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials seized more than 100,000
pirated video compact discs worth 1.9 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 245,000) after raiding 40 stores Wednesday evening in a
busy shopping mall.
	   Eleven people, aged between 22 and 65, were arrested when
customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau
raided 40 shops in Hong Kong's Kwai Chung district, a government
statement said.
	   The pirated discs included 12,000 of a Japanese television drama
series. The raid was carried out following last week's negotiations
between the Hong Kong government and Japan's Council for the
Protection of Copyright of Television Programs.
	   The department is stepping up its operations against pirated
Japanese dramas, the statement said. It is also concerned about
piracy activities through e-mail and the Internet.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list for
copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs creep back up like weeds. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.
	   Officers have seized more than 240,000 pirated Japanese
television dramas in separate raids since last Thursday, the
statement said.
	   The biggest seizure of pirated discs was in April, when officers
of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized 7 million pirated
video discs and production equipment worth U.S. dlrs 83 million.

Guerrilla leader urges Europe to counterbalance alleged US
</HEADLINE>
warmongering &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Colombian rebel spokesman on Wednesday
urged Europe to protest alleged U.S. military interference that is
damaging the prospects for peace in his country.
	   ``We are hoping that European opinion can counterbalance the
U.S. war strategy'' said Pablo Beltran from the ELN, Colombia's
second largest guerrilla group, at a Madrid press conference.
	   Conservative President Andres Pastrana took office last August
amid high expectations that he would negotiate an end to 30 years
of civil war with the country's rebel groups.
	   But according to Beltran, the peace process is threatened by the
United States.
	   ``What is in the middle is a (U.S.) strategy of war,'' Beltran
said at the end of a week in Spain that included discussions with
Colombian academics over a future peace agenda, and a visit to the
family of deceased guerrilla leader Manuel Perez.
	   The rebel spokesman accused the United States of supporting
right-wing paramilitary groups that have carried out massacres in
ELN zones of influence in the oil-rich north, greatly weakening the
group.
	   Beltran also said the United States, in response to the
possibility of a negotiated peace that would guarantee the rebels
future political influence, had boosted military aid for the army,
and prepared a military buildup in neighboring countries along
their Colombian borders.
	   As well as calling on Europe to protest U.S. policy, Beltran
also urged the Colombian government to grant an amnesty to
imprisoned rebels. He said the amnesty should cover crimes such as
ransom kidnapping that are not currently defined as political.
	   ``They should do it (grant an amnesty), and they should do it
now, so that a swap can be arranged with the soldiers and police
that the guerrilla are holding,'' he said.
	   Beltran said there are about 400 members of the armed forces
detained by the rebel groups and about 200 ELN prisoners.
	   Beltran also expressed skepticism about Pastrana's commitment to
seeing the peace process through. Although crediting the president
with ``demonstrating signs of wanting peace,'' Beltran said many of
the signs were ``just photo opportunities.''
	   The ELN, a Spanish-language acronym for National Liberation
Army, is Colombia's second largest guerrilla group and is hoping to
enter peace negotiations with the government and the larger
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   But Pastrana has prioritized talks with the FARC, promising
direct negotiations by November.
	   In response, the ELN has taken the political initiative and
enlisted judges, journalists, non-governmental organizations and
other civic groups to prepare a National Convention.
	   Beltran said that the agenda, date and location of the forum, a
unique opportunity for civic participation in the peace process,
would be announced on Oct. 12.
	   ``We hope that the convention can take place in Colombia but if
it is obstructed then we already have the offers we would need to
arrange it in Europe,'' he said.
	   Beltran's visit to Spain coincided with Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar's tour of Colombia. On Tuesday Aznar offered Pastrana
Spanish support for the peace process.
	   In Madrid, Beltran said that the ELN was hoping European support
of the negotiations would be ``multilateral,'' rather than
bilateral.

Basque homeland debate enlivened by regional elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KERNAN TURNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's election time in Spain's troubled
Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of action to end 30 years
of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by armed
ETA commandos fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
	   Basque nationalists urged this week that ETA renounce bloodshed
so that a political solution can be found.
	   Basque political parties, and ETA _ the Basque initials for
Basque Homeland and Freedom _ seek an independent nation, carved
out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political
groups, including the radical ETA political ally Herri Batasuna,
took a joint position on the issue. The so-called Lizarra
Declaration calls for peace talks and a permanent end of the
violence.
	   ``It would be a trick truce,'' Interior (national security)
Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said Wednesday, when asked about
the possibility of an ETA cease-fire.
	   Repeating the government position, Delgado said ETA would only
be seeking electoral support for its political allies in the Oct.
25 elections.
	   Herri Batasuna spokesman Kai Saez acknowledged cease-fire rumors
have ``snowballed'' in recent days, but denied the party had asked
ETA for one now. The party name is Basque for ``Our People.''
	   He said the party endorsed the Lizarra Declaration's position
that negotiations can be started without preconditions, but once
they entered the resolution phase, they would continue ``under a
condition of permanent absence of all expressions of violence.''
	   The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar,
takes the position it will not negotiate with ETA or its political
allies until ETA renounces violence forever.
	   The Lizarra Declaration came out of a so-called Ireland Forum
promoted by Herri Batasuna and held in the Basque city of Lizarra,
known as Nafarroa in Spanish. It was signed by representatives of
23 political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups.
	   The forum was inspired by the peace process in Northern Ireland.
The main premise was that, as in Ulster, the conflict has political
origins involving two countries--in this case Spain and France--and
can only be resolved through negotiations.
	   The forum and its declaration were boycotted by Spain's two most
powerful political parties, the ruling Popular Party and the
opposition Socialists, who agree that talks cannot be held with
terrorists.
	   Socialist Party Secretary General Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday
a cease-fire alone is not enough.
	   ``Just stopping the pointing of their pistols is not a
commitment to a lasting peace, and all the dialogue would be
watched over by guns,'' Almunia was quoted as saying by the
state-run news agency EFE.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's end goal, have
urged the commandos to stop the killing, but have not made it a
precondition for peace talks.
	   ``We ask that ETA listen to the outcry of the Basque people and
renounce the use of violence,'' Basque government spokeswoman
Carmen Garmendia said this week.
	   The government has said ETA cease-fires cannot be trusted.
	   ETA declared a truce for one week in 1996. That time it ended
with a series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the
government refused to negotiate unless ETA renounced violence
forever.
	   Prime Minister Aznar, himself the target once of an unsuccessful
ETA attack, has ruled out negotiations with ETA or Herri Batasuna
since the killing a year ago of a popular governing party councilor
in the Basque town of Ermua. Millions of Spaniards took to the
streets in protest in major cities around the country.
	   Aznar and his security forces have insisted they eventually will
stamp out ETA. Recent arrests in Spain and France have seriously
damaged ETA financing and closed down an influential Basque
newspaper.

Defector confirms Tehran's involvement in 1992 embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Supporting longstanding Israeli suspicions, an
Iranian defector said in an interview published Wednesday that
senior Iranian government officials plotted the 1992 bombing of the
Israeli Embassy in Argentina.
	   The defector, Ahmad Rezaei, is the eldest son of Maj. Gen.
Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-line policymaker and former commander of
Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
	   The younger Rezaei left Iran in February and has been living in
Los Angeles where he granted an interview to the Yediot Ahronot
daily, his first to an Israeli publication.
	   Rezaei said he used to accompany his father on several of his
missions, including meetings with leaders of the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Hezbollah at their bases in Lebanon.
	   ``The attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was planned
in Tehran,'' Rezaei told Yediot. ``This is what my father told me
when he was the commander of the Revolutionary Guards.''
	   Israel, Argentina and the United States have blamed pro-Iranian
groups for the 1992 blast and a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community
center in Buenos Aires. The two bombs killed 114 people. Tehran has
denied involvement.
	   Rezaei described a chain of command in which terror attacks were
planned in Tehran and carried out by Hezbollah with the knowledge
of Syria, the main power in Lebanon.
	   Rezaei said a hand-picked group of senior officers from the
Revolutionary Guards traveled to Hezbollah bases in Lebanon and
supervised military exercises before the attacks were carried out.
	   The officers, who moved in groups of 20, each had different
areas of expertise, from piloting helicopters to working with
explosives, Rezaei said.
	   The decision to carry out an attack was made by a group of top
Iranian government officials known as the ``center'' _ comprised of
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, the information minister, a
military representative, the head of intelligence, a Revolutionary
Guards representative.
	   In the excerpts of the interview published Wednesday, Rezaei did
not say which attacks were plotted in this way.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameni, must also give his
approval, Rezaei said.
	   The liaison between Hezbollah and Iran is the information
officer in the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Rezaei said.
``Everything was done with the full knowledge of the Syrian
president,'' Rezaei told Yediot.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Rwandan accused of genocide has `a peaceful conscience'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan governor, defending
himself against genocide charges, Wednesday told a U.N. court he
has ``a peaceful conscience,'' and most of the 52 people who
testified against him lied.
	   ``I have nothing to blame myself for,'' Clement Kayishema said,
concluding eight days of self-defense. ``I have a peaceful
conscience.''
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide launched by Hutu extremists in April 1994.
	   Kayishema, a Hutu, has pleaded innocent to 25 counts of
genocide, crimes against humanity and murder. If convicted by the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, he faces a maximum life
sentence.
	   Kayishema is on trial with businessman Obed Ruzindana, who also
has pleaded innocent. A three-judge panel adjourned their trial,
which began 17 months ago, until Oct. 21 when the prosecution will
make its closing argument.
	   The tribunal, beset by mismanagement and corruption since it was
founded in November 1994, has completed one trial, convicting
ex-Mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu of genocide. Earlier this month, the
court sentenced Rwanda's ex-prime minister, Jean Kambanda, to life
in prison after he pleaded guilty to genocide.
	   A total of 52 witnesses, including two journalists and a
Catholic nun, described in often frightening detail Kayishema's
role in the massacres in Kibuye, a district on Lake Kivu, west of
the capital Kigali.
	   ``I can only say that I'm praying for them because they have
come to say things which most of the time are not right,''
Kayishema said, according to the Hirondelle independent press
agency. ``I am in disagreement with them.''
	   Kayishema said he and other officials were overwhelmed by the
violence of Hutu peasants who blamed Tutsis for the assassination
of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, on April 6, 1994.
Habyarimana's assailants have never been publicly identified.
	   But prosecutors allege the massacres were orchestrated by Hutu
extremists trying to cling to political power.
	   They have accused Kayishema of masterminding a policy of
encouraging frightened Tutsis to take shelter in churches and a
stadium on the pretext of offering them protection, then
slaughtering them.
	   From a pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis _ the highest
concentration in the country _ only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis were left
alive in Kibuye by the end of June 1994, said African Rights, a
London-based human rights group.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Separate from the U.N. tribunal, Rwanda has carried out its own
prosecutions, has executed 22 people, and has about 130,000 people
in jail awaiting genocide trials.

Taliban has deadly Scud missiles in its arsenal against Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
said Wednesday it was ready to negotiate a peace treaty with Iran,
but warned that its arsenal is a formidable one that includes Scud
missiles.
	   About 200,000 Iranian soldiers are conducting a massive military
exercise on the border with Afghanistan amid high tension between
the two neighbors over the Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   Hakim Mujahed, the Taliban's delegate to the United Nations,
said Iran should know that the Taliban has an impressive arsenal.
	   Its Russian-made Scud missiles are the same type that Iraq used
to target Israeli cities during the Gulf War. The missiles, with a
range of about 160 kilometers to 280 kilometers (100 miles to 175
miles), are designed to hit large targets where they can do the
greatest amount of damage.
	   ``We have deployed our soldiers with all kinds of weapons,''
Mujahed said, including the Scud missiles, some of which he said
the Taliban inherited when they pushed their opponents from the
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   It was during the seizure of Mazar that 10 Iranian diplomats and
an Iranian journalist disappeared.
	   The Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight diplomats and the
journalist, but blamed the deaths on renegade soldiers. Iran vowed
revenge, and on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, put the military on full alert.
	   The standoff has raised fears in the region of a war.
	   Pakistan has urged restraint and offered to mediate, an offer
Iran is unlikely to accept given that Pakistan is believed to be
heavily backing the Taliban in the form of military training and
equipment.
	   Mujahed said the Taliban is looking to the United Nations.
	   ``It is up the to the U.N. to come up with a plan for
mediation,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad. ``We are ready to meet Iran
anywhere.''
	   Mujahed dismissed Iranian claims of mass killings in
Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province, where Iranian-backed Shiite
Muslims belonging to the opposition Hezb-e-Wahadat party have been
virtually routed.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says it has received
reports that the Taliban carried out widespread killing in northern
Mazar-e-Sharif, of Shiites in particular.
	   UNHCR says witnesses from there have arrived in Islamabad with
horrific stories of mass killings. Both sides in the bitter
conflict have been accused of atrocities.
	   Last year Shiite Muslims were said to have massacred 2,000
Taliban soldiers they had captured.
	   Meanwhile, Mujahed said the Taliban has sent several messages to
the United Nations seeking its mediation.
	   ``But mysteriously the United Nations is silent .. it is not
talking about a peaceful solution,'' he said.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of Iranians demonstrated Wednesday
against Afghanistan's Taliban militia, chanting ``Death to
Taliban!'' and ``Death to the U.S.'' amid high tension over the
Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   Iranian troops headed to the Afghanistan border Wednesday for
maneuvers announced Saturday, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   The divisions, which include tanks and artillery, will join the
bulk of the 70,000 troops that took part in maneuvers earlier this
month along the same border.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the military
on full alert on Tuesday as the public and newspapers called for
the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist to be
avenged.

	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ A South African couple who allegedly
prostituted their three underage daughters were denied bail on
Wednesday.
	   The girls' biological mother and their stepfather allegedly sold
the sexual services of the girls from 1995 to 1998 _ when they were
as young as 9, 12 and 15 years old _ for as little as 20 rands
(dlrs 5.55 at the 1995 exchange rate).
	   A 17-year-old youth and seven men who were arrested on rape
charges in connection with the case were due in court on Friday.
	   The girls' 39-year-old mother and 28-year-old stepfather, whose
names weren't released to keep the girls' identities private, can
apply for bail at their Sept. 21 court appearance. They were
arrested last week.
	   After the hearing, about 30 protesters sang songs outside the
courthouse and displayed placards saying ``Protect the child not
the abuser,'' and ``No bail for child abuser.''
	   The girls are in protective custody.

British investment firm takes stake in FC Basel Marketing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Fueling the controversy over multi-ownership of
soccer clubs by big business, British investment company Enic has
taken a stake in Swiss club FC Basel, the club's vice president
said Wednesday.
	   Enic is paying five million Swiss francs (dlrs 3.57 million) for
its 50 percent stake in the club's partner company FC Basel
Marketing AG, Mario Cueni said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
	   Enic already owns major stakes in Glasgow Rangers, AEK Athens,
Slavia Prague and Vincenza in Italy. Earlier this week, the firm
had a takeover bid for London club Tottenham turned down.
	   In May, European soccer's governing body UEFA announced a new
rule to prevent two or more clubs owned by the same company taking
part in the same European cup competition.
	   Greek club AEK Athens and Czech club Slavia Prague, both
controlled by Enic, qualified for the UEFA Cup in their domestic
championships. But UEFA decided to admit only Slavia Prague, unless
the Greek club could show it was no longer controlled by Enic.
	   In July, in response to a request for arbitration from the two
clubs, the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport
provisionally suspended the UEFA regulations and said AEK Athens
must be admitted to the new season's UEFA Cup.
	   The court said it concluded ``UEFA had not given the clubs
sufficient time to adjust to the new provisions.''
	   UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonnella declined to comment on the deal
between FC Basel and Enic because the club is not involved in UEFA
competitions.
	   ``UEFA is against cross ownership of clubs in European
competitions because that could harm the game of football,'' he
added. Gonnella refused to elaborate on the Athens-Slavia Prague
matter, saying UEFA's legal department was trying to find a
solution.
	   Cueni said the management of FC Basel and its players wouldn't
agree to deliberately lose a game in which it was involved because
of its ownership.
	   UEFA should change its regulations and find some other way of
allaying fears about match manipulation, rather than excluding
clubs from competitions, he said.
	   Enic's acquisition of the stake in FC Basel Marketing AG would
help improve the club's marketing and commercial activities, Cueni
said. FC Basel is currently second-placed in the Swiss national
league.

Soap operas in English just don't wash during dubbers' strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ridge speaking English just didn't wash for
soap-opera fans here used to hearing ``The Bold and the Beautiful''
hero only in Italian.
	   Upset about the consequences of a two-month-old dubbers' strike,
viewers on Wednesday inundated a TV network with protests.
	   Within three hours of the lunch-hour broadcast of the serial,
which goes by the name of ``Beautiful'' in Italy, hundreds of
viewers had called Canale 5 to demand their stars' voices only in
Italian, said Yuri Priori, a switchboard operator at Mediaset, the
media network of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
	   The callers, most of them women, also protested Tuesday's
broadcast of ``Guiding Light'' (here called ``Sentieri''), on
another Mediaset network. While ``Beautiful'' had an Italian
voiceover but with the original English still audible in the
background, ``Guiding Light'' had subtitles while the soap actors
spoke in English.
	   ``I won't watch it any more'' if ``Beautiful'' is shown again in
English during the strike, said Eleonora Sala, a 19-year-old
student. The voiceover, she said, was confusing, and she ventured
that elderly viewers might have a hard time following the program.
	   Italians like their films and TV shows in Italian, no matter
what the original language is, and the dubbers's strike, for more
money and royalties, has already put off the release of big
Hollywood films, such as ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in cinemas
reopening after the traditional summer shutdown.
	   Italian television is also heavy on American TV feature shows,
whose episodes are usually a year behind those being currently
shown in the United States. But since the new TV season doesn't
open until October here, the impact of the strike hasn't hit fans
of such popular fare such as ``Law and Order'' and ``ER.''
	   A spokeswoman from Mediaset, Silvia Catanzaro, said the
subtitled ``Guiding Light'' attracted more than 1.24 million
viewers, for an audience share of 14.9 percent. Normal share is
14.3 percent, she said, and it was too soon to know Wednesday's
share for the serial.
	   Asked whether the soap operas might be yanked until the strike
is over, Catanzaro said it was too soon to make any decision.
``We'll see how it goes,'' she said.

Britain joins European sanctions on Yugoslavian flight ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British officials reconsidered Wednesday and
joined European sanctions against the Yugoslav national airline,
averting the threat of legal moves by the European Union to force
Britain to comply.
	   But Foreign Office officials insisted the change of heart was
triggered by the worsening crisis in Kosovo and not by the growing
clamor among the EU for solidarity.
	   ``In the changed circumstances, we have concluded that it would
be right to proceed with an immediate ban,'' Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   The EU endorsed a ban on all flights into Europe by the Yugoslav
state carrier JAT last week in response to the crackdown by Serbian
troops against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Britain voted for the sanctions, but did not suspend landing
rights, saying a 1959 agreement with Yugoslavia required either
side to serve 12 months' notice before making any changes.
	   Britain gave JAT notice that all flights would be terminated in
a year's time.
	   British officials came under immediate criticism, with European
Commission President Jacques Santer accusing them of undermining
the entire ban. Santer said decisions taken by all 15 countries
should be carried out by all of the nations. The European
Commission began considering legal action to force Britain to
comply.
	   But that became moot when the Foreign Office announced Wednesday
that the threat to civilians in Kosovo outweighed legal
requirements to honor the 1959 agreement.
	   ``President Milosevic's current behavior, and in particular his
worsening record on human rights, means that on moral and political
grounds he has forfeited the right of his government to insist upon
the 12 months notice which would normally apply,'' Cook said.
	   He also said Britain would press the U.N. Security Council to
pass a worldwide flight ban on the Yugoslav airline.

	   EDIRNE, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish police intercepted 106 would-be
refugees attempting to cross the border into Greece, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The 80 Iraqis, 22 Moroccans and four Tunisians were rounded up
in four villages along the Meric river that runs along the
Turkish-Greek border in Thrace. The river is known as Evros in
Greek.
	   Authorities were unavailable for comment.
	   Would-be immigrants try to reach Greece, a European Union
member, as a gateway to other EU countries. The Meric river alone
sees thousands of attempted illegal border crossings each year.

Cruzeiro to try new offensive formation against San Lorenzo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Cruzeiro will try out a
three-forward offense against San Lorenzo of Argentina on Thursday
in a game for Group A of the Mercosur Cup.
	   Coach Levir Culpi said he planned to replace midfielder
Ricardinho with striker Marcelo, who will join all-stars Muller and
Fabio Junior in the front line.
	   A victory on Thursday would pull Cruzeiro even with co-leaders
San Lorenzo and Sao Paulo, each with six points. The Brazilian team
is tied with Chile's Colo Colo at three points.
	   Culpi is looking for ways to shake up his squad, which has
skidded since winning the Libertadores Cup in 1997. Cruzeiro has
played poorly in this year's national championship and now is in
21st place among the 24 clubs in the first division.
	   The team is glad to return to the familiar confines of Mineirao
stadium, the site of its only victory in the Mercosur Cup, a 5-1
thumping of Sao Paulo. In its away games, Cruzeiro lost to San
Lorenzo and Colo Colo, both by a 2-1 margin.
	   San Lorenzo also beat Colo Colo 3-0 at home and lost 2-1 to Sao
Paulo on the road.
	   In the group's other game, San Paulo plays at Colo Colo. If both
home teams win, all four will be tied for first place with six
points each.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. local time (0040 FMT) Friday.

It ends in tears for Ewe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian badminton star Ong Ewe
Hock attempted to play Wednesday despite his badly injured
hamstring, but the bid ended in defeat, and tears.
	   Ewe, the pre-tournament favorite, showed up for his second-round
match in the men's singles at the Commonwealth Games despite being
ruled unfit by team medical staff.
	   After his opponent, Pakistan's Mirza Ali Yar Beg, collected his
second point in the first game, the top seeded Ewe retired.
	   Ewe injured his hamstring muscle in his second game against
India's Gopi Chand Pullela in team competition Sunday after winning
the first 15-2.
	   He broke into tears after Wednesday's aborted effort to play,
and slammed his racket in anger as he walked to the dressingrooms
at the Kuala Lumpur Badminton Stadium.
	   ``To play in that situation is against medical advice...We have
told him about the risk if he falls again for the second time,''
said Dr. Ramlan Aziz of the National Sports Institute, who had been
attending to Ewe's hamstring injury.
	   Ewe was Malaysia's top candidate for a gold medal before the
start of the Games. The hosts have won three golds so far.
	   With Ewe sidelined, world No.7-ranked Yong Hock Kin takes over
as the hosts main hope, and he easily defeated New Zealander
Christopher Blair.
	   Hock Kin will meet India's third singles player Abhinni Shyam
Gupta who earlier disposed off Mauritius' Denis Constantin 15-9,
15-12 in an evenly fought match.
	   Pullela beat Scotland's Craig Robertson in straight sets 15-7,
15-5 in 35 minutes. Douglas Clark of the Falkland Islands went all
out against 3rd seed Wong Choon Hann but was no match for the
Malaysian who scored an easy 15-1, 15-2 win.
	   Choon Hann will meet Michael Watt of Northern Ireland who
earlier outclassed South Africa's Michael Adams 15-15-7, 15-10.
	   England's seasoned campaigner Darren Hall also advanced to the
third round by beating Welsh Matthew Hughes 15-3, 15-8.

Troops kill 29 Kurdish rebels in Turkey's southeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Troops killed 29 Kurdish
rebels in fighting in Turkey's southeast, authorities announced
Wednesday.
	   The clashes took place in the far eastern region of Hakkari over
the past 24 hours, the announcement said.
	   Kurdish rebels, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast
since 1984, offered Sept. 1 to have a cease-fire, but both Turkey's
military and government have rejected the offer.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict.

Allow landless villagers to settle on nature reserves, Malawi says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A state commission recommended Wednesday
that land-hungry villagers in Malawi be allowed to settle inside
the boundaries of nature reserves and on underutilized private
plantations.
	   The government could cut parcels of land from national parks and
hand over some unexploited private estates to tribal communities
that originally occupied them, said Patrick Saidi, head of the
government-appointed, 15-member Commission on Land Reform.
	   Saidi, presenting the commission's preliminary findings to
reporters, said the resettlement of villagers in and around nature
reserves would be ``a limited program.''
	   The commission made no suggestion that productive private land
would be seized by the government.
	   The commission was appointed by President Bakili Muluzi in 1996
after a series of disputes among rural communities over land.
	   The small, mountainous southeast African country suffers its
severest land pressure in the south, where villagers have access to
an average of half an acre (0.024 hectares) of arable land per
head, Saidi said.
	   That has led to family feuds and over-cultivation and erosion.
	   Malawi, with a population of 12 million, has few minerals and
depends largely on small-scale agriculture for its food production.
	   Some private tobacco, coffee and tea plantations have reduced
production in recent years because of domestic economic
difficulties that have made them uncompetitive on export markets.
	   Saidi said the commission's final recommendations will be
completed by February.
	   In neighboring Zimbabwe, the government intends to seize about
1,400 mostly white-held farms for land-poor blacks.

Sudan claims 50 Ugandans, rebels killed in clashes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS Kampala newspaper saying dead Ugandans were rebels
grafs 5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army has repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in southern Sudan, killing more than 50
Ugandans and Sudanese rebels, a government newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Three Sudanese government soldiers were also killed and five
others injured in Tuesday's clashes in Liria, Torit and Jabalain in
the province of Eastern Equatoria, which borders Uganda, the
official Al-Anbaa daily said.
	   It quoted a military statement as saying Ugandan forces and
southern Sudanese rebels used heavy artillery and tanks in their
attacks.
	   ``These intensive battles, in which your gallant armed forces
fought bravely'' claimed the lives of more than 50 people, mostly
Ugandan troops, the statement quoted Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim
as saying.
	   In Kampala, the government-run newspaper New Vision quoted a
spokesman for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army as saying
his group killed 40 Ugandans in a battle for the town of Jabalain.
	   Spokesman Justin Arop said the Ugandans were members of the
insurgent group, the Lord's Resistance Army, which has bases in
southern Sudan. The Ugandan government accuses the Sudanese
government of supporting the LRA.
	   Gen. Sirul-Khatim said Sudanese government troops destroyed
three tanks, three armored cars, a truck loaded with ammunition,
and other supplies for the Ugandan armed forces.
	   ``Fierce battles are still raging in some places, with the aim
of clearing them of the filth of these aggressive troops,''
Sirul-Khatim said.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
the each other's insurgents.

Taliban has deadly Scud missiles in its arsenal against Iran

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
said Wednesday it was ready to negotiate a peace treaty with Iran,
but warned that its arsenal is a formidable one that includes Scud
missiles.
	   About 200,000 Iranian soldiers are conducting a massive military
exercise on the border with Afghanistan amid high tension between
the two neighbors over the Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   Hakim Mujahed, the Taliban's delegate to the United Nations,
said Iran should know that the Taliban has an impressive arsenal.
	   Its Russian-made Scud missiles are the same type that Iraq used
to target Israeli cities during the Gulf War. The missiles, with a
range of about 160 kilometers to 280 kilometers (100 miles to 175
miles), are designed to hit large targets where they can do the
greatest amount of damage.
	   ``We have deployed our soldiers with all kinds of weapons,''
Mujahed said, including the Scud missiles, some of which he said
the Taliban inherited when they pushed their opponents from the
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   It was during the seizure of Mazar that 10 Iranian diplomats and
an Iranian journalist disappeared.
	   The Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight diplomats and the
journalist, but blamed the deaths on renegade soldiers. Iran vowed
revenge, and on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, put the military on full alert.
	   The standoff has raised fears in the region of a war.
	   Pakistan has urged restraint and offered to mediate, an offer
Iran is unlikely to accept given that Pakistan is believed to be
heavily backing the Taliban in the form of military training and
equipment.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz will travel to Tehran on
Thursday to soothe tempers.
	   ``We hope that Iran will not attack Afghanistan and that they
can settle the dispute through peaceful means,'' Aziz told
Pakistan's Senate or Upper House of Parliament on Wednesday.
	   ``Pakistan is deeply concerned about the crisis,'' he said,
denying his nation's involvement in assisting the Taliban. Last
week Iran accused Pakistan of supplying the Taliban with weapons as
well as military advisors.

Moscow mayor introduces price controls on staple foods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for feature approach, adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In this time of crisis, store manager Farik
Dabibov is having trouble remaining diplomatic about a decision by
Moscow's mayor to control the price of baby food.
	   ``It's going to be a serious problem, and our salaries are going
to get cut,'' said Dabibov, a store manager with a baby goods chain
in Moscow. ``Now we're just waiting to see what the government is
going to do with us next.''
	   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov decreed Tuesday that city retailers may not
mark up basic food products by more than 20 percent, at least until
Nov. 1. The list includes 27 categories such as sausage, cooking
oil, sugar, matches _ and baby food.
	   Many small stores already pummeled by the crisis said the decree
would push them closer to bankruptcy.
	   ``It's turning my work into a total mess,'' said Mikhail
Kochetkov, who runs a small market. ``I think about 20 percent of
businesses will survive the decree. We're certainly not going to
survive.''
	   With the ruble falling once again and business down after a wave
of hoarding two weeks ago, Kochetkov said he needs to raise prices
by 25 to 30 percent with each delivery to stay in the black.
	   Larger stores said they wouldn't be as hard hit by the limits,
with at least one fully supporting Luzhkov's decision. ``We're law
abiding citizens of Russia,'' said Lidiya Konstantinova, director
of a larger market. ``It's going to be hard for a while, but we
think it will ease the life of Moscow residents.''
	   Moscow authorities stressed that the controls were mostly an
attempt to retain calm in stores and halt shop owners from jacking
up their prices deliberately.
	   ``We do understand what a free market economy is, so the measure
is only temporary and is aimed at calming the situation down,''
said the deputy head of Moscow's consumer department, Svetlana
Korolyova, according to the Moscow Times newspaper.
	   But the decree, at a terse page and a half, is causing confusion
for some because it does not say if it applies to imported goods or
just domestic. The distinction is important because with the weak
ruble, store owners have had to pay far more for imports than for
Russian goods.
	   ``No, no, of course it doesn't affect imports,'' Konstantinova
said.
	   But Dabibov, the baby goods manager, and Kochetkov, the
supermarket director, both said they were applying the law to
everything on the list _ imported or Russian.
	   ``Sure it's hitting imports,'' Kochetkov said. ``And you think
I'm not going to obey this law? If I don't, they'll come in here
tomorrow and shut me down.''

Former Cabinet minister sentenced in corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A former Cabinet minister was sentenced
Wednesday to eight years in prison and ordered to pay dlrs 500,000
in the highest reaching corruption case in Armenia's seven years of
independence.
	   The court also said it was confiscating half of Rudolf
Teimurasian's property.
	   Teimurasian was minister of light industries when China granted
Armenia a dlrs 5 million loan for industrial development. In what
became known as the ``China case,'' he was accused and convicted of
stealing dlrs 4,098,000 of the money, along with a group of
accomplices.
	   Teimurasian was fired in 1992, the year after the loan was
granted and the theft was uncovered. Eventually, just under dlrs
1.4 million of the stolen money was returned to the federal budget,
authorities said.

Opposition ignores deadline to turn over weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Nano saying government has all the
authority it needs to arrest Berisha; Braho says parliament will
give Berisha until Thursday to respond to allegations &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, former President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the government _ from
jail if necessary.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,500 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting slogans against Prime
Minister Fatos Nano, who they blame for the weekend assassination
of popular politician Azem Hajdari.
	   Chanting ``death to Fatos Nano!'' Berisha's supporters marched
toward the city's main Skanderbeg Square for another rally, which
ended peacefully. Berisha claimed thousands of others were
prevented by police from reaching the square.
	   He called for another rally Thursday and urged followers to
break through police barricades if they had to.
	   Hajdari's killing Saturday touched off two days of rioting that
has plunged this impoverished Balkan nation into its second major
crisis in 18 months.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   Late Tuesday, the government demanded that Berisha's followers
surrender their remaining arms by dawn today or face a crackdown.
The party responded to an earlier demand by handing over a pair of
tanks seized during riots Monday.
	   But Berisha's bodyguards brandished semiautomatic rifles inside
party headquarters Wednesday, hours after the latest deadline had
passed.
	   ``No weapons have been handed over so far from the Democratic
Party supporters,'' Nano told reporters. ``The ultimatum given to
them by the Interior Ministry has expired this morning and since
then the police have all the authority based on the law to
operate.''
	   Parliament also ordered a criminal investigation of Berisha and
his top aides, accusing them of trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha told reporters. ``I'm prepared
to continue my battle in any situation. I will always be in the
country, alive or dead, in my house or elsewhere.''
	   Lawmaker Spartak Braho, who leads a commission looking into the
case, said parliament would give Berisha until Thursday morning to
appear before the assembly to answer the allegations before moving
to lift his immunity.
	   Outside party headquarters, Berisha's followers listened to his
remarks from a loudspeaker, chanting anti-Nano slogans. Berisha
said his followers _ who helped topple Albania's communist regime
in the early 1990s _ would oust the ``dictatorship of the
terrorists,'' meaning Nano.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of nationwide unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that
struck Albania last year following the collapse of shady pyramid
schemes that cost many people their life's savings.
	   Berisha was president during the pyramid investment crisis and
elections in its aftermath led to his ouster from power and the
rise of Nano's former communists in the Socialist Party.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing, but also widespread disappointment
with the government's inability to revive the economy and restore
confidence in the nation's future.
	   But the government appears committed to standing firm against
Berisha's challenge. Late Tuesday, parliament also enacted a law
transferring military police and some commando units from control
of the army to the Interior Ministry.
	   The decision means the government could use them to maintain
order without having to call in the army.

Education minister: one-third of kids out of school, asks help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Morocco's education minister says nearly
one-third of the country's school-age children aren't attending
class, and he appealed for help as the new school year began.
	   In an unusually frank roundtable discussion on national
television Tuesday, Moulay Ismail Alaoui said up to 2.5 million
children won't go to school due this year to a lack of funding and
transportation or because of family constraints.
	   Families often keep their children away from school either
because they're girls or are kept at home to work on farms,
explained Alaoui, a member of the 7-month-old center-left
government.
	   As a result of inadequate education, 55 percent of the Moroccan
population is illiterate, said Alaoui, calling the situation
``shameful.''
	   Many families, noting a large number of unemployed graduates,
prefer to put their children into apprenticeships, he said.
	   Those children who go to school must often walk or hitchhike
several kilometers (miles) to get there. Classrooms are often
overcrowded, dirty and unlit, members of the roundtable discussion
said.
	   Alaoui said that in addition to government action, ``universal
education also concerns business and non-governmental
organizations.'' He called for a general mobilization to put every
student in school.
	   Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi came to power in February,
appointed by King Hassan II after conservative parties failed to
assemble a governing coalition. Youssoufi is the first Socialist
head of government since Hassan came to power 30 years ago.

Report: India, Pakistan exaggerated size, number of nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pakistani minister denying oversatement of
blasts; ADDS detail on Kashmir; edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Both India and Pakistan exaggerated the size
and number of nuclear weapons they detonated in separate tests
earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday.
	   Quoting the findings of an independent study, the newspaper
reported that the two South Asian rivals overstated the power of
their atomic bombs by a factor of four.
	   In late May, Pakistan claimed it detonated six devices in
response to India's detonation of five nuclear devices two weeks
earlier. Both acts were condemned by nations around the world amid
fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in their
dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split
between them.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir since both gained independence from Britain in 1947.
	   But two of the nuclear tests India claimed may not have taken
place at all and only two of the explosions Pakistan announced
actually involved atomic bombs, the Times reported.
	   ``This is quite clearly a case where governments tested for a
political reason rather than scientific reasons, so we have to be
suspicious of what they say,'' said Terry Wallace of the University
of Arizona, an expert on the use of seismology to analyze nuclear
explosions.
	   In New Delhi, the Indian Foreign Office refused to comment on
the report in the Times. Officials at India's Atomic Energy
Commission, which also oversees the country's nuclear weapons
program, did not immediately return phone calls.
	   In Islamabad, Pakistani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Siddiq Kanju said, ``There is no question of overstating ... We
rely on our own information.''
	   Kanju refused to elaborate on this information. ``Let's not get
into scientific details,'' he said. ``I am a politician.''

<TEXT>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ This is what the dreamers of a new
Middle East may have envisioned.
	   Once they stepped through the elegant portals of the Oasis
Casino, Arabs and Jews found a shared purpose _ beat the odds at
blackjack, hit the jackpot at the slots and have a good time.
	   The dlrs 50 million glass-and-glitz gambling emporium in this
Palestinian-run town offered a luxurious, albeit brief, respite
from the resentments and suspicions that usually make it so hard
for Israelis and Palestinians to relax together.
	   ``We are all together. It's very nice,'' said Menachem Dante,
the longtime driver of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as he
sipped whisky and placed poker bets with a Palestinian dealer
during Tuesday night's invitation-only gala opening.
	   The ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail party,
with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty suits,
chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot machines.
	   Still, the tense reality of a 100-year bloody conflict could not
be shut out entirely.
	   The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, on Tuesday railed against the casino as a den of iniquity.
While Yassin did not make explicit threats, Hamas has killed scores
of Israelis in recent years and vowed only last week to resume
suicide bombings to avenge two members shot dead by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday night, dozens of security guards patrolled the
parking lot. Before bettors could play a hand of blackjack, they
faced searches and metal detectors. When the casino opened to the
general public Wednesday, gamblers had to register their passport
numbers.

Archaeologists furious over rabbinical appointments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli archaeologists decried a government
decision Wednesday to include five rabbis on a committee which
oversees all archaeological digs conducted in Israel.
	   The appointments were also likely to further tensions in a
brewing cultural war between Israel's religious and secular Jewish
communities over the role of religion in daily life.
	   Israel's education minister, Yitzhak Levy, a member of a
powerful religious party, announced the appointments Wednesday.
According to his spokesman Danny Shukon, the rabbis' religious
background will help solve disputes that arise during excavations
such as instances when ancient Jewish burials are found.
	   Ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that it is a sin to tamper with
Jewish burials, and in the past, many ultra-Orthodox demonstrators
have held violent protests at dig sites in an attempt to halt work
near possible graves.
	   But Moshe Kohavi, who heads the archaeological council committee
said ``There's no place for rabbis on the council.'' The council is
comprised largely of archeologists who advise the government on
approving dig permits and restoration plans and works to solve
religious-scientific disputes.
	   Kohavi said that archaeology should be a strictly scientific
endeavor, without political or religious influence. The council has
issued policy statements saying as such, he said.
	   ``I think it's not only my position, but the position of all
Israeli archaeologists,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   But the education ministry argued that the rabbis will be able
to assist in instructing archaeologists on the handling of remains
with respect to Jewish tradition while not disturbing the
excavation, Shukon said.
	   Archaeology is one of many areas in which Israel's religious and
secular populations clash. In recent years, religious communities
have up stepped protests over the use of roads and the opening of
restaurants on the Jewish Sabbath.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two more economic moderates were brought into
Russia's new Cabinet on Wednesday, but the ruble continued to fall
and the government's program for tackling the crisis remained in
limbo.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has now given new Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov four deputy premiers _ three of them considered moderate
reformers and one a Communist technocrat.
	   The new government, designed to accommodate Russia's disparate
political factions, has halted bitter feuding between the Kremlin
and Communist-led opposition. But it was unclear when it would
spell out a plan for easing Russia's economic crisis.
	   ``We have not yet drawn up any guidelines for our economic
policy; it is only being shaped,'' conceded the new deputy prime
minister in charge of financial issues, Alexander Shokhin.
	   Even the truce between various political factions remained
shaky.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned Wednesday that if any
leading reformers _ ``the odious people who ruined Russia'' _ were
brought back into the Cabinet, or if the government resumed the
``liberal policies'' of its predecessor, political confrontation
would flare up again.
	   However, in a sign of unusual support for the government, 59
percent of Russia's urban population approved of Primakov's
appointment, according to a poll by the independent All-Russian
Public Opinion Research Center, known by the acronym VTSIOM.
	   Only 17 percent disapproved, the poll indicated. The poll listed
no margin of error.
	   Fifty-nine percent is a remarkably high level of support in
Russia, where many people have grown cynical about government. By
contrast, Yeltsin's approval rating has been hovering around 4
percent.
	   The two new deputy prime ministers appointed Wednesday were
Vladimir Ryzhkov, a parliamentary leader of a pro-government
faction, and Vladimir Bulgak, who was science and technology
minister in the previous government.
	   Both are considered moderate reformers and are unlikely to
antagonize the opposition.
	   They join two previously appointed deputies: Shokhin, who is a
pro-government, centrist leader, and Yuri Maslyukov, a senior
Communist lawmaker, who previously served Yeltsin as industry
minister and now has been put in charge of economic policy.
	   The new government appears divided about how to handle the
crisis, including the question of whether to print more rubles to
pay millions of workers owed months of overdue wages. The
government has said its top priority will be to end this chronic
problem.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko has said he favored
expanding the money supply so the government could pay frustrated
workers and pensioners. But Shokhin was more cautious.
	   ``I'm not rejecting the very possibility of printing money, but
I am against the viewpoint that simply cranking up the money
printing presses will solve all our problems,'' Shokhin told a news
conference Wednesday. ``If we manage to restore popular confidence
in the government, that will allow us to avoid printing money.''
	   Shokhin also appealed to the Russian news media to stop using
the term ``printing money,'' which has a bad connotation. Instead,
he suggested, they could refer to ``an effective control over the
money supply.''
	   Russia's currency remained unstable Wednesday. The ruble had
been regaining strength in recent days as banks pushed for a better
rate before they paid off hard currency debts to foreigners.
	   But after rising to 7.5 to the dollar on Tuesday morning, the
ruble reversed course and was down to about 13-16 to the dollar in
street trading Wednesday.
	   Inflation already is soaring. Less than 1 percent a month before
the crisis hit in August, it was 43.3 percent in the first two
weeks of September.
	   ``We don't have an economy; we have a buffoonery,'' said Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov _ a potential top choice in the 2000
presidential election _ after meeting with Primakov.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin spoke by phone with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl about the crisis in Russia and ``stressed that the situation
is getting back to normal,'' the presidential press service
announced.
	   Yeltsin has made few appearances during the crisis and has not
said specifically what should be done, aside from general
pronouncements encouraging reforms.
	   The Standard and Poor's rating agency downgraded Russia's credit
worthiness again, this time from triple-C to triple-C-minus, news
reports said.
	   And the International Monetary Fund plans to withhold the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 aid package to Russia until the
government publishes its economic program, Interfax reported,
citing a joint statement by Russian and IMF officials.
	   Shokhin said Russia may still get the money, but ``the prospects
are not too rosy.''

U.S. lawyer says Austrian bank ready to review Nazi-era claims
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The U.S. lawyer representing Holocaust
survivors against a major Austrian bank on Wednesday praised its
``unique'' readiness to deal with his clients' claims but said it
was time for direct settlement talks.
	   Edward Fagan said discussions between his Manhattan law firm and
lawyers representing the Austrian Creditanstalt bank had been
productive.
	   But now, ``if we do not move on to direct talks with senior CA
representatives, there won't be much to talk about,'' he told the
Austria Press Agency.
	   Fagan also said that two other Austrian banks could soon be
faced with similar claims from Holocaust victims. He refused to
name them.
	   Austrian insurance companies will also be targets of class
action suits from Holocaust victims, despite their arguments that
they could not be taken to court in the United States, Fagan said.
	   Michael Witti, Fagan's Munich-based partner, urged major
Austrian firms to compensate Nazi-era forced labor victims and
their descendants.
	   He said documentary evidence was already being gathered against
VOEST, Lenzing and Steyr-Daimler-Puch, three major industrial
conglomerates.
	   Attorneys for Creditanstalt and its parent company, Bank
Austria, met last week in New York with lawyers for Holocaust
victims. On the weekend, Creditanstalt announced it was ready for a
``comprehensive review'' of its Nazi-era past.
	   Although its statement made no mention of any agreement, the
bank said the talks were ``constructive'' and will continue.
	   Creditanstalt was taken over by Germany's Deutsche Bank during
the Nazi era.
	   Fagan has been seeking compensation for gold stolen by the Nazis
from Jewish families and allegedly transferred by Creditanstalt to
Turkey during the Second World War.
	   The Austrian news magazine Profil, in its Monday issue, claimed
Creditanstalt maintained ``business contacts'' with at least 13
concentration camps, including Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen
and Dachau.
	   Profil said documents discovered in Polish archives showed that
Creditanstalt's branch in the Polish city of Krakow was used from
1941 for Polish families to transfer funds for use by relatives in
the nearby Auschwitz camp.
	   The magazine said the branch bank regularly received official
lists of those who had died in the camp so bank officials would
know which funds were not to be transferred.
	   Creditanstalt said it could not comment on the magazine report
until it had time to study the material. The magazine said the
Polish documents provided clear evidence that German and Austrian
bankers were aware of the death rates in concentration camps.
	   Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, one year before the
war began in Europe.

Norwegian soldier wounded in shell fire in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A Norwegian soldier was wounded Wednesday
when a mortar round fired by an Israeli army tank hit a U.N.
military outpost in south Lebanon, a U.N. statement said.
	   The statement said the Israeli tank fired three rounds in
southerly direction into a seven-man Norwegian patrol.
	   ``One soldier was hit with shrapnel wounds in his left hand,
resulting in the loss of one finger,'' it added. The soldier was
reported in stable condition at the U.N. field hospital in the
border town of Naqoura.
	   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-strong U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, said UNIFIL has strongly protested the incident with
the Israeli army.
	   In Israel, the army said an Israeli tank had fired at what it
termed ``suspicious movement'' on the eastern side of Israel's
so-called security zone.
	   Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said the incident was a ``bad
event,'' Israeli radio reported.
	   The army will take steps to improve the quality of its
operations, Mofaz added.
	   The U.N. position is in Blatt, a Shiite Muslim village north of
a border enclave occupied by Israeli troops in south Lebanon. The
area is 10 kilometers (six miles) west of Israel's northern Galilee
panhandle.
	   A total of 222 peacekeepers have been killed since UNIFIL
deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978 after an Israeli invasion.
Nine nations contribute to the force: Finland, Italy, France,
Poland, Norway, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal and Fiji.

	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) _ This is what the dreamers of a new
Middle East may have envisioned.
	   Once they stepped through the elegant portals of the Oasis
Casino, Arabs and Jews found a shared purpose _ beat the odds at
blackjack, hit the jackpot at the slots and have a good time.
	   The dlrs 50 million glass-and-glitz gambling emporium in this
Palestinian-run town offered a luxurious, albeit brief, respite
from the resentments and suspicions that usually make it so hard
for Israelis and Palestinians to relax together.
	   ``We are all together. It's very nice,'' said Menachem Dante,
the longtime driver of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as he
sipped whisky and placed poker bets with a Palestinian dealer
during Tuesday night's invitation-only gala opening.
	   The ambiance was much like that of an elegant cocktail party,
with many of the women in evening gowns and men in natty suits,
chatting against a backdrop of softly jingling slot machines.
	   Still, the tense reality of a 100-year bloody conflict could not
be shut out entirely.
	   The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, on Tuesday railed against the casino as a den of iniquity.
While Yassin did not make explicit threats, Hamas has killed scores
of Israelis in recent years and vowed only last week to resume
suicide bombings to avenge two members shot dead by Israeli troops.
	   On Tuesday night, dozens of security guards patrolled the
parking lot. Before bettors could play a hand of blackjack, they
faced searches and metal detectors. When the casino opened to the
general public Wednesday, gamblers had to register their passport
numbers.

Armenia gets new prosecutor general to replace slain official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenian President Robert Kocharian
appointed a new prosecutor general Wednesday to take the place of
an official who was slain in early August.
	   Agvan Ovsepyan, 45, succeeds Genrikh Khachatryan, who was killed
in his office in the capital, apparently by a fellow prosecutor who
committed suicide a short time later.
	   There was no indication that the killing was politically
motivated.
	   Ovsepyan is a veteran investigator who had headed the
investigative department of the prosecutor general's office since
April.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ After his followers ignored another
ultimatum to surrender weapons, ex-President Sali Berisha vowed
Wednesday to continue his campaign to oust the Albanian government,
even if he is jailed.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' Berisha told about 1,500 cheering supporters at his
Democratic Party headquarters. ``We will respond with a collective
sacrifice.''
	   Berisha's supporters responded by shouting for the death of
Prime Minister Fatos Nano, whom they blame for the weekend
assassination of popular politician Azem Hajdari. The killing
Saturday touched off two days of rioting in the impoverished Balkan
nation, where a failed pyramid investment scheme led to months of
unrest last year.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   If deputies follow up by lifting Berisha's parliamentary
immunity, he could be jailed.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha told the Wednesday press
conference. ``I'm prepared to continue my battle in any situation.
I will always be in the country alive or dead, in my house or
elsewhere.''
	   The government demanded that Berisha's followers surrender their
remaining arms by dawn Wednesday or face a crackdown. The party
already handed over a pair of tanks seized Monday during riots, but
hours after the Wednesday deadline Berisha's bodyguards still
brandished semi-automatic rifles inside party headquarters.
	   But Berisha's bodyguards brandished semiautomatic rifles inside
party headquarters Wednesday, hours after the latest deadline had
passed.
	   ``No weapons have been handed over so far from the Democratic
Party supporters,'' Nano told reporters. ``The ultimatum given to
them by the Interior Ministry has expired this morning and since
then the police have all the authority based on the law to
operate.''
	   Lawmaker Spartak Braho, who leads a commission looking into the
case, said parliament would give Berisha until Thursday morning to
appear before the assembly to answer the allegations before moving
to lift his immunity.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army has repulsed a
Ugandan-led assault in southern Sudan, killing more than 50
Ugandans and Sudanese rebels, a government newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Three Sudanese government soldiers were also killed and five
injured in Tuesday's clashes in Liria, Torit and Jabalain in the
province of Eastern Equatoria, which borders Uganda, the official
Al-Anbaa daily said.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
each other's insurgents.
	   Al-Anbaa quoted a Sudanese military statement as saying Ugandan
government forces and southern Sudanese rebels used heavy artillery
and tanks in their attacks.
	   ``These intensive battles, in which (Sudan's) gallant armed
forces fought bravely'' claimed the lives of more than 50 people,
mostly Ugandan troops, the statement quoted Gen. Abdul-Rahman
Sirul-Khatim as saying.
	   In Kampala, Uganda, the government-run newspaper New Vision
quoted a spokesman for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army as
saying his group killed 40 Ugandans in a battle for Jabalain.
	   Spokesman Justin Arop said the Ugandans were members of the
Ugandan insurgent group the Lord's Resistance Army, which has bases
in southern Sudan. The Ugandan government accuses the Sudanese
government of supporting the LRA.

tanks, three armored cars, a truck loaded with ammunition, and
other supplies meant for the Ugandan armed forces.

Three-way battle for county championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With four days remaining to decide the champion
county in English cricket, three teams _ Leicestershire, Surrey and
Lancashire _ are still in the hunt for the title.
	   The most critical clash will be between first-place
Leicestershire and second-place Surrey starting Thursday at the
Oval, while third-placed Lancashire is still in the calculations.
	   Leicestershire, winners in 1975 and 1996, can earn its second
county championship in three seasons with a win over Surrey.
	   Surrey can secure the championship with a outright win, while
Lancashire must rely on a draw at the Oval and score an outright
win over Hampshire at Old Trafford to grab its third domestic title
this season.
	   Lancashire has already won the AXA league and Natwest Trophy
limited-overs competitions this season and has hit form at the end
of the season.
	   Surrey, featuring a host of internationals including England
captain Alec Stewart, Mark Butcher, Graham Thorpe, Ian Salisbury
and Adam and Ben Hollioake, was leading the championship until
Sept. 4 when it lost to Yorkshire.
	   ``We have a lot of international players who thrive on pressure
and they will be really looking forward to getting out there and
giving it a go,'' Surrey captain Adam Hollioake said Wednesday.
	   Surrey, undefeated at the Oval this season, still has a strong
chance to clinch its 17th county championship but has several key
selection dilemas.
	   Its key strike bowler, off-spinner Saqlian Mushtaq, is
unavailable due to international commitments with Pakistan and has
to be replaced with another spinner.
	   Graham Thorpe has been sidelined with injury since England's
winning test series against South Africa and doubts remain over his
fitness.
	   Wasim Akram will bring a 10-year stint with Lancashire to an end
when he leads the Manchester-based team onto the field on Thursday.
	   The former Pakistan captain announced Tuesday he was quitting
international cricket to concentrate on fighting match-fixing
allegations in Pakistan.
	   He is being replaced at Lancashire next season by Sri Lankan
off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan.
	   Lancashire has not won the County Championship outright since
1934, although it did share the title with Surrey in 1950.
	   England opener Michael Atherton is the only player in doubt for
Lancashire but he is expected to be fully recovered from a back
injury which kept him out of England's 10-wicket loss to Sri Lanka
at the Oval three weeks ago.
	   Hampshire captain Robin Smith said he was confident his team
could reverse its Natwest Trophy semifinal loss to Lancashire.
	   ``We know it's going to be a difficult game because Lancashire
still have a chance of winning the title,'' he said.
	   ``But we still haven't made amends for losing to them in the
NatWest and we know that on our day we can be a match for anyone.''

Conference urges environmentally friendly business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The World Wide Fund for Nature opened its
conference on Wednesday with a campaign to encourage investment in
companies that recognize good environmental practices are good for
business.
	   The conference, which also promoted the use of an international
Forest Stewardship Council symbol stipulating protections for the
world's forests, follows a recent stunning victory for
environmentalists in Canada. MacMillan Bloedel, a logging company
targeted by protesters for five years, announced in June that it
will phase out all clear-cutting in British Columbia over five
years.
	   Earlier, several big American and European companies had
canceled or reduced orders because of MacMillan Bloedel's logging
practices, the fund said.
	   ``This was a watershed for people to realize that you can be
both environmentally friendly and get really good returns on your
investments at the same time,'' Ed Mattew, spokesman for the World
Wide Fund for Nature, said of Wednesday's conference. ``That's
something that people really haven't realized before.''
	   At present only 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) _ or 1
percent _ of the world's depleting forests are run by companies
certified by the council for good logging and other practices. But
the figure has doubled within the last eight months, and the WWF's
target is 25 million hectares (nearly 62 million acres) by 2001.
	   Among the delegates attending the London conference was the head
of AssiDoman, a giant forest company in Sweden whose entire
holdings are run under the council's guidelines.
	   ``As a result, we've increased our sales and attracted new
customers,'' AssiDoman President Lennart Ahlgren said in prepared
remarks.
	   Underlining that consumer organizations, particularly big users
of paper and other wood-products, also register to buy only
products that meet environmental standards, representatives of the
New York City pension funds also attended the conference.
	   Public concern about forest loss and forest management has
overtaken recycling and use of chemicals, the World Wild Life Fund
maintains.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Kosovo
refugees stood in lines that wrapped around the U.N. refugee agency
in Sarajevo on Wednesday, waiting for accommodation and food
supplies.
	   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, about
3,000 people from Kosovo have fled to Bosnia since fighting broke
out between Serb security forces and seccessionist Albanian rebels
in the Serbian province of Kosovo seven months ago.
	   Already strapped for financial resources to care for thousands
of Bosnian refugees, the UNHCR on Tuesday began housing the most
desperate Kosovo cases in an abandoned Coca-Cola bottling factory
in the western Sarajevo suburb of Hadzici.
	   Afrim Misini, a 25-year-old ethnic Albanian from the Kosovo town
of Urosevac, is one of about 250 refugees now living in the
factory, which has been standing idle since Bosnia's 3 1/2-year
war.
	   ``Finally we have a roof under our heads,'' he said Wednesday,
lying on a mattress lined up in the dingy hall. Since leaving
Kosovo a few weeks ago, Misini has been camped out in an abandoned
boxcar behind Sarajevo's railway station.
	   While unregistered refugees _ estimated to be as many as 15,000
_ live in abandoned and destroyed houses, those who come to the
U.N. agency have been provided with shelter either in two camps or
at private accommodations across Bosnia.
	   About 250 Kosovars were sent to Hadzici on Tuesday. Another 150
were expected to arrive Wednesday.
	   ``We know it is only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Ariane
Quentier, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency in Sarajevo.
	   Muhamed Veseljaj, 43, stood in line outside the agency offices
in Sarajevo. He would like to take his large family to western
Europe.
	   ``I know that Bosnia is exhausted with its own war and that they
can't help us,'' he said.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ More rain in southern Chiapas state
delayed aid flights Wednesday to villages isolated by a week of
flooding, and hunger became more acute among the hundreds of
thousands of affected people.
	   Helicopters resumed their work shuttling food, water and
medicine to the 400,000 people cut off by mudslides, swollen rivers
and downed bridges when the rain let up in the late morning,
Chiapas state official Cecilio Hernandez Gamboa said by telephone.
	   Forecasters predicted more heavy rain in the coming days.
	   The U.S. State Department cautioned Americans to take care in
traveling in Mexico because of the floods, noting that many roads
and bridges are washed out and many are barely passable.
	   Floods last week tore through the coastal regions of Chiapas
state, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without food, water
or power. The state's mountainous regions, site of a 4 1/2-year
rebellion by the Zapatista National Liberation Army, were not
affected.
	   Hunger was increasing among flood victims, and in one village
people attacked a military helicopter dropping off aid, according
to the Mexico City newspaper Reforma.
	   In the village of Soconusco, 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest
of Tapachula, dozens of villagers swarmed onto a helicopter
dropping off their rations Tuesday, grabbing everything inside the
chopper. Soldiers were unable to stop them, Reforma said.
	   ``People are starving to death here,'' Reforma quoted local
leader Leobardo Broca as telling the soldiers. ``See for
yourselves. I want all of you to understand that I'm not guilty of
anything, because you've left us alone.''
	   Reforma said the fight among villagers for the aid was intense.
Two women fought over the same sack of flower, and the sack split
in half, the helicopter's rotors sending flour raining down on the
entire scene.
	   The official death toll remained at 90, but local newspapers put
the toll at more than 200.
	   The Roman Catholic bishop of Tapachula, Monsignor Felipe
Arizmendi, said the church expected the death toll to reach 500 or
even 1,000 when officials are able to count all the missing from
tiny villages in the mountains.
	   In a telephone interview, he denied reports that the church had
counted 350 bodies, saying that number was the maximum number of
bodies the church believed could be found.
	   Many of the bodies are believed to have washed into the Pacific
or disappeared beneath the mud.
	   State government officials said Wednesday that helicopters had
been grounded Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning because of
rain, but the rain turned into a drizzle and the aid teams resumed
their work.
	   Mexico's Red Cross continued to call for donations of food and
medicine. Among those responding was Pope John Paul II, who donated
dlrs 50,000 through Catholic charities for Mexico.

Tens of thousands displaced as fighting in Kosovo moves north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with UNHCR hearing reports of 10,000 displaced in
northern Kosovo, ethnic Albanians say shelling continues.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces moved Wednesday
to crush a rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, spreading fighting
to a hitherto peaceful part of the province and sending thousands
of people fleeing.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province, said Serb forces were shelling
12 villages between Kosovska Mitrovica and Podujevo, towns some 30
kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Pristina.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Pristina, said agency
staffers who managed to get close to the area saw houses burning in
some of the villages and were told by locals that some 10,000
people from at least seven villages had been forced to flee.
	   The region north of Pristina is believed to be one of the two
remaining strongholds of the ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence of Kosovo from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. The central Drenica region is
the other rebel pocket.
	   Outgunned by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, the rebels have
been on the run in most of Kosovo over the past weeks, and were
pushed out of some Drenica villages on Monday and Tuesday. The
offensive north of Pristina could be the final push against the
militants.
	   Serb police confirmed the fighting saying ``strong groups of
Albanian extremists were destroyed'' in clashes that left six
guerrillas and a police officer dead and four other officers
wounded.
	   Yugoslav soldiers blocked off all roads into the area, refusing
access to observers and reporters.
	   Fernando Del Mundo, the Pristina-based spokesman for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said his agency's staffers were
banned from the region by Serb forces. They saw houses on fire in
three villages and could see smoke billowing from two more, said
Del Mundo. He said the refugees were reportedly packed in the
village of Lisica.
	   The attacks have so far created a flood of nearly 300,000
displaced. Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanians, but
the province is part of Serbia which stripped it off autonomy in
1989.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill warned NATO
representatives of a building humanitarian disaster.
	   Hill said his efforts at peace have been hampered by violence on
the ground. The American diplomat is trying to forge an interim
settlement granting Kosovo self-rule.
	   In recent weeks, American and European officials have signaled a
growing NATO readiness to take military action against Serbia even
without prior approval from the United Nations.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people lacking
shelter after being forced to flee the fighting won't make it
through the harsh winter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from an
estimated 40 of Kosovo to only a few patches, mostly in the
mountains. The Serb offensives that started on Feb. 28, fighting
has concentrated mostly in the east and west of Kosovo.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported Wednesday that two ethnic
Albanians who tried to go back to their homes in the region of
Malisevo, southwest of Pristina, were killed by police. The same
source said three babies had died among the refugees there.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb Media Center said that investigators found
additional six bodies near the western Kosovo village of Glodjane,
bringing the total found in the past week to 34. Police have
accused the KLA of mass executions of Serb civilians.
	   Neither report could be independently confirmed.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Parliament banned tobacco from radio and
television on Wednesday, including cigarette commercials and
indirect advertising such as sponsorships of sports events.
	   The ban is part of a rules restricting the advertising of
alcohol and other addictive substances on broadcast media and is
contained in a law on radio and television expected to be completed
later this year.

Russian, Japanese musicians perform for Yeltsin, Hashimoto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with concert taking place &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With former Japanese Prime minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the audience,
Mstislav Rostropovich and Japan's Seiji Ozawa took turns conducting
Wednesday night at a gala musical performance.
	   The concert at the Grand Hall of the Russian Conservatory of
Music was part of a celebration of Russian-Japanese friendship.
Even though the two countries don't have much history as friends,
both Yeltsin and Hashimoto and Ozawa and Rostropovich enjoy warm
relations.
	   Yeltsin and then-Prime Minister Hashimoto had a warm informal
summit in Japan in April, and addressed each other as ``Boris'' and
``Ryu.''
	   ``And I thought: Why shouldn't the great Japanese conductor
Seiji Ozawa and I also show our friendship, our bridge from heart
to heart,'' Rostropovich was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The celebration, called ``Heart to Heart: The Russian-Japanese
bridge,'' included the performance of ``War Requiem'' by British
composer Benjamin Britten on Wednesday night, with Rostropovich and
Ozawa taking turns conducting.
	   Ozawa is later to lead the Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra in
four days of concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
	   Hashimoto resigned as prime minister last month and was named
special foreign policy advisor by his successor, Keizo Obuchi.
Obuchi served as foreign minister under Hashimoto.
	   Relations between Russia and Japan have long been strained. The
countries have fought two wars in this century, and are still at
odds over Russia's World War II claim to the Kuril Islands off the
southern Japanese coast.

Germany requests extradition of terror suspect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to add that prosecutors so far have not named
other charges, background on Germany, minor edits to tighten &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIESBADEN, Germany (AP) _ German and Austrian prosecutors have
separately requested the extradition of a terrorist suspect
arrested last week in France after 23 years on the lam.
	   Germany wants to try Hans-Joachim Klein, a former leftist
radical, for alleged involvement in a 1975 attack on an OPEC
conference in Vienna in which three people were killed. State
prosecutors in Hesse made the extradition request Tuesday.
	   Klein, a suspected member of the Red Army Faction terror group,
has been on Germany's list of wanted terrorists for more than two
decades. German prosecutors have not announced any other charges
against him, although they are interested in what he has to say
about the left-wing terror network that destabilized Germany for
two decades.
	   Germany commonly tries its own citizens for crimes committed in
other countries.
	   Austria has also started the legal procedure to request
extradition of Klein for the same crime, Justice Ministry spokesman
Gert Felsenstein said in Vienna.
	   Orders for the attack are believed to have come from Ilich
Ramirez Sanchez, the man known as Carlos, who is now in a French
jail serving a life term for a triple murder in another case.
	   Klein, now 50, is suspected as one of the participants in the
attack. He was arrested last week in a village in southern France
where he had lived under a false identity for five years.
	   In an interview with reporters from the Hamburg-based
newsmagazine Stern before his arrest, Klein said he planned to give
himself up, the magazine said Tuesday.
	   That matches his lawyer Eberhard Kempf's assertion that he had
been negotiating with authorities to have Klein turn himself in,
although details were still being worked out at the time of the
arrest.
	   Klein told the magazine that he had not ``provably killed
anyone.''
	   During the interview, Klein portrayed himself as a man living in
fear of being discovered. He did not hold a regular job, working
instead as a farm hand or renovating houses.
	   ``The fear was always there,'' Stern quoted Klein as saying.
``In principle, I only left the house alone on Saturday afternoons
to shop and on Mondays and Fridays for karate training. Otherwise I
never left the house alone.''
	   While living on the lam, he met a teacher from Chartres, with
whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. The couple split
after 12 years.
	   Klein said the strain of his life in hiding brought thoughts of
suicide, but he decided not to follow through because of his
children, Stern said.
	   ``I somehow came to the end of the road, and had to make a
decision,'' Stern quoted Klein as saying. ``I don't want to go to
jail after all these years. But I'm doing it so I can begin a new
life.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of men and women demonstrated
against Afghanistan's Taliban militia Wednesday, chanting ``death
to Taliban'' and ``Death to the U.S.'' as tensions between the two
neighbors run high over the Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   Nine Iranian divisions headed to the Afghanistan border
Wednesday for maneuvers announced Sept. 12, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   The divisions, which include tanks and artillery, will join the
bulk of the 70,000 troops that took part in maneuvers along the
same border earlier this month.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the military
on full alert on Tuesday as the public and newspapers called for
the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist to be
avenged.
	   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi warned the Taliban Wednesday
that Iranian patience has limits.
	   Asked how the government was going to respond to the killings,
Kharrazi told Tehran radio that before Iran took military action,
it had to ``provide an opportunity for political and peaceful
solutions.''
	   ``It would be better for the Taliban not to miss this
opportunity,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Outside Tehran University, protesters condemned Pakistan and its
government, chanting ``Nawaz Sharif shame on you,'' in reference to
Pakistan's prime minister.
	   Pakistan is believed to provide the Taliban with military and
other support while Iran is suspected of backing the opposition
which represents Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims.
	   The demonstrators read out a statement which accused the United
States of interfering in Afghanistan.
	   ``Once again the dirty hands of the U.S. created a militant
group from the Stone Ages which does not hesitate to kill innocent
children and women.''
	   Iran's government also has blamed the United States for
supporting the Taliban, ignoring the U.S. condemnation of the
murders of the diplomats and a recent air raid on bases belonging
to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden on Taliban territory.
	   The fundamentalist Taliban militia admitted Sept. 10 to killing
the eight diplomats and a journalist for Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency after its forces captured the Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to
the border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The bodies of seven of the nine Iranians arrived in Tehran
Monday.
	   IRNA also reported that one of two missing diplomats who escaped
and returned home, Allah-Dad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, witnessed the
``barbaric killings of the Iranians'' when the Taliban attacked
Iran's consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   It said Qare_Husseini was injured. The other diplomat, Hussein
Akbari, was not in the embassy during the raid, the agency said.

 &UR; Study suggests blind people compensate with more acute hearing &QL; 
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ It might be true what they say about the
blind having better hearing than people who can see.
	   Blind people apparently compensate for their lost vision with
greater ability to locate sounds than people with normal or partial
vision, a Canadian study suggests.
	   Neuropsychology researchers at the University of Montreal found
that unlike people with normal vision, blind people could correctly
pinpoint the source of sounds even with one ear deliberately
blocked by the testers.
	   Normally, people use the subtle differences in the way sounds
reach each of their ears to tell where a noise originates.
	   Experts who did not take part in the study, reported in
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, said they were intrigued by
the findings but found them inconclusive because of the small
number of people tested: 47.
	   One important question left unanswered is whether blind people
learn to use their hearing more efficiently or undergo some kind of
physiological change, said William R. Wiener, chairman of blind
rehabilitation at Western Michigan University.
	   Wiener said other recent research suggests ``there may be some
physiological changes that occur in the brain in the processing
that make a blind person more efficient.''
	   The Canadian researchers tested eight people who are blind
because of damaged retinas or optic nerves, three people with
partial vision and 36 people with normal vision.
	   Seven of those who could see were blindfolded for the test. The
participants sat in a chair amid 16 loudspeakers arranged in a
semicircle and draped with cloth. Sounds were played at random
through the speakers and the person in the chair was asked to point
to the source of the sound.
	   When everyone had one ear plugged, the totally blind people did
better than those with normal vision. With everyone using both
ears, the blind people did as well as those who could see.
	   To researchers' surprise, partially blind people with a bit of
peripheral vision did worse than those who were totally blind or
had normal vision.
	   Dr. Steven Parker, director of developmental and behavioral
pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, said it is possible that part
of the brain commonly used to process images gets recruited to
process sound. But in the partially blind, those brain cells
already are being used for sight and they can't switch over, he
said.
	   Bill Jacobson, a University of Arkansas-Little Rock professor
who specializes in rehabilitating the blind, noted that the study
didn't say whether the blind people had received training to
improve their ability to find the source of sounds. Such training
is used in rehabilitation programs to help blind people find their
way around.

Mother of Bangladeshi author asks Muslims for forgiveness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Facing death threats from Islamic
fundamentalists, Taslima Nasrin has suffered enough and it's time
to forgive her, the author's mother said Wednesday.
	   Islamic fundamentalists called for her death after a newspaper
quoted her saying that Koran, the Islamic holy book should be
rewritten. Nasrin says she was misquoted, but does favor changes in
Islamic laws to give more rights to women in predominantly Muslim
Bangladesh.
	   ``Please forgive my daughter if she has hurt anyone's religious
sentiments,'' Eid-ul-Ara Begum, 60, said in an interview with The
Associated Press at her daughter's apartment in the Bangladeshi
capital, Dhaka.
	   According to Dhaka newspapers, Nasrin came back with her mother,
who is suffering from colon cancer.
	   ``Doctors at New York told me that I'll survive only a couple of
months,'' the mother said, ``I want my daughter to remain at my
bedside when I die.''
	   She refused to comment on local news reports that Nasrin, 36,
returned home from New York on Monday after a four-year exile in
Europe.
	   ``I'm worried about my daughter. Don't ask me anything about the
reports,'' she said, sobbing.
	   Top police officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that Nasrin is back home and is in hiding, for fear of assailants
seeking a cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) offered to
anyone who killed her.
	   The officers said they were unable to trace her.
	   The author fled the country in 1994 after former Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia's government ordered her arrest on blasphemy charges.
Before leaving for Stockholm, Sweden, she spent one month in
hiding.
	   ``My daughter has promised to me that she will never write
anything against Islam,'' Nasrin's mother told The Associated
Press.
	   On Tuesday, more than 500 Islamic radicals paraded Dhaka streets
calling for the author's death.
	   They asked the government to arrest Ms. Nasrin and put her on
trial.
	   Legally, she can still be tried in a blasphemy case filed in
1994. But Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who replaced Mrs. Zia in
1996, did not press for it.
	   On bail, Nasrin is not barred against returning to Bangladesh.
	   Nasrin angered fundamentalists with her novel, Lajja
(``Shame''), which criticized Muslims for attacking minority Hindus
in Bangladesh following the 1992 destruction of a mosque by Hindu
zealots in neighboring India.

Palestinians take advantage of new status to attend U.N. debate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Palestinians are coming, but Palau
isn't. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers are still trying to get in.
	   In all, 181 of the 185 U.N. member states plan to address the
General Assembly's general debate, the two-week marathon of
speeches that lets leaders from nations big and small tell the
world what, according to them, are the most pressing problems in
the world today.
	   The speeches begin Monday.
	   Top issues this year include disarmament, human rights,
terrorism and the Asian financial crisis. Reform of the United
Nations, a major topic in years past, was expected to figure in the
speeches, though perhaps less prominently than previous sessions,
diplomats say.
	   So far, 26 heads of state have signed up to speak, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, South African President Nelson Mandela
and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami _ the first time in 12 years
Iran has been represented at that level. Another 20 heads of
government have also confirmed their attendance.
	   On the sidelines of the debate, the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan plan to meet; foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nation, or ASEAN, will convene; and there were
reports out of Israel of a possible summit between Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   Inside the halls of the assembly chamber, the Palestinians will
speak to the assembly audience for the first time, thanks to a vote
this summer to enhance their observer mission's status. The vote
gave the Palestinians many of the same rights as member states to
participate in assembly matters, except for the right to vote.
	   Arafat plans to use his speech try to gain support for plans to
declare a Palestinian state in May 1999, Palestinian officials have
said.
	   Palau, on the other hand, won't be coming, the United Nations
said. The newest and smallest U.N. member state _ admitted in 1994
_ doesn't have an ambassador in New York and relies on its embassy
in Washington for representation. U.N. officials said the Pacific
island nation simply hadn't signed up to speak.
	   Several calls seeking comment from the Palau embassy were not
returned.
	   In addition, three other U.N. member states won't get to address
the assembly: Cambodia, Somalia and Yugoslavia.
	   Cambodia's seat has remained empty since strongman Hun Sen
deposed his co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a coup in July
1997. Somalia has an empty seat because the country lacks a central
government. Yugoslavia's seat was withdrawn during the Bosnian war.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban rulers are trying to wrest the U.N. seat
away from the ousted government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, seeking the
international recognition that the seat confers.
	   At a panel discussion last week at Columbia University in New
York, the Taliban's representative laid out the case for getting
the seat, citing the religious militia's capture of the bulk of
Afghanistan's territory from Rabbani's supporters.
	   ``Make no mistake,'' Noorullah Zadran said. ``Whether it suits
the world or not, one way or another, the Afghan people have made
their choice.
	   ``It's up to the world to listen to them.''

Bulgarian Roma call for more participation in government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Members of Bulgaria's 300,000 Gypsy
minority called Wednesday on the political establishment to make
more room for them in government.
	   ``Political parties can no longer win Roma (votes) with
meatballs,'' said Asen Hristov, a lawmaker of gypsy, or Roma origin
for the ruling Union of Democratic Forces. ``They (the Roma) want
participation in government.''
	   Hristov was referring to the food and other give-aways often
accompanying election campaigns in poverty-stricken Roma regions.
	   Hristov was addressing members of ``Kupate'' (Together) _ the
Roma umbrella assembly in Bulgaria.
	   Hristov is the third Roma to be elected to parliament since the
end of communist rule and the onset of democracy in Bulgaria in
1989. He is the only Roma in the current 240-seat chamber.
	   Kupate chairman Simeon Blagoev said Roma unemployment is up to
95 percent in some areas and three-quarters of Roma are poorly
educated and qualified.
	   Antoni Galabov, a government expert on Roma, said a government
program still to be implemented will strive for Roma integration
into the rest of Bulgarian society. Most Roma live in semi-ghettos
notorious for high crime and poverty.
	   The program will include improvement of health care and
education of the Roma as well their wider access to local and
central governments.
	   Parliament speaker Yordan Sokolov told Kupate members that the
state radio and TV plan to launch programs in Roma language.

 &UR; Medical journal asks better testing of herbal treatments &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Citing the hazards of poorly tested herbal
remedies, one of the nation's most distinguished medical journals
says alternative medicines should be subjected to the same rigorous
standards as mainstream treatments.
	   In an editorial, Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer of
the New England Journal of Medicine argued that testimonials and
speculation are no substitute for precise medical evidence that
treatments are safe and effective.
	   ``There cannot be two kinds of medicine _ conventional and
alternative,'' they wrote in Thursday's issue. ``There is only
medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not,
medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.''
	   Herbal remedies sold as dietary supplements have proliferated
since 1994, when Congress exempted them from regulation by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
	   The same issue of the journal carried these reports on
alternative medicine:
	   _Doctors from Alberta Children's Hospital in Canada reported two
cases in which parents opted to treat their children's cancer with
shark cartilage or the herb astragalus instead of standard
medicines. In both cases, the cancers progressed, and one child
died.
	   _The California Department of Health Services tested 260
traditional Chinese medicines and found one-third were contaminated
with heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, or pharmaceuticals not
listed on the labels.
	   _Doctors from Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey
tested a mixture of eight herbs, sold as PC-SPES, on men with
prostate cancer. They found it worked like estrogen, decreasing
testosterone and cutting sex drive. While not proving whether it
relieves cancer, the study shows the herb blend has potent hormonal
effects.
	   _The FDA described an episode, publicized last year, in which
the herb plantain was contaminated with a naturally occurring form
of digitalis, a heart stimulant that can cause cardiac arrest.
	   _A group of doctors from Arizona reported the case of a man
found driving erratically after taking a supplement promoted as a
way to increase growth hormone. A letter from the manufacturer,
RenewTrient Research of Cocoa Beach, Florida, said the man ignored
a label warning to take the substance only before sleeping.
	   ``Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific
testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional
treatments,'' the journal editorial said.
	   At the American Council on Science and Health, associate
director Jeff Strier said, ``It's good to see that mainstream
medicine is coming on board to defend itself'' against unproven
treatments.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roughly half of American women who have reached
menopause say they are happier and more fulfilled than when they
were younger, according to a Gallup survey released here Wednesday.
	   The survey, released at the start of the North American
Menopause Society's annual meeting, was conducted among 752
American women between 50 and 65 who had reached menopause.
	   Fifty-one percent said they had never felt as happy and
fulfilled as now. Ten percent said the most satisfying period was
in their 20s, 17 percent in their 30s and 16 percent in their 40s.
	   ``We often hear about the negative impacts of growing older,''
said Dr. Wulf H. Utian, executive director of the menopause
society.
	   ``Yet when we ask women, we continually hear that they view
menopause as the beginning of many positive changes in their lives
and health.''
	   About three-quarters of the women surveyed said they had made
some sort of lifestyle change when reaching menopause, including
altering diets, taking up new forms of exercise, reducing alcohol
intake and stopping smoking.
	   ``Twenty years ago, few woman ever mentioned the word menopause,
let alone discussed it at length with their doctor, friends, or
spouse,'' said Utian. ``Today, women have access to a broad range
of information on menopause and are very proactive in managing
their health as they grow older.''
	   The survey, conducted by telephone in May and June, had a margin
of error or four percentage points, according to the menopause
society.

Russian tax service presses bankruptcy against 28 firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian tax authorities said Wednesday they would
begin bankruptcy proceedings against 28 companies, both state and
privately owned, a news agency reported.
	   It was one of the first indications that bankruptcy would be
used as a tool of the new government as it copes with tax debts and
the fallout from Russia's economic crisis.
	   According to Interfax, the tax service said the companies
involved were spread across 13 regions of the country, and had
failed to either pay taxes or attempt to restructure their tax
debts.
	   It also said the companies tried to dodge their tax liabilities
by selling products through intermediaries and using barter.

Jimenez wins 11th leg of Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CERLER, Spain (AP) _ Jose Maria Jimenez won the 11th leg of the
Tour of Spain Wednesday, taking his second stage in as many days.
But Abraham Olano remained the overall leader as the race hit the
mid-way point.
	   It was the third stage-win for Jimenez of Spain, a Banesto racer
who covered the 186 kilometers (116 miles) from the Andorran border
to Cerler in 4 hours, 55 minutes and 5 seconds.
	   Second and third place went to fellow Spaniards Roberto Heras
and Fernando Escartin, both riding for Kelme-Costa Blanca. They
were credited with the same time as Jimenez.
	   The leg was decided in the last of several Pyrenees mountain
climbs, although there were breakaway attempts throughout the race.
	   Jimenez said he did not expect to win, and was just trying to
stay close to the front-runners. ``When I saw myself finish first,
I did not believe it. It's incredible,'' he said.
	   In the overall standings, second place belongs to Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank and Escartin is third.
Olano, the overall leader, is a Spaniard who races with Banesto.
	   Thursday's 12th leg covers 187 kilometers (117 miles) from
Benasque to Canfranc.

Belarusian parents protest increasing use of Russian in schools
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 200 Belarusian parents and public
activists rallied in central Minsk on Wednesday to protest the
increasing use of Russian as the primary language for educating
children.
	   Only 30 percent of Belarusian pupils go to schools where the
primary language of teaching is Belarusian, said Alexander Sidyaka,
deputy chief of the Belarusian Language Association, which
organized the rally.
	   Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko is an open
admirer of the Soviet Union and seeks to revive close ties with
Moscow. Two years ago, he made Russian an official language, along
with Belarusian.
	   Belarusian shares a common Slavic root with Russian, but is
sufficiently different that it is difficult for Russian speakers to
understand.
	   Rally participants charged that authorities harassed parents
whose children went to Belarusian-language schools and forcefully
transferred such schools to Russian-language education.
	   Six years ago, at the start of Belarus' independence from the
Soviet Union, up to 70 percent of the nation's students went to
schools where the primary language of teaching was Belarusian.

Hamas leader issues veiled threats against Israeli leaders

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Netanyahu, defense
minister, army chief of staff; reports of new security precautions &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a veiled threat against Israeli
leaders, the founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
Wednesday that those who ordered the killings of two top Hamas
fugitives ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   The fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot dead
last week when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout. The
brothers had been involved in plotting terror attacks in Israel.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to shake
suspicions Wednesday by denying Israel cooperated with Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority in the killings.
	   In response to the killing of the Awadallahs, Hamas said it
would detonate suicide bombings in Tel Aviv in retaliation. The
group which hopes to wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords,
has killed scores of Israelis in more than a dozen attacks since
1994.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the Hamas founder and
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, appeared to be raising the
level of threats against Israel by singling out those who ordered
the killings of the Awadallahs.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said.
	   Asked whether he was referring to Netanyahu, Yassin said Hamas
was not targeting the Israeli prime minister specifically.
	   Yassin noted that Netanyahu ``lives in a high tower,'' an
apparent reference to the tight security surrounding the prime
minister.
	   On Tuesday, Yassin was asked by the Spanish TV station Antena-3,
whether Netanyahu had anything to fear from Hamas. Yassin said that
``those whose hands are stained with the blood of the Palestinian
people ... must be afraid of us,'' but did not name Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said it was
``regrettable that instead of fighting terrorism, the Palestinian
leaders level threats of murder against Israeli leaders.''
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said. ``The occupiers
should expect anything from us.''
	   Israel has buried the Awadallah brothers in an unmarked grave at
a cemetery reserved for the ``enemies of Israel.''
	   The Awadallah family has demanded that the bodies be handed over
for a Muslim burial. Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, on Tuesday called the Israeli burial ``an inhumane
decision and a risky step.''
	   Tibi said any Israeli plan to use the bodies as bargaining chips
in possible exchanges with Hamas would backfire and was ``an
indirect invitation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.''
	   Israel's military chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz told
Israel's army radio that Hamas plots to kidnap soldiers had been
uncovered in the past. On Wednesday, Israel increased security at
transportation drop-off points used by soldiers and warned troops
not to hitchhike.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned Hamas that a
terrorist attack would be met with ``severe and harsh reactions,''
and accused the Palestinian Authority of not doing enough to weed
out militants.
	   ``I call upon the Palestinian Authority to do everything
necessary to meet its obligations to prevent terrorist attacks from
originating in the territory under its control,'' he said.

Lawmakers ban tobacco commercials and sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to clarify law takes effect when package passed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Parliament agreed on a draft resolution
banning tobacco from radio and television on Wednesday, including
cigarette commercials and indirect advertising such as sponsorships
of sports events.
	   The ban is part of rules restricting the advertising of alcohol
and other addictive substances on broadcast media.
	   It is part of a law on radio and television expected to be
completed and passed by parliament later this year. Passage is a
virtual certainty, considering government parties hold the majority
of seats in the legislature.
	   The law prohibits alcohol advertising that addresses
adolescents, or that claims that the product can solve personal
problems.

Panama's banana exports drop sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Panama's banana exports dropped 28
percent in the first eight months of 1998 compared to the same
period of 1997, because of European Union import restrictions and a
workers' strike, the government said Wednesday.
	   In a report, the National Bananas Administration said exports in
the first eight months totaled 317,000 tons, compared with 439,000
tons in the like period of 1997, with a net loss of dlrs 30
million.
	   Once Panama's leading dollar-earner, exports have been steadily
dropping during the past three years, ever since the 15-nation
European Union imposed restrictive quotas on bananas from Latin
America.
	   This has been true of all Latin American countries, especially
Ecuador, the world's biggest banana exporter.
	   It got worse for Panama this year because of a two-month strike
by workers for higher pay in the huge Pacific Coast plantations
belonging to the Chiriqui Land Co., a subsidiary of Chiquita Brands
of the United States.
	   Around 5,000 people work in the banana-growing industry in
Panama, and export earnings vary from dlrs 90 million to dlrs 120
million annually.

Iranian demonstrators condemn Taliban, Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of Iranians demonstrated Wednesday
against Afghanistan's Taliban militia, chanting ``Death to
Taliban!'' and ``Death to the U.S.'' amid high tension over the
Taliban's killing of nine Iranians.
	   Iranian troops headed Wednesday to the Afghanistan border for
maneuvers announced Saturday, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   The divisions, which include tanks and artillery, will join the
bulk of the 70,000 troops that took part earlier this month in
maneuvers along the same border.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the military
on full alert on Tuesday as the public and newspapers urged revenge
for the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist.
	   Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Wednesday warned the Taliban
that Iranian patience was reaching its limit.
	   Asked how the government was going to respond to the killings,
Kharrazi told Tehran radio that before Iran took military action,
it had to ``provide an opportunity for political and peaceful
solutions.''
	   ``It would be better for the Taliban not to miss this
opportunity,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Outside Tehran University, protesters condemned Pakistan and its
government, chanting ``Nawaz Sharif shame on you,'' in reference to
Pakistan's prime minister.
	   Pakistan is believed to back the Taliban while Iran is suspected
of backing the opposition that represents Afghanistan's minority
Shiite Muslims.
	   The demonstrators read out a statement that accused the United
States of interfering in Afghanistan for allegedly supporting the
Taliban.
	   ``Once again the dirty hands of the U.S. created a militant
group from the Stone Ages, which does not hesitate to kill innocent
children and women.''
	   Iran's government also has accused the United States of
supporting the Taliban, ignoring the U.S. condemnation of the
murders of the diplomats and a recent air raid on bases belonging
to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden on Taliban territory.
	   The fundamentalist Taliban militia admitted Sept. 10 to killing
the eight diplomats and a journalist for Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency after its forces captured the Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan, and Taliban leaders have said they've rushed troops to
the border region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The bodies of seven of the nine Iranians arrived in Tehran
Monday.
	   IRNA also reported that one of two missing diplomats who escaped
and returned home, Allah-Dad Shahsavan Qare-Husseini, witnessed the
``barbaric killings of the Iranians'' when the Taliban attacked
Iran's consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   It said Qare-Husseini was injured. The other diplomat, Hussein
Akbari, was not in the embassy during the raid, the agency said.

Report suggests U.S. Army stole Nazi gold hidden in Bavaria

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A German newspaper on Wednesday published
a report suggesting that U.S. Army soldiers stole Nazi gold worth
dlrs 71.4 million today that allegedly disappeared from a hiding
place in the Bavarian Alps.
	   Rumors about the fate of the missing gold have persisted for
decades, and the report did not identify any of the alleged
participants, nor could the documents conclusively trace the trail
of the missing bars of gold.
	   In its report Tuesday, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung cited a newly
discovered 1950 report by Bavarian state police chief Michael
Freiherr von Godin who said that advancing Americans found the gold
and took possession just as the war was coming to an end.
	   The gold _ which had been robbed by the Nazis from the victims _
then disappeared without a trace, the newspaper said.
	   It's existence turned up in neither U.S. Defense Department nor
U.S. Army archives, the newspaper said.
	   The Bavarian police chief said the gold had been brought to
Bavaria from the Nazi's central bank in Berlin, the Reichsbank, and
was delivered to a train station at Weilheim, about 35 kilometers
(20 miles) south of Munich.
	   The gold was taken to a ``secure hiding place,'' near a forest
ranger building at Walchensee lake on Steinriegel mountain, the
report said.
	   ``The story was revealed after (the Americans) advanced, and
some German officers were arrested until the treasure was found,''
Sueddeutsche quoted the document. ``The Americans found all of it
and took possession.''
	   The newspaper also cited a document from the historical archives
of the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt, which gives an account by
a chief cashier who helped transport the gold to Bavaria for
safekeeping.
	   The report quoted the cashier, identified by the family name
Netzeband, as saying the treasure included ``365 packets with gold
bars.''
	   Arrested by British intelligence in July 1945, Netzeband said
was taken to several suspected hiding places in the mountain, where
the British told him the Americans had already found the gold, the
report said.
	   Contacted Tuesday by The Associated Press, a former Munich
resident who worked for the U.S. Army in Bavaria at the time
recalled being told that the Americans had found Nazi gold in the
mountain.
	   When he asked an American supervisor what would happen to the
treasure, Christian Hallig said he was told it would be taken back
to the United States for safety until it could be used as part of a
basis for starting up a new German currency.
	   But Werner Englert, the mayor of Kochel a small town on the
northern tip of Walchensee lake, said the rumors about the hidden
treasure and its possible theft are all ``pure speculation.''
	   Nonetheless, people for years have come to search the mountain
and dive the lake in search of the treasure.
	   ``It is totally in the dark, there are all sorts of rumors,''
Englert told the Sueddeutsche.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces moved Wednesday
to crush a rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, spreading fighting
to a hitherto peaceful part of the province and sending thousands
of people fleeing.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province, said Serb forces were shelling
12 villages between Kosovska Mitrovica and Podujevo, towns some 30
kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Pristina.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Pristina, said agency
staffers who managed to get close to the area saw houses burning in
some of the villages and were told by locals that some 10,000
people from at least seven villages had been forced to flee.
	   The region north of Pristina is believed to be one of the two
remaining strongholds of the ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence of Kosovo from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. The central Drenica region is
the other rebel pocket.
	   Outgunned by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, the rebels have
been on the run in most of Kosovo over the past weeks, and were
pushed out of some Drenica villages on Monday and Tuesday. The
offensive north of Pristina could be the final push against the
militants.
	   The guerrillas remained defiant. In a statement distributed to
Kosovo Albanian media on Wednesday, the group condemned
U.S.-brokered attempts for an interim deal that would ease but not
end Serbian rule of the province as ``unacceptable.''
	   ``We will consider any such agreement national treason,'' said
the statement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces moved Wednesday
to crush a rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, spreading fighting

of people fleeing.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of ethnic

	   Outgunned by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, the rebels have
been on the run in most of Kosovo over the past weeks, and were
pushed out of some Drenica villages on Monday and Tuesday. The
offensive north of Pristina could be the final push against the
militants.
	   Serb police confirmed the fighting saying ``strong groups of
Albanian extremists were destroyed'' in clashes that left six
guerrillas and a police officer dead and four other officers
wounded.
	   Yugoslav soldiers blocked off all roads into the area, refusing
access to observers and reporters.
	   Fernando Del Mundo, the Pristina-based spokesman for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said his agency's staffers were
banned from the region by Serb forces. Del Mundo reported that
staffers saw houses on fire in three villages and could see smoke
billowing from two more. He said the refugees were reportedly
packed into the village of Lisica.
	   The attacks have so far created a flood of nearly 300,000
displaced persons. Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanians, but the province is part of Serbia, which stripped it of
autonomy in 1989.
	   In Brussels, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill warned NATO
representatives of a building humanitarian disaster.
	   Hill said his efforts at peace have been hampered by violence on
the ground. The American diplomat is trying to forge an interim
settlement granting Kosovo self-rule.
	   In recent weeks, American and European officials have signaled a
growing NATO readiness to take military action against Serbia even
without prior approval from the United Nations.
	   With foodstuffs and medical supplies running short, humanitarian
agencies are worried that the tens of thousands of people lacking
shelter after being forced to flee the fighting won't make it
through the harsh winter.
	   Since July, the Serbs have reduced the KLA's territory from an
estimated 40 of Kosovo to only a few patches, mostly in the
mountains.
	   The Kosovo Information Center reported Wednesday that two ethnic
Albanians who tried to go back to their homes in the region of
Malisevo, southwest of Pristina, were killed by police. The same
source said three babies had died among the refugees there.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb Media Center said that investigators found
an additional six bodies near the western Kosovo village of
Glodjane, bringing the total found in the past week to 34. Police
have accused the KLA of mass executions of Serb civilians.
	   Neither report could be independently confirmed.

Taliban has deadly Scud missiles in its arsenal against Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with protests in Iran, comment from Iranian

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
said Wednesday it was ready to negotiate a peace treaty with Iran,
but warned that its arsenal is a formidable one that includes Scud
missiles.
	   Iran is sending troops to the border with Afghanistan for a
massive military exercise on the border with Afghanistan amid high
tension between the two neighbors over the Taliban's killing of
nine Iranians.
	   Hakim Mujahed, the Taliban's delegate to the United Nations,
said Iran should know that the Taliban has an impressive arsenal.
	   Its Russian-made Scud missiles are the same type that Iraq used
to target Israeli cities during the Gulf War. The missiles, with a
range of about 160 kilometers to 280 kilometers (100 miles to 175
miles), are designed to hit large targets where they can do the
greatest amount of damage.
	   ``We have deployed our soldiers with all kinds of weapons,''
Mujahed said, including the Scud missiles, some of which he said
the Taliban inherited when they pushed their opponents from the
northern stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   It was during the seizure of Mazar that 10 Iranian diplomats and
an Iranian journalist disappeared.
	   The Taliban admitted Thursday to killing eight diplomats and the
journalist, but blamed the deaths on renegade soldiers. Iran vowed
revenge, and on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, put the military on full alert.
	   Nine Iranian divisions headed to the Afghanistan border
Wednesday for maneuvers later this month, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported. The divisions, which include tanks
and artillery, will join the bulk of the 70,000 troops that took
part in maneuvers in the same area earlier this month.
	   In Tehran on Wednesday, hundreds of men and women demonstrated
against the Taliban, chanting ``death to Taliban'' and ``death to
the U.S.''
	   Iran's government has blamed the United States for supporting
the Taliban _ despite the U.S. condemnation of the killings of the
diplomats and a recent U.S. missile strikes on bases in Afghanistan
suspected of belonging to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
	   The standoff between Iran and Afghanistan has raised fears in
the region of a war.
	   Pakistan has urged restraint and offered to mediate, an offer
Iran is unlikely to accept given that Pakistan is believed to be
heavily backing the Taliban in the form of military training and
equipment.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz will travel to Tehran on
Thursday to soothe tempers.
	   ``We hope that Iran will not attack Afghanistan and that they
can settle the dispute through peaceful means,'' Aziz told
Pakistan's Senate or Upper House of Parliament on Wednesday.
	   ``Pakistan is deeply concerned about the crisis,'' he said,
denying his nation's involvement in assisting the Taliban. Last
week Iran accused Pakistan of supplying the Taliban with weapons as
well as military advisors.
	   Mujahed, meanwhile, said the Taliban is looking to the United
Nations to mediate.
	   ``It is up the to the U.N. to come up with a plan for
mediation,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad. ``We are ready to meet Iran
anywhere.''
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told Tehran radio
Wednesday that before Iran took military action, it had to
``provide an opportunity for political and peaceful solutions.''
	   ``It would be better for the Taliban not to miss this
opportunity,'' Kharrazi said.
	   Mujahed dismissed Iranian claims of mass killings in
Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province, where Iranian-backed Shiite
Muslims belonging to the opposition Hezb-e-Wahadat party have been
virtually routed.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says it has received
reports that the Taliban carried out widespread killing in northern
Mazar-e-Sharif, of Shiites in particular.
	   UNHCR says witnesses from there have arrived in Islamabad with
horrific stories of mass killings. Both sides in the bitter
conflict have been accused of atrocities.
	   Last year Shiite Muslims were said to have massacred 2,000
Taliban soldiers they had captured.

talking about a peaceful solution,'' he said.

Communist ally threatens to vote against Italian coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi's troublesome Communist ally on
Wednesday threatened to withhold support for the center-left
coalition on a key issue -- approval of next year's national
budget.
	   After a meeting of coalition leaders, Fausto Bertinotti, who
heads the Communist Refoundation party, said he was unconvinced
that the government's planned 1999 budget did enough to generate
job creation in the underdeveloped south.
	   Prodi must submit the budget to Parliament by Sept. 30. He has a
majority in the Senate without the Communists but has depended on
their votes in the lower Chamber of Deputies for a majority there.
	   ``We remain in significant disagreement with the general
economic framework,'' Bertinotti told reporters after the meeting.
	   Unemployment runs at about 12.5 percent nationally in Italy and
nearly double that in the south.

 &UR; Iraqi leadership calls on U.N. to restore reviews of sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq called Wednesday for the U.N. Security
Council to reverse its decision to suspend reviews of sanctions.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said it had decided to ask the Security Council to
rescind the resolution it passed on Sept. 9.
	   The resolution condemned Iraq's decision to stop cooperating
with U.N. arms inspectors as ``a totally unacceptable
contravention'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It suspended
the 60-day reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Revolutionary Command Council said it would implement the
Iraqi parliament's recommendation to freeze the remaining U.N.
monitoring of weapons sites ``at a suitable time.''

Hamas leader issues veiled threats against Israeli leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Netanyahu, defense
minister, army chief of staff; reports of new security precautions &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a veiled threat against Israeli
leaders, the founder of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
Wednesday that those who ordered the killings of two top Hamas
fugitives ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   The fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot dead
last week when Israeli troops raided their West Bank hideout. The
brothers had been involved in plotting terror attacks in Israel.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to shake
suspicions Wednesday by denying Israel cooperated with Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority in the killings.
	   In response to the killing of the Awadallahs, Hamas said it
would detonate suicide bombings in Tel Aviv in retaliation. The
group, which hopes to wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords,
has killed scores of Israelis in more than a dozen attacks since
1994.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the Hamas founder and
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, appeared to be raising the
level of threats against Israel by singling out those who ordered
the killings of the Awadallahs.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said.
	   Asked whether he was referring to Netanyahu, Yassin said Hamas
was not targeting the Israeli prime minister specifically.
	   Yassin noted that Netanyahu ``lives in a high tower,'' an
apparent reference to the tight security surrounding the prime
minister.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said it was
``regrettable that instead of fighting terrorism, the Palestinian
leaders level threats of murder against Israeli leaders.''
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said.

Bosnian Serb hardliners criticize OSCE, warn against more delay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring victory in weekend
elections, Bosnian Serb ultra-nationalists Wednesday warned
international officials against withholding results of the
balloting and ``toying with the will of the people.''
	   In a statement carried by Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, two
extremist parties accused the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe of deliberately delaying the publishing of
preliminary results because of the hardliners' strong showing.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' said the joint
statement by the Bosnian Serb Radical Party and Serb Democratic
Party.
	   The accusations of a setup followed an OSCE failure Tuesday to
announce preliminary results of the weekend nationwide vote as had
been previously scheduled. International officials cited
complicated election procedure as the reason for delay.
	   But the move only fueled speculation that hardliners opposed to
the goals of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement had defeated those
favored by the Americans and Europeans. The delay in releasing the
results also raised tensions among the Bosnian Serb rival camps
which both said they had won the vote.
	   Nikola Poplasen, who ran for the presidency of the Serb-run
entity against the Western-backed current president Biljana
Plavsic, warned of street-protests in the results are not published
soon.
	   Poplasen's Radical party claimed victory Tuesday for the
nationalist coalition and indicated it would not recognize a
different outcome.
	   A triumph of Poplasen and other extremist candidates at the
election would present a serious setback for Western efforts in
Bosnia. U.S. and other officials have hoped that moderate Muslims,
Serbs and Croats would prevail and further enforce a peace deal for
the country.
	   Poplasen and Momcilo Krajisnik, a candidate for the joint
Bosnian presidency, are supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic and his policies of ethnic hatred and division. They are
against the Dayton peace accord which envisaged a unified Bosnia.
	   According to sources in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, another
Western favorite Kresimir Zubak was also faring poorly. Zubak has
recently split from the Bosnian Croat hard-liners and formed a new,
more moderate party.
	   Some analysts in the Serb-run half of Bosnia have predicted a
strong showing for the nationalists at the election, despite
international efforts to boost the image of President Plavsic and
her coalition by supplying millions of dollars of economic aid.
	   Plavsic had also been a Karadzic supporter but turned against
the wartime Serb leader last year and pledged to support the Dayton
deal.
	   Analysts believe that nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs
has been rekindled because of the clashes in the Serbian province
of Kosovo against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians. Rising Western
pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo also played
against pro-Western Plavsic, they said.
	   Robert Barry, head of the office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, has dismissed suggestions that
OSCE was holding up announcing figures in order to manipulate the
outcome.
	   He said no figures will be made public until the counting is
completed and results checked _ which may take several more days.
	   Further complicating the situation was the possibility that the
OSCE disqualifies nationalist candidates from the race because of
some violations of election rules prior to the vote.
	   ``Any future toying with the election will of the people will be
strongly condemned'' Poplasen and his coalition partners warned.

occurs.

before the Security Council will lift sanctions, which were imposed
in 1990.

	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ A 20-year-old soldier critically
injured along with 21 other German troops when a grenade exploded
during classroom training at a military school died Wednesday, the
Nuremberg prosecutor's office said.
	   State prosecutor Ewald Behrschmidt, who is investigating the
Sept. 7 explosion at Amberg, 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of
Nuremberg, said the case has now been broadened to possible charges
of negligent homocide.
	   He said the investigation is concentrated on the 33-year-old
sergeant instructing the troops, and an ammunition supply clerk who
issued the live grenade, which officials said was against the rules
for classroom training.

Appointment of new coach illegitimate, sports official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A government official in charge of sports
said Wednesday the appointment of a new national soccer team coach
was illegitimate.
	   He was reacting to the appointment Monday of Dimitar Dimitrov by
the Soccer Union, the top soccer body in the country. Dimitrov,
coach of Bulgaria's champion Liteks, replaced Hristo Bonev, who
resigned as national team coach after a disappointing first-round
elimination at the World Championships.
	   On Tuesday the government Committee of Youth, Physical Training
and Sports banned the Union from running soccer affairs, accusing
it of failing to react to a positive doping test of a local player.
	   The committee, which is empowered to license sports
organizations and teams, said it was revoking the license of the
Bulgarian Soccer Union and gave it to the Professional Soccer
League, a part of the Union including only professional teams.
	   ``The fact that the Soccer Union has appointed Dimitrov coach
means nothing,'' committee chairman Tsviatko Barchovski said.
	   Liteks on Tuesday dismissed Dimitrov as coach.
	   The Committee said the Union broke international and Bulgarian
regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included in the
national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs in April. Gruev plays for Neftochimik
in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The Union is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because
of Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance.

Izvestia names new editor, merges with Russky Telegraf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis apparently claimed its
first victim in the news industry Wednesday when the respected
daily newspaper Russky Telegraf agreed to merge with the older,
more prosperous Izvestia.
	   Izvestia, the former Soviet government newspaper that is now
partly owned by the giant oil company Lukoil, also announced the
appointment of a new editor-in-chief, Interfax reported.
	   The new editor, Mikhail Kozhokin, had previously been chairman
of the newspaper's board of directors. He told Interfax that
Izvestia will begin publishing two daily editions, one for national
distribution and a later edition for Moscow.
	   ``This is possible because the best journalists from the Russky
Telegraf newspaper are joining our staff,'' Kozhokin said.
	   Russky Telegraf was started last September, and had positioned
itself as a serious, Western-style, independent newspaper, although
it was owned by the politically influential Uneximbank.
	   One staff member said Wednesday night that the mood in the
newsroom was gloomy, with many of the 120 journalists assuming they
would be losing their jobs. The staffer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the newspaper had been losing money and that
Uneximbank had decided it could no longer support it.
	   Kozhokin said it had not been determined when Russky Telegraf
would cease publication.
	   Kozhokin succeeds Vasily Zakharkov, who will continue to work in
an unspecified capacity at Izvestia. Kozhokin's position as board
chairman was filled by Alexander Vasilenko, Lukoil's public
relations chief, Interfax said.
	   Izvestia, founded in 1917, had a circulation of 10 million in
the late 1980s. Circulation plunged after the Soviet collapse, and
was estimated at less than 600,000 last year, when the former
editor-in-chief quit in protest over Lukoil's influence on the
paper.
	   He founded a colorful competitor, New Izvestia, which continues
to publish.

Russian prosecutors request lifting immunity of Dagestani lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prosecutors have asked parliament to lift the
immunity of lawmaker and Muslim leader Nadir Khachilayev, accused
of storming a government building in Russia's republic of Dagestan
last spring, an official said Wednesday.
	   Under the Russian law, a parliament deputy cannot be arrested or
tried in court unless parliament votes to lift the lawmaker's
immunity from prosecution.
	   Khachilayev is a member of the Dagestani parliament and leader
of Russia's Muslim Union, a leading organization of Russian
Muslims. He is suspected of organizing the May 21 raid together
with his brother, Magomed Khachilayev.
	   Dagestani Prosecutor General Imam Yaraliyev said the Russian
parliament had been told of the accusation that Khachilayev had led
public unrest, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Magomed Khachilayev, who leads an organization representing an
ethnic minority in Dagestan, the Laks, was arrested in Dagestan's
capital, Makhachkala, last week, but Nadir Khachilayev managed to
escape.
	   Supporters of the Khachilayev brothers held several policemen
and officials hostage at the government building in Makhachkala.
They left peacefully after receiving promises of a shakeup in the
local government.

Rolling Stones back in Greece after abrupt exit 31 years ago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSITTING to CORRECT garble, dropped copy. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It took a generation for Rolling Stones
fans in Greece to get some satisfaction: an encore performance from
the British rockers after they were hustled off the stage by
military rulers.
	   More than 60,000 fans, including some top members of the
government, welcomed back the Stones on Wednesday on the final leg
of their ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour.
	   It was quite a different reception during the Stones' last
performance in Greece in 1967, just months after a coup that began
a seven-year military dictatorship in Greece. The Stones' lead
singer, Mick Jagger, was dragged off the stage by police when he
tried to toss red carnations to the audience.
	   The ultra-right military junta interpreted the color of the
flowers as a pro-communist gesture.
	   On Wednesday, however, it was the tax police that took charge.
Concert organizers were suspected of selling up to 8,000 tickets
worth 12,000 drachmas (dlrs 41) each without the official
government tax stamp, meaning the income could possibly be hidden
from authorities, media reported.

League, a part of the Union made up of only professional teams.
	   ``The fact that the Soccer Union has appointed Dimitrov coach
means nothing,'' committee chairman Tsviatko Barchovski said.
	   Liteks on Tuesday dismissed Dimitrov as coach.
	   The Committee said the Union broke international and Bulgarian
regulations by allowing player Ilya Gruev to be included in the
national team although he had tested positive for
performance-enhancing drugs in April. Gruev plays for Neftochimik
in the Black Sea city of Burgas.
	   The Union is headed by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of late
communist ruler Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov has been criticized because
of Bulgaria's poor World Cup performance.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq: in 1990.
	   The command council said that sanctions were being maintained
because of ``pressure and extortion that the United States was
exerting on the Security Council.''
	   The Security Council resolution agreed to a recommendation from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive review of
Iraq's progress on disarmament, but said such a review could take
place only once Iraq had restored cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   In its response Wednesday night, the Iraqi leadership said such
a review would not be acceptable unless the council rescind its
decision, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The command council also said it hoped that Annan would be
``more effective regarding his promises.''

Nurse convicted in Saudi murder is writing her jail memoirs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Scottish nurse convicted in Saudi Arabia of
murdering an Australian colleague is writing a book about her time
in prison, the publisher said Wednesday.
	   Lucille McLauchlan's book, ``One Nurse's Hell,'' is expected to
go on sale in November, said a spokeswoman for Mainstream, the
Scotland-based publisher, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   She refused to disclose how much McLauchlan was paid for the
book, which includes diaries and commentary.
	   McLauchlan, 32, with British nurse Deborah Parry, was convicted
in Saudi Arabia in the December 1996 murder of Yvonne Gilford, who
was stabbed, suffocated and beaten in her room at a Saudi hospital
where all three women worked.
	   Saudi King Fahd granted the two nurses clemency and they were
freed in May.
	   McLauchlan and Parry said their confessions to the murder were
extracted by brutal treatment from Saudi authorities, and they
later recanted.
	   British tabloids paid the nurses for their stories after they
returned home from Saudi Arabia.

Gun shots fired during former prime minister's visit to university

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen fired in the air
Wednesday during former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's visit to the
country's largest university campus to meet students making saline
for flood victims, police said.
	   The firing occurred as the car in which Zia was traveling
entered the Dhaka University campus.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the firing.
	   Zia's party blamed the incident on the supporters of her rival,
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a charge they denied.
	   In the past, supporters of both politicians have frequently
attacked each other with knives, machetes and crude guns.
Universities across Bangladesh are often the training ground for
future politicians. All political parties have their student wings,
which they often use to settle personal scores.
	   Ignoring the gunfire, Zia met with dozens of student activists
of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party who were making oral
rehydration liquid for victims of diarrhea in the recent floods.
	   Government health officials said more than 200,000 people
displaced by the country's worst flooding in decades are down with
diarrhea and other waterborne diseases because of poor hygiene and
lack of clean drinking water.
	   The floods that battered the delta nation for more than two
months have claimed more than 900 lives and displaced 35 million
people _ nearly one-third the population.

Kalemie firmly in rebel hands despite Congolese government claims

	   KALEMIE, Congo (AP) _ Rebel commanders escorted journalists
through Kalemie on Wednesday to dispute Congolese government claims
it had recaptured the port city. Nearby fighting was reported, but
Kalemie appeared to be under rebel control.
	   ``How many times are they going to take Kalemie?'' said regional
rebel commander Jean-Claude Moluka. ``How many Kalemies are
there?''
	   On Wednesday, rebels flew several journalists to the
southeastern town they captured Aug. 26, saying they wanted to
disprove government claims over the past week that its troops had
regained control the city, located on Lake Tanganyika.
	   ``On the contrary, we have information Kabila's troops are
fleeing,'' said Moluka.
	   Kalemie is one of several eastern Congolese towns the rebels
captured since the war's start on Aug. 2. Their movement westward
had reached to the capital Kinshasa but was pushed back when
President Laurent Kabila recruited assistance from Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia.
	   Dozens of rebel soldiers and commanders roamed the streets,
pulling up in some of the few vehicles on the town's quiet roads.
	   Residents said the town had been calm since a bombardment by
aircraft loyal to Kabila on Aug. 7, complaining more about the high
prices of scarce goods and supplies because of the war.
	   Moluka said the air strike killed 25 civilians and wounded 40,
but no rebel troops were killed.
	   He said the previous week, troops loyal to Kabila surrounded the
town and attacked trying to recapture control, but they were
repelled.
	   Moluka said the battle lasted only one day and the rebels took
prisoners, among them Congolese troops and Burundian Hutu rebels
from the Forces for Defense and Democracy.
	   He said Kabila has made a pact with the FDD that if they helped
him capture Kalemie, he would help them in their fight to conquer
the Burundian capital Bujumbura.
	   Rebel officials say Kabila has struck a similar deal with
Rwandan Hutu rebels who attacked the rebel stronghold Goma on
Monday.
	   ``Kabila tried to use all means at his disposal to reduce us but
he didn't succeed,'' Moluka said.
	   He said soldiers had covered a five-kilometer (three-mile) area
around Kalemie and had seen no sign of government troops.
	   Moluka said the rebel goal was to take the southeastern city of
Lubumbashi, Congo's third-largest city and the capital of the
copper-rich Shaba region just north of the Zambia border.
	   The war has become increasingly regional with Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and reportedly Sudan allied with Kabila and Rwanda and
Uganda siding with the rebels. Rwanda and Uganda deny Kabila's
claims they spearheaded the rebellion.
	   On Wednesday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said he would
maintain troops inside eastern Congo to fight Ugandan rebels based
there until a regional peace agreement was put in place.
	   Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency reported that at least 100
Congolese soldiers and 250 civilians fled from the region between
Kalemie and Uvira, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) further north,
across Lake Tangyanika to Tanzania in the past 10 days.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq: his promises.
	   The statement did not refer to such a promise, but in an article
in a government-controlled newspaper Tuesday, the presidential
adviser Hamed Youssef Hummadi accused Annan of failing to honor a
commitment to ``strive for an end to the sanctions.''
	   Hummadi wrote in Al-Qadissiya newspaper that Annan had made the
promise in the negotiations for the agreement of February 23, when
Iraq acceded to the U.N. demand for inspectors to have
	   access to presidential compounds.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with the inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons. The inspections cannot take place
unless Iraqi escorts accompany inspectors.
	   Early this year Saddam promised Iraqis that sanctions would be
lifted by early next year. The Security Council resolution left
Baghdad with no mechanism to have the embargo terminated.

Basque homeland debate enlivened by regional elections

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's election time in Spain's troubled
Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of attempts to end three
decades of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by
ETA rebels fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
	   Basque nationalists this week urged ETA, one of Europe's few
remaining armed political groups, to renounce bloodshed so that a
political solution can be found.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political
groups, including radical ETA-linked political party Herri
Batasuna, took a joint position on the issue. Their so-called
Lizarra Declaration calls for peace talks and a permanent end to
the violence.
	   But when asked Wednesday about the possibility of an ETA
cease-fire, Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said, ``It
would be a trick truce.''
	   ETA, the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France. The
group has killed 800 people since it took up arms 30 years ago, and
was extremely active during the Socialist administration of
ex-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the early 1980s, killing
dozens of police officers every year.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged
the rebels to stop the killing.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not
negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces
violence.
	   The Lizarra Declaration came out of a forum promoted by Herri
Batasuna and held in the Basque city of Lizarra. It was signed by
representatives of 23 political parties, labor unions and
grassroots groups. but the forum was boycotted by Spain's two most
powerful political parties, the ruling Popular Party and the
opposition Socialists.
	   ETA declared a truce for one week in 1996. It ended with a
series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the government
refused to negotiate unless ETA renounced violence.

First approval in Italy for higher obligatory school age
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The lower chamber of Italy's Parliament on Wednesday
approved raising the number of years Italian children must attend
school from eight to 10.
	   If the measure is also passed by the Senate, starting in the
next scholastic year, children will be required in effect to attend
school from the ages of five to 15.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's government aims to gradually raise the
age to 18 to get Italy more in line with most other Western
European countries. Under the plan, for example, in two years
students will be required to stay in school until they turn 16 if
the measure receives final approval.

Iraqi leadership calls on U.N. to restore reviews of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES Urgent series; ADDS BYLINE; MINOR EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq called Wednesday for the U.N. Security
Council to reverse its decision to suspend reviews of sanctions.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said it had decided to ask the Security Council to
rescind the resolution it passed on Sept. 9.
	   The resolution condemned Iraq's decision to stop cooperating
with U.N. arms inspectors as ``a totally unacceptable
contravention'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It suspended
the 60-day reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Saddam had promised Iraqis that sanctions would be lifted by
early next year. The Security Council's move left Baghdad with no
mechanism to have the embargo terminated.
	   The Revolutionary Command Council said it would implement the
Iraqi parliament's recommendation to freeze the remaining U.N.
monitoring of weapons sites ``at a suitable time,'' the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   ``The duration of this time will be short if the United States
and Britain persist with their hostility,'' the Revolutionary
Command Council warned.
	   Since the freeze on surprise inspections, U.N. arms experts have
continued to monitor Iraqi weapons sites where they have installed
cameras and sensors to make sure that no prohibited activity
occurs.
	   Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament called Monday for the government
to put a stop to the U.N. monitoring, which would effectively close
down the whole disarmament operation.
	   The command council said the parliament's recommendation was
``an expression of the angry feelings of the Iraqi people''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions.
	   The command council said that sanctions were being maintained
because of ``pressure and extortion that the United States was
exerting on the Security Council.''
	   The Security Council resolution agreed to a recommendation from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive review of
Iraq's progress on disarmament, but said such a review could take
place only once Iraq had restored cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   In its response Wednesday night, the Iraqi leadership said a
review would not be acceptable unless the council rescinded its
decision.
	   The command council also said it hoped that Annan would be
``more effective regarding his promises.''
	   The statement did not refer to a promise, but in an article in a
government-controlled newspaper Tuesday, the presidential adviser
Hamed Youssef Hummadi accused Annan of failing to honor a
commitment to ``strive for an end to the sanctions.''
	   Hummadi wrote in Al-Qadissiya that Annan had made the promise in
the negotiations for the agreement of February 23, when Iraq
acceded to the U.N. demand for inspectors to have access to
presidential compounds.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with the inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

Lesotho protesters block Parliament over vote fraud charge

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in top 4 grafs that election report to be delivered on
Thursday; EDITS thereafter to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A long-awaited international
investigation into allegations of election fraud will be presented
to troubled Lesotho on Thursday, a South African government
official announced.
	   The three-nation Langa Commission report will be given to
Lesotho's government, the three main opposition parties and King
Letsie III, said Frank Chikane, top aide to South African President
Thabo Mbeki, in Johannesburg on Wednesday.
	   Representatives from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and
Mozambique are to visit Lesotho on Thursday to discuss the report
and to ``chart the way forward,'' Chikane said.
	   ``The report on its own cannot resolve all problems of
Lesotho,'' Chikane said. ``The people and leadership of Lesotho
should exercise their political wisdom to help the country move
beyond the current impasse.''
	   The government of this tiny, mountain kingdom on Wednesday
appeared increasingly helpless in the face of unrest over charges
of fraud in the May elections, reports said.
	   Youths blocked the entrances to Parliament, preventing Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, cabinet ministers and government
officials from gaining entry to their offices, South African Press
Association said.
	   Many civil servants also stayed away from work, Sapa said.
	   Opposition party demonstrators took to the streets for a second
day, demanding the release of the report into the alleged fraud.
	   Lesotho, a country of 2 million people located within the
borders of South Africa, has a history of political upheaval and
coups.
	   Opposition supporters have been protesting for weeks about
election results.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe were called on to mediate
the election dispute, and prepared the report.
	   Also Tuesday, soldiers came to the aid of young opposition party
supporters who took to the streets and seized government vehicles,
police said.
	   In an apparently unrelated matter, the defense chief was forced
to step down last week by mutinous officers, and his successor, Lt.
Gen. Anthony Thibedi, appeared to have lost control of the army,
officials said Tuesday.

Kalemie firmly in rebel hands despite Congolese government claims
</HEADLINE>

	   KALEMIE, Congo (AP) _ Rebel commanders escorted journalists
through Kalemie on Wednesday to dispute Congolese government claims
it had recaptured the port city. Nearby fighting was reported, but
Kalemie appeared to be under rebel control.
	   ``How many times are they going to take Kalemie?'' said regional
rebel commander Jean-Claude Moluka. ``How many Kalemies are
there?''
	   On Wednesday, rebels flew several journalists to the
southeastern town they captured Aug. 26, saying they wanted to
disprove government claims over the past week that its troops had
regained control the city, located on Lake Tanganyika.
	   ``On the contrary, we have information Kabila's troops are
fleeing,'' said Moluka.
	   Kalemie is one of several eastern Congolese towns the rebels
captured since the war's start on Aug. 2. Their movement westward
had reached to the capital Kinshasa but was pushed back when
President Laurent Kabila recruited assistance from Angola, Zimbabwe
and Namibia.
	   Dozens of rebel soldiers and commanders roamed the streets,
pulling up in some of the few vehicles on the town's quiet roads.
	   Residents said the town had been calm since a bombardment by
aircraft loyal to Kabila on Aug. 7, complaining more about the high
prices of scarce goods and supplies because of the war.
	   Moluka said the air strike killed 25 civilians and wounded 40,
but no rebel troops were killed.
	   He said the previous week, troops loyal to Kabila surrounded the
town and attacked trying to recapture control, but they were
repelled.
	   Moluka said the battle lasted only one day and the rebels took
prisoners, among them Congolese troops and Burundian Hutu rebels
from the Forces for Defense and Democracy.
	   He said Kabila has made a pact with the FDD that if they helped
him capture Kalemie, he would help them in their fight to conquer
the Burundian capital Bujumbura.
	   Rebel officials say Kabila has struck a similar deal with
Rwandan Hutu rebels who attacked the rebel stronghold Goma on
Monday.
	   ``Kabila tried to use all means at his disposal to reduce us but
he didn't succeed,'' Moluka said.
	   He said soldiers had covered a five-kilometer (three-mile) area
around Kalemie and had seen no sign of government troops.
	   Moluka said the rebel goal was to take the southeastern city of
Lubumbashi, Congo's second-largest city and the capital of the
copper-rich Shaba region just north of the Zambia border.

Soap operas in English just don't wash during dubbers' strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS graf with dubbing companies saying now willing to discuss
issue that could lead to resumed negotiations &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ridge speaking English just didn't wash for
soap-opera fans here used to hearing ``The Bold and the Beautiful''
hero only in Italian.
	   Upset about the consequences of a two-month-old dubbers' strike,
viewers on Wednesday inundated a TV network with protests.
	   Within three hours of the lunch-hour broadcast of the serial,
which goes by the name of ``Beautiful'' in Italy, hundreds of
viewers had called Canale 5 to demand their stars' voices only in
Italian, said Yuri Priori, a switchboard operator at Mediaset, the
media network of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
	   The callers, most of them women, also protested Tuesday's
broadcast of ``Guiding Light'' (here called ``Sentieri''), on
another Mediaset network. While ``Beautiful'' had an Italian
voiceover but with the original English still audible in the
background, ``Guiding Light'' had subtitles while the soap actors
spoke in English.
	   ``I won't watch it any more'' if ``Beautiful'' is shown again in
English during the strike, said Eleonora Sala, a 19-year-old
student. The voiceover, she said, was confusing, and she ventured
that elderly viewers might have a hard time following the program.
	   Italians like their films and TV shows in Italian, no matter
what the original language is, and the dubbers's strike, for more
money and royalties, has already put off the release of big
Hollywood films, such as ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in cinemas
reopening after the traditional summer shutdown.
	   Italian television is also heavy on American TV feature shows,
whose episodes are usually a year behind those being currently
shown in the United States. But since the new TV season doesn't
open until October here, the impact of the strike hasn't hit fans
of such popular fare such as ``Law and Order'' and ``ER.''
	   A spokeswoman from Mediaset, Silvia Catanzaro, said the
subtitled ``Guiding Light'' attracted more than 1.24 million
viewers, for an audience share of 14.9 percent. Normal share is
14.3 percent, she said, and it was too soon to know Wednesday's
share for the serial.
	   Asked whether the soap operas might be yanked until the strike
is over, Catanzaro said it was too soon to make any decision.
``We'll see how it goes,'' she said.
	   On Wednesday evening, a spokeswoman for dubbing companies said
they were willing to discuss one of the issues under contention --
dubbers' demands to have a collective contract. The representative,
Elisabetta Bucciarelli, told The Associated Press that the
development could lead to the resumption of negotiations between
both sides.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces moved Wednesday
to crush a rebel stronghold in northern Kosovo, spreading fighting
to a hitherto peaceful part of the province and sending thousands
of people fleeing.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province, said Serb forces were shelling
12 villages between Kosovska Mitrovica and Podujevo, towns some 30
kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Pristina.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Pristina, said agency
staffers who managed to get close to the area saw houses burning in
some of the villages and were told by locals that some 10,000
people from at least seven villages had been forced to flee.
	   The region north of Pristina is believed to be one of the two
remaining strongholds of the ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence of Kosovo from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic. The central Drenica region is
the other rebel pocket.
	   Outgunned by Serb police and the Yugoslav army, the rebels have
been on the run in most of Kosovo over the past weeks, and were
pushed out of some Drenica villages on Monday and Tuesday. The
offensive north of Pristina could be the final push against the
militants.
	   The guerrillas remained defiant. In a statement distributed to
Kosovo Albanian media on Wednesday, the group condemned
U.S.-brokered attempts for an interim deal that would ease but not
end Serbian rule of the province as ``unacceptable.''
	   ``We will consider any such agreement national treason,'' said
the statement.

U.N. economic conference focuses on interdependence

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Facing severe recessions and worsening
financial turmoil, world leaders and economic and social experts
will discuss the pros and cons of global interdependence at a
conference beginning Thursday.
	   The two-day conference focuses on globalization _ the relations
that exist when one country's domestic policies affect other
nations.
	   ``The purpose of this meeting is merely to have a dialogue. It's
not meant to produce a communique or agreed conclusions or any such
product,'' Nitin Desai, the U.N. undersecretary-general for social
and economic affairs, said Wednesday.
	   Among those participating will be ministers from rich countries
like Germany, Japan and Austria, and developing ones like India,
Cuba, Ghana and Mexico.
	   The dialogue is increasingly necessary, Desai said, because one
of the lessons of the Asian financial crisis is that greater
openness of individual economies to foreign investment and loans
can create vulnerabilities, not just benefits.
	   ``Countries that have taken greatest advantage of global capital
flows in recent years find themselves under the daily scrutiny of
financial markets,'' Desai said in his overview of a world economic
and social survey for 1998.
	   Investors skittish about holding currencies they deem to be
overvalued have sold their holdings in countries as diverse as
Thailand, South Africa and Brazil. The cascading effect of the
abrupt withdrawal of money needed to fund economic growth has
caused stock markets to gyrate wildly across Asia, Europe and the
Americas.
	   Many analysts fear the year-old Asian financial crisis _ and the
recessions it has caused in regional powerhouses like Japan and
Hong Kong _ could spread to Western Europe and North America.
	   A 229-page study by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
to be released Thursday argues that the Asian financial crisis is
worse than first thought and will cause overall world output to
drop by at least 1 percent.
	   Desai said ideas for this conference began even before the Asian
economic crisis.
	   The conference will also feature two panels of experts to
discuss ways to sustain economic growth and end poverty.

Dane, American arrested for using poor kids for pornography

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Police have arrested
two foreign men accused of using street children to make
pornographic videos, revealing a growing child sex tourism industry
in the Dominican Republic.
	   One of the children was just 3 years old and the oldest, aged
17, had lived with the accused men since he was 7, said Yusmari
Rodriguez, the chief prosecutor in the Department of the Family and
Minors.
	   Finn L. Jensen, 66, of Denmark, and Hubert Backhause, 82, of the
United States, were arrested Monday following complaints from
neighbors in the historic old town of Santo Domingo, she said.
	   Authorities also were investigating the parents of the children,
who may have been paid by the accused, Rodriguez said.
	   She said that the men had told investigators that the videos _
of naked children dancing erotically _ were for their personal use,
but that prosecutors believe they were being made for sale abroad.
	   Police seized video cameras and 72 video films, she said.
	   Prosecutors have 48 hours from the time of arrest to formally
charge the men.
	   For years, various agencies have warned that Dominican Republic
was turning into a juvenile sex tourist destination. They have said
that some Europeans visit the Caribbean island only because its
prostitutes are cheap and poor children are available.
	   A Roman Catholic priest who works with street children, the Rev.
Luis Rosario, said he hoped the case would draw authorities
attention to increasing ``sex tourism.''
	   ``This is not a unique case. There are hundreds of brothels that
use minors, and the worst of it is that in many cases this is done
with the knowledge of their parents,'' Rosario told The Associated
Press.
	   Public prosecutor Dominguez Brito said child prostitutes saved
by authorities in the past soon have found their way back to the
streets.
	   The arrests come a week after the Supreme Court urged
authorities to activate special courts for minors, which were
created some years ago but have had no judges appointed.

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia advanced to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 500,000 ATP Tour
President's Cup on Wednesday with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over South
African David Nainkin.
	   It took Kafelnikov about 50 minutes to outplay Nainkin in two
sets.
	   ``The first two opponents I played at this tournament did not
conform to my level, therefore I won,'' Kafelnikov said at a news
conference after the match.
	   Speaking of the upcoming Open Championship in Hannover,
Kafelnikov said: ``Hannover is not the highlight of the season for
me. I still have seven or eight tournaments left and I would like
to improve my skills, as the last two seasons were not the best for
me.'
	   In the quarterfinals Kafelnikov will play Gaston Etlis of
Argentine, who defeated Vadim Volchkov of Belarus, 7-5, 6-2, in the
second round today.
	   Another Russian, Marat Safin, seeded sixth, upset Rogier Wassen
of Neverlands, 6-3, 6-2. Safin will face France's Cedric Pioline,
third seed of the tournament.
	   ``I've lost to Pioline at Roland Garosse this season. He has an
excellent serve and it will be the hardest match for me,'' Safin
said at a news conference.
	   Pioline, ranked 17th by the ATP, had a tough time overcoming
Laurence Tieleman of Italy, ranked 118th by the ATP, 4-6, 7-6
(8-6), 6-3. Pioline did not show up at a news conference.
	   The third day of the tournament drew in about 4,200 spectators.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Threatened with arrest, Albania's former
president urged followers Wednesday to break through blockades if
police try to stop them from joining new anti-government protests.
	   About 1,500 supporters cheered Sali Berisha at his Democratic
Party headquarters, where his bodyguards brandished semiautomatic
rifles in defiance of a government order to hand over weapons by
dawn Wednesday.
	   The latest unrest began with the weekend assassination of
popular politician Azem Hajdari, which touched off two days of
rioting in this impoverished Balkan nation.
	   The violence has raised fears of a repeat of last year's months
of anarchy following the collapse of pyramid schemes that cost many
people their life's savings. Berisha was president during the
crisis and lost elections in its aftermath.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping outrage
over Hajdari's killing, which many blame on the government. There
is also widespread disappointment with the government's inability
to revive the economy.
	   U.S. and European diplomats fear the unrest could spread,
further complicating the situation in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence. The European Union sent a representative to Tirana on
Wednesday to try to avert further violence.
	   Parliament has ordered a criminal investigation of Berisha and
his top aides, accusing them of trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting, when mobs briefly seized state
television, parliament and Nano's office.
	   On Thursday, a parliament committee was scheduled to decide
whether to lift Berisha's immunity from arrest. If it does, the
full parliament chamber could order Berisha's detention on charges
of seeking to overthrow the government.
	   Outside party headquarters, Berisha's followers Wednesday
listened to his remarks from a loudspeaker, chanting slogans
against Prime Minister Fatos Nano. Berisha said his followers _ who
helped topple Albania's communist regime in the early 1990s _ would
oust the ``dictatorship of the terrorists,'' meaning Nano.
	   ``I am not disturbed,'' Berisha said. ``I'm prepared to continue
my battle in any situation. I will always be in the country, alive
or dead, in my house or elsewhere.''
	   The protesters marched to another rally in the city's main
Skanderbeg Square. Berisha claimed thousands of others were
prevented by police from attending the demonstration, which ended
peacefully.
	   He called for another rally Thursday and urged followers to
break through police barricades if they had to.
	   Late Tuesday, the government demanded that Berisha's followers
surrender their remaining arms Wednesday or face a crackdown. The
party responded to an earlier demand by handing over a pair of
tanks seized during riots Monday.
	   ``No weapons have been handed over so far from the Democratic
Party supporters,'' Nano said.

Mozambique attorney general says gun running fuels South Africa

crime &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Mozambique's Attorney General
Antonio Namburete admitted Wednesday that gun smuggling from his
country had directly contributed to soaring crime in South Africa.
	   In a speech at a crime conference in Pretoria, Namburete said
the large demand for illegal firearms in South Africa had also
prompted Mozambican gun runners to seek new sources for the
weapons.
	   ``They have started to lure members of the defense and security
forces with easy money to steal arms from their barracks,'' he
said.
	   He said organized crime syndicates in Mozambique plowed the
proceeds from selling hijacked cars from South Africa and other
neighboring countries into legal commercial enterprises in
Mozambique.
	   Speaking to reporters afterwards, Namburete said he expected new
arrests in connection with the case of South African foreign
official Robert McBridge, who has been accused of gun running and
espionage in Mozambique.
	   McBride was released after six months in jail in Mozambique, and
has returned to South Africa. But government agencies have
disassociated themselves from his case, and McBride has been
suspended at full pay from his job as director of the ministry's
Asian desk.

Kabila: loyalist troops surround eastern rebel towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese and allied forces are besieging
key cities in eastern Congo, where rebels remain entrenched despite
losing ground in their seven-week uprising, President Laurent
Kabila said Wednesday.
	   Kabila told reporters that troops battling on the government's
behalf had surrounded the cities of Goma, Bukavu and Kisangani as
well as the town of Bunia, which rebels captured shortly after
their seven-week rebellion began.
	   Goma, on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda, has served as the
rebel headquarters.
	   ``We are preparing the counter-offensive,'' Kabila said.
``Congo's enemies are becoming more and more isolated.'' He did not
say when the new strikes would come.
	   Kabila's boasts came amid a similar public relations drive by
rebel officials, who flew several reporters to the eastern town of
Kalemie that the government earlier claimed to have captured. It
remained in rebel hands.
	   Kalemie, a port town on Lake Tanganyika bordering Tanzania was
calm and rebel soldiers patrolled the streets despite government
announcements earlier in the week that it had been recaptured by
loyalists.
	   ``On the contrary, we have information Kabila's troops are
fleeing,'' said regional rebel commander Jean-Claude Moluka.
	   The rebels _ an alliance of Tutsi fighters, former military
soldiers and Kabila allies _ captured a string of cities in eastern
after revolting on Aug. 2. But the insurgents were pushed back from
Kinshasa, the capital, and other points in western Congo late last
month after Kabila enlisted troop and equipment support from
Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
	   The rebels _ who say Kabila has failed to implement democratic
reforms, and accuse him of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisiveness _ have also accused Sudan of joining the war on
Kabila's behalf.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are widely believed to be backing the rebels,
although both countries have denied direct involvement. Uganda's
President Yoweri Museveni said Tuesday his troops would remain in
Congo to protect Uganda from domestic rebel groups with bases
there.
	   Kabila vowed that Congolese government supporters would remain
``vigilant as long as foreign invaders remain in part of our
country.''
	   Responding to criticism of lack of democratic changes in Congo,
Kabila said he had been asked by some supporters to remain in power
and refrain from organizing elections.
	   ``To these people we say - `We understand you,''' Kabila said.
``I would like to see this trust returned to me at the ballot
box.''
	   Kabila has promised elections next year.
	   Rebel officials say Kabila has struck deals to help rebel groups
in Rwanda and Burundi in return for their support in driving out
the Congolese insurgents.
	   ``Kabila tried to use all means at his disposal to reduce us but
he didn't succeed,'' Moluka said, claiming rebel fighters had seen
no sign of government troops within five kilometers (three miles)
of Kalemie.
	   Moluka said the rebels aimed to capture Congo's southeastern
city of Lubumbashi, the country's third-largest city and the
capital of the copper-rich Shaba region just north of the Zambia
border.

Striking taxi drivers riot in Ivory Coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Striking taxi drivers protesting the
killing of a colleague by police attacked a police station with
rocks and bottles Wednesday and set cars on fire. Police responded
by firing tear gas.
	   No serious injuries were immediately reported.
	   The violence broke out during the funeral procession for Assane
Sanogo, an Abijdan cab driver shot dead over the weekend by police
officers when he failed to stop at a routine checkpoint. Such
checkpoints are often used by Ivorian police to extort money from
drivers.
	   A long line of taxis in the funeral procession stopped at the
police station in the Abidjan neighborhood of Yopougon, where cab
drivers began taunting riot police and hurling rocks and bottles at
them. Eventually, the police barricaded themselves inside the
station and fired tear gas canisters into the crowds.
	   Many protesters left when the violence broke out and the coffin
was taken to a nearby mosque for burial ceremonies. But some cab
drivers remained at the station and burned at least one police
truck and one civilian vehicle. The crowds were eventually
dispersed by the tear gas.
	   Normally packed with the orange and yellow taxis, Abidjan's
streets have been quiet since Monday, when the drivers began a mass
strike over Sanogo's death. Buses are jammed and many commuters are
forced to walk miles (kilometers) to work and back.
	   The strikers have vowed to continue protests on Thursday.

Spanish Prime Minister Aznar visits Peru's jungle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
arrived in Peru's jungle city of Iquitos on Wednesday to begin a
four-day visit to strengthen economic and political ties between
the countries.
	   Aznar, accompanied by his wife, Ana Botella, and Industry
Minister Josep Pique visited a fruit processing plant and a school
financed by Spanish aid in Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers)
northeast of Lima in the Amazon jungle.
	   Aznar was to fly to the capital Lima late Wednesday and was
scheduled to meet with President Alberto Fujimori on Thursday.
	   The leaders are expected to sign agreements to coordinate
efforts against drug-crop production and offer Peru credit to help
it recover from the effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon, the
foreign ministry said.
	   Spain is the leading foreign investor in Peru, accounting from
32 percent of total investment. A large part of that investment
comes from Telefonica de Espana's 1994 purchase of part of Peru's
state telephone company for dlrs 2 billion.
	   Aznar will meet with Spanish business leaders while in Lima.
	   On Saturday, Aznar with visit the Andean city of Cuzco and visit
the stone ruins of Machu Picchu, Peru's top tourist attraction.
	   From Cuzco, Aznar will return to Madrid on Saturday.

Iraqi leadership calls on U.N. to restore reviews of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq called Wednesday for the U.N. Security
Council to reverse its decision to suspend reviews of sanctions.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said it had decided to ask the Security Council to
rescind the resolution it passed on Sept. 9.
	   The resolution condemned Iraq's decision to stop cooperating
with U.N. arms inspectors as ``a totally unacceptable
contravention'' of U.N. Security Council measures. It suspended the
60-day reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Saddam had promised Iraqis that sanctions would be lifted by
early next year. The Security Council's move left Baghdad with no
mechanism to have the embargo terminated.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions.
	   Since Iraq froze surprise inspections Aug. 5, U.N. arms experts
have continued to monitor Iraqi weapons sites where they have
installed cameras and sensors to make sure that no prohibited
activity occurs.
	   Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament called Monday for the government
to end the U.N. monitoring, which would effectively close down the
whole disarmament operation.
	   The Revolutionary Command Council said Wednesday it would
implement the parliament's recommendation to freeze the continued
monitoring ``at a suitable time,'' the official Iraqi News Agency
reported.
	   ``The duration of this time will be short if the United States
and Britain persist with their hostility,'' the council warned.
	   The command council said the parliament's recommendation was
``an expression of the angry feelings of the Iraqi people''
	   The command council said that sanctions were being maintained
because of ``pressure and extortion that the United States was
exerting on the Security Council.''
	   The Security Council resolution agreed to a recommendation from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive review of
Iraq's progress on disarmament, but said such a review could take
place only once Iraq had restored cooperation with the inspectors.
	   In its response Wednesday night, the Iraqi leadership said a
review would not be acceptable unless the council rescinded its
decision.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with the inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

Soap operas in English just don't wash during dubbers' strike

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with dubbers' announcing they are suspending strike as
negotiations resume; EDITS throughout to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Ridge speaking English just didn't wash for
soap-opera fans here used to hearing ``The Bold and the Beautiful''
hero only in Italian.
	   Upset about the consequences of a two-month-old dubbers' strike,
viewers on Wednesday inundated a TV network with protests. Hours
later, the fans were able to breathe a sigh of relief -- the
dubbers' agreed to suspend the strike and return to negotiations.
	   Nobody was linking the suspension of the strike to the groans
around the nation from viewers who were getting their first earful
of subtitled or voice-over episodes of their favority shows as the
soaps returned from the traditional summer break.
	   But the news, reported Wednesday night by the Italian news
agency ANSA that the dubbers were going back to the recording
booths, was sure to warm the hearts of TV networks barraged with
complaints.
	   Within three hours of the lunch-hour broadcast of the serial,
which goes by the name of ``Beautiful'' in Italy, hundreds of
viewers had called Canale 5 to demand their stars' voices only in
Italian, said Yuri Priori, a switchboard operator at Mediaset, the
media network of former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.
	   The callers, most of them women, also protested Tuesday's
broadcast of ``Guiding Light'' (here called ``Sentieri''), on
another Mediaset network. While ``Beautiful'' had an Italian
voiceover but with the original English still audible in the
background, ``Guiding Light'' had subtitles while the soap actors
spoke in English.
	   ``I won't watch it any more'' if ``Beautiful'' is shown again in
English during the strike, said Eleonora Sala, a 19-year-old
student. The voiceover, she said, was confusing, and she ventured
that elderly viewers might have a hard time following the program.
	   Italians like their films and TV shows in Italian, no matter
what the original language is, and the dubbers's strike, for more
money and royalties, had already put off the release of big
Hollywood films, such as ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in cinemas
reopening after the traditional summer shutdown.
	   Italian television is also heavy on American TV feature shows,
whose episodes are usually a year behind those being currently
shown in the United States. But since the new TV season doesn't
open until October here, the impact of the strike hadn't hit fans
of such popular fare such as ``Law and Order'' and ``ER.''
	   On Wednesday evening, a spokeswoman for dubbing companies said
they were willing to discuss one of the issues under contention --
dubbers' demands to have a collective contract.
	   The representative, Elisabetta Bucciarelli, told The Associated
Press that the development should lead to the resumption of
negotiations between both sides, and shortly after, the news broke
that the strike was being suspended.
	   ANSA said the dubbers, who number about 500, are hoping to have
a national contract by March.

Zimbabwe's parliament questions government's involvement in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Congo-Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe's decision to
send 3,000 troops to Congo last month came under fire Wednesday in
Parliament, where his own ruling party members questioned the move.
	   During Parliament's first meeting after a month-long break,
Mugabe's critics fumed that the legislature was not consulted in
the decision, the official ZIANA news agency reported.
	   Lawmakers also questioned the cost and benefits of sending
troops so far away and demanded to know how long they would be
there. ZIANA did not identify which legislators were speaking.
	   Zimbabwe last month joined Namibia and Angola in supporting
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's effort to quell a rebel
insurrection. Zimbabwe is thought to be spending dlrs 1 million a
day to maintain the troops, warplanes, armored cars and logistical
backup.
	   Human rights groups and independent lawyers have said
dispatching the troops was unconstitutional because the Parliament
and ruling party committees were not consulted. But this was the
first time Parliament questioned the action.
	   Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said Zimbabwe's troops arrived in
Congo just in time to keep Congo's capital Kinshasa from falling to
rebel hands. He said Parliament was not consulted because it was
not in session.
	   Already battered by soaring inflation of up to 40 percent and
declining social services, Zimbabwe could not afford the military
involvement, parliament members said.
	   Mahachi said the troops would remain until there was permanent
peace and stability in Congo, echoing similar comments by Namibian
President Sam Nujoma earlier Wednesday.
	   The ruling party dominates all but three of the Zimbabwean
Parliament's 150 seats.
	   Mahachi said seven Zimbabwe troops had died and 11 were wounded
in Congo fighting.

French back Clinton, think Starr went too far
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 2200 GMT Wednesday; time set by source

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The sympathy vote in France is overwhelming for
U.S. President Bill Clinton, according to a new poll that says he
shouldn't resign and that politicians shouldn't be prosecuted for
lying about their private life.
	   In a country where politicians have jealously guarded their
privacy, 87 percent of those surveyed said Clinton should not step
down as a result of his extra-marital affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, the newsweekly Le Point reported
Thursday.
	   Eighty-five percent said the French thought a politician should
not face prosecution if he lies about his private life, according
to the poll for Le Point by the Ipsos agency.
	   Eighty-three percent feel the investigation of Clinton by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has gone too far, and 88 percent
think the U.S. media has overstepped in its coverage of the probe,
the poll said.
	   Still, 58 percent said Clinton was right to admit to his
relationship with Lewinsky. In perhaps the most surprising result,
51 percent believe such an affair could happen in France.
	   The late French President Francois Mitterrand wasn't confronted
about his illegitimate daughter until shortly before his term ended
in 1995, and the revelation caused little debate.
	   Ipsos surveyed a nationally representative sampling of 942
adults by telephone last Friday and Saturday. Congress released the
Starr report Friday.

	   ROME (AP) _ Ridge speaking English just didn't wash for
soap-opera fans here used to hearing ``The Bold and the Beautiful''
hero only in Italian.
	   Upset about the consequences of a two-month-old dubbers' strike,
viewers on Wednesday inundated a TV network with protests. Hours
later, the fans were able to breathe a sigh of relief -- the
dubbers' agreed to suspend the strike and return to negotiations.
	   Nobody was immediately linking the suspension of the strike to
the groans around the nation from viewers who had their first taste
of subtitled or voice-over episodes of their favorite shows as the
soaps returned from the traditional summer break.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Peter Stastny and Michel Goulet, teammates on the
Quebec Nordiques in the late 1980s, joined the Hockey Hall of Fame
on Wednesday.
	   Stastny made international headlines in 1980 when he, his
pregnant wife and brother Anton fled then-Czechoslovakia to North
America to play for Quebec.
	   Stastny was the 1980-81 National Hockey League rookie of the
year and he went on to score 450 goals in 15 seasons in the NHL for
Quebec, New Jersey and St. Louis. He retired after the 1994-95
season and is now a scout for the Blues.
	   Goulet, who retired a year earlier, scored 548 goals over 15
seasons with Quebec and Chicago to put him 16th on the NHL's
all-time list.
	   Last year's Hall of Fame inductees were Mario Lemieux, Bryan
Trottier, Edmonton Oilers general manager Glen Sather, Hockey News
founder Ken McKenzie and longtime Philadelphia Flyers radio voice
Gene Hart.

Taliban army agrees to UN conditions for team to visit captured

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UN saying Taliban agrees to conditions for
mission; DELETES outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Taliban religious army controlling
most of Afghanistan told the United Nations on Wednesday that it
has agreed to U.N. conditions for sending an observer team to a key
province where Taliban fighters are making gains, U.N. officials
said.
	   The timing of the mission to central Bamiyan province wasn't
known, but U.N. officials said they expected it to depart soon.
Fighting may still be continuing in the area, a U.N. statement
said.
	   The Taliban government invited U.N. staff to visit the province
following reports that its troops carried out mass killings after
capturing the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug 8. The Taliban
has denied the charges and says neighboring Iran is behind the
propaganda.
	   Reports from Iran, which Taliban officials say is backing an
anti-Taliban opposition alliance, have said similar killings
occurred after the capture of Bamiyan. Taliban forces have driven
opposition fighters from an estimated 90 percent of Afghanistan.
	   The United Nations, which no longer has international staff in
the country, had set specific conditions for a team to be sent to
Bamiyan.
	   The United Nations demanded that the team's safety be
guaranteed; U.N. planes be allowed to fly directly to and from
Bamiyan; U.N. personnel not be forced to stay overnight or be
denied use of U.N. communications equipment; and that the team have
``unfettered access to all affected populations in the Bamiyan
area,'' according to a U.N. press release.
	   The Taliban representative in New York, Noorullah Zadran, told
U.N. officials Wednesday that authorities at Taliban headquarters
in Kandahar had agreed to all the points, a U.N. statement said.
	   Zadran noted, however, that Bamiyan's airport had been damaged.
	   Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have escalated following
the deaths of nine Iranians during the Taliban attack on
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   The Taliban government has acknowledged that unidentified
members of its forces killed the Iranians while taking over the
city _ slayings that have prompted threats of military retaliation
from Tehran.
	   But Taliban officials have denied that their fighters killed
hundreds of people belonging to ethnic minority groups.
	   The Taliban government was willing to have the United Nations
visit Bamiyan ``so that the accusation does not get out of hand as
it did in Mazar-e-Sharif,'' Zadran said in an interview Tuesday.
	   Central Bamiyan is dominated by Shiite Muslims. Taliban members
are Sunni Muslims. Iran is a largely Shiite nation.
	   The Taliban government has asked the United Nations to mediate
the dispute with Iran. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is considering
the request, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

Bosnian Serb hard-liners criticize OSCE, warn against more delay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring victory in weekend
elections, Bosnian Serb hard-liners warned international officials
Wednesday against withholding results of the balloting and ``toying
with the will of the people.''
	   In a statement carried by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, two
extreme nationalist parties accused the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe of deliberately delaying the release of
preliminary results because of the hard-liners' strong showing.
	   ``The results are known but OSCE is silent,'' said the joint
statement by the Bosnian Serb Radical Party and Serb Democratic
Party.
	   Preliminary results had been promised Tuesday, but the OSCE,
which organized the election, postponed their release.
International officials cited complicated election procedures as
the reason for delay, and have said it could be several days before
results are released.
	   But the move fueled speculation that hard-liners opposed to the
1995 Dayton peace agreement had defeated candidates favored by the
Americans and Europeans. The delay also raised tensions among the
rival Bosnian Serb camps, which both claimed victory.
	   Under the Dayton plan, Bosnia is divided into two entities, a
Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters cast ballots
for a three-member presidency _ one Muslim, one Croat, one Serb _
along with a national parliament and separate parliaments in each
entity and region. The Serb republic also voted for the president
of its entity.
	   Nikola Poplasen, who ran for Serb republic presidency against
the Western-backed current president Biljana Plavsic, warned of
street protests if the results are not published soon.
	   Poplasen's Radical party claimed victory Tuesday for his
nationalist coalition and indicated it would not recognize a
different outcome.
	   A victory for Poplasen and other extremist candidates would
present a serious setback for Western efforts in Bosnia. U.S. and
other officials have hoped that moderate Muslims, Serbs and Croats
would prevail and further enforce a peace deal for the country.
	   Poplasen and Momcilo Krajisnik, a candidate for the joint
Bosnian presidency, are supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic and his policies of ethnic division. They oppose the
Dayton accord.
	   According to sources in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, another
Western favorite, Kresimir Zubak, was also faring poorly.
	   Analysts say nationalist sentiment among Bosnian Serbs has been
rekindled because of the fighting in the Serbian province of Kosovo
against largely Muslim ethnic Albanians.
	   Robert Barry, head of the Sarajevo OSCE office, has dismissed
suggestions that the OSCE was holding up announcing figures to
manipulate the outcome.
	   He said no figures will be made public until the counting is
completed and results checked, which may take several more days.
	   Further complicating the situation was the possibility that the
OSCE could disqualify nationalist candidates because of violations
of election rules prior to the vote.
	   ``Any future toying with the election will of the people will be
strongly condemned,'' Poplasen and his coalition partners warned.

Chirac will run for re-election, conservative leader says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac will run for re-election
when his term is up in 2002, the head of his conservative coalition
said in an interview released Wednesday.
	   ``It's obvious that the president will be a candidate to renew
his mandate,'' Philippe Seguin, president of Chirac's Rally for the
Republic, said in an interview to be published in Thursday's Le
Figaro daily.
	   The president, elected to a seven-year term in 1995, suffered a
heavy blow when he called early parliamentary elections last year
in which a leftist coalition took over the National Assembly,
Cabinet and the prime ministership.
	   Still, Chirac's approval rating has rebounded, and Seguin said
the 65-year-old president is ``the only candidate in the opposition
today,'' according to the conservative daily.
	   So far, Chirac's most likely opponent on the left is moderate
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Since the June 1997 elections, the right has been torn apart by
a war of chieftains and a debate over whether to ally with the
far-right National Front.
	   Seguin condemned any such alliances as ``morally disputable,
politically unimaginable and electorally illusory.''

Milan trial resumes with attention focused on mother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After a summer break, the trial for the
slaying of fashion scion Maurizio Gucci has returned to a Milan
courtroom with attention focused on a new figure, the mother of
Gucci's ex-wife.
	   Testimony by Silvana Barbieri, mother of murder defendant
Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, was scheduled for Thursday. Trial
resumed on Wednesday with testimony from a minor witness, the wife
of one of the five defendants charged with the 1995 fatal shooting
of Gucci on the doorsteps of his Milan office.
	   Just before the court recessed in mid-July, Gucci's ex-wife,
Reggiani Martinelli, admitted she had threatened the slain fashion
mogul and repeatedly sought someone to kill him, but she denied
going through with the plan. She insists she is the victim of
blackmail.
	   Reggiani Martinelli is accused of planning the killing to gain
control over the multimillion-dollar estate of her former husband.
	   In a surprise development just before the trial went on summer
break, codefendant Pina Auriemma, a psychic-friend of Reggiani
Martinelli, accused Barbieri of having known about a plan to kill
Gucci.
	   Prosecutors have contended that Auriemma asked a Milan hotel
porter to arrange the killing. The ex-owner of a pizzeria and a
mechanic, accused of the actual slaying, are the fourth and fifth
defendants in the trial.
	   In a separate case, Barbieri is under investigation for the
death of her own husband, former Milan shipping magnate Ferdinando
Reggiani, following accusations from her stepson, Vittorio Reggiani
shortly after the arrests in the Gucci case.

	   KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany (AP) _ Martin Wagner scored late in the
first half time to give Kaiserslautern a 1-0 victory over Benfica
Lisbon in its Champions League debut Wednesday.
	   Wagner scored in the 41st minute of an evenly balanced match in
which each team had its moments _ Kaiserslautern more in the first,
Benfica in the second half time.
	   Benfica finished the match with 10 men after defender Khalej
Tahar was sent off for a desperately late tackle on Marco Reich.
	   Only three minutes into the Group F match, a header by Olaf
Marschall, one of Germany's most prolific scorers, was stopped by
Benfica goalkeeper Michael Preud'homme.
	   Kaiserslautern did not make much out of its early pressure and
Benfica settled into a cautious game, waiting for the opportunity
to strike from counter-attacks.
	   In the 32nd minute, Preud'homme made a diving save to deny
Andreas Buck.
	   The visitors had their best chance one minute later, when a
deflected long-range shot by Jose Calado forced Kaiserslautern
goalkeeper Andreas Reinke to punch the ball over the bar.
	   Four minutes before half time, Wagner fed Marian Hristov on the
edge of Benfica's area, Hristov headed back to Wagner, who drove
home a low volley inside the post.
	   Seven minutes into the second half, Preud'homme did well to save
a shot by Marschall from close range and less than a minute later
Marschall connected with a low pass from the left only to shoot
high.
	   Benfica replied with two solo efforts by Martin Pringle, who
kept the Kaiserslautern defense on its toes the entire night.
	   Marschall was wide with two more headers and Hristov failed to
beat Preud'homme from point-blank range.
	   Then it was Benfica's turn to miss three opportunities within
three minutes, between the 66th and 69th.
	   Karel Poborsky, just in for Joao Pinto, fired a tremendous
free-kick from 18 meters (yards) into the upper left corner, only
to see Reinke tip it onto the bar.
	   Brian Deane then shot wide and Poborsky fired just outside the
far post as Benfica's quick passing caused havoc in the German
defense.
	   Marschall was on target in the 75th, but Preud'homme, the
39-year-old Belgian, flung himself to his left to deny the German.

32 minutes came against the run of play and captain Andre Ooijer
equalized for PSV on 59 minutes.
	   Multinational PSV started its first Group F game with just three
Dutch players and eight different nationalities.
	   But Bobby Robson's team wasted its first-half territorial
advantage with clumsy play near the HJK box and failed to create
genuine chances.

Manchester United and Barcelona tie 3-3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Barcelona striker Luis Enrique fired
a penalty in the 71st minute to salvage a 3-3 tie against
Manchester United in the Champions League opener at Old Trafford on
Wednesday.
	   Manchester United dominated the first half but Barcelona siezed
control in the second period. United suffered a double-blow in the
70th minute when Nicky Butt was called for a handball in the area.
	   Butt, a second half substitute, was sent off and Barcelona
awarded a penalty, which Enrique converted to level the score.
	   Ryan Giggs opened the scoring in the 17th minute when he notched
Manchester United's 250th goal in European soccer to give the home
team a 1-0 lead.
	   England midfielder David Beckham created the chance, beating the
defense down the right side and firing a perfect cross to Giggs,
whose flying header beat Barcelona goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   United doubled the advanatge in the 24th minute when Paul
Scholes fired a low drive past Hesp on the rebound after the Barca
'keeper had blocked Dwight Yorke's sensational attempt.
	   Yorke, facing away from the net, connected with a looping
midfield pass from Beckham but his acrobatic reverse kick was
blocked and the ball rebounded to Scholes.
	   But Barcelona took control in the second half.
	   The Spanish giants hit back within two minutes of play resuming
when Sonny Anderson capitalized on some poor Manchester United
defense in front of goal.
	   The ball ricocheted off two defenders before falling at
Anderson's feet about 15 meters (yards) out and he drove the ball
past the outstretched left hand of Peter Schmeichel.
	   Brazilian ace Giovanni equalized for Barca in the 60th minute
with a penalty from the spot after compatriot Rivaldo was pulled
down in the area.
	   Manchester United regained the lead in the 64th minute when
Beckham fired a perfectly weighted free kick from 25 meters, over a
defensive wall and just under the crossbar to make it 3-2.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ France will reopen its embassy in
Jamaica after a two-year closing designed to cut costs, Jamaica's
foreign ministry said Wednesday.
	   ``Jamaica and France have had an extensive program of economic

accreditation will undoubtedly facilitate the enhancement of such
cooperation,'' the ministry said.
	   It said the decision was announced Wednesday by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine at a luncheon with Latin American and

Juventus and Galatasaray play to 2-2 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Favorite Juventus of Turin, one player down
for most of the match, was held to a 2-2 draw by Galatasaray in
their Group-B first rotation of the Champions League Wednesday
night.
	   The equalizer by Italian defender Alessandro Birindelli, with a
powerful header in the 68th minute, prevented the Turkish team from
achieving a sensational upset win at home of the Italian league
champion _ a three time finalist of the most titled European
competition since 1996.
	   Striker Filippo Inzaghi, fed by Alessandro Del Piero, gave
Juventus a 1-0 lead with a spectacular back kick in the 17th
minute.
	   A turning point came in the 32nd minute when captain-keeper
Angelo Peruzzi was sent off the field by German referee Markus Merk
for using hands outside the penalty area to stop a lob by Turkish
striker Hakan Sukur.
	   Coach Marcello Lippi took off Uruguayan forward Daniel Fonseca
to field substitute goalie Michelangelo Rampulla and the reshuffled
Italian team allowed Galatasaray's equalizer in the 44th minute.
	   Hakan Sukur, left unmarked close to the Italian net, controlled
a long pass and kicked the ball in from a few meters, silencing a
crowd of about 38,000 at Turin's Delle Alpi arena.
	   Midfielder Umit put the visitors in front in the 63rd minute,
with a powerful drive from outside the penalty area.
	   Birindelli's goal, from close range on a free kick by Del Piero,
avoided La Juve a humiliating home loss.
	   The Italian champions showed an uncertain form and a weak
defense in absence of injured key players such as Ciro Ferrara,
Paulo Montero and Mark Iuliano.
	   Galatasaray, fielding Brazil's No.1 goalie Claudio Taffarel and
Romanian veteran star Gheorghe Hagi, was faster and more determined
and missed some clear scoring opportunities.
	   The most sensational chance was wasted by Hasan Sas in the 13th
minute. The Turkish midfielder outdribbled goalie Peruzzi but
kicked out from an angled position.
	   Juventus takes on Norway's Rosenborg next, while Galatasaray
will play the other Group-B team, Athletic Bilbao.

Porto ties 2-2 with visitor Olympiakos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Olympiakos of Greece fought back from a
two-goal deficit to clinch a 2-2 tie in the final minutes against
Porto of Portugal on Wednesday in their opening European Champions
League Group A game.
	   A 90th-minute goal by Serbian Sinica Gogic, coming five minutes
after Stelios Giannacopoulos had pulled one back for the Greek
side, completed a dramatic turnaround.
	   After a largely uneventful first half, Porto took the lead after
the break through Slovenian Zlatko Zahovic and Brazilian Mario
Jardel.
	   Zahovic's 60th-minute goal _ a neatly-aimed shot from a
free-kick on the edge of the Greek area _ and Jardel's close-range
shot eight minutes from the end injected life into what had been a
largely uneventful match at the Antas stadium.
	   But as the Portuguese eased off the pace Giannacopolous scored
with a tap-in after a goalmouth scramble in the final minutes then
Gogic headed in the equalizer.
	   The game started sluggishly but the Portuguese side gradually
took control and Olympiakos struggled to contain the home team's
attack, especially Zahovic and Jardel.
	   Zahovic had Porto's best first-half chance when he ran unmarked
into the area to receive a pass from Ljubimko Drulovic, but the
Olympiakos goalie moved quickly to shut out the shot.
	   Olympiakos had rarely strayed out of its own half. Grigoris
Georgatos almost scored with a thundering long-range shot on the
half-hour which was palmed away by Porto keeper Ivica Kralj at full
stretch.

 &UR; Iranian diplomat recalls surviving massacre by Taliban

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iranian diplomat who survived a massacre
by Taliban forces in Afghanistan told Wednesday how he lay on the
floor, holding his breath and waiting for a bullet to kill him.
	   Allahdad Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was one of 10 Iranian diplomats
who disappeared when the Taliban militia captured the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Last week the Taliban admitted that its forces had killed eight
of the diplomats and a journalist for Iran's official news agency.
Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni, who was wounded in the leg, and another
diplomat escaped.
	   In an interview with Iranian television, Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said that when the Taliban militia entered Mazar-e-Sharif, he and
his colleagues in the Iranian consulate did not expect trouble as
they had received word from Pakistan that their diplomatic status
would be respected. Pakistan is widely believed to be the principal
backer of the Taliban.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni said a group of Taliban militiamen forced
their way into the consulate, robbed all the employees and took
them down to the basement.
	   ``A few moments later three of their leaders entered the room
and fired at us with their weapons ... They fired repeatedly and
martyred everyone in the most cruel way,'' he said according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the interview, received in
Cairo.
	   ``I tried to control myself and even tried to control my
breathing. I closed my eyes and waited.'' Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said.
	   ``I said my prayers and waited for them to fire a bullet at me
and kill me. I was waiting to be killed. In any case, God's
blessing was with me. God decided that it was right for me to live,
to act as a messenger from them,'' he said.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni lay on the floor under a table until he
heard that the militiamen had left.
	   ``I decided to stand up. I noticed that I had been hit in the
leg ... I moved my leg and established that I could walk without
difficulty.''
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was responsible for the consulate's
secretariat and immigrant affairs.
	   The other diplomat who survived was not at the consulate when
the Taliban arrived.

Lens snatches 1-1 tie in injury time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ An injury time equalizer by Tony Vairelles
earned Lens a 1-1 tie with Arsenal on Wednesday in the opening
round of the Champions League.
	   Vairelles poked in a left-wing corner from two meters to level
after Marc Overmars had given the visitors a 51st minute lead.
	   Two of Arsenal's French contingent set up the first goal.
Nicolas Anelka slipped past his marker with a smart turn on the
left and supplied Emmanuel Petit, whose diagonal pass was slotted
into the net by Overmars.
	   Five minutes later, the Dutch winger struck the post with a
rasping 22-meter shot.
	   Before its goal, Lens came closest in the 70th minute when Eric
Sikora struck the Arsenal cross-bar with a 25-meter free kick.
	   Anelka had three good chances to kill the match but Arsenal,
Premier League and FA Cup-double titlist, failed to capitalize on
its second-half domination.

Real Madrid beats Inter Milan 2-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid defeated Inter Milan 2-0
Wednesday in a battle of titans to kick off the Champions League.
	   The first goal came in the 79th minute on a penalty kick by
Fernando Hierro, who had been fouled by Argentine defender Javier
Zanetti.
	   The second came in the 91st minute on a solo runaway from
Clarence Seedorf, who placed the ball just to the left of Gianluca
Pagliuca when the Inter goalkeeper came out to challenge him.
	   Real Madrid, defending the Champions League title it won last
year, managed to neutralize Brazilian superstar Ronaldo in the key
Group C matchup.
	   It was only Ronaldo's second game since his World Cup final
nightmare in July.
	   He had what was perhaps Inter's best chance to score, early in
the second period, but shot high and to the right as he looked Real
Madrid goalkeeper Bodo Illgner right in the eye.
	   Chilean Ivan Zamorano also squandered a good opportunity to
score with just minutes left in the game, his header from just
outside the goalie's box going wild and high.
	   Inter Milan is the defending UEFA Cup champion.
	   The game was played in Seville, rather than Madrid, as
UEFA-imposed punishment for an incident in which Real Madrid fans
knocked down a goalpost at cavernous Santiago Bernabeau Stadium
right before last year's Champions League semi-final match against
Germany's Borussia Dortmund.

	   Although the Moscow team had arrived hours late Tuesday in Graz
after its charter plane had been turned back by Polish authorities,
Spartak showed no signs of tiredness in the game.
	   The Russians controlled the game and outplayed the Austrian
team, which held its own against Spartak only in the first half
time.
	   Inside the first minute of the game, Markus Schopp got open on
the right but missed the target.
	   Ivica Vastic, the Austrian international, twice missed from the
long-range and was inches wide with a 42nd-minute volley, while
Darko Milanic headed wide after a corner, missing Sturm's best
opportunities.
	   Spartak imposed control after the interval with its fast-paced,
skillful passing game.
	   After the Austrian defense failed to clear a Zimbalar free kick,
Titov nudged the ball into the net for Spartak's first goal.
	   Zimbalar fired home from 20 meters (yards) to seal Spartak's
victory and the Russians were never really threatened again.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia Zagreb and Ajax Amsterdam played
to a spirited but goalless draw Wednesday in Group A of the
Champions League.
	   Ajax, a four-time champion, had more possession looked
threatening from outside the box. However, it was Croatia that
wasted the best chance to win.
	   Australian international Mark Viduka was fed an ideal pass by
Robert Prosinecki in a quick counterattack midway through the
second half, but the robust forward missed from point-blank range,
hitting his shot directly into goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar.
	   The biggest battle was waged for supremacy in the midfield,
where neither side was able to establish an upper hand.
	   Prosinecki and Edin Mujcin parried well for Croatia in
withholding and distributing the ball, but Richard Witschge and
Danny Blind closed down key passages for the visitors.
	   The play was free and flowing, providing the referee little room
for intervention and stoppages.
	   Tijani Babangida weaved into a promising position for the Dutch
side before the half-time break but was denied by goalkeeper Drazen
Ladic, while Finnish striker Jari Litmanen volleyed just wide of
the near post only moments later.
	   Croatia had several other opportunities coming from long
distance shots which forced Van der Sar to make brilliant saves.
	   In the end, both sides looked satisfied with a draw in their
opening match of the series.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Allan Ravn's goal in the 90th minute
gave Brondby IF a 2-1 win over Bayern Munich Wednesday in a
first-leg game of the Champions League.
	   It took 76 minutes of hard work before midfielder Markus Babbel
finally gave Bayern a 1-0 lead after a long free kick by Stefan
Effenberg.
	   In the 87th minute, Bayern's Thomas Helmer accidentally helped
the Danes when the ball rebounced on his foot and into his own goal
on a low shot by forward Soeren Colding. In the last minute, Ravn
ran alone through the German defense towards goalie Oliver Kahn and
lifted the ball above him and into the nets.
	   The Danes had entered the game with nothing to lose, knowing
Bayern was the favorite.
	   Bayern hesitated during the first 25 minutes and stayed on their
side of side of the turf, which boosted the Danish champions'
confidence. Then Bayern structured its game and had a couple of
good shots, including one by Giovane Elber that goalie Mogens Krogh
stopped with the finger tips.
	   In the second half, Bayern's rhythm seemed disturbed by
Brondby's continued pressure and Krogh's stunning savings. Twice
unmarked by the Danish defense, forward Carsten Jancker had two
attempts at opening the score but Krogh stopped the ball. Elber
later gunned a low ball at the Danish nets which the diving Krogh
nabbed to the cheers of the 30,378 fans.

Panathinaikos Athens a 2-1 victory over Dynamo Kiev Wednesday in a
Group E game for the Champions League.
	   Playing before 25,000 spectators, Panathinaikos came out strong
in the opening minutes, but the Ukrainians reacted quickly,
controlling the ball and launching dangerous attacks.
	   The visitors lost three good scoring opportunities with Serhiy
Rebrov in the 15th, Andriy Husin in 17th and Valentyn Belkevich in
the 18th.
	   In the 30th, Andriy Shevchenko dribbled past two Greek players,
gave to Rebrov who easily beat Polish goalie Jozef Wandzik to give
Dynamo a 1-0 lead.
	   Panathinaikos, which reached the semi-finals of the competition,
two years ago, regrouped after the rest period and levelled with a
header by Norwegian midfielder Erik Mykland off a center from
Costas Constantinidis in the 57th.
	   Lymberopoulos, who missed two scoring opportunities in the first
period and had a shot on Dynamo's crossbar in th second, scored the
winner with a header off a pass from Leonidas Vokolos.
	   Earlier, Vokolos had made two line saves to shots by Ukrainian
players.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ More rain delayed aid flights Wednesday
to villages isolated by a week of flooding in Mexico, while the
death toll rose to 119 and hunger grew among those cut off by the
downpours.
	   Helicopters resumed shuttling food, water and medicine to the
400,000 people in southern Chiapas state isolated by mudslides,
swollen rivers and downed bridges when the rain let up in the late
morning.
	   Forecasters predicted more heavy rain in the next 24 hours.
	   The floods last week tore through an area the size of Belgium,
leaving residents without food, water or power. By Wednesday, 119
bodies had been recovered, according to Health Minister Juan Ramon
de la Fuente, although officials expect the number to rise.
	   Local newspapers said more than 200 had died, and the Roman
Catholic bishop of Tapachula, Monsignor Felipe Arizmendi, said the
church expected the death toll to reach 500 or even 1,000 when
officials are able to count all the missing from tiny villages in
the mountains.
	   Many bodies are believed to have washed into the Pacific or
disappeared beneath the mud.
	   Hunger was increasing among flood victims, and in one village
people attacked a military helicopter dropping off aid, according
to the Mexico City newspaper Reforma.
	   Dozens of villagers in Soconusco, 40 miles (65 kilometers)
northwest of Tapachula, swarmed onto a helicopter dropping off
rations Tuesday, grabbing everything inside the chopper. Soldiers
were unable to stop them, Reforma said.
	   ``People are starving to death here,'' a local leader, Leobardo
Broca, was quoted as telling the soldiers. ``See for yourselves. I
want all of you to understand that I'm not guilty of anything,
because you've left us alone.''
	   The fight for the aid was intense, the newspaper said. Two women
fought over the same sack of flour, splitting it in half and
sending a cloud of flour over the area, churned up by the
helicopter's rotors.
	   Weather officials said 3.2 inches (8.1 centimeters) of rain had
fallen in Pijijiapan, one of the hardest-hit communities, and half
an inch (1.25 centimeters) in Tapachula. They forecast another 2 to
2 1/2 inches (5 to 6.3 centimeters) in the state over the next 24
hours.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department advised Americans to
exercise caution when traveling in Mexico because the floods have
washed out roads and bridges, blocking passage on some, including
sections of the Pan American Highway.
	   State government officials said helicopters had been grounded
Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning because of rain, but the
rain turned into a drizzle and the aid teams resumed their work.
	   Mexico's Red Cross continued to call for donations of food and
medicine. Among those responding was Pope John Paul II, who donated
dlrs 50,000 through Catholic charities for Mexico.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Burkino Faso became the 40th country to
ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines
Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months,
the United Nations announced.
	   Carol Bellamy, director of the United Nations Children's Fund,
was to travel to Bosnia on Thursday to mark the occasion.
	   The treaty was signed by more than 120 countries at a landmark
meeting in Ottawa last December. Nations that ratify the treaty
pledged to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and
clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years.
	   Forty countries needed to ratify the treaty for it to take
effect. With Burkina Faso's ratification, the treaty will go into
force in March, after a preparatory period of six months, U.N.
officials said.
	   ``Today, the world has taken a step toward becoming a safer and
more humane place,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a
statement. The treaty ``will have far-reaching implications for
both mine-affected and mine-producing countries.''
	   Carol Bellamy, director of the U.N. International Children's
Fund, congratulated the countries that ratified the treaty.
	   ``We stand at an historic moment in the struggle to end the
anguish that these weapons have already inflicted on tens of
thousands of the world's children, their families and their
communities,'' she said in a statement.
	   The United States has refused to ratify the treaty, arguing that
such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter an
invasion by North Korea of South Korea.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and an estimated 20,000 people are killed or injured
each year, mostly innocent civilians.
	   Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and
its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122
countries signing the treaty in Ottawa.
	   With Williams as campaign coordinator, the ICBL grew into a
global movement, backed by more than 1,000 organizations and
millions of people, including Britain's late Princess Diana.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Allan Ravn's 90th minute goal gave
Brondby an upset 2-1 win over Bayern Munich Wednesday in the
Champions League opener.
	   The match was scoreless until the 71st minute, when Bayern
midfielder Markus Babbel gave the visitors a 1-0 lead on a long
free kick by Stefan Effenberg.
	   But in the 87th minute, Bayern's Thomas Helmer unintentionally
contributed to the equalizer when low driver by Brondby forward
Soeren Colding rebounded off his foot into the net for an own-goal.
	   A last-minute solo run by Ravn through the German defense
created the clincher. Ravn eventually encountered Bayern goalkeeper
Oliver Khan in a one-on-one but lifted the ball over his head to
score the match-winning goal.
	   The Danes had entered the game with nothing to lose, with Bayern
a clear favorite.
	   Bayern hesitated during the first 25 minutes, which boosted the
Danish champions' confidence. Then Bayern structured its game and
had a couple of good shots, including one by Giovane Elber which
goalie Mogens Krogh stopped with the finger tips.
	   In the second half, Bayern's rhythm seemed disturbed by
Brondby's continued pressure and Krogh's stunning savings.
	   Twice unmarked by the Danish defense, forward Carsten Jancker
had two attempts at opening the score but Krogh stopped the ball.
Elber later gunned a low ball at the Danish nets which the diving
Krogh nabbed to the cheers of the 30,378 fans.

Long maligned, Simon Bolivar's lover emerging as heroine

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ She was the lover of one of Latin
America's greatest heroes, Simon Bolivar, and one of his most
trusted confidants.
	   But Manuela Saenz spent her last 25 years despised and
destitute, selling tobacco in a dusty port in northern Peru and
translating letters North American whale hunters wrote their lovers
in Latin America.
	   ``Manuelita'' died in disgrace during a diphtheria epidemic in
1856. Now, 142 years after her body was dumped in a mass grave and
her belongings _ including most of Bolivar's love letters _ were
burned, many Latin Americans are starting to think of her as one of
the continent's greatest heroines.
	   ``She really is perhaps the most important woman in Latin
American history,'' Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero says. ``She
had more political influence than even Eva Peron,'' the former
first lady of Argentina popularized in the play ``Evita.''
	   Books and newspaper articles in Bolivar's native Venezuela
finally are painting flattering portraits of the independence
hero's lover of eight years. Two movies are in production that
portray her as more than simply Bolivar's mistress; she is also a
liberated, intelligent woman who played an important role in the
revolution.
	   The demonization of Saenz has dissipated faster elsewhere in
Latin America. She is considered a national heroine in Ecuador, and
Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote warmly of her in his
1989 novel, ``The General in His Labyrinth.''
	   But for years, a moralistic streak among Venezuelans condemned
Saenz as the adulterous lover of a demigod, writer Muriel
Pilkington said in a recent interview.
	   Historians left her out of their books and authorities destroyed
or hid letters and documents that referred to her, Victor Von Hagen
writes in his authoritative 1989 biography, ``The Four Seasons of
Manuela.''
	   As recently as the mid-1980s a proposal to erect a bust of Saenz
in a square in the Andean mountain city of Merida provoked fierce
opposition from the Catholic Church.
	   Her detractors describe her as immoral and promiscuous, said
Venezuelan director Diego Risquez, whose movie ``Manuela Saenz'' is
to be released next year.
	   Bolivar freed Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia _
the country named after him _ from Spanish rule, but died hated and
disgraced after his dreams of a united South America collapsed in a
power struggle. His lover's reputation fell under the same cloud.
	   Bolivar's reputation eventually was restored, and he became one
of the region's most revered historical figures. But it has taken
much longer for Saenz to get her due in a culture where
politicians' mistresses are widely accepted as long as they stay in
the background.
	   Former President Carlos Andres Perez tried to keep his
relationship with Cecilia Matos relatively private although
Venezuelans were aware the couple had two children. Jaime
Lusinchi's mistress, Blanca Ibanez, accompanied the president on a
state visit to Spain in the 1980s, provoking mild disgust.
	   Venezuelans are reassessing Saenz, an elegant, audacious woman
who read the Greek and Latin classics. She was a highly decorated
colonel in the independence army, and some considered her a pioneer
for women's rights.
	   Born in 1797 as the illegitimate daughter of a Spanish
aristocrat in Quito, Ecuador, she grew up in a Catholic convent.
Her father forced her to marry an English businessman whom she
despised and later left.
	   She secretly raised money and distributed propaganda for the
independence movement before she even met Bolivar at a ball
honoring his triumphant entry into Quito in 1822.
	   They spent the last eight years of his life together _ far
longer than any of his other lovers. Bolivar was only 19 when his
wife of eight months died, and he swore he would never marry again.
	   Saenz challenged some of Bolivar's ideas and served as his eyes
and ears to detect rebellion in the army.
	   When mutinous officers rushed through the presidential palace in
Bogota, Colombia, one night in 1828, she helped him to escape
through a window. Bolivar dubbed her ``The Liberator of the
Liberator.''
	   ``It was a relationship of equals,'' Romero said.
	   After Bolivar's death in 1830, Saenz was barred from Colombia
and her native Ecuador. Destitute, she lived out her days in the
seedy northern port of Paita, Peru. She was disabled when the
wooden stairs in her home, weakened by termites, collapsed.
	   Herman Melville, on a whaling expedition in 1841 that reached
the northern tip of Peru, sought her out. Von Hagen, in his
biography of Saenz, quotes Melville as saying of her: ``I admire
you, not as the victor crowned by honors, but as the defeated.''

Doctor: Rehabilitation of Chinese gymnast is `inspiring'

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sang Lan, the Chinese gymnast paralyzed in the
Goodwill Games, is learning to write her name again _ using fingers
that still can't move.
	   ``Her spirit is quite amazing _ highly motivated. She is
consistently in a good mood,'' said Dr. Kristjan Ragnarsson, an
expert on rehabilitation for spinal cord injuries at The Mount
Sinai Medical Center.
	   The 17-year-old star athlete, who broke her neck during a warmup
vault on July 21, remains paralyzed, ``but she's very skillful,''
her doctor says. ``She's working very hard on things that come very
simply to us.''
	   Holding utensils with the help of a splint attached to her hand,
she painstakingly feeds herself, combs her own hair, brushes her
teeth and is learning to dress herself. She gets out of bed with a
sliding board onto a wheelchair, which she pushes around the
hospital corridors.
	   It's all in preparation for a new, more self-sufficient life
that includes learning English from a tutor.
	   ``She greets me very politely in English _ `Good morning, Dr.
Ragnarsson,''' the doctor said.
	   The bad news, he said, is that there has not been any
significant change in her neurological condition since the accident
at the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island. Sang still has no feeling in
her lower body or her hands.
	   She is, however, developing the muscles she can control,
including those in her neck, shoulders, arms and wrists, and she's
learning to balance her body while sitting.
	   For her type of spinal cord injury, Ragnarsson said, ``the
prognosis for recovery is exceptionally poor.'' Any other
development would have been ``almost miraculous.''
	   However, the doctor said, he has heard that some people with a
``complete spinal cord injury'' _ like Sang's _ have regained some
function.
	   The teen-ager is facing the bad news ``with maturity,'' he said,
adding, ``I'm sure there have been moments of frustration and
depression, but she has kept those to herself.''
	   Ragnarsson has also treated former New York Jets defensive
lineman Dennis Byrd, who recovered six years ago from paralysis
after breaking his neck in an American football game. But Sang's
injuries were more severe, he said.
	   Sang plans to get more education, because she understands it's
necessary ``when you have lost the physical skills,'' Ragnarsson
said.
	   She is to be discharged from Mount Sinai by mid-October to live
in a nearby hospital-owned apartment and continue rehabilitation,
which now takes as much as six hours of her day. Her parents, who
flew here from China after the accident, are participating in her
therapy.
	   The costs are covered by Goodwill Games insurance, and a private
fund also has been started for her.
	   For now, there's no talk about returning to China.
	   From her hospital room on Wednesday, Sang sent a message to
America, through Ragnarsson: ``She's enormously grateful and
appreciative not only to hospital staff and doctors, but to the
American people who have shown so much interest and empathy for
her.''
	   The lively teen-ager is still receiving cards from well-wishers
around the world, and talks to members of her Chinese team
regularly. In the past months, two of her wishes came true: visits
from her idols, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and singer Celine Dion.
	   And she's still hoping for that medical miracle.
	   The wall of her hospital room is graced by two favorite objects:
Buddhist beads and an image of Jesus Christ.
	   ``She has said her goal is to walk again,'' Ragnarsson said.
``She's inspiring.''

PSV Eindhoven scrambles last-gasp win over HJK Helsinki

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ HJK Helsinki, the first Finnish
team ever to play in the Champions League, lost 2-1 to PSV
Eindhoven Wednesday thanks to a last-minute Arnold Bruggink strike.
	   Finnish international forward Mika Kottila's brilliant goal on
32 minutes came against the run of play and captain Andre Ooijer
equalized for PSV on 59 minutes.
	   Multinational PSV started its first Group F game with just three
Dutch players and eight different nationalities.
	   But Bobby Robson's team wasted its first-half territorial
advantage with clumsy play near the HJK box and failed to create
genuine chances.

 &UR; With Iran-Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iranian diplomat who survived a massacre
by Taliban forces in Afghanistan spoke Wednesday of how he lay on
the floor, holding his breath and waiting for a bullet to kill him.
	   Allahdad Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was one of 10 Iranian diplomats
who disappeared when the Taliban militia captured the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Last week the Taliban admitted that its forces had killed eight
of the diplomats and a journalist for Iran's official news agency.
Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni, who was wounded in the leg, and another
diplomat escaped.
	   In an interview with Iranian television, Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said that when the Taliban militia entered Mazar-e-Sharif, he and
his colleagues in the Iranian consulate did not expect trouble as
they had received word from Pakistan that their diplomatic status
would be respected. Pakistan is widely believed to be the principal
backer of the Taliban.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni said a group of Taliban militiamen forced
their way into the consulate, robbed all the employees and took
them down to the basement.
	   ``A few moments later three of their leaders entered the room
and fired at us with their weapons ... They fired repeatedly and
martyred everyone in the most cruel way,'' he said according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the interview received in
Cairo.
	   ``I tried to control myself and even tried to control my
breathing. I closed my eyes and waited.'' Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said.
	   ``I said my prayers and waited for them to fire a bullet at me
and kill me. I was waiting to be killed. In any case, God's
blessing was with me. God decided that it was right for me to live,
to act as a messenger from them,'' he said.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni lay on the floor under a table until he
heard that the militiamen had left.
	   ``I decided to stand up. I noticed that I had been hit in the
leg ... I moved my leg and established that I could walk without
difficulty.''
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was responsible for the consulate's
secretariat and immigrant affairs.
	   The other diplomat who survived was not at the consulate when
the Taliban arrived.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE threat to stop monitoring graf 2; EDITS to
 &UR; Iraqi leadership calls on U.N. to restore reviews of sanctions
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq called Wednesday for the U.N. Security
Council to reverse its decision to suspend reviews of sanctions.
	   Iraq threatened to freeze the remaining U.N. monitoring of arms
sites, effectively closing down the international operation to
abolish its weapons of mass destruction.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said it had decided to ask the Security Council to
rescind its resolution of Sept. 9.
	   The resolution condemned Iraq's decision on Aug. 5 to stop
cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors as ``a totally unacceptable
contravention'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It suspended
the 60-day reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Saddam had promised Iraqis that sanctions would be lifted by
early next year. The Security Council's move left Baghdad with no
mechanism to have the embargo terminated.
	   The Revolutionary Command Council said it would implement the
Iraqi parliament's recommendation to freeze the U.N. monitoring of
weapons sites ``at a suitable time,'' the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
	   ``The duration of this time will be short if the United States
and Britain persist with their hostility,'' the Revolutionary
Command Council warned.
	   Since the freeze on surprise inspections, U.N. arms experts have
continued to monitor Iraqi weapons sites where they have installed
cameras and sensors to make sure that no prohibited activity
occurs.
	   Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament called Monday for the government
to put a stop to the U.N. monitoring.
	   The command council said the parliament's recommendation was
``an expression of the angry feelings of the Iraqi people''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions.
	   The command council said that sanctions were being maintained
because of ``pressure and extortion that the United States was
exerting on the Security Council.''
	   The Security Council resolution agreed to a recommendation from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive review of
Iraq's progress on disarmament, but said such a review could take
place only once Iraq had restored cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   In its response Wednesday night, the Iraqi leadership said a
review would not be acceptable unless the council rescinded its
decision.
	   The command council also said it hoped that Annan would be
``more effective regarding his promises.''
	   The statement did not refer to a promise, but in an article in a
government-controlled newspaper Tuesday, the presidential adviser
Hamed Youssef Hummadi accused Annan of failing to honor a
commitment to ``strive for an end to the sanctions.''
	   Hummadi wrote in Al-Qadissiya that Annan had made the promise in
the negotiations for the agreement of February 23, when Iraq
acceded to the U.N. demand for inspectors to have access to
presidential compounds.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with the inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Athletic Bilbao blew an early lead and had
to settle for a 1-1 tie with Rosenborg of Norway on Wednesday in a
Champions League Group C game.
	   The Spaniards scored in the 6th minute on clever footwork by
Joseba Etxeberria, who outmaneuvered defender Erik Hoftun and beat
Jorn Jamtfall when the Rosenborg goalkeeper came out to challenge
him.
	   Athletic Bilbao dominated much of the rest of the first period
but in the second came out looking unorganized. The Norwegians
controlled the ball much more, and in the 64th minute they scored
on a powerful shot from just outside the area by Roar Strand.
	   With the tie Athletic Bilbao ended a streak of nine straight
home wins. It had also gone six European matches without allowing a
goal.

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ HJK Helsinki, the first Finnish
team ever to play in the Champions League, lost 2-1 to PSV
Eindhoven Wednesday thanks to a last-minute Arnold Bruggink strike.
	   Finnish international forward Mika Kottila's brilliant diving
header put HJK ahead on 32 minutes against the run of play.
	   PSV's Belgian defender Davy Oyen looked at fault on the goal
after he lost Kottila as the center came across.
	   The Dutch side was rocked on its heels but it was a Finn playing
for PSV, Joonas Kolkka, who provided the corner which led to Andre
Ooijer's 59th-minute equalizer.
	   Ooijer was marked by two players and stood rooted to the spot
but managed to send a looping header into the roof of the net.
	   Despite a penalty appeal when Gilles de Bilde was pulled down in
the HJK box and a clear chance for second-half substitute Bruggink,
the Finnish defense held out until the dying seconds.
	   But keeper Tommi Kolvistoinen fumbled the ball needlessly on the
edge of his penalty area and Bruggink gratefully drilled the ball
into an empty net from 20 yards (meters).
	   Multinational PSV started its first Group F game with just three
Dutch players and eight different nationalities.
	   But Bobby Robson's team wasted its first-half territorial
advantage with clumsy play near the HJK box and failed to create
many genuine chances.
	   The 30,000-seater Philips stadium was just half full for the
game.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Navy officer returning from a drinking
spree shot three civilians to death and wounded two fellow
soldiers, the armed forces said Wednesday.
	   The shooting spree occurred Tuesday night at a naval station in
Amatitlan, 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Guatemala City, the
armed forces said.
	   Edwin Arturo Garcia Reyna returned from town drunk with fellow
officers, according to the statement. At the naval station, he
grabbed a gun and opened fire on two officers who tried to disarm
him, seriously wounding both.
	   He then left the base and went to a bridge at the mouth of Lake
Amatitlan and killed three civilians, the armed forces said.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Relatives of an opposition lawmaker found
shot dead in his home, said Wednesday that they suspect the suicide
note found near his body was forged.
	   Hector Manuel Klee Orellana's body was found in his home Tuesday
evening in the town of San Bartolome Milpas Altas, 16 miles (25
kilometers) west of the capital, with a bullet in his head.
	   A note near the body said he killed himself because he was
overwhelmed by many recent death threats.
	   But family members said they doubt Klee Orellana committed
suicide and authorities have ordered an investigation to determine
whether the lawmaker was murdered.
	   Klee Orellana was elected for the Center National Union party to
Guatemala's legislature, then broke away and became an independent
who strongly opposed President Alvaro Arzu's administration.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels killed six police
officers and wounded three when they tossed grenades into a police
station and sacked a bank in an eastern town overnight, authorities
said Wednesday.
	   The bloody assault in Hato Corozal, 180 miles (300 kilometers)
east of Bogota in Casanare state, began late Tuesday and was
carried out by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the
country's largest guerrilla group.
	   Several guerrillas were killed before air support arrived and
the rebels withdrew, leaving body parts scattered about town
streets, said the national police operations chief, Gen. Alfredo
Salgado. He was not able to provide a precise figure.
	   The rebels, who have been fighting the government since the
1960s, have stepped up military actions and now hold some 245
security force members prisoner.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A man who survived a Spanish
jetliner flight to Miami while stowed away in one of the wheel bay
has been returned unhurt to his hometown in northern Honduras.
	   Emilio Dominguez, 23, arrived at San Pedro Sula shortly before
midnight Tuesday as a non-paying passenger on an Iberia airlines
DC-9, the same plane he had stowed away on Sunday.
	   Dominguez, a poor farm laborer and sometimes gardener, was
allowed to go home free. Police in San Pedro Sula, 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa, planned to question him but said
they doubted he would face any charges.
	   Mechanics on a routine checkup of the jet after it landed in
Miami on Monday found him doubled up in the wheel bay and turned
him over to U.S. immigration authorities, who ordered him deported
to Honduras.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A week of heavy rain has caused
flooding in northwestern Nicaragua, and the Red Cross said
Wednesday that it has rescued 67 people.
	   ``Ten families made up of 31 adults, 25 children and 11 babies
were rescued,'' said Eleanora Rivera, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
	   The families were put up at a school in the town of Chinandega
and received food and first aid, she said.
	   ``So far there are no reports of human losses, but in
northwestern Nicaragua there are still communities that are
isolated because of flooded rivers,'' she said.
	   Forecasters predicted more rain for the region.

Champs Real Madrid win and Bayern upset; Barca draws Man United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defending champions Real Madrid posted a 2-0
victory Wednesday over UEFA Cup holders Inter Milan as the
Champions League opened play Wednesday with 12 first-rotation
matches.
	   Other powerhouses weren't as fortunate as the Spaniards.
	   Manchester United blew a 2-0 lead and drew 3-3 against Barcelona
before a disappointed 55,000 sellout at Old Trafford.
	   Danish side Brondby upset German giant Bayern Munich 2-1, while
'96 champion Juventus was held to a 2-2 draw by Turkey's
Galatasaray. French champions Lens drew 1-1 with English champions
Arsenal.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Madrid defeated Inter Milan 2-0 as
Fernando Hierro scored in the 79th on a penalty _ after a foul by
Argentine defender Javier Zanetti _ and Clarence Seedorf made it
2-0 in second-half injury time.
	   Real Madrid, playing 300 miles (500 kilometers) from home in
Seville _ a penalty for crowd trouble in last season's European
Champions Cup semifinal _ neutralized Brazilian superstar Ronaldo
in the key Group C matchup. It was only Ronaldo's second game since
his World Cup nightmare in July.
	   He probably had Inter's best chance to score early in the second
period but shot high and to the right of Real Madrid goalkeeper
Bodo Illgner.
	   Chilean Ivan Zamorano also squandered a good scoring opportunity
with just minutes left as his header from just outside the box
sailed high.
	   In Manchester, England, Luis Enrique scored on a penalty in the
71st as Barcelona came back for a 3-3 draw at Manchester United.
The penalty came after United's Nicky Butt was called for a
handball in the area and shown the red card.
	   The tying goal came just seven minutes after England
international David Beckham had scored on a 25-meter (yard) free
kick in the 64th for what looked like the deciding goal.
	   Welsh international Ryan Giggs and England's Paul Scholes scored
first-half goals as United took a 2-0 lead. But Barcelona rallied
with two early second-half goals by Sonny Anderson and Giovanni on
a penalty to tie.
	   It was a decent start for Barcelona in Group D _ the most
difficult this season _ and a disappointing one for United. Last
season, Barca won only one of six games in the Champions League and
was eliminated. United reached the quarterfinals.
	   In Turin, Italy, favored Juventus of Turin, one player down for
most of the match, was held to a 2-2 draw by Galatasaray of Turkey
in their Group B match.
	   The equalizer by Italian defender Alessandro Birindelli, with a
powerful header in the 68th minute, prevented the Turkish team from
achieving a sensational upset win at the home of the storied
Italian league champions.
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, Allan Ravn's 90th minute goal gave
Brondby an upset 2-1 win over Bayern Munich. The match was
scoreless until the 71st minute when Bayern midfielder Markus
Babbel gave the visitors a 1-0 lead on a long free kick by Stefan
Effenberg.
	   But in the 87th minute, Bayern's Thomas Helmer unintentionally
contributed to the equalizer when a low drive by Brondby forward
Soeren Colding rebounded off his foot into the net for an own-goal.
	   In Lens, France, an injury time equalizer by Tony Vairelles
earned Lens a 1-1 tie with Arsenal. Vairelles poked in a left-wing
corner from two meters (yards) to level after Marc Overmars had
given the visitors a 51st minute lead.
	   In other games:
	   In Kaiserlautern, Germany, Martin Wagner scored in the 41st
minute in an evenly balanced match to give Kaiserslautern a 1-0
victory over Benfica Lisbon. Benfica finished with 10 men after
defender Khalej Tahar was sent off for a late tackle.
	   In Eindhoven, Netherlands, HJK Helsinki, the first Finnish team
to play in the Champions League, lost 2-1 to PSV Eindhoven on a
last-minute Arnold Bruggink strike. Finnish international Mika
Kottila scored in the 32nd and Andre Ooijer equalized for PSV in
the 59th.
	   In Porto, Porgugal, Olympiakos of Greece fought back from a
two-goal deficit to clinch a 2-2 tie in the final minutes against
Porto. A 90th-minute goal by Serbian Sinica Gogic, coming five
minutes after Stelios Giannacopoulos had pulled one back for the
Greek side, completed a dramatic turnaround.
	   In Zagreb, Croatia, Croatia Zagreb and Ajax Amsterdam played to
a spirited but 0-0 draw. Ajax, a four-time champion of the event,
had the better of the play and looked threatening from outside the
box. However it was Croatia that foiled the best chance to win.
	   In Bilbao, Spain, Athletic Bilbao blew an early lead and had to
settle for a 1-1 tie with Rosenborg of Norway. The Basques scored
in the sixth minute on clever footwork by Joseba Etxeberria, who
outmaneuvered defender Erik Hoftun and beat goalkeeper Jorn
Jamtfall. But Roar Strand tied in the 64th on a powerful shot from
just outside the area.
	   In Athens, Greece, Nikos Lymberopoulos' 68th minute goal gave
Panathinaikos Athens a 2-1 victory over Dynamo Kiev in a Group E
game.
	   In Graz, Austria Yegor Titov and Ilya Zimbalar scored within
three minutes to give Spartak Moscow a 2-0 victory over Sturm Graz
in a Group C.

Iranian diplomat recalls surviving massacre by Taliban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to lower With line &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Iran-Afghanistan
 &UR; CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iranian diplomat who survived a massacre by
Taliban forces in Afghanistan told Wednesday how he lay on the
floor, holding his breath and waiting for a bullet to kill him.

<TEXT>
	   Allahdad Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was one of 10 Iranian diplomats
who disappeared when the Taliban militia captured the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Last week the Taliban admitted that its forces had killed eight
of the diplomats and a journalist for Iran's official news agency.
Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni, who was wounded in the leg, and another
diplomat escaped.
	   In an interview with Iranian television, Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said that when the Taliban militia entered Mazar-e-Sharif, he and
his colleagues in the Iranian consulate did not expect trouble as
they had received word from Pakistan that their diplomatic status
would be respected. Pakistan is widely believed to be the principal
backer of the Taliban.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni said a group of Taliban militiamen forced
their way into the consulate, robbed all the employees and took
them down to the basement.
	   ``A few moments later three of their leaders entered the room
and fired at us with their weapons ... They fired repeatedly and
martyred everyone in the most cruel way,'' he said according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. transcript of the interview, received in

	   ``I tried to control myself and even tried to control my
breathing. I closed my eyes and waited.'' Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni
said.
	   ``I said my prayers and waited for them to fire a bullet at me
and kill me. I was waiting to be killed. In any case, God's
blessing was with me. God decided that it was right for me to live,
to act as a messenger from them,'' he said.
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni lay on the floor under a table until he
heard that the militiamen had left.
	   ``I decided to stand up. I noticed that I had been hit in the
leg ... I moved my leg and established that I could walk without
difficulty.''
	   Shahsavan-Qarahosyeni was responsible for the consulate's
secretariat and immigrant affairs.
	   The other diplomat who survived was not at the consulate when
the Taliban arrived.

	   Armed Basque separatist group ETA announces cease-fire
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA has
announced an open-ended cease-fire that will begin Friday, a
newspaper reported late Wednesday.
	   The radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion said it had
received a statement from ETA in which the separatist group
announced an ``indefinite truce'' in its 30-year-old battle for an
independent Basque homeland in the north of Spain, the state-run
news agency EFE reported.
	   ETA sets no conditions for observing the ceasefire, news reports
said.
	   The four-page announcement, written in the Basque language,
makes references to the North Ireland peace agreement reached this
Easter.
	   The communique said ``new political majorities'' are forming in
the Basque country and that because of this ETA is in a position
``to take risks.''
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque language acronym which stands for
Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its
drive for Basque independence.

Iraqi leadership calls on U.N. to restore reviews of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to lower Eds line &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE threat to stop monitoring graf 2; EDITS to

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq called Wednesday for the U.N. Security
Council to reverse its decision to suspend reviews of sanctions.
	   Iraq threatened to freeze the remaining U.N. monitoring of arms
sites, effectively closing down the international operation to
abolish its weapons of mass destruction.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
government said it had decided to ask the Security Council to
rescind its resolution of Sept. 9.
	   The resolution condemned Iraq's decision on Aug. 5 to stop
cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors as ``a totally unacceptable
contravention'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions. It suspended
the 60-day reviews of the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Saddam had promised Iraqis that sanctions would be lifted by
early next year. The Security Council's move left Baghdad with no
mechanism to have the embargo terminated.
	   The Revolutionary Command Council said it would implement the
Iraqi parliament's recommendation to freeze the U.N. monitoring of
weapons sites ``at a suitable time,'' the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
	   ``The duration of this time will be short if the United States
and Britain persist with their hostility,'' the Revolutionary
Command Council warned.
	   Since the freeze on surprise inspections, U.N. arms experts have
continued to monitor Iraqi weapons sites where they have installed
cameras and sensors to make sure that no prohibited activity
occurs.
	   Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament called Monday for the government
to put a stop to the U.N. monitoring.
	   The command council said the parliament's recommendation was
``an expression of the angry feelings of the Iraqi people''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions.
	   The command council said that sanctions were being maintained
because of ``pressure and extortion that the United States was
exerting on the Security Council.''
	   The Security Council resolution agreed to a recommendation from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive review of
Iraq's progress on disarmament, but said such a review could take
place only once Iraq had restored cooperation with U.N. inspectors.
	   In its response Wednesday night, the Iraqi leadership said a
review would not be acceptable unless the council rescinded its
decision.
	   The command council also said it hoped that Annan would be
``more effective regarding his promises.''
	   The statement did not refer to a promise, but in an article in a
government-controlled newspaper Tuesday, the presidential adviser
Hamed Youssef Hummadi accused Annan of failing to honor a
commitment to ``strive for an end to the sanctions.''
	   Hummadi wrote in Al-Qadissiya that Annan had made the promise in
the negotiations for the agreement of February 23, when Iraq
acceded to the U.N. demand for inspectors to have access to
presidential compounds.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with the inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.

Holyfield welcomed home for title defense against Bean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Evander Holyfield is back home to fight, and his
friends and neighbors seem happy to see the heavyweight champion.
	   At least 24,000 tickets have been sold for Holyfield's title
defense against Vaughn Bean, the IBF's No. 1 challenger, Saturday
night in the Georgia Dome. The arena is set up for 42,000 for the
fight.
	   ``I wanted to do this fight in Atlanta,'' Holyfield said
Wednesday at a joint news conference. ``I was willing to fight here
if nobody showed.''
	   ``The people of Atlanta have spoken with their dollars because
they love this guy,'' Mayor Bill Campbell said. ``Any time you see
Evander Holyfield's name on the tickets you know you're going to
see a fight.''
	   The reason ticket buyers and Showtime viewers are going to see
this fight is because Bean is the IBF's mandatory challenger and
Holyfield must fight him or lose the IBF title.
	   ``It's best to follow the rules and regulations,'' said
Holyfield, who added that he would make a mandatory WBA defense
against Henry Akinwande before considering a unification fight with
WBC champion Lennox Lewis of Britain.
	   Lewis will make a mandatory defense against Zeljko Mavrovic of
Croatia Sept. 19 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville,
Connecticut.
	   Holyfield was to have fought Akinwande, of Britain, June 6 at
Madison Square Garden in New York, but that match was postponed
after Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis-B. Ticket sales were
poor.
	   Another reason Holyfield is making it a homecoming against Bean
is because there was no demand for the fight being held elsewhere.
	   Bean has a 32-1 record, but has beaten only three opponents who
had winning records at the time he fought them _ Warren Williams
(10-8-1) in 1993, Maurice Harris (11-9-2) in 1994, and Isaac Brown
(12-10), whom he stopped in the second round Jan. 30. Bean's loss
was on a majority decision to Michael Moorer in a bid for the IBF
title on March 29, 1997.
	   Holyfield's guarantee from Showtime reportedly is dlrs 3.5
million, and he would make about dlrs 5 million with ticket sales
at 24,000. Bean's purse is dlrs 1.8 million.
	   A dlrs 5 million purse is not peanuts, but Holyfield made dlrs
11 million and dlrs 35 million, respectively, for his two wins over
Mike Tyson and dlrs 20 million for his eighth-round victory over
Moorer last Nov. 8. Those were pay-per-view bouts.
	   Saturday night's fight is not.

Both sides hint at willingness for summit with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates material from Israel-Hamas &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian officials hinted
Wednesday at a willingness to hold summit talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton later this month but carefully avoided pinning hopes
for a new peace deal on the meetings.
	   A U.S. diplomatic official in Washington, who spokes on
condition of anonymity, said earlier Wednesday that Clinton was
hoping to conduct the talks and bring an end to months of impasse,
when world leaders gather in New York to attend a special session
of the United Nations General Assembly.
	   A senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that no
invitation, approach or discussion of such a summit had been held
with the Americans despite several meetings with Clinton's Mideast
envoy who is currently in the region trying to hammer out an
agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   But David Bar-Illan said that Netanyahu would welcome a meeting
with Arafat to help move the process forward.
	   ``If the gaps are bridged by then, which might take a small
miracle, then a summit meeting may be very beneficial, but that's a
big if,'' Bar-Illan said. He added that closing the gaps meant
Palestinian compliance with Israel's security demands, namely a
spelled out approach to fighting terrorism.
	   In Gaza City, where Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was meeting
with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, a senior Palestinian official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Ross had presented the
idea of a summit to Arafat and the matter was being discussed
between the two men and their aides. The official said the idea
``was possible.''
	   At issue, is a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdrawal its troops
from an addition 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures against militant groups such as Hamas which
has carried out deadly attacks against Israel. Ross has been trying
to bring the sides to an agreement over the past week, but with
reportedly little success.
	   Fearing revenge attacks, Israel has been on high alert since its
troops killed two Hamas fugitives last week in a raid on their West
Bank hide-out. On Wednesday, Israel increased security at
transportation drop-off points used by soldiers and warned troops
not to hitchhike. It has also barred most Palestinians, even
regular day laborers from entering Israeli cities.
	   Netanyahu said Hamas was ``flourishing like a cancer in the
Palestinian territories,'' and called on Arafat to do more combat
the militants if he wanted a peace deal.
	   Hamas has vowed to carry out suicide bombings in retaliation for
the killings of Adel and Imad Awadallah and the movement's
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated Press
Wednesday that that those who ordered the killings of the two
brothers ``should be afraid'' for their safety.
	   ``Any person whose hands are stained with the blood of our
people ... should be afraid. He should expect a reaction to the
attack ... because he is the one who decided to carry out the
attack and the one who decided to kill people,'' Yassin said. Hamas
opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace-making and has carried out scores
of deadly attacks against Israel.
	   Yassin said Hamas would continue its attacks against Israeli
targets. ``Hamas has a clear strategy to resist the occupiers until
we will liberate all of Palestine,'' Yassin said. ``The occupiers
should expect anything from us.''
	   Israel has buried the Awadallah brothers in unmarked graves in a
special cemetery. The family and members of the Palestinian
Authority have demanded the bodies be returned for Muslim burial
but when asked by Israel TV whether the bodies would be
handed-over, Netanyahu said ``no.''

Clinton pledges support for Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged full
support for Latin America and Brazil to help them out of their
current financial difficulties, the Brazilian president's press
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   According to Sergio Amaral, Clinton made his pledge during an
informal 15-minute phone call to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso Tuesday night.
	   In recent weeks, Brazilian stocks have plunged, and the country
has been hemorrhaging foreign reserves as part of on-going turmoil
on the world's financial markets.
	   The Brazilian president had planned to call Clinton on Tuesday,
but when Clinton learned of this he took the initiative and called
Cardoso himself, Amaral said.
	   ``You can rest assured that the U.S. will not give up its
support for Latin America and Brazil,'' Amaral quoted Clinton as
saying.
	   Amaral said Clinton also praised ``Brazil's economic conditions
and the policies executed by Cardoso.''
	   During the conversation, Cardoso confirmed Brazil still had dlrs
50 billion in reserves and that he had taken the necessary measures
to defend the currency, said Amaral.

Buffalo beats Austrian club in Euro-training camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ The Buffalo Sabres spotted Klagenfurt
the opening goal, then stormed back to record a comfortable 5-1 win
over the Austrian League runners-up Wednesday in the second match
of the International Challenge tournament.
	   The Sabres, who advanced to the Eastern Conference final last
season, were shocked early in the first period when Dieter Kalt
beat the NHL's Most Valuable Player and Czech Olympic hero Dominik
Hasek.
	   The goal sent the 5,000 spectators _ many of them from the
near-by Czech Republic _ into a frenzy which would last the
evening.
	   The goal served as a wake-up call for the Sabres, who struck
with five unanswered goals.
	   Michal Grosek and Dixon Ward counted in the first period to put
Buffalo ahead, while Paul Kruse had the only goal of the second.
Ward, with his second of the night, and team captain Mike Peca
closed out the scoring in the third.
	   The Tampa Bay Lightning, which had the worst record in the NHL
last year, also opened the tournament on a winning note beating
European League champions Feldkirch 4-1 on Tuesday.
	   The Sabres, who missed a place in the Stanley Cup finals after
losing 4-2 to the Washington Capitals last season, were the least
enthusiastic of the two clubs about coming to Europe.
	   While the Tampa Bay Lightning took a business approach to the
Euro-training camp, the Sabres are easing into the pre-season
accompanied by wives and girlfriends, and have peppered their trip
with visits to the local casino, tennis and boating.
	   ``We're taking this pretty seriously though there's some fun
involved,'' said Peca. ``It's not the level of competition we'd see
back home against other NHL teams, and we're not fighting for a job
since 95 percent of the guys were already on the team last year.
	   ``At the same time, we didn't come all the way to Europe to
lose,'' Peca added.
	   After a travel day Thursday, the showcase event will conclude
Friday when the two NHL teams meet and the two Austrian clubs face
each other.

Kings offer coaching job to Adelman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ After signing two players with
off-court problems, the Sacramento Kings offered their vacant
coaching job to Rick Adelman, a coach with a track record of
dealing with troubled stars.
	   Adelman, who twice coached the Portland Trail Blazers to the
National Basketball Association finals, is considering the
multiyear offer that would make him the Kings' eighth coach since
the team moved to Sacramento in 1985.
	   The Kings said Wednesday they did not want to announce the deal
until it was completed.
	   ``Everything looks good as far as the conversations we've had,''
Adelman told The Sacramento Bee. ``However, I've been through
enough things in the NBA that I'd rather wait until everything is
signed, sealed and delivered before I talk about anything.''
	   The coaching job has been vacant since Aug. 18, when the Kings
fired Eddie Jordan, who left with a 33-64 career record. The Kings
have never had a winning season in Sacramento.
	   Adelman earned high marks for his ability to work with problem
players, such as Golden State's Latrell Sprewell and Portland's Rod
Strickland.
	   The Kings have gambled on two talented players with off-court
problems, Chris Webber and Jason Williams.
	   Webber is awaiting trial on charges of marijuana possession,
second-degree assault and resisting arrest stemming from a traffic
stop in Maryland. On a promotional tour last month, Webber was
fined in Puerto Rico for having marijuana in his luggage.
	   Williams was thrown off the Florida Gators squad for unspecified
team rule violations. Gators coach Billy Donovan said he had ``an
unacceptable attitude in practice and in games.''
	   If Adelman joins the Kings, he will reunite with Geoff Petrie,
the Kings vice president, who was Portland's senior vice president
of operations when Adelman coached the Trail Blazers. The two also
played together in the Portland backcourt from 1970-1973.
	   ``I have absolutely no reservations in his ability to coach or
in his qualities as a person,'' Petrie said. ``Rick's statistics,
even going back to his community college days when he was a novice,
in terms of wins and losses are as high as any coach available in
the NBA.''
	   In six seasons with Portland (1988-94) and two with Golden State
(1995-97), Adelman was 357-252. In 1990-91, Portland went 63-19 but
lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals.
	   Adelman, 53, had two seasons left on a four-year, dlrs 4 million
contract with Golden State when he was fired as a new owner
acquired the team after the 1996-97 season. He was paid dlrs 1
million last season.
	   The Kings had narrowed the pool of candidates to Adelman and
Charlotte assistant coach Paul Silas. Adelman also was in the
running for the coaching job at Portland State.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ After a bloody 30-year fight for an
independent homeland in northern Spain, the armed Basque separatist
group ETA has announced a cease-fire, a newspaper reported late
Wednesday.
	   ETA's four-page statement announcing the indefinite truce was
sent to the radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion, the state-run
news agency EFE reported. The group set no conditions on the
cease-fire, which it said is to begin Friday.
	   The report comes days after Basque nationalists urged the
militant group to renounce bloodshed to help foster a political
solution to the conflict, which has cost 800 lives.
	   Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire had escalated
since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups
_ including the ETA-allied political party Herri Batasuna _ called
for peace talks and a permanent end to the violence.
	   The statement, dubbed the Lizarra Declaration, was signed by 23
political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups. The forum
was boycotted by Spain's two most powerful political parties, the
ruling Popular Party and the opposition Socialists.
	   ETA, the Basque language initials for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation
carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
	   Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged
the rebels to stop the killing.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not
negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces
violence.
	   ETA declared a truce for one week in 1996. It ended with a
series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the government
refused to negotiate unless ETA repudiated violence.

In a town of baseball dreams, Sammy Sosa keeps hope alive
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ This is where
the fantasy begins, the town that produced so many U.S. major
leaguers. And for local kids with a glove and a bat, inspiration
comes nightly on TV as they watch one of their own _ slugger Sammy
Sosa.
	   ``He's our hope,'' said Jose Richardson, caressing a baseball
bat Tuesday night as he waited in vain for Sosa to hit home run No.
63. ``When we see what Sammy has done, things seem possible.''
	   Against the San Diego Padres, Sosa went 1-for-5 on Tuesday, a
night after striking out four times, and again trailed Mark McGwire
in the chase for the single-season U.S. Major League Baseball home
run record.
	   But in the town where he once shined shoes and now owns a mall,
Sosa's still No. 1.
	   San Pedro de Macoris overflows with dreams of baseball
greatness. U.S. and Japanese teams run a dozen baseball camps here,
and players like Mariano Duncan, Julio Franco, Jose Offerman and
Joaquin Andujar all played on the ragged diamonds.
	   It seems almost everyone has a relative trying to make it big in
baseball.
	   Jose's 18-year-old brother Miguel has gotten further than most:
He plays outfield for the Florida Marlins' Dominican farm team,
earning dlrs 175 a week during the three-month season. His signing
bonus was dlrs 7,500 _ about three years' average wages in the
Dominican Republic. During the offseason, he practices full time.
	   In his bedroom, Miguel has ``21'' _ Sosa's number with the
Chicago Cubs _ stenciled on the wall near a picture of his
grandparents. A baseball bat props the window open.
	   Jose, 19, is still trying to win a contract himself. His friend,
19-year-old Frank Ramirez, is a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles'
farm team.
	   The Richardsons live with their mother in a cramped house on a
dirt street a few blocks from Plaza 30-30, a small shopping center
that Sosa built a few years ago. There's a statue of him in the
courtyard and a disco, Sammy's Hit Club, that has seen business
soar since Sosa's streak began.
	   In the nearby Papi Sports Bar, the talk was of ERAs, RBIs and
other baseball lore.
	   As they watched Sosa swing and miss on the flickering screen,
locals recalled the young boy who once shined shoes to help support
a poor family, and then worked in a clothing factory.
	   ``Sammy had it hard,'' said Mauricio Castellano, a cook.
``Whatever they pay him up there _ he's earned it down here.''
	   ``Sammy is our inspiration,'' chimed in Luis Santana, 23, who
works for a flour factory. ``Just one more reason to keep hope that
someday, somebody else in this town will make it big.''

Britain, France, testing waters for Kosovo resolution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain and France have begun preliminary
discussions with Security Council members about a resolution on
Kosovo with the aim of ending the crisis peacefully and averting a
humanitarian disaster, diplomatic sources said Wednesday.
	   Details of the resolution were sketchy, particularly on how far
it would go in demanding a stop to the Serb offensive on ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern Yugoslav province and whether
it would threaten force if the campaign continued.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the possibility of NATO
intervention in Kosovo in a press conference Wednesday. Russia,
which as a permanent council member wields a veto, however, has
said it opposed any use of force to settle the conflict.
	   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, would only say
that France and Britain were testing the waters to determine the
level of support among council members for a resolution.
	   ``We want to avert a humanitarian disaster,'' said one British
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We also want a
political settlement that's resolved through peaceful means. At the
same time, military campaigns must stop.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown in February on ethnic Albanian separatists who
are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their
homes following Serb bombing campaigns in the province, which is 90
percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The United Nations and international aid groups have warned of
an impending humanitarian disaster as winter approaches and
civilians are left without food or shelter.
	   The Security Council has taken little action on Kosovo,
delegating authority to the so-called Contact Group of nations and
NATO to decide the course of action.
	   Some council members have expressed frustration at the lack of
direction from the Contact Group _ the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ in the face of evidence of
what the U.N. chief has called ``wanton destruction'' that embodies
a ``scorched earth policy'' on the part of Serb forces.
	   In recent days, American and European officials have signaled a
growing readiness in NATO capitals to take military action against
Serbia even without prior approval from the United Nations.
	   The allies have been prevented from taking a more forceful
stance over Kosovo by divisions over whether U.N. blessing is
needed for military action to halt Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic
Albanians there.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said in German television
Tuesday military action could come ``in three to five weeks'' if
Serb forces maintain their crackdown.
	   NATO has developed three basic options for military action
ranging from a preventive deployment of NATO troops in Albania
along the border with Kosovo to air strikes against Serb targets to
the deployment of ground troops to support a cease-fire or a peace
agreement, if any.

Council backs arms embargo, local peacekeeping in Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With a civil war raging in Congo and other
conflicts simmering on the African continent, the Security Council
on Wednesday called on all member states to enforce arms embargoes.
	   The council unanimously adopted a Gabon-sponsored resolution
that encourages countries to take all necessary measures to ensure
that weapons don't fall into the hands of sanctioned states.
	   Mentioned in the resolution were Angola and Sierra Leone, where
fighting has threatened to spill over into other countries.
	   In a separate statement, the 15-member council encouraged
donations for regional peacekeeping initiatives on the continent.
	   The council took note of efforts by regional African groups such
as Organization of African Unity, the Southern African Development
Community and the Economic Community of West African States who
have been trying to defuse local tensions through mediation or
peacekeeping troops.
	   The SADC has been trying to mediate an end to the fighting in
Congo, where rebels are seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila
from power. Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of backing the rebels,
a charge the countries deny.
	   Zimbabwe and Angola, meanwhile, have been assisting Kabila in
rebuffing the rebels.
	   In Angola, a 1994 peace accord has crumbled with a recent
resurgence in fighting between the government and the former rebel
group UNITA, which the United Nations accuses of delaying
implementation of the accord.
	   In Sierra Leone, a Nigerian-led intervention force drove the
military junta from power in February, but junta loyalists and
their rebel allies continue to wage war in areas across the
country. Many of their attacks are against civilians, thousands of
whom have been murdered, mutilated and raped.

Tokyo stocks higher, dollar falls against yen in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose moderately in early trading
Thursday on hopes that Japan's government will soon agree on a plan
to reform the ailing banking system. The U.S. dollar fell.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 32.47 points,
0.23 percent, in the first 30 minutes of trading to 14,230.17. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei closed down 29.67 points, or 0.21 percent.
	   The dollar bought 134.06 yen in early morning trading, down 0.86
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate
of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and opposition forces
are nearing an agreement on key components of bank reform bills,
including a plan to rescue the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
media reports said.
	   LTCB shares, which tumbled 13 yen or 34 percent Wednesday, fell
4 yen to 21 yen Thursday. Ruling and opposition parties are likely
to agree to temporarily nationalize the troubled bank, local
reports said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 0.46 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,087.96. On
Monday, the TOPIX closed up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent.
	   An overnight gain on Wall Street also helped boost Tokyo shares,
traders said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.39 points to
8,089.78, marking the fourth straight session of gains.
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen after some
market participants interpreted comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan as meaning there would be no interest rate
cuts soon.
	   Greenspan told Congress that the United States was increasingly
at risk of deflation because of the global economic crisis, but
said no interest rate cuts are planned to halt the damaging
effects.
	   The dollar lost most of its overnight gains in early Asian
trading, though, as optimism over the apparent progress on Japan's
bank bills boosted the yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.740 percent from 0.755 on Wednesday,
driving its price up to 115.02 from 114.92 yen.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Western powers fear the violent showdown
between Albania's prime minister and former President Sali Berisha
may worsen if he is arrested on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   A European Union representative arrived in Tirana on Wednesday
to try to defuse the standoff, but a parliament committee was
scheduled to meet Thursday morning to decide whether to lift
Berisha's immunity from arrest. If it does, parliament could order
Berisha's detention on charges of seeking to overthrow the
government.
	   The EU appears to be worried an arrest of Berisha would
radicalize his supporters and worsen the crisis and increase Balkan
instability.
	   In rioting Sunday and Monday, Berisha's supporters damaged the
parliament and prime minister's office, briefly took over the state
television station, burned cars and looted some shops.
	   Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Tuesday said Berisha must ``take
responsibility for what happened in Albania in the last days.''
	   Berisha told several hundred people at his Democratic Party
headquarters he would continue to defy Nano's ``dictatorship,''
even if from prison.
	   Despite Berisha's rhetoric, he faces an elected government
backed by Western powers desperate to prevent the Albanian unrest
from influencing other crisis points in the region, such as
neighboring Kosovo province in Yugoslavia.
	   Since the rioting ended, Nano's government has strengthened its
grip on power. Parliament gave the Interior Ministry temporary
control of military police and some special commando units,
allowing the government to use them without having to call out the
army. The government also increased the pay of police by 50 to 100
percent and awarded them special bonuses to ensure loyalty.
	   ``The government has decided to solve the political crisis with
an iron hand,'' a red-faced Berisha shouted to chanting supporters
outside his party headquarters on Wednesday. ``We will respond with
a collective sacrifice.''
	   But the small crowd _ about 1,500 people when it gathered in the
main square _ showed Berisha's support in Tirana was limited.
	   Under Western pressure, Berisha initially complied with Nano's
demand Tuesday that his supporters hand over their heavy weapons.
Two army tanks seized by protesters Monday were given back Tuesday.
	   But another demand by Nano for Berisha's men to hand over all
automatic rifles was ignored. Guards carrying the rifles were seen
inside Democratic Party headquarters Wednesday.
	   The second major crisis in Albania in 18 months began after the
slaying Saturday of popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide
to Berisha, who immediately blamed Nano.
	   Demonstrations degenerated into rioting that lasted two days and
left three people dead and dozens injured.
	   Berisha has been seeking to return to power, tapping not only
outrage over Hajdari's killing but also widespread disappointment
with the government's inability to revive the economy and restore
confidence in the nation's future.
	   Berisha has demanded that Nano resign in favor of a ``technical
government'' to arrange new elections. The crisis has raised fears
of nationwide unrest reminiscent of the months of anarchy that
struck Albania last year following the collapse of shady pyramid
schemes that cost many people their life's savings.
	   Berisha was president during the pyramid investment crisis.
Elections in its aftermath led to his ouster from power and the
rise of Nano's former Communists in the Socialist Party.

Infertility device may reduce dangerous multiple pregnancies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCOTT ANDREWS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (AP) _ Women who seek fertility
treatment often face a tragic irony: Desperate to have just one
child, they suffer a catastrophe of riches instead, becoming
pregnant with two, three or more.
	   Multiple pregnancies, more likely to hurt mothers and cause
children to die, have increased in the United States since in vitro
procedures became available in the 1970s.
	   Doctors often try to boost in vitro success by flooding women's
wombs with three or more eggs fertilized outside their bodies. But
the technique also causes more than a third to bear twins or more _
an 18-fold increase over traditional pregnancies.
	   But obstetricians now see help in sight as a new device to
better assess the health of eggs moves toward human trials.
	   The device is an electrical probe that gauges the metabolism of
eggs by measuring ion transfer through the cell walls. It is being
developed at Brown University and the Marine Biological Laboratory
on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
	   Researchers hope that if doctors know which fertilized eggs are
vibrant, they will begin transferring only one or two healthy eggs
to the womb, rather than entire batches.
	   ``It is a tremendous problem. If this technological advance by
the folks at Brown will result in a smaller number of high-order
multiple gestations being created, it is wonderful,'' said Dr.
Richard Berkowitz of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
	   He performs ``pregnancy reductions'' for triplets or more. Women
can elect to abort at least one fetus to reduce heath risks.
	   ``It is a terrible thing to have to go through,'' Berkowitz
said. ``I have seen patients that get angry, that get up and say,
'This is not something I can think about.' There aficult.
	   Infant mortality and premature birth rates for multiples of
triplets or more are far higher than twins or singles, and
premature births present a host of problems from breathing
difficulties to developmental delay.
	   Mothers bearing twins or triplets also have health problems:
higher rates of pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, bedrest and
Caesarean sections.
	   The experimental probe could cut the number of times women with
unhealthy eggs go through costly and emotionally draining in vitro
treatment cycles, obstetricians said. Each in vitro attempt costs
dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 12,000 and often isn't covered by insurance.
	   Marjorie, a 41-year-old from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, endured
five failed cycles of in vitro treatments before giving up. She
said anything that accurately could have predicted her lack of
success would have saved her agony and money.
	   ``I think it would be good to know,'' said Marjorie, who asked
that her last name not be used. ``I don't think anyone wants to go
through taking all those drugs and going back and forth to the
doctor and waiting and having your hopes dashed.''
	   While the probe holds out hope for in vitro patients such as
Marjorie, it would not help the many women who use fertility drugs
alone to assist their pregnancies. Slightly less than one-third of
those women have multiple pregnancies.
	   The probe is being designed by Dr. Peter Smith of the Marine
Biological Laboratory, a former Cambridge University researcher,
and Dr. David L. Keefe, a father of seven. Keefe works at Brown and
at Women and Infants' Hospital in Providence.
	   The probe's basic design isn't new. Versions have been used to
study everything from the symmetry of seaweed eggs to the
regeneration of amphibian limbs.
	   But Keefe and Smith have altered it to measure the rates at
which calcium, oxygen and potassium ions pass through an egg's
wall. Keefe likens its versatility to that of the
electrocardiograph, saying he hopes other scientists develop
additional uses.
	   The probe was proven safe on mice in September, according to
Smith and Keefe. Next, they will create defects in unfertilized
eggs, hoping to measure them with the probe. The final steps are
tests on unfertilized and fertilized eggs.
	   Keefe and Smith say they also hope to reduce costs of the probe
by developing technology to manipulate it over the Internet. That
would allow a central laboratory to conduct the tests, saving
infertility clinics the cost of expensive technicians.
	   The National Institutes for Health recently awarded the project
a dlrs 200,000 grant.
	   The project faces friendly competition from two other proposals
to cut multiple pregnancies: rules to limit the number of eggs
doctors transfer and a technique to grow eggs longer outside the
womb to learn which are healthy.
	   Despite widespread enthusiasm for the probe, even one of its
biggest supporters has doubts that the device will lower multiple
pregnancy rates _ even if it is technically flawless.
	   ``The crucial factor would be whether doctors cut back on the
number of embryos they put back (into wombs),'' said Dr. Alan
DeCherney, editor of the journal Fertility and Sterility. ``If they
continue putting back three or four so that the chances of
pregnancy increase, the test would have no impact.''

Decades later, crippling symptoms flare for polio survivors

<TEXT>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ Phil Thorpe was a young airman in
1951 when he got orders for Korea. Instead of going to war, he
wound up in the hospital with the scourge of the time, polio.
	   He was hospitalized for nine months, battling the virus that
destroys muscle motor neurons in the brain and impairs the central
nervous system. Doctors told him he would never walk without braces
and crutches, but he proved them wrong through intensive physical
therapy and muscle transplants.
	   Thorpe married, raised a family, ran a business. Then in the
1980s, he began tiring faster, his arthritis got worse and he
started having trouble sleeping.
	   He was diagnosed with post polio syndrome, a cruel sequel that
shows up 30 or 40 years after the infection.
	   Before vaccines were developed in the late 1950s, polio
paralyzed or killed an estimated 50,000 people a year in the United
States. Post polio syndrome, or PPS, could strike up to 70 percent
of the 1.63 million Americans who survived.
	   Today, the 69-year-old Thorpe uses two canes to get around, and
he's learned ways to conserve his energy.
	   ``The first thing you should know, it's not fatal,'' he said.
``The second thing is, there is no cure.''
	   The syndrome occurs as neurons wear out. It can be diagnosed by
muscle and nerve tests that separate it from the normal aches and
pains of aging. Polio affected 90 percent of the motor nerves of
those who had muscle weakness or paralysis, killing at least 50
percent of the nerves.
	   ``Because those of us who had it had fewer neurons, our neurons
branched out to supply muscles that didn't have their own nerve
cells,'' said Dr. Craig Nettleton, a polio survivor and
psychologist at St. Joseph Rehabilitation Hospital and Outpatient
Center in Albuquerque.
	   ``Our neurons worked overtime,'' Nettleton said.
	   Because polio affected its victims' brain stems, neurological
disorders also show up. A 1990 post polio survey found most people
with PPS have concentration, memory or attention problems.
	   ``There are no primary memory problems,'' Nettleton said. ``What
I'm seeing is not so much a decline as a difficulty in getting
information stored in the first place.''
	   Thorpe said he sometimes has trouble keeping his mind on a task.
	   ``It's like my brain gets tired. You can't will yourself to do
things all the time,'' he said.
	   Other symptoms range from overwhelming fatigue and muscle
weakness to joint pain, intolerance to cold and trouble swallowing,
breathing and sleeping.
	   The problems all have the same origin _ nerves killed or damaged
by the polio virus years before, said Dr. Richard Bruno, director
of the Post-Polio Institute at the Englewood Hospital and Medical
Center in Englewood, New Jersey.
	   Post polio fatigue is associated with a severe inability to
focus attention and by a marked reduction in the hormone that
activates the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals damage to
the brain-stem neurons that activate the brain.
	   PPS sufferers also report new muscle weakness in limbs hit by
the virus, but 75 percent also report weakness in limbs they
believed weren't touched.
	   ``There's no such thing as an unaffected muscle,'' Bruno said.
	   It's like an eight-cylinder car running on four cylinders.
``It's not one of these things where you can say, `Push through the
weakness and push through the fatigue,''' he said. ``Every time you
drain these batteries, the more likely for the battery not to
recharge again.''
	   That's a problem for polio survivors, many of whom became
strivers and overachievers. They beat polio by embracing the ``use
it or lose it'' philosophy, and now they're being told to
``conserve it to preserve it.''
	   Many find it difficult to slow down, use a cane or turn to a
wheelchair and other devices for help.
	   This is what they tell Bruno: ``I am not going to be a cripple
again. I did that. I knew what that felt like and I am not going to
do that again.''
	   That's why Bruno's clinic takes a behavioral approach to
treatment, having patients keep logs of what activities cause
problems and how to modify those activities.
	   ``If you take care of yourself ... you won't get any worse, and
you will feel better,'' Bruno said. ``But if you continue doing
what you're doing, just draw a straight line and follow it into the
toilet.''
	   Nettleton, 48, agrees it's a tough adjustment. He got polio at
age 5 but ``passes for normal'' since the virus didn't leave him
with atrophied limbs or other outward signs.
	   Now, however, he's having problems with pain and fatigue. He
knows his patients' fear and their memories of feeling isolated.
	   ``It's a painful process for a lot of people,'' Nettleton said.
``You have to work through this before you can deal with therapy.''
	   Although PPS has become more recognized by the medical community
in the past two decades, Bruno said only about six U.S. centers
have formal clinical programs and research projects. Because polio
is no longer an epidemic, post polio is viewed as a medical
condition that will not occur in the future, he said.
	   Post polio takes decades to develop, so many people didn't show
up at doctors' offices with new weakness until the '80s. At first,
doctors diagnosed some with muscular dystrophy or other diseases.
It took time to recognize that something new was hitting polio
survivors.

Mexican officials urge giving OAS court jurisdiction in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo has asked the
Senate to grant an inter-American human rights organization
automatic jurisdiction in Mexico, the foreign secretariat said
Wednesday.
	   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, formed in 1979, is a
court of last resort for human rights cases in countries that
accept its rulings.
	   The proposal would ``allow Mexico to integrate itself fully into
the inter-American system of promotion and protection of human
rights,'' the secretariat said.
	   Some nations _ including the United States _ do not accept its
jurisdiction but can use the court for advisory decisions.
	   The court, a part of the Organization of American States,
accepts only cases referred by governments or by a sister agency,
the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.
	   That commission requires that people complaining of abuses first
exhaust remedies available in their own countries.
	   The commission in 1996 criticized the Mexican military's
prosecution of Gen. Jose Francisco Gallardo, who was arrested after
writing a 1993 article calling for a human rights ombudsman in the
military.
	   Gallardo this year was convicted of illegal enrichment and
sentenced to 14 years in prison.
	   On the other hand, Mexico, Honduras and Paraguay have asked the
court itself to denounce U.S. executions of foreigners who were not
given the right to meet with consular officials after their
arrests.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Daily smog levels in big cities rise
dramatically but mysteriously at dawn even before most commuters
start their engines. Swiss researchers believe they have found the
culprit _ soot.
	   Soot particles that are suspended overnight in the atmosphere
are coated with nitrogen dioxide. When the sunlight strikes them at
dawn, the photochemical reaction breaks down the nitrogen oxide
into nitrous acid, a component of smog and ozone pollution.
	   The nitrous acid production occurs 10 million times faster on
soot than on the surfaces of other atmospheric particles that were
examined, said environmental chemist Markus Ammann of the Paul
Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland.
	   Soot particles can be generated by industry, power plants and
vehicle exhaust. They remain in the atmosphere for long periods.
	   The report by Ammann and others was based on laboratory
simulations of urban air pollution. Their results were published in
the latest issue of the journal Nature.

	   DALLAS (AP) _ About 40 egrets were released to the wild nearly
two months after they were rescued from bulldozers that leveled a
rookery.
	   Volunteers for a nonprofit wildlife organization released the
birds Sept. 8, one by one _ and sometimes with a push _ from cages
and pet carriers near a wastewater treatment plant south of Dallas.
The site has been used for years as a reserve.
	   The egrets were rescued in July after the city of Carrollton
sent bulldozers to level trees the birds used as a breeding area.
Dozens of birds were killed. Nearly 300 were saved by the Rogers
Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Mesquite.
	   Many of the birds with injured legs and wings were nursed back
to health. Kathy Rogers, the center's founder and director, said at
least 100 egrets remain at the center and will probably be released
in the next few weeks, just in time for their migration south.
	   Those not ready to fly will be taken to a refuge near Corpus
Christi to be released, she said.
	   The bulldozing outraged many Carrollton residents. Three city
officials were suspended without pay for two weeks and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating because the city failed
to get a required permit before disturbing the rookery.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ An American Cancer Society study found that
people with a past diagnosis of the least dangerous kinds of skin
cancer later died at 20 percent to 30 percent higher rates from
other cancers.
	   ``A history of non-melanoma skin cancer should increase the
clinician's alertness for certain (other) cancers as well as
melanoma,'' the authors said in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
	   Scientists don't know why some cancers may be more deadly later
in people who have had squamous cell skin cancer or basal cell skin
cancer, but they have observed the same phenomenon in previous
European studies.
	   The new study involved 1.1 million U.S. volunteers who were
tracked for 12 years.
	   After adjusting for differences that affect cancer risk, such as
age and smoking habits, the researchers found that people with a
history of non-melanoma skin cancer were at higher risk of dying
from some but not all other cancers.
	   The higher risks were for melanoma, cancer of the pharynx, lung
cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, bladder cancer,
salivary cancer (men only), breast cancer (women only) and
leukemia.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Balance training is becoming a more popular
part of a balanced exercise program.
	   Better balance can help athletes improve performance and help
non-athletes avoid spills. And, although trainers are not falling
over each other to offer balance programs, many are starting them.
	   ``I'd say there is 20 percent more interest than 8 to 12 months
ago,'' said Gary McCoy, senior director for education at IDEA, a
fitness professionals' organization based in San Diego. ``Trainers
are beginning to focus on balance and stability.''
	   Balance training requires little or no equipment _ perhaps a
balance beam to walk or a wobble board with a curved bottom and
flat top to try to stand on.
	   And the tasks are deceptively simple _ in balance training, less
is more. The exerciser first stands and relaxes; later, the
challenge may grow to moving with eyes closed on an unstable
platform.
	   ``Balance training develops control,'' said trainer John
Blievernicht of Chicago in IDEA Personal Trainer magazine. The
training also leads to more efficient movement, he said.
	   Balance needs to be taught, especially as people age, said
fitness specialist Suzanne Nottingham of Mammoth Lakes, California.
Like biking _ itself a balance activity _ you don't forget after
you learn it once. But also like biking, you can get better with
training.

Guatemalan archbishop's body to be exhumed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The body of slain Archbishop Juan Gerardi
will be exhumed on Thursday to try to determine if he had been
bitten by the pet dog of a priest jailed in the crime.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina said Wednesday that he had ordered
the exhumation, which had been requested by the Archbishop's human
rights office. Gerardi formerly headed that office.
	   The Roman Catholic archbishop was clubbed to death on April 26,
two days after he delivered a human rights report blaming the
military and pro-government death squads for most of the deaths
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   The exhumation may be key in determining whether Gerardi was
killed by a fellow priest, Rev. Mario Orantes Najera, as
prosecutors charge, or by those angered by his human rights work.
	   Orantes lived in Gerardi's residence at the time of the killing
and owns a dog that reportedly responded only to his command.
Spanish experts said they saw evidence of dog bite marks in
photographs of Gerardi's body.

Chavez gets one more chance to win or talk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Julio Cesar Chavez doesn't understand what
Oscar De La Hoya is making such a fuss about.
	   To De La Hoya, though, it's simple.
	   ``He made up excuses after he lost to me the first time,'' De La
Hoya said. ``If he was a real man he would admit he lost and he
still refuses to do so.''
	   Two years after De La Hoya stopped a bloodied Chavez in the
fourth round of their junior welterweight title fight, De La Hoya
is still waiting for Chavez to admit he was the better man in the
ring that night.
	   That's part of the reason _ dlrs 9 million is the other _ De La
Hoya agreed to give Chavez another shot at him Friday night when
the two meet for the WBC welterweight title.
	   ``It's been in my mind for a long time,'' De La Hoya said. ``I
don't think about it every single day but I do think about it. I
start thinking, let's have a rematch and we'll settle it.''
	   Chavez has done little to earn a second shot against De La Hoya,
other than to remain an irritant to the champion. But he still
sells tickets, and he also has a story line to sell in what figures
to be his last hurrah at 36.
	   Though he didn't make it even a third of the way through their
first fight, Chavez insists the result would have been different if
he were not cut in the first round and could not see with blood
flowing into his eyes.
	   ``How am I supposed to give him respect if I was cut?'' Chavez
asks. ``It doesn't make sense. I didn't give him any respect
because he didn't earn it.''
	   The rematch of the first fight doesn't have the suspense or the
hype of the first time they met, when Chavez was still thought to
have some fight left in him and there were still questions to be
answered about De La Hoya.
	   This time around, there doesn't seem much the aging Chavez can
do with a 25-year-old opponent many believe is just entering a
period of real greatness.
	   ``Oscar's gotten a lot better since then and there's no way
Chavez has gotten better,'' said Gil Clancy, the veteran trainer
now helping handle De La Hoya.
	   De La Hoya, a 2-1 pick in the first fight, is an 8-1 favorite in
the rematch, which is expected to draw a near sellout at the UNLV
campus arena on a Mexican independence weekend.
	   The long odds reflect both De La Hoya's increasing ring
presence, and the very ordinary way Chavez has looked in his fights
since losing to De La Hoya. In his last fight June 25, Chavez was
cut badly over his right
	   ``I'm very happy the doctor went to the podium and said he's not
cut anymore,'' De La Hoya said. ``I want to knock him out, not stop
him on cuts.''
	   Chavez, for his part, has taken the fight as seriously as any in
a remarkable career in which he has built a record of 101-2-2. But
in recent years his body has shown the wear and tear of 18 years in
the ring and any amount of training won't bring back long gone
reflexes.
	   Chavez trained for nearly two months in the mountains of
Colorado, and vows that the rematch will be far different from the
first fight.
	   Still, he acknowledges he could lose. And if he does, he plans
to give De La Hoya his due.
	   ``This time if he beats me I'll give him respect,'' Chavez said.
``I hope that Oscar gives me respect if I beat him.''

A'Hern wins 20k walk; Boldon aims for 100m world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with later heats, finals &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Nick A'Hern pulled away from the
field at the mid-point of the race to win the 20 kilometer walk
Thursday and capture Australia's 41st gold of the Commonwealth
Games.
	   On the day Trinidad's Ato Boldon attempted a world record run in
the 100 meters under pressure from Namibia's Frankie Fredericks and
Obadele Thompson of Barbados, A'Hern was in a class of his own in
the walk around Lake Titiwangsa.
	   After sharing the lead with Canada's Arturo Huerta and another
Australian, Nathan Deaks, A'Hern made his move 45 minutes into the
race and finished some 250 meters clear of Huerta in 1 hour, 24
minutes and 59 seconds.
	   The Canadian won the silver in 1:25.49 with Deakes third in
1:26.06.
	   The walk medals were the first to be presented on the second day
of athletics. The highlight of the six finals later Thursday in the
100,000-capacity National Stadium at Bukit Jalil was the men's 100
meters in which Boldon, Fredericks and Thompson were expected to
fight over the medals with European champion Darren Campbell and
Australia's new sprint star, Matthew Shirvington, also in
contention.
	   Boldon has said the heat and humidity if Kuala Lumpur suits him
and is ideal for setting a world record.
	   The Trinidad sprinter, who trains in Los Angeles under respected
American coach John Smith, is targeting the 9.84 seconds set by
Canada's Donovan Bailey at the Atlanta Olympics, where Boldon
finished third behind the Canadian and Fredericks.
	   After his two rounds on Wednesday, however, Boldon was not so
certain that the track was fast enough.
	   ``I'm starting to have my doubts about the track,'' he said.
``It's not just me, it's the times the other guys are running.
	   ``I think Frankie should have run faster so I'm having a few
questions about whether it's a world record track.
	   Fredericks best time, after a poor start, was 10.15 while
Thompson had 10.09 and Shirvington 10.13.
	   Both the semifinal and final were scheduled for the evening when
other medals would be presented in the steeplechase, the women's
100, 400 and 5,000 meters, the men's discus.

Comprehensive review taking shape: Iraq's disarmament, and regional
</HEADLINE>
threat &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief is considering asking the
Security Council to re-evaluate all resolutions regarding Iraq's
disarmament to see if they're relevant anymore in terms of whether
Baghdad is a regional threat, diplomats say.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan is formulating his request as part
of a proposal for a comprehensive look at the 8-year-old effort to
disarm Iraq.
	   The council invited the U.N. chief to give his views on such a
proposal in an effort to persuade Iraq to rescind its decision to
bar cooperation with the United Nations, which has paralyzed
inspections for banned weapons.
	   Iraqi diplomats here have said they were pleased with the
preliminary details of Annan's proposal which emerged Wednesday
after Annan briefed the 10 nonpermanent members of the council.
	   ``It's not just disarmament, it's all resolutions,'' one Western
diplomat said after the briefing. ``To see if they're relevant
anymore starting from the premise of whether Iraq's a threat.''
	   The council must verify that Iraq no longer can produce
chemical, nuclear or biological weapons before it can lift
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq broke cooperation with inspectors after the chief arms
expert, Richard Butler, refused to certify Iraq had destroyed its
banned weapons. The decision halted U.N. inspections of suspected
weapons sites, though monitoring of previously inspected sites is
ongoing.
	   The council suspended it regular 60-day reviews of sanctions to
punish Iraq for its Aug. 5 decision, and said Iraq must resume
cooperation with inspectors before any comprehensive review can go
forward.
	   Iraqi leaders say they have complied with disarmament
resolutions, and blame Washington for using inspections to raise
trivial issues to maintain sanctions.
	   Iraqi leaders Wednesday called on the council to reverse its
decision to suspend the 60-day reviews of sanctions, but deferred
action on a recommendation to break off all relations with U.N.
monitors until a ``suitable time.''
	   The move was seen as a window for Baghdad to assess Annan's
proposal.
	   In the past, the council has checked Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions primarily on the basis of biannual reports from
Butler's U.N. Special Commission. Over the years, those reports
have charged Iraq with withholding information from the commission,
known as UNSCOM.
	   In his proposal, Annan is seeking a greater role for the council
in deciding what information Baghdad must offer to meet disarmament
mandates, diplomatic sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   While it has always been up to the council to determine whether
Iraq has complied with its resolutions, the council has typically
relied on UNSCOM to assess Iraq's compliance.
	   ``It was UNSCOM that told ... what was lacking,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now its the council
as a whole that can address this situation.''
	   The United States and United Kingdom, supporters of UNSCOM, have
said they can go along with the comprehensive review, but not at
the expense of disarmament mandates.

New crop of Australian girls set to take on gymnastics world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spelling Frketic is correct in 9th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The diminutive Australian girls
may be too young to celebrate their Commonwealth Games medals with
champagne. But they are not too young to take on the world.
	   With performances that outclassed all others this week,
17-year-old captain Zeena McLaughlin, the oldest member, and her
teammates have heralded a new age of Australian gymnastics as the
2000 Olympic host nation prepares to take on the traditional
powers.
	   ``Definitely we are sending a signal to the world,'' said
Frances Crampton, the Australian manager.
	   Until now, Australians had been no match for gymnasts from
Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the United States and China.
	   But gymnastics has gained muscle along with other sports in
Australia since the government set up a federal sports institute
and subsidiary bodies in all states, employing full-time
professional coaches.
	   ``That made a huge difference,'' said Crampton, who was a member
of the 1964 Olympics squad. Paid to work 36 hours, the coaches and
trainers put in 70 to 80 hours a week, she added.
	   ``We have no doubt now that we will be looking at the medals in
Sydney. I wouldn't have said that a couple of years ago,'' Crampton
said.
	   ``The results here have shown (the girls) have what it takes to
compete in the international arena,'' she said.
	   On Sunday, McLaughlin, Lisa Skinner, Allana Slater, Trudy
McIntosh and Katarina Frketic took the gold in the women's team
event.
	   The next day, the girls made a clean sweep of the medals in the
individual all-around competiton. McLaughlin took the gold, Slater
the silver and McIntosh the bronze.
	   On Wednesday, McIntosh took the gold for balance beam,
impressing the judges with her rock steady somersault mount on the
bar, which is as broad as her tiny feet. Then Skinner took the gold
on the uneven bars.
	   ``This is just the beginning,'' said Peggy Jo Lidick, the
women's head coach, who had trained American Shannon Miller to the
1996 Olympic Gold.
	   Even opponents acknowledge Australia's power.
	   ``They are definitely international. They are going to be a
serious challenge,'' said David Arnold, manager of the Canadian
gymnastics team.
	   Australia's Monday sweep was especially sweet: it was the first
time in two decades that one country had won all three all-around
medals in a gymnastics competition at the Commonwealth Games.
Canada achieved that in 1978 before McLaughlin or any of the other
gymnasts were born.
	   ``Really? We did that? I didn't even know it,'' said McIntosh.
	   Standing 139 centimeters (4 feet, 7 inches) and weighing 39
kilograms (86 pounds) the 14-year-old is the youngest, shortest and
lightest member of the Australian Commonwealth squad.
	   A bricklayer's daughter from Geelong outside Melbourne, McIntosh
trains 33 hours a week, six days a week. The daily diet is cereals
for breakfast, a snack, lunch consisting of a roll, and dinner of
fruit and pasta.
	   At age 5, when her kindergarten teachers noticed her handstands,
McIntosh was sent to the gymnastics club.
	   Crampton said McIntosh is Australia's strongest hope for the
Olympics as she will turn 16, the minimum qualifying age, just in
time.
	   Away from gymnastics, McIntosh's favorite pastime is romping
with Roxie, her pet Rottweiler.
	   ``Most of the time I miss hanging out with my friends. But they
think it is unfair how I get to go around the world,'' she said.

Medical journal asks better testing of herbal treatments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Citing the hazards of poorly tested herbal
remedies, one of the nation's most distinguished medical journals
says alternative medicines should be subjected to the same rigorous
standards as mainstream treatments.
	   In an editorial, Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer of
the New England Journal of Medicine argued that testimonials and
speculation are no substitute for precise medical evidence that
treatments are safe and effective.
	   ``There cannot be two kinds of medicine _ conventional and
alternative,'' they wrote in Thursday's issue. ``There is only
medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not,
medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.''
	   Herbal remedies sold as dietary supplements have proliferated
since 1994, when Congress exempted them from regulation by the Food
and Drug Administration.
	   The same issue of the journal carried these reports on
alternative medicine:
	   _Doctors from Alberta Children's Hospital in Canada reported two
cases in which parents opted to treat their children's cancer with
shark cartilage or the herb astragalus instead of standard
medicines. In both cases, the cancers progressed, and one child
died.
	   _The California Department of Health Services tested 260
traditional Chinese medicines and found one-third were contaminated
with heavy metals, such as lead and arsenic, or pharmaceuticals not
listed on the labels.
	   _Doctors from Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey
tested a mixture of eight herbs, sold as PC-SPES, on men with
prostate cancer. They found it worked like estrogen, decreasing
testosterone and cutting sex drive. While not proving whether it
relieves cancer, the study shows the herb blend has potent hormonal
effects.
	   _The FDA described an episode, publicized last year, in which
the herb plantain was contaminated with a naturally occurring form
of digitalis, a heart stimulant that can cause cardiac arrest.
	   _A group of doctors from Arizona reported the case of a man
found driving erratically after taking a supplement promoted as a
way to increase growth hormone. A letter from the manufacturer,
RenewTrient Research of Cocoa Beach, Fla., said the man ignored a
label warning to take the substance only before sleeping.
	   ``Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific
testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional
treatments,'' the journal editorial said.
	   At the American Council on Science and Health, associate
director Jeff Stier said, ``It's good to see that mainstream
medicine is coming on board to defend itself'' against unproven
treatments.
	   However, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents
supplement makers, defended the law that allowed the pills to come
into wider use. It said many of the issues raised by the journal,
such as contaminated products, are already covered by federal
regulations.
	   ``Broadsides such as the NEJM editorial serve only to confuse
the issue by intermingling a variety of topics,'' said a statement
by the organization.

O'Neill on target for 10
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian swimmer Petria Thomas
stands between Susie O'Neill and an outright record of 10 gold
medals in Thursday's final pool session at the Commonwealth Games.
	   O'Neill equaled compatriot Mike Wenden's mark of nine gold
medals at the games when she won a relay medal late Wednesday.
	   On Thursday, the Olympic 200-meter butterfly champion eased off
to qualify second fastest for the final behind Canada's Jessica
Deglau.
	   Thomas, who beat O'Neill in the 100-meter butterfly earlier in
the meet, was third fastest.
	   Thomas has not beaten O'Neill in the 200 since 1993. She won
silver medals behind her at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and January's
world championships.
	   ``She's been going for 10 golds the whole meet, but I'll get in
there and try and do my best,'' said Thomas.
	   ``She's done a great job this meet and if it happens it happens,
but I'm certainly going to be trying to make it difficult for
her.''
	   Thomas and O'Neill have a long running rivalry and O'Neill has
usually been able to lift under pressure.
	   ``The only time I've beaten her was at the Pan Pacs in 1993 _
there's got to be a second time for everything I suppose,'' Thomas
said.
	   O'Neill has tackled eight events at the games and won five golds
and two silvers with Thursday's final remaining.
	   ``I feel a bit tired,'' she said.
	   O'Neill seemed listless Thursday and told reporters she tried to
swim slow to secure an outside lane. It was anyone's guess if she
was joking.
	   A team spokesman suggested O'Neill might be trying to ease the
pressure on herself after the hype over her gold prospecting.
	   With her latest haul added to four golds from the past two
games, O'Neill joined Wenden at nine. It is believed to be the most
golds by any athlete in any sport at the games but the Commonwealth
Games Federation would not confirm it as a record because of
inadequate book keeping.
	   O'Neill will equal the record for most golds at one games by a
swimmer if she wins Thursday. Canadian Graham Smith claimed six
golds at the 1978 Edmonton Games and seven overall.
	   Australia goes into the final session with 19 of the 26 gold
medals that have been decided so far and needs a clean sweep of six
to equal its games record of 25 set four years ago in Victoria,
Canada. The Australians are expected to claim four of the six but
will struggle in the women's 200-meter backstroke and 50-meter
freestyle.
	   The Australians have the top three swimmers in the 1,500-meter
freestyle race, with world champion Grant Hackett in strong form.
	   Matthew Dunn qualified fastest for the 200-meter individual
medley, ahead of compatriot Robert Van Der Zant, with 200-meter
butterfly gold medalist James Hickman of England third.
	   Helen Duncan of England was fastest qualifier for the 200-meter
backstroke final, in front of compatriots Jo Deakins and Katy
Sexton.
	   England's Sue Rolph is on course to add the 50-meter freestyle
to her 100-meter victory in the opening event of the meet.
	   Rolph clocked 25.92 to be fastest qualifier.
	   If England can win two golds it will jump ahead of Canada in
second place in the gold standings. Canada has four so far and
England has three.

Indians clinch AL Central with win over Twins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians clinched a fourth
straight AL Central title Wednesday night as Manny Ramirez hit his
41st and 42nd homers, tying the major league record with homers in
four straight at-bats and five in two games in an 8-6 victory over
the Minnesota Twins.
	   The Indians became the third team to win four straight titles
since divisional play started in 1969. They joined Atlanta, on its
current run of seven straight, and the Oakland A's, who won the AL
West from 1971-75.
	   Ramirez, who homered in his last three at-bats Tuesday night,
homered on a 1-1 pitch from Minnesota's Bob Tewksbury (7-11) in the
first. After grounding out in the second, Ramirez hit a 3-2 pitch
to left for his fifth homer in six at-bats. That gave him six hits
in his last 37 at-bats _ all homers.
	   Charles Nagy (14-10) survived a scary moment when a liner was
hit off his pitching hand in the second. He allowed four runs and
eight hits in 5 1-3 innings with no walks and three strikeouts.
 &UR; Blue Jays 2, Tigers 1
	   In Detroit, Roger Clemens won his 14th straight decision _ the
longest streak in the AL since he did it in 1986 _ for Toronto.
	   Clemens (19-6) struck out 11 in 7 2-3 innings, allowing only
four hits. The four-time Cy Young Award winner is tied for the
major league lead in victories and tops the AL in ERA (2.63) and
strikeouts (245).
	   The Blue Jays won for the 15th time in 19 games and remained
four games behind Boston for the wild-card spot. The Red Sox beat
Baltimore 4-3.
	   Clemens matched the longest winning streak of his career,
previously done 12 years ago with Boston. The last pitcher to win
14 in a row in the majors was Atlanta's John Smoltz in 1996.
	   Clemens moved ahead of Bob Gibson (3,117) into 10th place on the
career list, and finished the game with 3,127.
	   Brian Powell (3-8) took the loss.
 &UR; Red Sox 4, Orioles 3 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore. Tom Gordon matched a major league single-season
record with his 38th consecutive save and set a Red Sox mark with
his 41st save of the season.
	   Boston held its four-game lead in the wild-card race over
Toronto.
	   Nomar Garciaparra and Troy O'Leary had three hits apiece for the
Red Sox, who have won two straight after dropping nine of 11.
	   Gordon got the final out in the eighth inning with a runner on
third, then worked around B.J. Surhoff's RBI single in the ninth.
The 38 successive saves ties the single-season record set by
Cleveland's Jose Mesa in 1995.
	   Gordon's 41 saves snapped the franchise record of 40 by Jeff
Reardon in 1995. He has converted 41 of 42 save opportunities this
season, failing only on April 14 against Oakland.
 &UR; Devil Rays 7, Yankees 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Tony Saunders pitched six scoreless
innings and Tampa Bay beat AL East champion New York for the first
time.
	   The Yankees were the only AL team the expansion Devil Rays had
not beaten. New York won the first six games of the season series,
including four straight at Tropicana Field.
	   Andy Pettitte (16-10) struggled again for the Yankees, losing
for the fourth time in six decisions. He gave up at least five runs
for the sixth straight start, leaving after six innings with Tampa
Bay ahead 6-0.
	   The loss meant the Yankees cannot set the major league record
for wins in a season. At 104-46, the best they can do is match the
mark of 116 victories by the 1906 Chicago Cubs. The AL record is
111 by the 1954 Cleveland Indians.
	   Saunders (6-14), who went 16 starts without a victory early in
the season, allowed five hits, struck out three and walked five.

United and Rapids post victories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New York (AP) _ D.C. United scored three
first-half goals Wednesday and went on to hand the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars their sixth straight Major League Soccer loss
5-0, the most lopsided defeat in club history.
	   Penalty kicks by Roy Lassier and Jaime Moreno in the fourth and
15th minutes, respectively, staked United to an early 2-0 lead and
the pair added assists on Ben Olsen's 36th-minute goal, giving the
two-time MLS champions a 3-0 edge at the interval.
	   The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for Eastern
Conference-leading D.C., which improved its record to an MLS best
23-7, good for 57 points. The MetroStars, who set a team record for
consecutive losses, fell to 14-17. They have 38 points. Their worst
previous losses were by 4-0 scores on several occasions.
 &UR; Colorado 4, Columbus 2
	   In Columbus, Ohio, Joey DiGiamarino's goal from about 25 yards
out broke a 2-2 tie as the Colorado Rapids defeated the Columbus
Crew 4-2 in Major League Soccer.
	   DiGiamarino opened the scoring in the 32nd minute, with
goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann assisting, and has three goals for the
season, all in the last two games.
	   Wolde Harris clinched the victory by scoring in the 89th minute
from 35 yards into an empty net after Columbus goalkeeper Juergen
Sommer came out to challenge him.
	   The goal was Harris' 12th of the season, breaking the team
record of 11 set by Jean Harbor in 1996.
	   The Rapids' other goal came in the 51st minute, with Paul Bravo
scoring off assists from Tahj Jakins and DiGiamarino.

Hall of Fame has new Nordiques' connection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ It didn't take long for former Quebec Nordiques
teammates Peter Stastny and Michel Goulet to start walking down
memory lane on Wednesday, the day the Hockey Hall of Fame announced
the two forwards were the new inductees.
	   ``Remember, Peter, that trip to Vancouver and Washington?''
Goulet asked during a conference call.
	   ``Yep,'' replied Stastny, knowing what was coming.
	   ``Peter had five points in Vancouver,'' Goulet said. ``The next
day we were playing in Washington and he had eight points that day.
It was unbelievable.''
	   Peter and his brother, Anton, each struck for an astounding
eight points in Quebec's 11-7 victory over Washington on Feb. 22,
1981, which continues to stand as a league record for most points
in a road game.
	   ``I remember it very vividly because it was our rookie season,''
Stastny said.
	   ``I tell you what, when Washington came to Quebec a month later
we both ended up with zero points because they were focusing on us
so badly.''
	   The Quebec Nordiques are long gone from the NHL, becoming the
Colorado Avalanche in 1995, but Goulet and Stastny represent the
Nordiques' heydey in the 1980s when Quebec had a venomous rivalry
with the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Stastny, 42, and Goulet, 38, will be officially inducted into
the Hall of Fame on Nov. 16, along with Roy Conacher in the
veterans category and Notre Dame College founder Pere Athol Murray
as a builder.
	   The Hall also announced French journalist Yvon Pedneault will be
given the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for hockey writing and
Howie Meeker the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for broadcast
journalism.
	   Stastny was the 1980-81 NHL rookie of the year and he went on to
score 450 goals in 15 seasons for Quebec, New Jersey and St. Louis.
He retired after the 1995 season and currently is a scout for the
Blues.
	   ``It's overwhelming, but humbling,'' Stastny said of his
selection.
	   Stastny made international headlines in 1980 when he, his
pregnant wife and brother Anton fled then-Czechoslovakia under
cover of darkness to play in North America for the Nordiques.
	   The operation, aided and abetted by Nords general manager Marcel
Aubut, was fraught with peril. The brothers actually became
separated in Innsbruck, Austria, before sneaking onto a plane for
Amsterdam and then Canada.
	   The Stastnys were a hit in Quebec and even more so after Peter
and Anton raised about dlrs 30,000 in bribe money to pry their
brother, Marion, out of Czechoslovakia in 1981. The three brothers
played on the same line for a time with the Nordiques and were
popular players at Le Colisee.
	   ``As a fan base, it was unbelievable,'' said Stastny, who along
with his brothers are considered part of the first wave of European
players into the NHL.
	   Goulet spent 11 seasons in Quebec and played alongside Stastny
for 10 of them. A head injury forced Goulet to retire from the
Chicago Blackhawks after the 1994 season.
	   Stastny and Goulet are the fourth set of teammates to be
inducted together in the 1990s. Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and
Bryan Trottier went in in 1997, Montreal's Steve Shutt and Guy
Lapointe in 1993 and the New York Islanders Denis Potvin and Mike
Bossy in 1991.

Tokyo stocks fall, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei's morning close, midday dollar and bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell Thursday morning on renewed
worries recent Russian economic turmoil will negatively affect some
Japanese companies. The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 156.19 points,
1.09 percent, to 14,041.51 at the end of the morning session. On
Wednesday, the Nikkei closed down 29.67 points, or 0.21 percent.
	   The dollar bought 134.14 yen in midday trading, down 0.78 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 134.90 yen overnight.
	   Traders said shares of major Japanese trading houses and other
companies doing business with Russia were among the morning's
losers.
	   Shares of TDK Corp., a major maker of electronic parts, sank 540
yen (dlrs 4), or 5.45 percent, to 9,360 yen (dlrs 70) per share
from Wednesday's close.
	   On Wednesday, TDK said it may face delays in the redemption of
16.31 billion yen (dlrs 121 million) that it had invested in
Russian euroyen bonds, because of the recent economic turmoil.
	   It was not clear how long the repayment delay might be, or how
much of the investment may be lost, the company has said. The bonds
were slated to be redeemed Sept. 31.
	   Earlier in the session, share prices were moderately higher on
hopes that Japan's government will soon agree on a plan to reform
the ailing banking system. But stocks moved into negative territory
toward the morning close on the Russian worries.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party and opposition forces
are nearing an agreement on key components of bank reform bills,
including a plan to rescue the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
media reports said.
	   LTCB shares, which tumbled 13 yen or 34 percent Wednesday, fell
3 yen to 22 yen Thursday. Ruling and opposition parties are likely
to agree to temporarily nationalize the troubled bank, the reports
said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 9.08 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,078.42.
On Monday, the TOPIX closed up 3.34 points, or 0.31 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar initially advanced against the yen after
some market participants interpreted comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan as meaning there would be no interest rate
cuts soon.
	   Greenspan told Congress that the United States was increasingly
at risk of deflation because of the global economic crisis, but
said no interest rate cuts are planned to halt the damaging
effects.
	   But the dollar lost most of its overnight gains in early Asian
trading, though, as optimism over the apparent progress on Japan's
bank bills boosted the yen.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.710 percent from 0.755 on Wednesday, driving its
price up to 115.25 from 114.92 yen.

Rumors of IMF aid give Brazil a boost but markets end down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's largest stock exchange has
rallied nearly 8 percent on news of a possible International
Monetary Fund (IMF) aid package. But the rally lost steam and the
markets closed down slightly.
	   At Wednesday's opening, markets were still buoyed by Finance
Minister Pedro Malan's confirmation Tuesday that Brazil had been
negotiating with the IMF for financial support.
	   In his announcement the minister took pains not to characterize
the package as a bailout similar to those extended to Russia and
several Asian countries.
	   ``The operation is of a preventive nature, because Brazil has
foreign reserves of dlrs 50 billion,'' the O Globo newspaper quoted
Malan as saying.
	   Malan stressed that despite losing over dlrs 20 billion in the
last few weeks as foreign investors unloaded emerging market
stocks, Brazil still had sufficient foreign reserves to fend off a
speculative attack on its currency.
	   For this reason Malan said the package was ``a coordinated
effort in which the IMF would play an important role.''
	   ``It is an historic opportunity to show Brazil, the other
countries in Latin America and the G-7 nations to work in a
coordinated manner to prevent a crisis that would occur if such an
action is not taken,'' Malan was quoted by the O Globo newspaper.
	   Rumors of an IMF package had been circulating since early in the
week and had driven the market up 45 percent over three days. The
three day rally helped scale back losses in a market that at one
point last week lost as much as three quarters of its value since
March.
	   But the mornings optimism tapered off after nothing concrete
emerged later in the day and the market dropped as low as 5.7
percent before coming back to close down 2.1 percent.
	   ``The market rose over the last three days because of hopes of
help from abroad, a financial package,'' said one Sao Paulo trader.
``But has anything been confirmed? No.''

U.S. Open final renews feud among Philippoussis and officialdom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Davis Cup captain John
Newcombe said Thursday an independent party should try to heal the
rift between tennis officials in Australia and U.S. Open runner-up
Mark Philippoussis.
	   Newcombe said he'd lost count of the number of times he had
tried to persuade Philippoussis to return to the Davis Cup team.
	   Newcombe has threatened to quit if his good friend and team
coach Tony Roche resigns because of the row with Philippoussis. He
said a third party, from candidates he would not name, could be the
only solution.
	   The Australian newspaper said Thursday that Roche was on the
verge of quitting over complaints from Philippoussis that Roche was
supporting Pat Rafter when the pair met in the U.S. Open final.
	   During the final, Roche and Newcombe sat in Rafter's player box,
drawing the ire of Philippoussis who felt the two Davis Cup coaches
should have sat in a neutral area.
	   Newcombe was commenting on the rift after a news conference at
Royal Brisbane Hospital on Thursday where U.S. Open winner Rafter
handed over 300,000 Australian dollars (180,000 US dlrs) to the
Starlight Foundation children's charity.
	   The Starlight Foundation provides entertainment, care and
welfare for chronically or terminally ill children.
	   Rafter refused to answer questions about the row with
Philippoussis.
	   Rafter will play for Australia in the Davis Cup match against
Uzbekistan next weekend in Townsville, Australia. (djp)

Lee: Singapore facing most serious economic crisis in 30 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore is grappling with its most serious
economic crisis since the British withdrew their armed forces from
the former colony in 1968, elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew was cited
as saying in a Thursday newspaper.
	   ``The damage to the Indonesian economy and the problems in
Malaysia have made for more concerns'' for neighboring Singapore,
Senior Minister Lee was quoted as saying in The Business Times.
``Their difficulties will affect us through our many trade and
investment links.''
	   Lee, the father of modern Singapore, said late Wednesday that
Singapore would have to cut business costs significantly in order
to restore its competitiveness and control rising unemployment,
according to the report.
	   Since the start of the financial crisis in Asia, Singapore's
currency has weakened considerably less against the U.S. dollar
compared to its neighbors. Also, the cost of doing business in the
city-state had steadily risen to levels higher than its
competitors, even before the crisis.
	   Speaking at an event to launch his controversial memoirs and
celebrate his 75th birthday, Lee explained that simply letting the
Singapore dollar fall to regain competitiveness would not work.
	   The former prime minister said all-round cuts in rents, fees,
taxes, power and telecommunications rates, and wages were required,
reported the daily.
	   ``These adjustments will not solve our problems and cause us to
recover quickly, as happened in 1985'' during the last recession,
Lee was quoted as saying. ``But they are indispensable if Singapore
is to weather the severe difficulties that will last at least a few
years.''
	   He added that the present crisis is more difficult to overcome
because Japan is in recession, leaving only the United States and
the European Union to aid Singapore, according to the newspaper.
	   The huge depreciation in Asian currencies, including the
Indonesian rupiah and the Malaysia ringgit, has made Singapore's
costs _ especially labor _ less competitive than other Asian
countries, said Lee.
	   ``For example, the Japanese are making disk drives in the
Philippines to compete against those made in Singapore, paying
wages and rents in pesos at a fraction of ours,'' he was quoted as
saying in the report.

Two-day meeting on climate change opens in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Environment ministers from 22 countries and the
European Union opened a two-day meeting on Thursday amid calls for
quick implementation of the Kyoto treaty to prevent global warming.
	   The ministers were meeting to discuss ways to stop global
warming and to prepare for the annual United Nations Climate
Convention to be held in November in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
Japan's foreign ministry said in a statement.
	   The meeting was the first of its kind since many of the
officials met last year in Kyoto, Japan and signed a historical
treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
	   In the Kyoto Global Climate Change Treaty, 38 countries
committed to reducing their combined greenhouse gas emissions _
mainly carbon dioxide _ to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008 to
2012.
	   The treaty has yet to be implemented. Some U.S. politicians have
condemned the pact saying it would impose strict restictions on
companies and put Americans out of work.
	   The ministers should agree on a strict deadline of the year 2000
for deciding on rules to implement the treaty to prevent
governments from backsliding on its provisions, the World Wide Fund
for nature said in a statement.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A treaty aimed at eliminating
anti-personnel land mines will take effect in six months, the
United Nations has announced.
	   The announcement Wednesday came after the West African nation of
Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact.
	   The treaty was signed by more than 120 countries at a landmark
meeting in Ottawa in December. Nations that ratify the treaty
pledge to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and
clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years.
	   With Burkina Faso's approval, the treaty will go into force in
March in those 40 countries, U.N. officials said. The pact required
the ratification of forty nations and their legislatures to go into
effect.
	   ``Today, the world has taken a step toward becoming a safer and
more humane place,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a
statement. The treaty ``will have far-reaching implications for
both mine-affected and mine-producing countries.''
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty,
maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are
also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and an estimated 20,000 people are killed or injured
each year, mostly innocent civilians. The mines have also rendered
huge swaths of productive land unusable.
	   Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and
its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122
countries signing the treaty in Ottawa.
	   President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve the
treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up
with an alternative weapon by then. The Pentagon has requested dlrs
4.7 million in the fiscal 1999 budget for the program.
	   One possibility is a weapon that would temporarily disable an
approaching enemy, but not kill. Another involves sensors that warn
of a foe's approach and then trigger weapons.
	   Carol Bellamy, director of the U.N. International Children's
Fund, congratulated the countries that ratified the treaty.
	   ``We stand at an historic moment in the struggle to end the
anguish that these weapons have already inflicted on tens of
thousands of the world's children, their families and their
communities,'' she said in a statement.

Seoul proposes joint North-South Korean teams for international
</HEADLINE>
sporting events

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's president asked the
International Olympic Committee Thursday to help organize single
teams composed of South and North Koreans for the Sydney Olympics
and other major international sports events.
	   President Kim Dae-jung made the request when he met with IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch. Samaranch was in Seoul for an IOC
executive board meeting, timed to coincide with the 10th
anniversary of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
	   ``South Korea wants to take part in international sports events
as a single team with North Korea. For this, I want the IOC to
actively cooperate,'' Kim told Samaranch.
	   Kim's chief spokesman, Park Jie-won, said South Korea's
immediate goal is to organize single teams for the 1999 Asian
Winter Games in South Korea, the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2002
Asian Games in Pusan, South Korea.
	   The South Korean president expressed hope that inter-Korea
sports exchanges would help promote peace on the divided Korean
peninsula, the spokesman said.
	   Samaranch pledged full IOC support for the South Korean efforts,
he said.
	   South Korean officials said Seoul's proposal will be discussed
when Thomas Bach, a German member of the IOC's executive board,
visits North Korea this weekend in an attempt to revive sports
exchanges between the two Koreas.
	   ``We will discuss a possible, IOC-sponsored sporting event
between the two Koreas,'' Bach said in Seoul earlier this week.
	   Bach was being accompanied by three officials from the German
auto giant Daimler Benz, which planned to donate a bus and uniforms
and shoes for North Korean athletes.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war since an armistice,
rather than a peace treaty, ended their 1950-53 conflict. Their
border is sealed, with no mail or other direct means of
communication.
	   In the early 1990s, the Koreas formed single soccer and table
tennis teams for international tournaments. There has been no
sporting exchange between the two Koreas since.

Chinese track champion to attend Colorado State University
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Women's 5,000-meter Olympic champion Wang Junxia
has left China to study at Colorado State University, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Wang, who has not competed since the Atlanta Olympic Games, left
for Fort Collins, Colo., on Wednesday with her husband, Zhan Yu,
the report said.
	   It said Wang planned to resume training in Colorado ``if her
health permits.''
	   Wang holds the world record in the 10,000 event, which she set
at the 1993 World Athletic Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.
	   Initially, she trained under flamboyant coach Ma Junren, whose
runners turned in record-breaking performances during the early
1990s.
	   Wang later switched to a different coach because of disputes
over his strict style and over prize money. She won a gold medal in
the 5,000 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was injured and
returned to the track only late last year.

Mineral imports hit record high in fiscal 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Imports of gold scrap from South
Korea and Indonesia were one of the main contributors to a record
level of mineral imports in fiscal 1997, Australia's government
commodity researcher said Thursday.
	   The latest issue of the Australia Bureau of Agriculture of
Research Economics' (ABARE) Australian Mineral Statistics also
found export earnings by the minerals and energy sector rose 13
percent in the fiscal year ended June 30.
	   ABARE executive director Brian Fisher said mineral imports hit
8.537 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.122 billion) in
fiscal 1997 _ 16 percent higher than the previous year _ with gold
imports surging by 238 percent to 1.402 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 841 million).
	   ``This increase (in gold imports) was largely a result of
significant quantities of gold scrap being imported from South
Korea and Indonesia following the recent financial problems
experienced in those countries,'' Fisher said.
	   By contrast, imports of petroleum products fell by 14 percent or
741 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 444.6 million).
	   Fisher said a rise in export earnings to 40.8 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 24.48 billion) came as a result of the weakening
Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar and higher volumes for
most mineral and energy commodities.

North Korean worker stows away on Russian ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A man claiming to be a defector from
North Korea has surrendered himself after stowing away on a Russian
freighter, police said Thursday.
	   The man, identifying himself as Kim Nam Su, 39, told police he
arrived in the port of Pusan on South Korea's southern coast
Wednesday aboard a Russian ship.
	   Police in Pusan said the man, a warehouse worker in North Korea,
left his communist homeland last October. After staying in China
for two months, he went to Russia's Far East where he sneaked
aboard a ship sailing to South Korea, they said.
	   Nearly 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the
past three years. All reported severe food and fuel shortages in
the reclusive country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945.

 &UR; Rangers 5, Angels 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Arlington, Texas, the Rangers beat the Angels and tied up the
wild AL West.
	   Texas finally caught Anaheim in the standings after trailing for
the last month as Todd Stottlemyre, Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile,
all acquired at the trading deadline exactly for games like this,
led the Rangers.
	   Both teams have 11 games remaining _ four against each other.
	   The Angels had been alone in first place since passing the
Rangers on Aug. 14. Anaheim led by as many as four games on Aug.
26, but have dropped six of their last eight with five coming on
its current seven-game road trip.
	   Stottlemyre (4-4) pitched his best game yet for Texas, allowing
six hits in eight innings. Clayton drove in two runs, scored once
and made a nice defensive play at shortstop and Zeile had an RBI
double.
	   Chuck Finley (11-8) lost for the second time on the trip and for
the third time in three starts this season against Texas.
 &UR; White Sox 9, Royals 4
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle capped a seven-run, seventh-inning
outburst with his 46th homer and set a team record with his 139th
RBI.
	   Belle, who earlier this season broke Frank Thomas' club record
of 41 home runs, surpassed the old White Sox record of 138 RBIs by
Zeke Bonura in 1936.
	   Mike Caruso added a three-run double in the seventh as Chicago
halted Kansas City's four-game winning streak.
	   Jim Abbott (3-0) got the win in his third start of the season,
working seven innings and allowing four runs and six hits.
	   Brian Bevil (3-1) was the loser.

Braves down Phillies; Brewers stop Reds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES from previous cycle with late games; will be updated. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ John Smoltz, tuning up for the postseason,
pitched six shutout innings and Eddie Perez hit a two-run homer as
the Atlanta Braves maintained the best record in the National
League with a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on
Wednesday.
	   Smoltz allowed only three hits before turning over the big lead
to the bullpen. Atlanta came within one out of its second straight
shutout against the Phillies, who managed only three runs in the
three-game series.
	   Perez went 3-for-3 with a single, double and home run and
Chipper Jones hit his 34th homer against Carlton Loewer (6-8).
	   Smoltz (16-3) has won 11 of his last 12 decisions and leads the
league with an .842 winning percentage.
 &UR; Brewers 2, Reds 0
	   In Cincinnati, Bill Pulsipher and four relievers combined on a
five-hitter as Milwaukee posted its second shutout of the season.
	   Pulsipher (3-2) allowed five hits in six innings, struck out
three and walked two. Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his 25th
save.
	   Fernando Vina singled off Brett Tomko (12-12) to lead off the
third and scored on an RBI groundout by Jeff Cirillo. Milwaukee
added another run in the eighth when Cirillo doubled and scored on
Darrin Jackson's two-out, ground-rule double.
 &UR; Expos 3, Marlins 2
	   In Montreal, if it was their curtain call, the Montreal Expos
bowed out in style.
	   In what might have been their last game in Montreal, the Expos
rallied for two runs in the ninth inning on pinch-hit RBIs.
	   Robert Perez hit a pinch RBI single with two outs and Jose Vidro
drove in the winning run with a double to rally the Expos.
	   The Expos' ownership group has set a Sept. 30 deadline to decide
whether sufficient financing is available to build a dlrs 165
million downtown stadium in time for the 2001 season. If they do
not proceed with the project, the team will likely be sold and
moved, possibly before the beginning of next season.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Pirates 0
	   In St. Louis, Jason Christiansen barely avoided giving up Mark
McGwire's 64th home run, too.
	   McGwire, who hit homer No. 63 off Christiansen the previous day,
flied out to the warning track against the Pittsburgh reliever.
	   On Tuesday, McGwire ended his six-game, 18 at-bat homerless
drought with a pinch-hit shot in the ninth inning.
	   This time, McGwire hit a high fly ball that fell short for the
final out in the seventh, stranding two runners.
	   McGwire was 0-for-3 with a walk, his 155th of the season. He
needs 15 walks in the final nine games to tie Babe Ruth's 1923
major league record.
	   McGwire walked in the first, took a called third strike in the
third, and also flied out to center in the sixth.

Malaysia restricts Singapore rescue, military flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Singapore aircraft conducting
search and rescue operations or military training flights will
require case-by-case approval to enter Malaysian air space from
Friday, the Defense Ministry announced.
	   The practice of giving blanket approval for Singapore fighter
jets to traverse Malaysian air space, and for other aircraft to
conduct search and rescue, will be terminated, the ministry said in
a statement carried by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   No explanation was given for the change.
	   The two countries' relations have grown increasingly acrimonious
over the past two weeks in disputes over the location of a railroad
border post, trading of Malaysian currency and stocks in Singapore,
and competition between the two countries' ports.
	   Malaysian leaders, including the defense minister, have reacted
angrily this week to the launch of memoirs by Singapore's senior
minister, Lee Kuan Yew. The book, ``The Singapore Story,'' is
deeply critical of Malaysian leadership.
