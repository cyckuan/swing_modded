	   WOOMERA, Australia (AP) _ Work began Thursday on the world's
first commercial spaceport to launch telecommunications satellites
into low Earth orbit from U.S.-made rockets.
	   Spaceport Woomera, a wholly owned subsidiary of the U.S.-based
Kistler Aerospace Corp., held a ground-breaking ceremony attended
by representatives from the federal government, the South
Australian state government and local Aboriginal groups.
	   The spaceport will be the base for the world's first fully
reusable launch vehicle, the Kistler K-1.
	   Spaceport Woomera chairman Robert Wang said Woomera is an
``ideal site'' for the two-stage, reusable rocket because it needs
a large recovery range.
	   Woomera, an Australian military base used in the 1950s and 1960s
as a missile test range for the U.S. and British space programs,
and more recently for launches by European and Japanese space
consortiums, covers 49,000 square miles (127,000 sq. km.)
	   Both rocket stages descend under parachutes and deploy air bags
for a soft landing.
	   The rocket is built in the United States by contractors
including Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, and is powered by
three Russian NK-33 engines.
	   The spaceport is due for completion late this year when test
flights will be conducted, with the first commercial payload to be
launched in 1999.
	   The rocket can loft a 10,000-pound (4,500-kilo) payload of up to
three satellites at a time.
	   Wang said Kistler had taken significant strides in the past six
months but Thursday's ceremony was an important transition.
	   ``Moving this project from concept to construction in such a
short time is a testament to the determination and commitment of
the many parties in helping us establish Woomera as the world's
first fully-dedicated commercial satellite launch site,'' Wang
said.
	   Wang said he believes 1,400 private satellites will be launched
into low-Earth orbit over the next 10 years.
	   He said Kistler will be able to launch a satellite for U.S. dlrs
17 million, compared for 20 million for a Chinese or Russian
launch, 35 to 50 million for a U.S.-based launch, or 400 million
for a space shuttle deployment.

Chang, Agassi advance at Legg Mason Classic

 &UR; Eds: Updates with Chang match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Top-seeded Michael Chang and No. 2 Andre
Aggasi breezed to second-round victories Wednesday night in the
Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   Chang defeated Michael Sell 6-2, 6-3 and Agassi continued his
success against David Wheaton with a 6-4, 6-2 victory.
	   Chang is a two-time defending champion of the tournament, but
knee and wrist injuries have prevented him from winning on the tour
this year.
	   ``My biggest opponent has been the injuries,'' said Chang, who
had been fairly free of injuries before this year. ``It's a little
bit new for me. Maybe it has to do with El Nino or something.''
	   ``We've grown up together. ... There is no guesswork at what's
going to take place out there. Just go out and see who executes,''
said Agassi, who has won five straight from Wheaton and is 6-3
overall in the series.
	   Agassi, a three-time Legg Mason champion, feasted on Wheaton's
second serve, winning 17 of 30 points.
	   Fresh from helping the U.S. Davis Cup team defeat Belgium over
the weekend, Agassi heads into the summer hardcourt season with
confidence.
	   ``I feel great about my game,'' Agassi said.
	   Agassi's Davis Cup teammate, Jim Courier, beat the heat and
Marcos Ondruska of South Africa.
	   The seventh-seeded Courier beat Ondruska 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (8-6) in
an afternoon match played in muggy conditions with a heat index of
110 degrees (43 degrees Celsius).
	   ``It becomes a survival test more than anything else,'' Courier
said. ``Both of us were trying to keep the points short.''
	   Courier managed the conditions better than Wade McGuire.
	   McGuire was scheduled to resume his first-round match against
Jimmy Arias on Wednesday morning, but was unable to after being
hospitalized for six hours Tuesday night because of heat
exhaustion.
	   McGuire dropped the first set to Arias 6-4 Tuesday, but was
leading 5-2 in the second when a storm knocked out the power at the
FitzGerald Tennis Center.
	   Battling severe dehydration after the postponement, McGuire had
to be taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was given
intravenous fluids.
	   ``It was really a frightening experience for me,'' McGuire said.
	   Arias, who turns 34 next month, was playing his first tour event
in four years. Third-seed Wayne Ferreira cut Arias' comeback bid
short with a 6-1, 6-2 victory Wednesday night.
	   ``I'm better at hitting the ball now, but physically I'm
worse,'' said Arias.
	   Arias, bothered by sore neck and ribs, wouldn't mind playing
another tournament this summer but his next stop is likely the
senior circuit.
	   The fans appreciated Arias' on-the-court friendly demeanor. The
same couldn't be said for ninth-seed Jeff Tarango, who lost to
Canadian Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Tarango had a racket-throwing tantrum in the second set over
line calls and directed a verbal assault at the chair umpire prior
to set point.
	   Other seeds bounced Wednesday included eighth-seed Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands, who was beaten by qualifier Maurice
Ruah of Venezuela, and 10th-seed Andrew Ilie of Australia, who fell
to American Justin Gimelstob.

Analysts say loss-ridden Thai banks may be nationalized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Heavy losses reported by Thai banks for
the first half of 1998 could signal a new wave of central bank
takeovers as several institutions in dire need of capital appear to
have nowhere else to turn, analysts said Thursday.
	   Buckling under the weight of Thailand's economic crisis, all of
the country's 15 commercial banks reported massive losses this
week. The banks lost in total at least 113 billion baht (dlrs 2.75
billion) for the first half of the year.
	   Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's Gerard Kruithof told Dow Jones
Newswires that the losses have wiped out a significant portion of
the capital base of most of the country's 15 commercial banks.
	   ``The extent of the losses will force all Thai banks, with the
exception of Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank, into an urgent
recapitalization,'' Kruithof said.
	   Even two commercial banks that have already found foreign
buyers, Thai Danu Bank and Bank of Asia, will have to raise new
funds, he said.
	   But for several of the weaker banks, a window of opportunity to
raise funds through private placements or strategic partnerships
appears to have closed with the announcement of first half results,
Kruithof said.
	   ``You have to ask, where will they get the money? And the answer
is the government,'' he said. ``I can foresee that more banks will
be nationalized''
	   Four banks _ Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, First Bangkok City Bank,
Siam City Bank and Bangkok Bank of Commerce _ were taken over by
the central bank early this year.
	   Thailand's banking and finance sector was once the rock-solid
base of the economy. But overzealous lending left many in bad shape
when property developers and exporters, both hit by slumps, could
not repay.
	   Making matters worse, Thailand floated its currency, the baht,
in July 1997. It fell sharply, inflating the value of loans the
banks and finance companies borrowed from international lenders.
	   Of the country's 93 finance companies, 56 were shut down by the
government earlier this year. Thailand is now receiving a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout of its economy supervised by the International
Monetary Fund.
	   With the economy expected to contract by 5 to 7 percent this
year, analysts said they had underestimated the extent of
competition for deposits in the midst of a severe recession.

New U.S. ambassador arrives to fill sensitive post in Mexico

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow has
taken his place in one of America's most sensitive embassy posts, a
job that has been vacant for more than a year.
	   Davidow arrived Wednesday night, two months after a DEA
money-laundering investigation of Mexican banks sparked government
protests over what the Mexico described as an affront to the
country's sovereignty.
	   ``Yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, when she
swore me in, noted that there is no country in the world with which
the United States has a more important bilateral relationship,''
Davidow said after he arrived at Mexico City's international
airport aboard a commercial flight from Washington, D.C..
	   ``My wife Joan and I are extraordinary pleased to be here in
Mexico,'' a smiling but tired-looking Davidow said. He refused to
take questions from reporters assembled at the airport.
	   He said he would present his credentials to the administration
of President Ernesto Zedillo before making further statements to
the press.
	   Relations between the U.S. and Mexico, long subject to concerns
about U.S. anti-drug certifications and other matters, have come
under increased strain since former Ambassador James Jones left the
American Embassy in June of last year.
	   Mexican officials were caught by surprise last May when the U.S.
Treasury and Justice Departments announced the results of a
money-laundering sting code-named Operation Casablanca, which led
to the indictment of three Mexican banks.
	   The disclosure that U.S. Customs agents had carried out part of
the sting operation in Mexico without the government's
authorization annoyed the Zedillo administration.
	   President Bill Clinton expressed regret to Zedillo about the
secrecy of the operation, which was carried out over three years.
Keeping Mexico uninformed about the operation was deemed necessary
to protect the agents.
	   ``Ambassador Davidow will have plenty of work to do, especially
after 'Operation Casablanca','' said analyst Joel Estudillo of the
Mexican Institute for Political Studies. ``The situation is very
complex, although not as tense as newspapers claim.''
	   Davidow, a career diplomat who previously served in U.S.
Embassies in Chile, Guatemala and Venezuela, will find Mexico's
political landscape to be very different from the one his
predecessors encountered.
	   Mexico has been ruled uninterruptedly by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, since the party was created in 1929 to
consolidate power following a bloody, decade-long revolution.
	   But the PRI's grip on power is showing signs of aging. Last
year, it lost its majority in the lower house of Congress for the
first time in its history, leading to a new balance of power that
gave opposition parties greater leverage.
	   The PRI remains strong in many states, but the opposition sees
the 2000 elections as the first real opportunity to wrest the
presidency away from the long-ruling party.
	   ``Davidow's greatest challenge will be his ability to understand
the exceptional situation in which Mexico finds itself,'' said
Sergio Aguayo, a political science professor at El Colegio de
Mexico.

Thai military posts profit from mosquito repellent sales to

Malaysia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's cash-strapped Ministry of
Defense made a profit of more than 200 million baht (dlrs 4.8
million) this year selling mosquito repellent to neighboring
Malaysia, local papers reported Thursday.
	   The Thai military has been forced to accept budget cuts because
of the country's economic crisis, and the defense ministry has been
searching for alternate sources of income.
	   Thailand and Malaysia contain pockets of forest where malaria, a
mosquito-borne disease, is still a threat.
	   The repellent is made by the military's pharmaceutical plant and
the sale of each lot needs Cabinet approval, said Defense Permanent
Secretary Yuthasak Sasiprap, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   Yuthasak also said the ministry was profiting by selling
explosives to Malaysia and other countries, although he did not
give details.

Scientists say that men exposed to radiation could pass on
</HEADLINE>
increased risk of leukemia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Scientists have found that a group of
mice exposed to radiation passed on an increased risk of leukemia
to their offspring, according to research published Wednesday.
	   Brian Lord, head of a research team at the Paterson Institute
for Cancer Research in Manchester, northwest England, said that
although more work was needed, research carried out on mice exposed
to radiation suggested that it could damage offspring if a second
cancer trigger was also present in the offspring. Lord's research
was published this week in the British Journal of Cancer.
	   ``What it does show us, for the first time, is a potential way
in which paternal irradiation can lead to an increase in leukemia
risk for the next generation. It shows us how DNA defects can be
passed from generation to generation,'' he said.
	   Researchers independent of the British study said they were
skeptical that cases of childhood leukemia could be connected to
fathers' radiation exposure.
	   Scientists in Britain have been debating whether radiation
causes childhood leukemia for many years. A controversial study in
1990 claimed that a cluster of leukemia cases in northern England
resulted from parents working at the Sellafield nuclear power plant
in Cumbria, northwest England. Other studies of atomic bomb
survivors and people who have had radiotherapy found no evidence to
support the theory.
	   In the journal, Lord said that research was carried out on 40
mice, with half of them injected with plutonium-239 three months
before being mated with healthy females. Plutonium-239 is used in
the production of nuclear weapons.
	   Their offspring were then injected with a second cancer-causing
agent and monitored for the onset of leukemia and lymphoma. The
mice injected with plutonium had DNA damage in their bone marrow
and passed some of the damage on to cells in their offspring,
increasing their vulnerability.
	   Leukemia developed earlier and more frequently in those affected
cells when the mice were exposed to a second cancer-causing
chemical than in normal mice exposed to the same chemical.
	   Lord said that although this alone was not enough to cause
leukemia in its offspring, it nearly doubled vulnerability to the
disease.
	   Dr. Michael Thun, chief of epidemiological research for the
American Cancer Society, said he had not read the study and was
reluctant to comment directly. He said the question of radiation
affecting the fathers' sperm was ``scientifically interesting,''
but had little practical importance to patients at this time.
	   ``The way to avoid cancer is not to worry about your father's
occupational exposure,'' he said. ``It's likely that what you do in
life would be much more harmful and contribute to your risk of
getting cancer.''

Leader flexes electoral muscle as supporters arrive in capital

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In a show of strength, Cambodian
leader Hun Sen mustered convoys of trucks and thousands of
supporters to parade through the capital Thursday to demonstrate
his political dominance three days before the country votes in
parliamentary elections.
	   But Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-premier Hun Sen deposed in
a coup last year, demonstrated his continued personal popularity in
a surprise visit to the capital's main market. He was mobbed by
enthusiastic vendors and shoppers who knocked over goods and
smashed glass booths as they crushed into the narrow aisles.
	   Cambodia's senior Buddhist monk meanwhile led a chant for peace
to calm nerves frayed by the violence-marred campaign. Opposition
activists have been reported murdered daily, and fear is widespread
that Hun Sen would call out the army to retain power if the vote
goes against him. He denies it.
	   At least four motorcades comprising more than 200 trucks drove
through Phnom Penh in the morning, rolling past the fairy-tale
Royal Palace and along the Bassac river with bullhorns blaring
slogans for the ruling Cambodian People's Party. Supporters waved
flags and shouted, ``Chai-yo!'' or ``Bravo!''
	   Party officials said they were part of a larger demonstration to
put 11 separate convoys totalling 743 trucks and some 28,000
supporters from Kandal province, which surrounds Phnom Penh, on the
roads. Not all the convoys were intended to go through the capital.
Each supporter was paid 10,000 riels (about dlrs 2.50).
	   The motorcades demonstrated Hun Sen's unrivalled party
organization in the provinces, but generated little enthusiasm
among people in the capital, where memories remain fresh of tank
and mortar from last year's takeover.
	   By contrast, Ranariddh's appearance at the Central Market
resembled the arrival of a rock star. Surrounded by bodyguards to
make room to breathe, the prince was doused in sweat as he greeted
mobs of vendors and shoppers pushing forward to see and touch him.
Glass display cases were smashed by people crushing forward.
	   The cases would normally have contained gold, but nervous
traders have closed this week amid fears of a wave of kidnappings
and possible post-election violence.
	   Exuding optimism, Ranariddh said: ``I feel very encouraged, not
only here in Phnom Penh, but all over.''
	   While he was confident Cambodians around the country would
support his royalist FUNCINPEC party, he was worried that Hun Sen's
control of the electoral machinery would lead to rampant cheating.
	   ``We have to be absolutely cautious about counting to prevent
cheating,'' Ranariddh said. ``I am still worried about what will
happen after election day.''
	   Election results are not expected to be announced until a week
after the ballot. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, the other main
challenger, fear Hun Sen will arrange the count to ensure he
remains in power. If he cannot, they fear, he may disqualify or
arrest his opponents or call out the military.
	   Earlier, Buddhist patriarch Maha Ghosanada, who has been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for heading peace marches
through war-torn territory, led several score monks and nuns in a
chant and three minutes of meditation for a peaceful election.
	   The ceremony, just outside the capital, was attended by Chheng
Pong, head of the National Election Committee, high-ranking U.N.
officials and several ambassadors, including those of the United
States, Japan, Singapore, Russia and several hundred others.
	   Ranariddh's party finished atop U.N.-sponsored elections backed
by 20,000 peacekeepers in 1993, but he was forced to share power
when Hun Sen threatened civil war.
	   Hun Sen has led the country for most of years since 1985, when
he came to power under the harsh Vietnamese military occupation
that succeeded the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime.

Rover expected to announce cuts in reaction to strong sterling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rover was expected to set out plans Thursday to
cut up to 3,000 jobs and put workers on a four-day week as BMW, its
German parent company, embarks on a major cost-cutting program,
according to a report in The Times.
	   The plan was scheduled to be announced later on Thursday, when
BMW unveils its half-year results, the newspaper reported.
	   Britain's biggest car producer was expected to blame the
strength of the pound for the cutbacks, the newspaper reported,
saying the company has canceled plans to recruit more than 1,000
workers for the production of its new model and will slash more
than 1,500 existing jobs.
	   Employees are to be asked to back plans to put many production
lines on a four-day week as Rover, which employs 39,000 workers,
faces tough export markets, The Times said.
	   The company, which operates a four-and-a-half-day week, wants to
store up unworked hours and then make extra demands on staff when
production recovers, the newspaper said.
	   The company called in union leaders Wednesday to set out its
package, the newspaper added.
	   BMW has called for changes at the British company it bought four
years ago after it became clear that Rover was going to miss its
target of braking even by 2000, The Times said.
	   Later this year Rover will unveil its new model, the R40 salon.
The car will be the first salon development since BMW bought Rover
and was to have been a prestigious occasion, the newspaper said.

Moody's says some Japan government debt could be downgraded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, quotes; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing profound weaknesses in the Japanese economy,
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. said Thursday
that it has placed some Japanese government debt on review for a
possible downgrade.
	   The move could lead to a lower credit rating for Japan, meaning
the government would have to pay higher interest rates to borrow on
international markets, exacerbating the country's mounting budget
deficit as it struggles with its worst recession since the end of
World War II.
	   ``The review is prompted by deep, structural problems in Japan's
economy that have defied conventional policy remedies and an
apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a medium-term
strategy for implementing structural reform and for managing the
economy,'' Moody's said.
	   The announcement, which specifically could lead to a lower
credit rating for Japan's triple-A sovereign ceiling ratings for
foreign currency-denominated debt and yen-denominated debt,
triggered a sharp rise in the dollar against the Japanese yen,
while Japanese bond prices were lower in Singapore trade. The
dollar rose above 142 yen for the first time since July 13.
	   The move comes several months after the U.S.-based ratings
agency changed its ``stable'' outlook for Japan's economy to
``negative'' in April, signaling that it might lower its appraisal
of Japan's ability to repay its debts.
	   Moody's also cited ``a public sector fiscal problem that, unlike
most other highly-rated countries, will likely continue to worsen
over the medium term, and signs of weakening in Japan's external
position.''
	   Of particular concern, the rating agency said, is the potential
for volatile portfolio shifts into foreign currency assets by
Japanese residents as the country implements a series of financial
reforms know as the ``Big Bang.''
	   Moody's did, however, say that Japan has considerable strengths,
including very high income and savings, the capacity to absorb
economic shocks, and a formidable manufacturing sector that has
retained its international competitiveness despite the appreciation
of the yen in the past decade.
	   ``The country's strong external payments position is reflected
in the considerable net foreign asset position of the Bank of Japan
and the commercial banking system,'' the rating agency said.
	   The review will focus on the effects of possible policy
responses for the long-term strength of Japan's fiscal and external
payments position, and how such developments could affect the
banking sector's intrinsic strength, which Moody's considers to be
much weaker than other countries rated triple-A.
	   As a result of this review, the triple-A-rated foreign currency
securities issued by the following institutions are also on review
for possible downgrade: Japan Development Bank, Japan Finance
Corporation for Municipal Enterprises, Export Import Bank of Japan,
Metropolis of Tokyo, Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric
Power Co., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., and Tokyo Electric
Power Co.

Icebreaker stricken by engine fire must abandon Antarctic mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ An Australian icebreaker disabled by an
engine room fire will abandon its pioneering mid-winter expedition
and struggle home through Antarctic sea ice on one engine.
	   Fire erupted Tuesday night in a main engine of the Aurora
Australis, and the ship remained in trouble about 115 miles (185
kilometers) from the Antarctic continent, Australian Antarctic
Division director Rex Moncur said Thursday.
	   The crew overnight started two auxiliary generators to provide
the ship with heating and light, Moncur said.
	   The 54 expeditioners and 25 crew were without heat for the first
24 hours, and had to wear heavy clothing, Moncur said.
	   The fire was in one of the ship's two main engines and there
would be no attempt to re-start the engine.
	   Contact had been made with other Antarctic nations in case help
was needed, he said.
	   Only the French, whose expedition ship L'Astrolabe was in
Hobart, were in a position to help.
	   However he was confident the Aurora could return to Hobart on
one engine.
	   The Aurora left Hobart last Wednesday for a seven-week voyage
that was to have focused on a polynya, an area where savage winds
break up the sea ice and cause heavy, salt-laden water to sink to
the bottom.
	   Oceanographers believe a closer study of the phenomenon would
bring a better understanding of climate change and how the sea
absorbs carbon gases from the atmosphere.
	   The study had to be done in winter, hence the Aurora's first
mid-winter voyage to the Antarctic continent.
	   It was very disappointing that such an ambitious project had to
be abandoned, at least for this year, Moncur said.
	   It was too early to know if the fire would affect the ship's
spring program, he said.

Two American naval men missing in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two American naval men have disappeared
in Thailand, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday, and local papers are
reporting that a large amount of cash from their ship vanished with
them.
	   An embassy spokesperson said the two men, John Pizzifred and
Roger Chain of the USS Thach, have not been officially declared
deserters because they have not been missing for 30 days. The two
disappeared sometime in June.
	   At the moment they are ``absent without authorization,'' said
the spokesperson on condition of anonymity.
	   The Bangkok Post newspaper reported Thursday that the men took
dlrs 16,897 in cash from the ship. The paper cited naval officers
as saying Chain has access to cash in his job as an agent cashier.
	   Pizzifred, 20, and Chain, 32, are both from California, the
paper said.
	   Embassy officials said they weren't sure where the sailors
disappeared, but naval vessels usually dock at Pattaya, 110
kilometers (68 miles) south of Bangkok.
	   Pattaya is known as a center of prostitution, drug trafficking
and other crimes. Several dozen foreigners have been murdered or
drugged and robbed there during the past few years.
	   The Post quoted friends and relatives of the missing seamen in
California as saying they didn't believe the two would desert.

Newspaper: Prince Harry meets his Camilla Parker Bowles for first
</HEADLINE>
time

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Both of Prince Charles' children now have met his
longtime companion, Camilla Parker Bowles, according to a report
Thursday in The Sun tabloid newspaper.
	   The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana met for tea
with Mrs. Parker Bowles at his father's country home, Highgrove,
Britain's biggest selling tabloid reported in a front-page ``world
exclusive,'' headlined ``When Harry met Cammi.''
	   A royal spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
	   Two weeks ago, Prince Charles' spokesman confirmed a report in
The Sun that Mrs. Parker Bowles had met Prince William, 16, for the
first time when the young prince came home unexpectedly June 12.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles, 50, was there on a regular visit and Prince
Charles, realizing they might bump into each other, asked Prince
William if he wanted to meet her, The Sun had said. Prince William,
16, agreed and the three had an amicable half-hour of small talk.
	   At that time, it was considered that a meeting with 13-year-old
Prince Harry would follow soon, if he wanted it to.
	   The teatime meeting between the younger prince and the woman in
his father's life for the last 25 years was attended by Prince
William and Prince Charles, who were there to help break the ice,
the newspaper said. It did not say exactly when the meeting took
place, only that it occurred within days of news of the encounter
with William becoming public July 9.
	   Attempts by Prince Charles, 49, to introduce the British public
to Mrs. Parker Bowles were put on hold when Princess Diana died in
a Paris car crash in August. Diana had blamed Mrs. Parker Bowles
for the breakup of her marriage.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles, 50, then disappeared from public view,
fearful she would be treated as a scapegoat.
	   Prince Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles, who is now divorced,
first met in their 20s. Princess Diana maintained that Charles
never really gave up the relationship, but he indicated that he was
faithful after his 1981 marriage to Diana until relations broke
down following the birth of Harry.
	   On July 10, The Sun called on Prince Charles to show the nation
he loved Mrs. Parker Bowles, saying: ``It is time for Charles to
put public opinion to the test. Clearly, a love that lasts more
than two decades _ and survives both marrying someone else along
the way _ is very, very special.''
	   Support from Britain's powerful tabloid newspapers could be key
in successfully making Mrs. Parker Bowles a public figure.

<TEXT>
	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ Eighteen years may have eased
some of the pain at the deaths of four U.S. churchwomen raped and
murdered by Salvadoran national guardsmen in 1980, but the parole
of three of five of the killers still stirs anger.
	   Professing innocence, a third national guardsman convicted of
raping and killing the three U.S. nuns and a layworker walked free
from prison Wednesday as church leaders worried that the truth
about who ordered the killings may never be known.
	   After years of investigations, ``we still haven't found out the
truth,'' said Rev. Paul Schindler, who worked with the murdered
women in El Salvador.
	   ``We lost a great opportunity to make progress in justice and to
know the historical truth,'' said Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary
bishop of San Salvador.
	   Five national guardsmen were convicted of kidnapping, raping and
killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Maura Clark and Dorothy Kazel
and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980. The women were
suspected of sympathizing with leftist rebels in the 1980-1992
civil war.
	   The crimes caused outrage in the United States, which strongly
supported the Salvadoran government during the 1980-1992 civil war.
About 70,000 people died, many at the hands of military-backed
death squads.
	   Daniel Canales, the former guardsman released Wednesday, told
reporters that he would cooperate with investigators.
	   In a nervous, subdued voice, Canales reiterated his innocence
before television cameras and microphones. While Canales has
admitted that he was at the murder scene, he has insisted he did
not participate.
	   Despite church fears that the releases mean he and his former
fellow guardsmen cannot be compelled to testify more, Canales
promised to help reveal who ordered the killings.
	   Canales said the low-ranking guardsmen ``were executing orders
of superiors.''
	   The masterminds of the crime ``were at the top and they could
not fall, so they had to make (a cover-up) so that the weakest
would pay for this crime,'' he said.
	   After speaking to reporters, Canales went to a parish church in
Quezaltepeque, where he gave thanks for his release.
	   Only the leader of the squad, Sgt. Luis Colindres, is alleged to
know where the orders came from. On his release Tuesday, he said he
was innocent and denied any knowledge of such orders. Also released
Tuesday was former guardsman Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura.
	   ``I have always been innocent in the case,'' Colindres told
reporters. ``I cannot tell you anything.''
	   Asked who had ordered the slayings, he replied, ``How do you
know they gave me that order?''
	   Canales and the two guardsmen freed Tuesday were released under
a new law to ease prison overcrowding after serving almost 18 years
of their 30-year sentences. A judge declared two others ineligible,
one because of a weapons charge and the other because of his
participation in a prison riot.
	   Schindler expressed anger that the U.S. immigration system turns
back ``people who are fleeing for their lives,'' while two former
Salvadoran officials believed to have covered up the killings have
been allowed to live in the United States.
	   A 1993 U.N. report determined that the two men _ former national
guard director, Col. Eugenio Vides Casanova, and Defense Minister
Jose Guillermo Garcia tried to cover up the killings, and that
Vides Casanova knew the guardsmen had acted on the orders of
superiors.
	   ``It seems that the cover-up has continued,'' Therese Howard, a
spokeswoman for the Maryknoll order in the United States, said by
telephone. Two of the victims were Maryknoll nuns.

Philippine Airlines to proceed with flights despite strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with President Estrada telling union that strike is
affecting the whole country in grafs 9-10; arrival of ASEAN
ministers in 11th graf; trims
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines Inc. said
Thursday it plans to fly all of its scheduled flights despite a
strike by its ground personnel.
	   PAL said about 85 percent of its 9,000 remaining employees
reported for work Wednesday after the ground crew union launched
its strike. All 19 domestic and six international flights
eventually took off, although some after substantial delays, it
said.
	   President Joseph Estrada met with union leaders for about six
hours Wednesday night while other senior officials talked with
airline executives to try to forge a compromise.
	   The striking ground personnel are demanding the reinstatement of
5,000 workers who were laid off by the airline under a massive
retrenchment program triggered by a 22-day pilots' strike last
month.
	   Avelino Zapanta, senior vice president of the airline, said a
dialog with the union is continuing.
	   ``Management has drafted a proposal to settle the problem and
it's now in the hands of the union,'' he said. The proposal
includes an indefinite suspension of the layoffs, he said.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos, who threatened Wednesday to
shut down the airline, was considerably more conciliatory Thursday.
	   ``We have to exchange blows with management to send our message
across,'' he said. ``Like a fight between brothers, we exchange
blows not to kill but to let off steam and then later reconcile.''
	   Estrada said he told the union leaders the strike was hurting
the entire economy, with hotel occupancy dropping below 15 percent
in the central resort city of Cebu.
	   ``I told them that if it is possible, we should solve this
problem in the soonest time,'' he said.
	   The strike came as foreign ministers from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations started arriving in Manila for annual
meetings. They will be joined Monday by Cabinet officials from 10
other countries, including the United States, Japan, China and
Europe.
	   PAL has branded the ground crew strike illegal because it was
prohibited by labor authorities who assumed jurisdiction over the
dispute on July 10, five days after the start of the pilots'
strike.
	   The pilots' walkout was a devastating blow to the already
deteriorating financial condition of the 57-year-old airline,
Asia's oldest.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on about dlrs 2 billion
of debt and is discussing a rehabilitation program with Manila's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The plan includes layoffs, the disposal of most of the airline's
planes, and a sharp reduction of flights.
	   SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay expressed pessimism Wednesday over
whether that plan would be viable with the strike by ground
personnel.

IBM, Mexico City reach agreement over alleged computer contract
</HEADLINE>
fraud &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ International Business Machines Corp.'s
Mexican unit has agreed to pay monetary and in-kind reparations to
the Mexico City prosecutor's office for alleged fraud in the
delivery of a computer database.
	   The agreement, announced Wednesday by Mexico City Attorney
General Samuel Del Villar, was signed Tuesday, the Azteca
television network reported.
	   Under the terms of the deal, Del Villar said IBM will provide
free services until 2000 and make 12 monthly payments of 406,525 to
his office. He estimated the total value of the reparations package
at over 37 million.
	   Del Villar said IBM also accepted responsibility for
irregularities in the dlrs 27.7 million computer contract for a
data base on crimes and criminals.
	   The agreement will not end criminal proceedings brought in June
against three IBM officials and 19 former city officials accused of
helping the company illegally win the contract without putting it
up for public bid, Del Villar said.
	   The suspects face two criminal counts. If found guilty, they are
subject to up to 19 years in prison, but the agreement would settle
any fines they might be sentenced to.
	   The city's judicial police announced in May they would abandon
the computer system. ``Instead of helping us improve our system, it
made things worse,'' Del Villar said. ``It never worked.''

Economic plan emphasizes price, currency stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED with comment, detail from Daim.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's economic recovery
program unveiled Thursday emphasizes price and currency stability,
the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The recovery plan was put together over the last seven months by
the National Economic Action Council, which was conceived by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad as a means of rapidly addressing the
country's economic problems.
	   Bernama released details of the recovery program ahead of a
presentation by the NEAC's executive director, special economics
minister Daim Zainuddin.
	   ``All the actions that have been agreed to must be implemented
without any undue delay,'' the recovery plan said, according to
Bernama.
	   In releasing the National Economic Recovery Plan, the council
outlined six objectives for economic rehabilitation: stabilizing
the ringgit; restoring market confidence; maintaining financial
market stability; strengthening economic fundamentals; continuing
the equity and affirmative action program for indigenous Malays;
and restoring the adversely affected sectors.
	   The NEAC conceded that some unanticipated problems may surface
at the implementation stage, but added these problems must be
overcome with the minimum amount of delay.
	   ``These problems must not be allowed to accumulate and fester,''
Bernama quoted the report as saying.
	   The progress of the plan should be reassessed before the
finalization of the 1999 Budget in December. After that, it will be
reviewed quarterly.
	   To steady the currency, which has lost around 40 percent of its
value in the last year, an appropriate exchange-rate regime needs
to be chosen while over-dependence on the dollar for trade issues
must be reduced, Bernama reported.
	   Currency stability also requires an adoption of a balanced
interest-rate policy, as well as an increase in Malaysia's foreign
reserves, the government-owned news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   In San Francisco, Bobby Witt threw five solid innings for his
first NL victory since 1995 and Gary Gaetti hit a two-run homer for
St. Louis.
	   Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 43 homers, went 0-for-4
for St. Louis. He grounded into a double play in the first, struck
out looking in the third, flied to right in the sixth and popped to
third in the eighth.
	   Witt, starting in place of the injured Juan Acevedo, allowed two
runs on four hits, walked three and struck out four. He was making
his first start for the Cardinals since being acquired in a June 22
trade with Texas.
	   Witt (1-1), who spent the 1996-97 with the Rangers, got his
previous NL victory while pitching for the Florida Marlins.
	   Gaetti hit his 10th homer in the second. Brian Jordan led off
the fourth with his 17th homer.
	   Kirk Rueter (10-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Dodgers 6, Astros 4 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Charles Johnson quickly won back Dodgers fans
with a home run after committing a baserunning blunder.
	   Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros homered on consecutive pitches by
Jose Lima in the fifth inning and Brian Bohanon (3-6) earned his
first victory in three starts with the Dodgers since coming over in
a trade with the New York Mets.
	   Karros went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
	   Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth inning for his 28th save.
	   Johnson stood at home plate on a popup he hit down the
left-field line in the second, and didn't run until two Astros
collided and let the ball drop. An embarrassed Johnson settled for
a single instead of a double as the home crowd of 31,365 booed.
	   Johnson won them over in the fourth when he a 1-1 pitch from
Lima (8-6) into the left-field bullpen for his 14th homer.
 &UR; Padres 9, Diamondbacks 3 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Greg Vaughn hit his 36th homer, a three-run shot,
and Andy Ashby tied for the NL lead with his 14th victory.
	   Vaughn, who also singled and scored twice, hit his sixth homer
in nine games to give the Padres a 6-1 lead in the third. The
Padres (66-35) won for the ninth time in 11 games to move 31 games
above .500 for the first time in franchise history.
	   In his last nine games, Vaughn has gone 16-for-32 with 14 RBIs
and 14 runs scored.
	   Wally Joyner also hit a three-run homer for the Padres, a shot
in the first off Willie Blair (4-14).
	   Ashby (14-5), who has won nine of his last 10 decisions, tied
Atlanta's Tom Glavine for the NL lead in victories. He allowed one
run and five hits in six innings.

Tehran mayor awaits verdict in politically charged case

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor returned to court
Thursday to hear the verdict in his corruption trial that has come
to symbolize a power struggle between hard-liners and moderates in
Iran's ruling clergy.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi stood in the dock as a court official
read a 39-page report repeating the charges that were heard during
the month-long trial against the suspended mayor.
	   Hundreds of journalists were crammed in the court at the Imam
Khomeini Judicial Complex.
	   Outside, police and firefighters were on alert in case the
verdict sparks violent protests in favor of the popular mayor.
Riots broke out in Tehran when he was arrested in April.
	   Court sources said the mayor was likely to receive a long prison
sentence and huge fines. He would also be barred from holding
public office for several years, they said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The trial, which has gripped Iran since it opened June 7, is
widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in the government to
topple key officials allied with the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   Karbaschi ran the campaign that got Khatami elected with a
landslide in the May 1997 election.
	   Karbaschi was accused of embezzling millions of dollars in
public funds, in part to finance Khatami's campaign.
	   He has admitted to making mistakes but denied that he ever stole
money from the government.
	   The trial was also replete with drama: Karbaschi accused the
judge, who is also the prosecutor, of being unfair by refusing to
call witnesses he had requested, and for the lengths the court had
gone to investigate him.
	   During his final address on July 11, Karbaschi broke down after
telling the court that a teenage girl had sent him two gold coins
as a contribution to his defense expenses. They were her life's
savings, and she had not provided her name and address, he said.
	   The gesture provided evidence of the considerable support that
Karbaschi wields, in part because he is an ally of the hugely
popular Khatami.
	   The president is trying to loosen almost two decades of social
and political restrictions imposed by the clergy who took power in
the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.
	   But he has faced stiff opposition from the hard-liners who are
backed by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Besides initiating the trial against Karbaschi, the hard-liners
recently impeached the interior minister, another Khatami ally. But
in a bid to avoid a confrontation, they approved Wednesday another
of Khatami's nominee for the post.

Moody's says some Japan government debt could be downgraded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a blow to Japan's position as the economic
anchor of Asia, credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc.
on Thursday put Tokyo on notice that it may downgrade its rating
for Japan's government debt.
	   A downgrade would mean Japan's government will have to pay
higher interest rates to borrow on international markets,
exacerbating the country's mounting budget deficit as it struggles
with its worst recession since the end of World War II.
	   Though the move wouldn't put Japan's credit rating anywhere near
the junk-bond status of neighbors like Indonesia and Thailand, the
announcement raises deeper concerns about Japan's ability to pull
itself out of the economic slump and help the rest of Asia.
	   ``The review is prompted by deep, structural problems in Japan's
economy that have defied conventional policy remedies and an
apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a medium-term
strategy for implementing structural reform and for managing the
economy,'' Moody's said.
	   The impact was immediate on world currency markets. The
announcement sent the U.S. dollar above 142 yen in trading in Tokyo
for the first time since July 13.
	   Specifically, Moody's targeted Japan's triple-A sovereign
ceiling ratings for foreign currency-denominated debt and
yen-denominated debt, signaling the U.S.-based agency might lower
its appraisal of Japan's ability to repay its debts. The triple-A
rating is the highest.
	   This isn't the first time that Moody's has increased its
scrutiny of Japan's troubled financial sector, which has seen
several major institutions go bust in the past year. The U.S.-based
ratings agency changed its ``stable'' outlook for Japan's economy
to ``negative'' in April.
	   In Thursday's announcement, Moody's also cited ``a public sector
fiscal problem that, unlike most other highly-rated countries, will
likely continue to worsen over the medium term, and signs of
weakening in Japan's external position.''
	   Some analysts point out, however, that despite a rising
government deficit, Japan is unlikely to default on its outstanding
debt as it is the world's largest lender and saver. And most of
Japan's debt is financed domestically, so Japanese taxpayers bear
the greatest risk.
	   What's more, if the rating is downgraded, Japan would probably
be forced to sell off its massive holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a
last resort to raise funds, potentially leaving the United States
in a worse position than Japan.
	   ``The first victim of a Japanese financial collapse could be the
U.S., not Japan,'' said Yasushi Okada, chief economist in the Tokyo
office of Credit Suisse First Boston.
	   Moody's did say that Japan has considerable strengths, including
very high income and savings, the capacity to absorb economic
shocks, and a formidable manufacturing sector that has retained its
international competitiveness despite the appreciation of the yen
in the past decade.
	   ``The country's strong external payments position is reflected
in the considerable net foreign asset position of the Bank of Japan
and the commercial banking system,'' the rating agency said.
	   Of particular concern, Moody's said, is the potential for
volatile portfolio shifts into foreign currency assets by Japanese
residents as the country implements a series of financial reforms
began earlier this year.
	   The review will focus on the effects of possible policy
responses for the long-term strength of Japan's fiscal and external
payments position, and how such developments could affect the
banking sector's intrinsic strength, which Moody's considers to be
much weaker than other countries rated triple-A.
	   As a result of this review, the triple-A-rated foreign currency
securities issued by a number of major private companies and
state-financing institutions also came under review for a possible
downgrade.
	   These include the Japan Development Bank, Japan Finance
Corporation for Municipal Enterprises, Export Import Bank of Japan,
Metropolis of Tokyo, Chubu Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric
Power Co., Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., and Tokyo Electric
Power Co.

Local Chinese army receives honor from Jiang

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ People's Liberation Army troops, largely unseen
in Hong Kong since their arrival a year ago, received Chinese
military honors in a simple ceremony on Thursday for their work in
the territory.
	   The second-class honor, ordered by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, is the third highest in a five-level honor system, spokesman
Li Ying said.
	   Lt. Gen. Liu Zhenwu, commissioner of the Hong Kong garrison,
said that the troops have obeyed the local and military laws and
respected the territory's autonomy.
	   The ceremony, followed by songs, skits and dances, was closed to
the public.
	   ``We have shown our determination to maintain the one country,
two systems principle,'' Liu said. The reunification formula
guarantees that Hong Kong can keep its freewheeling capitalist
lifestyle for at least 50 years.
	   ``We will continue to contribute to the stability and prosperity
of Hong Kong,'' he said.
	   About 4,700 Chinese troops have been stationed in Hong Kong
since the territory was returned to Chinese rule in July 1997.
	   With the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 still in their
memories, many Hong Kong people were wary of their arrival.
Disputes broke out between British and Chinese officials in the
final months of British rule over how many troops would come to
Hong Kong and when they would arrive.
	   Despite an awe-inspiring march into the territory hours after
the handover, the troops have since stayed invisible and are
shrouded in mystery. Thousands of local citizens attended two open
houses last year, and spokesman Li said they are considering
opening the bases to the public once or twice a year.
	   The military marching band also performs regularly in public
events, but rarely makes contact with the public.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa thanked the troops for showing
sensitivity towards the local culture.
	   As an example, Tung said a soldier returned a tunnel toll of 5
Hong Kong dollars (60 U.S. cents) to a collector after he
accidentally drove past the booths in a lane reserved for cars that
have pre-paid the toll.

As rains swell Yangtze river, floods also ravage north China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Heavy rains and floods that have dangerously
swelled southern China's Yangtze River have also ravaged the north,
killing 113 persons and leaving 90,000 homeless, the official China
Daily reported Thursday.
	   Torrents that began in early July have destroyed 22,000 homes
and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland and washed away
roads, power lines, and food supplies in Shaanxi province _
normally an arid swath of barely tillable hills, the China Daily
reported.
	   In addition to the deaths, another 69 persons were missing and
2,625 were injured in the flooding, the worst in 40 years in some
areas, the newspaper said.
	   Seasonal rains that came earlier and fell harder than usual have
already killed more than 1,000 people, mostly in flooding along the
Yangtze river in central China.
	   Dikes that are the only shield protecting millions of people
along the river are waterlogged by more than two weeks of constant
rainfall and could collapse, according to official media reports.
	   In an indication of how seriously the central government views
the flooding, President Jiang Zemin on Wednesday personally ordered
local officials to shore up dikes and aid victims.
	   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and residents have been
mobilized to man dikes and fill sandbags, newspapers reported.
	   In the central industrial city of Wuhan, more than 50,000 people
were keeping a round-the-clock vigil of embankments, the China
Daily said.
	   A flood crest, the second this month, was roaring down the
Yangtze through Wuhan, home to 7 million people, on Thursday. The
city has been inundated this week by its heaviest rainfall in
history.
	   The rains _ which left parts of the city under waist-deep water
Tuesday _ led to one death, stranded 600,000 people and cut traffic
on some highways, the Communist Party flagship People's Daily
reported.
	   No rain fell in the city Thursday, allowing soldiers and
residents to drain streets, China Central Television reported.
	   Further upstream in Hunan province, floods washed away a
3,000-meter (3,000-yard) section of newly constructed dikes in
Huarong county and opened a 600-meter (180-foot) crack in the
embankment surrounding Caisang lake, both near Yueyang city, the
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Downstream from Wuhan, river waters were reported about 1 meter
above warning levels in Nanjing city, where the river broadens
before flowing into the sea near Shanghai.

British ship sunk in Singapore waters during WWII salvaged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A salvage team has discovered
historically-valuable artifacts aboard a British merchant cruiser
sunk by the Japanese in Singapore waters during the Second World
War, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Empress of Asia was ferrying 2,200 British soldiers to
Singapore from Bombay when Japanese bombers attacked it on February
5, 1942. It sank in shallow waters only five miles (8 kilometers)
from the shores of this former British colony, which fell to
Japanese forces ten days later.
	   The first reported salvage of a ship in the island republic's
waters, the 250,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 146,000) operation has
yielded some interesting finds, according to The Straits Times.
	   These include army uniforms, machine guns, and china ware. The
artifacts will be donated to the Singapore History Museum.
	   A lighthouse keeper who watched the sinking 56 years ago gave
the newspaper an eyewitness account of the event.
	   ``The ship had nowhere to hide, the planes kept dropping their
bombs and smoke was billowing from the ship,'' said 71-year old
Felix Paul Monteiro.
	   ``All the soldiers jumped overboard and swam to the Sultan Shoal
lighthouse,'' he added.
	   Sixteen people died in the attack, according to the report.

Some items may also have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Both of Prince Charles' children now have met his
longtime companion, Camilla Parker Bowles, according to a report
Thursday in The Sun tabloid newspaper.
	   The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana met for tea
with Mrs. Parker Bowles at his father's country home, Highgrove,
Britain's biggest selling tabloid reported in a front-page ``world
exclusive,'' headlined ``When Harry met Cammi.''
	   A royal spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
	   Two weeks ago, Prince Charles' spokesman confirmed a report in
The Sun that Mrs. Parker Bowles had met Prince William, 16, for the
first time when the young prince came home unexpectedly June 12.
	   The teatime meeting between the younger prince and the woman in
his father's life for the last 25 years was attended by Prince
William and Prince Charles, who were there to help break the ice,
the newspaper said. It did not say exactly when the meeting took
place, only that it occurred within days of news of the encounter
with William becoming public July 9.

	   MURFREESBORO, Tennessee (AP) _ A vandal left a pretty slick
calling card at a Tennessee hotel: The entire room was smeared with
petroleum jelly.
	   Police said the man checked into a Howard Johnson's hotel on
July 15. Two days later, he slipped out, leaving the room a gooey
mess.
	   ``When maids went to clean the room, they discovered the entire
room covered with Vaseline,'' police Officer Don Schubert wrote in
his report.
	   The slick stuff was spread on the carpet, furniture, curtains,
walls and linens. Police found about 15 empty containers of
petroleum jelly in the room.
	   The damage was estimated at dlrs 1,375.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Finders, keepers? That saying
didn't cross Cheryl Brown's mind when she found a wallet stuffed
with dlrs 6,700 in cash.
	   Brown turned the billfold right in to Penn State university
police. ``It was natural,'' said Brown, who discovered the wallet
in a parking garage as she searched for her car after work.
	   No one had reported the wallet missing, and the only
identification found inside it was a name.
	   Fortunately for owner S.H. Park, a police officer recognized her
name because she had been in a minor car accident earlier Sunday.
Police retrieved the accident report and returned her wallet.
	   She and her husband are from South Korea and had been in the
United States for a week. The money was Ms. Park's tuition for the
fall semester at Penn State, where her husband, W.J. Nam, teaches
mechanical engineering.
	   ``It was a very, very lucky day for us,'' said Nam, adding he
appreciated Brown's honesty.
	   Brown said honesty is something to be expected.
	   ``It is no big deal. Anyone would have done it,'' she said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) _ Two women were acquitted of
indecency charges Wednesday for sunbathing topless last summer in a
Canadian park.
	   Provincial Court Judge Eugene Lewchuk ruled that Evangeline
Godron, 64, and Kathleen Rice, 42, didn't offend community
standards when they took their tops off in public.
	   Lewchuk said his ruling didn't clear the way for unconditional
toplessness. He said women who engaged in erotic or offensive
behavior while baring their breasts still might face arrest.
	   The two women were charged after taking their shirts off in
Victoria Park in downtown Regina on a hot afternoon last August.
	   Police, acting on a complaint, asked the women to put their tops
back on. They refused and were charged with creating an indecent
exhibition in a public place.
	   Wednesday's judgment conforms with a ground-breaking ruling in
Ontario two years ago in which the province's highest court
overturned the indecency conviction of Gwen Jacobs. She had been
arrested after strolling topless down a street in her hometown of
Guelph in 1991.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ A state registry deflated plans
Wednesday for Germany's first wedding in a hot-air balloon by
denying certification for the nuptials.
	   ``There are considerable questions about designating the basket
of a hot-air balloon as an official state office,'' northern
Brandenburg state said in a statement.
	   The registry at first approved holding the marriage in a balloon
with its basket on the ground, but then yanked authorization two
days ago, saying marriages must be in a closed room.
	   Evelyn Neew und Christof Galuschka said they already invited 160
guests to their wedding in Potsdam, near Berlin, and hoped to
change the officials' minds.
	   But state spokeswoman Carola Schneider said Wednesday: ``Rules
are rules.''
	   The betrothed couple planned to go ahead with the ceremony and
make the marriage official later.

Pakistan, U.S. end talks with promise to meet again in August

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Two days of talks between Pakistan
and the United States on the prickly nuclear issue ended Thursday
with a promise to meet again in August in Washington.
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left the final
round of talks with Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshed Ahmed
saying ``the foreign secretary and I have been dealing with very,
very tough issues that go to the very core of Pakistan's most vital
national security interest.''
	   Neither side would elaborate on the talks, although government
sources here said Pakistan pressed for international mediation on
the Kashmir dispute with neighboring India.
	   The United States, meanwhile, urged Pakistan to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban treaty.
	   In a brief statement on the steps of Pakistan's Foreign ministry
building, Talbott said that the test ban treaty figured in
negotiations, but neither he, nor Ahmed, would elaborate.
	   ``It is not in the interest of our objectives ... to give you a
box score every time we meet,'' Talbott told reporters.
	   He said the fact that the two sides are meeting again is a clear
sign that ``we're not finished.''
	   Talbott's visit to India and Pakistan -- the world's newest
nuclear states -- was an attempt to try to ease tensions in the
region and encourage nuclear non-proliferation.
	   The troubled South Asian region shot to international prominence
in May when India and Pakistan both conducted underground nuclear
tests, outraging the industrialized world and prompting economic
sanctions from the United States.
	   Pakistan has been particularly hard hit by the sanctions because
of its heavy dependence on international loans, unlike its neighbor
India.
	   A U.S. decision to support renewed talks between Pakistan and
the International Monetary Fund and to abstain on votes for aid to
this cash-strapped country has been welcomed here.
	   Talbott said the United States is interested in the ``strength,
prosperity, security and stability of a democratic Pakistan.''
	   But it also wants to see an ``enhancement of the global
non-proliferation regime.'' The essence of the task at the
negotiation table is to reconcile the two, he said.
	   The United States also is hoping that the first face-to-face
talks between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India on July 29
in Sri Lanka will move the region closer to stability.
	   For Pakistan the outstanding issue is the dispute over Kashmir,
the flash point of two wars between the South Asian neighbors in
the last 51 years. India and Pakistan fought a third war over
Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   New Delhi accuses Islamabad of fomenting violence on its side of
the disputed Kashmir border and of arming and training Muslim
militants leading a secessionist uprising there.
	   Pakistan denies the charge and is demanding a vote by all
Kashmiris to decide whether a united Kashmir should join Pakistan
or India.
	   India has rejected a vote in Kashmir.

Four Thai women die in garment factory fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Four women were killed and 13 others
injured in a fire that raced through a Bangkok garment factory,
Thai police said Thursday.
	   The fire broke out early Wednesday morning at the Lucky Knitting
Co. and lasted for about 90 minutes before it was brought under
control, police said.
	   Although many Thai factories are regarded by fire safety experts
as fire traps, police said the Lucky Knitting Co. had passed city
fire inspections.
	   They said the four women died because they went back into the
burning building to retrieve belongings and were overcome by smoke.
	   The factory also served as a dormitory for 25 women employees.
Many lowered themselves to safety during the blaze by tying bed
sheets together and climbing out windows.
	   Police said the cause of the fire had yet to be established.
According to eyewitness, the fire spread rapidly after a small
explosion.

Football codes agree on drug policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's major sporting codes
agreed Thursday on guidelines for tackling drugs in sport,
including a two-year ban for players caught using
performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids.
	   But the chief executives of the four football codes _ soccer,
rugby league, rugby union and Australian rules football _ and
cricket stopped short of adopting a single uniform code and
continued their hands-off approach to recreational drugs like
marijuana.
	   Australian Sports Commission Chief Executive Jim Ferguson, who
organized the meeting, said there was broad agreement on what
action major sports should take to outlaw drug cheats.
	   ``The key principles are that there has to be a serious regime
of penalties, there has to be an appropriate method of testing,''
Ferguson said.
	   ``The Commission's taken the view, which I think is agreed in
principle, that there should be a two-year penalty for a first
offense for a serious drug case such as a steroid.
	   ``But obviously penalties will vary depending on the substance
and the circumstances.''
	   Ferguson said there was no move to penalize players caught using
recreational drugs such as marijuana.
	   ``Our view is that that is a matter for the sports concerned,''
he said. ``We don't ignore it, but we don't regard it as a
performance-enhancing drug.''
	   National Rugby League chief executive Neil Whittaker, whose
sport has been rocked by three high-profile positive drug tests,
said his code fully supported the two-year ban on first offenders.
	   ``This meeting is an opportunity, certainly for us, to share war
stories,'' Whittaker said.
	   Australian Football League chief executive Ian Collins said his
code didn't believe players caught using marijuana should be
penalized, despite this week's revelations a number of Australian
rules players had tested positive for the drug.
	   ``Marijuana is not a substance taken that we issue penalties
on,'' Collins said. ``We've been testing for marijuana for three
years now and I think we had two positives the first year, one last
year and five this year.'' (djp)

Gang headed by Hong Kong man broken up in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chinese authorities have broken up a gang led
by a Hong Kong man suspected in a string of murders, kidnappings
and the smuggling of explosives across the Hong Kong-mainland
boundary, reports said Thursday.
	   China's Xinhua news agency said police working with Hong Kong
authorities had arrested 18 members of the gang in southern
Guangdong province, which is adjacent to Hong Kong.
	   While applauding the arrests, Hong Kong papers said there was
likely to be more such cross-border crime after the handover of
Hong Kong to Chinese rule last year.
	   The Hong Kong Standard called on authorities to clarify gray
areas of jurisdiction stemming from the case. Most of the crimes
allegedly were planned in China, but committed in Hong Kong.
Reports said the suspects likely would be tried on the mainland,
where they could face the death penalty.
	   Hong Kong newspapers said the gang, led by 43-year-old Cheung
Tza-keung, had been implicated in the kidnapping in 1996-97 of
tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development
companies.
	   Papers plastered a picture of a squinting Cheung, known as the
``Big Spender,'' with a few days' growth of beard on his chin.
	   Fourteen of the 18 were reported to be from Hong Kong
	   Xinhua said the gang had been together since 1990, and besides
the kidnappings were suspected of smuggling 800 kilograms (1,760
pounds) of explosives into Hong Kong; murders in the Chinese cities
of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and robberies of Hong Kong jewelry
stores.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor Thursday awaited
the verdict in his corruption trial that has come to symbolize the
tense power struggle between hard-liners and moderates in Iran's
ruling clergy.
	   The court session began with an official reading a 39-page
report repeating the charges that were heard during the month-long
trial against the suspended mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei was expected to announce the
verdict afterward but no time was set. Karbaschi was not present in
the court but was represented by his lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz.

Philippine stocks fall again as foreigners unload holdings; peso
</HEADLINE>
rises slightly

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippines stocks plunged for a
second day Thursday as foreign fund managers unloaded blue chips
following an assessment by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan that suffering Asian economies have made meager progress.
	   The peso, meanwhile, strengthened against the dollar in early
trading, mirroring a rise in the Japanese yen, but then began to
sag as the yen dipped.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 33.59
points, or nearly 2 percent, to 1,678.16, adding to a 1.8 percent
loss Wednesday.
	   ``Investors who have been waiting to unload their holdings used
Greenspan's comment as an excuse to sell,'' said Edwin Siao, a
trader for institutional sales at Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Traders said a second day of losses on Wall Street compounded
the market's poor sentiment.
	   Core issues bore the brunt of Thursday's selldown as a number of
foreign fund managers started clearing out their investment
portfolios and getting out of the country as Asian economic
prospects remain dim, said Siao.
	   Among those stocks sold down were power distributor Manila
Electric Co., Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. and Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co.
	   ``Phones aren't ringing anymore at the stock exchange for
orders,'' said Robinson Siao, vice president for Securities 2000
Inc.
	   Traders suspect foreign investors may no longer be confident in
the Philippine economy, even as the government has repeatedly
stated that the country's economic fundamentals remain healthier
than its neighbors'.
	   ``Investors may now feel that the country won't start improving
until the whole region starts recovering,'' said Edwin Siao of
Abacus Securities.
	   While the Philippines isn't in recession, Robinson Siao said it
could be just a matter of time before that happens.
	   Investors have also been forced to deal with the Philippines'
rising political risks, stoked by a lack of policy coherence among
several factions in the administration of President Joseph Estrada,
said Robinson Siao.
	   ``Our advice to investors is to stay out of the market in the
meantime and just hold on to their cash,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 42.022 pesos in morning
trading, down slightly from 42.051 pesos Wednesday.
	   The peso began slipping, however, after the yen weakened
following a Moody's Investors Service announcement that it is
placing Japan's triple-A sovereign credit ratings on review for
possible downgrade.
	   Traders said the peso is likely to continue to track the yen's
movements, as it has in recent months.

Dollar rises on Moody's Japan review, stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday in
Tokyo after a U.S. ratings agency placed Japan's sovereign debt
rating on review for possible downgrade. Japanese stocks fell
moderately.
	   The dollar bought 141.73 yen, up 1.07 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 141.24 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said yen-selling accelerated in early afternoon trading
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it has placed some
Japanese government debt on review for a possible downgrade.
	   Moody's announcement raised lingering concerns about the health
of Japan's economy, in its worst recession since the end of World
War II.
	   The yen had already come under pressure overnight in New York on
indications that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was likely to
succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Obuchi is seen as less aggressive on economic reforms than other
candidates in a ruling party race which will conclude in a vote on
Friday. Last week, Hashimoto announced his resignation to take
responsibility for his party's stunning defeat in the July 12
elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   On the other hand, the dollar was supported on remarks from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in congressional testimony
Wednesday that the U.S. economy can withstand the effects of the
Asian financial crisis.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 105.05 points,
or 0.64 percent, closing at 16,188.01 points. On Wednesday, the
average lost 263.63 points, or 1.6 percent.
	   Share prices, especially utilities issues and banking stocks,
were sold following the Moody's announcement, which could lead to a
lower credit rating for Japan.
	   Before the afternoon selling, the market remained mixed in quiet
trading as many investors held back to await the outcome of the LDP
presidential election. The party head will become Japan's prime
minister because the LDP enjoys a comfortable majority in
Parliament's more powerful lower house.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 7.98 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,249.87. The
TOPIX closed down 19.32 points, or 1.15 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.350 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.385 percent, driving its price up to 110.75 yen from 110.50 yen.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ruling Golkar party has
decided to fire seven of former president Suharto's relatives from
the nation's top legislative body, a party official said Thursday.
	   Suwito, a Golkar spokesman, said four of the ex-leader's
children, along with Suharto's half-brother, cousin and a
daughter-in-law, would be dropped from the People's Consultative
Assembly.
	   The seven along with hundreds of others in the body were
appointed by Suharto before he quit as president in May. He
resigned following a wave of riots and protests against his 32-year
rule and his mishandling of a deep economic crisis.
	   According to Suwito, the decision was made at a Wednesday night
meeting attended by General Chairman Akbar Tanjung and all 16
chairmen.
	   ``The new members to replace the seven Suharto family members
are expected to be sworn in this month,'' Suwito said.
	   Reform of the assembly _ made up of 500 lawmakers and 500
government appointees _ is part of an agenda for democratic change
put in place by Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie.
	   Habibie is a longtime friend of Suharto. Nevertheless he has
promised to wipe out corruption and nepotism that flourished under
his predecessor's reign.
	   Dozens of other assembly appointees accused of being chosen
because of family or business connections resigned earlier at the
party's request. However, the seven Suharto family members had
stated that they would not quit.
	   The assembly's main task is to elect a president and vice
president. It is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting in
November to prepare new political laws for parliamentary elections
in 1999. This will be followed by the selection of a new head of
state by another meeting of the assembly.
	   The decision to end the political activities of the Suharto
family follows a major reform push by Habibie within Golkar, which
has dominated Indonesia's tightly controlled political system since
the early 1970s.
	   Earlier this month, the party took a major step by electing a
new pro-reform chairman. It also severed ties with Suharto himself,
by dissolving its board of patrons, headed by the former president.
The body had been instrumental in deciding Golkar policy where
Suharto had a veto right.
	   In its latest decision, Golkar decided to replace Suharto's
children _ Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, Bambang Trihatmodjo, Titiek
Prabowo, and Hutomo Mandala Putra _ as its representatives in the
assembly.
	   Golkar will also remove Bambang's wife, Halimah Bambang
Trihatmodjo, Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo, and Suharto's
cousin, Sudwikatmono.
	   Rukmana, known as ``Tutut'' and once named by Suharto as social
affairs minister, and Bambang, had already been ousted from
Golkar's executive board.
	   Critics of Suharto say the former leader showered his family and
friends with privileges that allowed them to become super-rich and
influential.

	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi was also banned from holding public
office for 20 years and sentenced to 60 lashes. But the court said
the flogging would be suspended because of his social standing. He
was fined 1 billion rials (dlrs 333,000).
	   Karbaschi can appeal the verdict.
	   He was accused of embezzling millions of dollars in public
funds, in part to finance moderate President Mohammad Khatami's
election campaign last year.
	   Karbaschi has admitted to making mistakes but denied that he
ever stole money from the government.

	   In addition to the three years jail for corruption, Karbaschi
was sentenced to two years for misapproriation of funds. The two
sentences will run consequtively, bringing his total jail term to
five years.
	   The court session began with an official reading a 39-page
report, repeating the charges that were heard during the month-long
trial against Karbaschi.
	   He was not in the court when a court official read out the
guilty verdict and the sentences prepared by Judge Gholamhossein
Mohseni Ejaei who was present in the court.
	   Iranian courts usually announce the verdict and sentencing
together.
	   Ejaei said Karbaschi would remain free on bail until he decides
whether he wants to appeal or not.
	   Hundreds of journalists were crammed in the court at the Imam
Khomeini Judicial Complex.
	   Outside, police and firefighters were on alert in case the
verdict sparks violent protests in favor of the popular mayor.
Riots broke out in Tehran when he was arrested in April.
	   Karbaschi's trial, which has gripped Iran since it opened June
7, was widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in the government
to topple key officials allied with President Khatami.
	   Karbaschi ran the campaign that got Khatami elected with a
landslide in the May 1997 election.
	   The trial was not without drama: Karbaschi accused the judge,
who is also the prosecutor, of being unfair by refusing to call
witnesses he had requested, and for the lengths the court had gone
to investigate him. Judge Ejaei frequently threatened to slap
Karbaschi with contempt.
	   During his final address on July 11, Karbaschi broke down after
telling the court that a teenage girl had sent him two gold coins
as a contribution to his defense expenses. They were her life's
savings, and she had not provided her name and address, he said.
	   The gesture provided evidence of the considerable support that
Karbaschi wields, in part because he is an ally of the hugely
popular Khatami.
	   The president is trying to loosen almost two decades of social
and political restrictions imposed by the clergy who took power in
the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.
	   But he has faced stiff opposition from the hard-liners who are
backed by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Besides initiating the trial against Karbaschi, the hard-liners
recently impeached the interior minister, another Khatami ally. But
in a bid to avoid a confrontation, they approved Wednesday another
of Khatami's nominee for the post.

	   SISSANO LAGOON, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The threat of disease
from thousands of rotting corpses is so dangerous that the
government may have to evacuate the survivors of the deadly
tsunami, a senior official said Thursday.
	   More than 1,200 people are officially confirmed dead after the
tsunami smashed villages on the north coast last Friday, but
another 6,000 villagers are missing and feared dead, their bodies
hidden in the impenetrable mangrove swamps.
	   Crocodiles, dogs, pigs and sharks are feasting on the rotting
corpses.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate told The Associated Press on Tuesday
that the government was considering sealing off the Sissano lagoon
area and evacuating all survivors.
	   Only 2,500 to 3,500 people have been found alive out of a total
population in this part of West Sepik province estimated at 8,000
to 10,000 before the disaster.
	   ``I think the government will have to go with that decision and
just abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay,
allow the bodies to just rot off,'' Andrew Kumbako, the local
member of Parliament, who is also the vice finance minister, said
Thursday.
	   After letting nature take its course, he said, Australian
engineers could enter the area and determine if water supplies will
be safe enough to ever allow resettlement.
	   The area may have to be sealed off and resettlement banned, he
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The gruesome task of body recovery and disposal continued
Thursday. At least 30 bodies were found washed up on a beach in the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
west of the disaster zone, police said.
	   The National Disaster Committee said Thursday that 1,235 people
have been officially confirmed dead, most of them children.
	   Many bodies were cast high into the mangroves surrounding and
forming islands in the lagoon. The mangroves are impenetrable, a
tangled mass of gnarled low-lying trees, which have roots that
stick out of the mud like spikes.
	   ``Many people are caught there. We can't reach them,'' John
Tekwie, the governor of West Sepik Province province, told The
Associated Press during a tour of the lagoon.
	   Makeshift villages are already springing up on higher ground
around Sissano lagoon.
	   That is the area hit hardest by the three 23-foot (7-meter)
tsunami waves that crashed ashore last Friday evening. The waves _
triggered by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake _ arrived within
minutes, making it impossible to warn coastal villages.
	   Australian military doctors who have set up a military hospital
at Vanimo, a nearby administrative town that was not hit by the
waves, are already facing a second wave of infections among
survivors whose wounds were untreated for days.
	   Doctors performed seven amputations of gangrenous limbs
Wednesday night on villagers who only emerged from the jungle after
being driven to seek help for their festering wounds.
	   ``I just don't know when it's going to end,'' said Australian
medical officer Les Robert-Thompson.
	   Medical teams from Australia, New Zealand and Japan are working
to save survivors brought into Vanimo by relays of helicopters.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make a brief
stop in Papua New Guinea next Wednesday to discuss how the United
States can help the relief effort.
	   She will stop over en route from a meeting of Southeast Asian
and Pacific foreign ministers in Manila, the Philippines, to talks
in Sydney, Australia, with her counterpart there.
	   Pacific leaders meeting in Fiji, members of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group, will discuss Thursday how they can offer help to
Papua New Guinea. Fiji has already offered to send 50 medics to the
disaster site.

Report: Court finds ex-minister guilty in death-squad trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jumping ahead of a verdict's official
release, Spain's leading daily said Thursday the Supreme Court has
found a former Interior Minister and 11 others guilty in the
so-called GAL death-squad trial, a case which has dominated Spanish
politics for several years.
	   El Pais said the ex-minister would be sentenced to 13 years in
prison for his role in the kidnapping of a French businessman by
the GAL death squad that targeted Basque separatists.
	   If confirmed, the sentence will come as a major blow to former
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who has consistently denied his
1982-96 governments ran the death squads to combat the armed Basque
separatist group ETA.
	   Although it gave no source for the story, El Pais said the
verdict had been voted for by six judges while four voted against.
It said the verdict would be officially released next week.
	   Several other national dailies ran the story Thursday although
El Pais was the only one to have it in its first edition.
	   In the 22-day trial which ended July 14, the prosecution asked
for jail sentences of 23 years for Barrionuevo, Interior Minister
between 1982-88, and his secretary for security, Rafael Vera, for
their role in the kidnapping businessman Segundo Marey in 1983.
	   Lesser sentences were sought for 10 others, who, unlike
Barrionuevo and Vera, had pleaded guilty.
	   Marey's abduction is taken as the first operation of the
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which killed 27 people in
a drive against ETA in southern France betts campaign for Basque
independence.
	   Marey was held for 10 days. He was released after his kidnappers
realized he was not the ETA hitman they were chasing.
	   The prosecution contended GAL was organized by Gonzalez's
government to combat ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym
for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
	   On June 23, Gonzalez told the court the trial was part of a plot
to discredit him and his Socialist party.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor on Thursday was
sentenced to five years in jail for corruption in a case that has
come to symbolize the tense power struggle between hard-liners and
moderates in Iran's ruling clergy.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi also was banned from holding public

Milwaukee chosen as site for U.S. Davis Cup semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The Davis Cup semifinal between the United
States and Italy will be played at Wisconsin Center Arena in
downtown Milwaukee, officials said Wednesday.
	   ``It is probably the most exciting thing that's ever happened to
Wisconsin tennis,'' said Charles Mulcahy, a lawyer who helped
establish Marquette's annual tournament 23 years ago.
	   The semifinal will be held Sept. 25-27. Milwaukee beat out
Detroit, San Diego and Richmond, Virginia, as the semifinal site.
	   Davis Cup representatives visited Milwaukee last week to
consider the availability of motel and hotel rooms.
	   A reason for choosing the city ``was the excitement that I felt
from all of the people we met,'' said Russ Cline, whose Kansas City
firm helps organize the tournament.
	   The choice needed the approval of the London-based International
Tennis Federation and the United States Tennis Federation, Cline
said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As shoppers tighten their purse-strings to cope
with the economic downturn, this year's Great Singapore Sale has
been anything but great, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Results in the annual event, launched in 1994 to stimulate the
retail business in Singapore, have been the worst ever, with some
big retailers reporting revenue declines of up to 20 percent
compared with last year's sale, The Straits Times said.
	   ``It's very bad,'' Singapore Daimaru managing director Toshiro
Nishii was quoted as saying. ``There are fewer tourists and the
whole economy is getting worse and worse. So people try to save
money and do not want to spend too much.''
	   With only a few days left in the five-week sale, the
Japanese-owned department store has experienced a 20 percent fall
in sales at its main branch since the event began, the report said.
	   Shoppers have steered clear of expensive items, the newspaper
added.
	   In its five-year history, the Great Singapore Sale has
experienced mixed results. In the last few years, retailers have

September because of declining tourist arrivals and the Asian
economic crisis.

Chinese police release dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police on Thursday released a dissident
held for nearly two weeks in a crackdown on an opposition political
party, a human rights group reported.
	   Wang Donghai, a leading organizer of the China Democracy Party,
returned to his home in Hangzhou early Thursday afternoon, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   Although they released Wang, police said they would keep him
under ``residential surveillance'' at home, the Hong Kong-based
group said.
	   Three other dissidents detained in the crackdown on the party in
Zhejiang province, eastern China, remained in custody, the
Information Center said.
	   It said a total of 13 dissidents were rounded up in the
crackdown that began July 10, a week after U.S. President Bill
Clinton wrapped up a nine-day tour of China during which he called
for greater political and religious freedoms.
	   The crackdown, and the sentencing and detention of other
activists, marked the most concerted police action against China's
embattled dissident community in recent years.
	   Wang Donghai, along with Wang Youcai and Lin Hui, who remain in
custody, announced the formation of the China Democracy Party on
July 25, the day Clinton arrived in China, in a challenge to the
political monopoly of the ruling Communist Party.
	   But Chinese officials refused to let the party register, as
required by law.

Unions call off planned 3-day Spanish airport strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Labor unions on Thursday called off a
planned strike at Spanish airports that was to take place over
three key vacation days beginning July 31.
	   The stoppage was annulled after union and management
representatives reached an agreement concerning wages and
productivity for the next four years in overnight talks.
	   The unions had called the 8,000 workers employed by the national
airports authority to stop work claiming nearly two years of talks
had failed to produce any progress in the negotiation of a new
collective contract.
	   July 31, Aug.1 and Aug. 2 are three of the busiest days of the
year at Spain's 41 airports.

Actor Gerard Depardieu given suspended sentence for drunken crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ A court on Thursday convicted actor
Gerard Depardieu of driving drunk when he crashed his motorcycle
last May, but it slapped him on the hands with a three-month
suspended sentence and a 10,000-franc (dlrs 1,600) fine.
	   What will likely hurt more was the court's decision to suspend
Depardieu's driver's license for 15 months.
	   ``I decompressed like a Moujik,'' France's most popular actor
told the court in this Paris suburb, likening himself to a drunken
Russian peasant.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ``Green Card,'' and ``The
Return of Martin Guerre,'' suffered minor facial injuries when he
crashed his motorbike May 18 in nearby Clairefontaine.
	   At the time, he was filming the movie ``Asterix,'' directed by
Claude Zidi.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president was wounded in an
assassination attempt Thursday that also left four of his

	   President Aslan Maskhadov came under attack Thursday morning
from unidentified assailants, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Chechen and Russian officials.
	   No additional details were immediately available.
	   Tensions between rival factions have been on the rise in
Chechnya, a mostly Muslim republic in southern Russia. The
territory has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdraw at the end of 1996 following a two-year war.

Former Cambodian refugee to receive 1998 Magsaysay award for
</HEADLINE>
community leadership &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Cambodian refugee who built
a center in a refugee camp to help women and children recover from
the trauma of civil war will receive the 1998 Ramon Magsaysay award
for community leadership, the awards board announced Thursday.
	   The board cited Noun Phaly, currently executive director of the
Future Light Orphanage, for her ``selfless commitment to helping
war-traumatized women and children rebuild their spirits and lives
in the wake of Cambodia's great national tragedy.''
	   She is the first Cambodian to receive a Magsaysay award,
considered the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize.
	   The 55-year-old former civil servant spent nine years with her
husband and children in a refugee camp on the Thailand-Cambodia
border to escape the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge.
	   At the camp, she saw many women suffering from war-induced
depression.
	   In 1985, she and her husband opened their small home in the camp
as a center for refugees suffering from depression. It grew quickly
to accommodate 35 depressed women as well as 16 orphaned children,
and was named the Khmer People Depression Center.
	   Most of the women recovered from their depression and reunited
with their families, and the center became primarily an orphanage.
	   When Noun Phaly returned to Cambodia in 1993, she was
accompanied by 91 children and nine widows.
	   She re-established her center, which was renamed Future Light
Orphanage, on a two-hectare (4.5-acre) site owned by her parents
just outside Phnom Penh.
	   The center now cares for about 150 children. It also continues
to provide livelihood training and mental health counseling to more
than 100 war widows in nearby villages.
	   The Magsaysay awards board previously named Thai Sophon
Suphapong, president of Bangchak Petroleum Ltd., winner of this
year's award for public service, and Pakistani Adibul Hasan Rizvk,
director of Karachi's Sindh Institute of Urology and
Transplantation, winner for government service.
	   Two other recipients of this year's Magsaysay awards will be
announced in the areas of international understanding, and
journalism, literature and creative arts.
	   The winners will be honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies
in Manila on Aug. 31, the birth date of Magsaysay, a popular
Philippine president who died in a plane crash in 1957.
	   The winners of the award each receive a certificate, medallion
and dlrs 50,000.

In Argentina's `Land of Fire,' mercury is rising but no heat wave
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) _ The temperature's rising, the sun's
peeking out over the mountaintops and it promises to be another
scorcher in Argentina's Deep South: That is, a day when the mercury
makes an appearance above freezing.
	   This may be the Tierra del Fuego _ Spanish for the ``Land of
Fire'' _ but on South America's southernmost tip, about 115,000
inhabitants are trying to beat the snow, ice and a bone-chilling
cold a world away from North America's cruel heat wave.
	   Natalie Pasarela, 15, leashed her Alaskan sled dog Negra to a
rope tied to her snowsuit and took off on cross-country skis across
a winter wonderland.
	   ``Hup! Hup! Pull!'' she shouted joyfully as Negra _ a 2-year-old
with coal-black fur and pale blue eyes _ lunged forward, towing
Pasarela at breakneck speed over a snowy mountain trail.
	   Nearby, her father, Jorge, 47, split stout logs with an ax and
tossed them into a fire roaring in an oil drum. Cross-country
skiers coming off mountain trails gulped hot coffee close to the
flames.
	   Here in Ushuaia, the southernmost city on earth, 1,945 miles
(3,130 kilometers) south of the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires
and just 435 miles (700 kilometers) north of Antarctica, it's deep
winter. Temperatures hover around freezing every day during the
season and plummet far below that on most nights.
	   A place whose very name evokes fear of the elements, isolation
and loneliness, Tierra del Fuego is a sprawl of mountainous
islands, sea channels and cliffs locked in a chill all winter.
	   Summer in the Southern Hemisphere _ which comes as Americans and
others in the Northern Hemisphere are stumbling through winter _ is
mild and blissful. Temperatures range into the mid-80s Fahrenheit
(30s Celsius) and the sun shines for all but a few hours.
	   Soaking up what little warmth 6 1/2 hours of daylight afford,
children this week pelted each other with snowballs or whisked down
icy hills on plastic sleds, packing as much activity as they could
into a day that began with a 10 a.m. sunrise. After a late lunch,
the day slides toward sundown.
	   Some complain that temperatures above freezing ruin the fun.
	   ``The snow's too icy,'' grumbled Abelardo Cano, 14, trying out
his snowboard with a group of friends, all from Ushuaia, who are
enjoying a two-week winter school vacation.
	   Each year, tens of thousands of people visit Ushuaia, primarily
in the warmer summer months, dwarfing its year-round population of
45,000. But areas around Ushuaia and elsewhere in the Argentine
portion of Tierra del Fuego _ its islands are split with Chile _
are now being promoted as a destination for skiing, snowmobiling
and dog-sledding.
	   In Ushuaia, weather-worn houses climb the rocky slopes from the
icy, blue Beagle Channel, reflecting the rays of a sun that barely
skims the horizon and lingers briefly on jagged snow-topped peaks.
	   In the mushy, icy streets, taxis clink along with chains on
their tires, prowling for passengers as snowplows clear away
several inches (centimeters) of snow that fell earlier in the week.
	   The sun's feeble warmth brings a steady drip-drip from 10-foot
(3-meter) icicles hanging from a gray mountain face. Loads of snow
slip from the tops of A-frame homes and come crashing down.
	   Mercedes Lescano, a 34-year-old mother of four, said when
temperatures creep above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius)
she lets her kids romp in the knee-deep snow all day.
	   ``Let's just hope this warm weather holds. It's so much easier
keeping these little guys outside the house than in,'' Lescano
said, noting the long winter nights when children are penned
indoors.
	   Asked if she was aware of the heat wave sweeping across the
Northern Hemisphere, one youngster, 11-year-old Estefania Firma
Paz, said, ``Yeah, they told me about it in school. When it's
winter here, it's hot up there.''

Nestle announces 5.7 percent first-half sales increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-based food and drinks giant
Nestle SA increased its group sales for the first half of 1998 by
5.7 percent over the same period last year, the company announced
Thursday.
	   The increase to 35.3 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 23.5 billion)
from 33.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.3 billion) the previous year was
``satisfactory'' in view of currency depreciations, Nestle said in
a statement.
	   Profit figures for the period will be announced in September, it
said.
	   In March, Nestle announced a profit for 1997 of 4.01 billion
francs (dlrs 2.7 billion) on sales of 69.9 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 46.6 billion).
	   Sales progressed in Africa, the Middle East and East Europe, but
the recession in Japan and a slowdown in Brazil made their effects
felt, the firm said.
	   ``In the Asian countries hardest hit by the economic crisis,
reduced demand for certain product categories is beginning to
become noticeable,'' Nestle said.
	   The company said it saw ``very good growth'' in mineral water
and breakfast cereals, and good growth in soluble coffee, frozen
food, ice cream and refrigerated products

NATO troops arrest two war crimes suspects in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers have
arrested two Bosnian Serbs who were charged with war crimes, a NATO
press release said Thursday.
	   Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad did not resist when troops
surrounded their house Wednesday evening to arrest them in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 75 kilometers (47 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   They were immediately flown to The Hague, where the
international war crimes tribunal is located, the NATO statement
said.
	   The Banovic brothers are wanted for their role as guards at the
infamous Keraterm prisoner camp near Prijedor during the 3 1/2
Bosnian war.
	   They are charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Convention,
torture or inhumane treatment and unlawful confinement and other
crimes.
	   No one was hurt in the operation to arrest the two, NATO said,
but no other details were immediately available.

Thai parliament passes money laundering bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's parliament has passed a law
aimed at preventing money laundering, but the government and
opposition accused each other of watering down the legislation.
	   The bill passed during Wednesday's parliament session by a vote
of 174 to 0, with 3 abstentions, the government said in a statement
Thursday.
	   Thailand is a major smuggling center for drugs, weapons, oil,
other contraband goods and migrants. Successive Thai governments
have struggled to pass a money laundering bill that would enable
authorities to seize assets of those involved in crimes.
	   Police and academics studying the money laundering issue have
said that criminal enterprises in Thailand take in billions of
dollars a year.
	   Several lawmakers and politicians have staunchly opposed
attempts to pass a money laundering bill. But several men regarded
and named in polls as provincial godfathers also happen to be
lawmakers.
	   The controversy over the current bill centers on the fact that
it pertains only to money allegedly earned from drugs and
prostitution.
	   Government and opposition lawmakers have accused each other of
preventing other crimes from being included in the bill.
	   Sudarat Keyuraphan, an independent lawmaker, put the blame on
the government, saying that with its majority in parliament it
should have been able to push for all crimes to be included in the
bill, the newspaper Bangkok Post reported Thursday.

BMW says six-month profits up 17 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German automaker BMW said Thursday its
net profit rose to 511 million marks (dlrs 285 million) in the
first six months from 435 million marks (dlrs 243 million) in the
same period last year.
	   BMW said it expects production, sales and earnings for the full
year to top those of 1997, even though the strength of the pound is
a ``serious burden'' for sales of its British unit, Rover.
	   BMW, or Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said sales rose to 31
billion marks (dlrs 17.3 billion) in the first six months, up from
29.1 billion marks (dlrs 16.3 billion) a year earlier.
	   Deliveries of BMW, Rover, Land Rover, Mini and MG brand vehicles
remained unchanged at about 600,000, though auto production rose 1
percent in the January- June period.

UN fact-finding mission on insurgency meets govt officials

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A U.N. fact-finding mission on Algeria's
bloody Muslim insurgency started its work Thursday by talking with
government officials who promised to cooperate. But like previous
foreign missions, the scope was likely to be limited.
	   Massacres of hundreds of civilians in recent months _ adding to
about 75,000 dead in the past 6 1/2 years _ prompted the mission
led by former Portuguese President Mario Soares.
	   The six-member delegation spoke first with Foreign Minister
Ahmed Attaf after arriving Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday
morning, they met with Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Interior
Minister Mohamed Benmansour.
	   The panel, which also includes representatives from the United
States, France, India, Jordan and Kenya, was meeting Justice
Minister Mohamed and Constitutional Council President Mohamed
Bouchair later in the day.
	   The two-week mission was also to include talks with party
leaders, representatives of social groups and Algerian journalists.
	   Government spokesman Hamraoui-Habib Chawki on Wednesday said
officials promised to help the mission ``within the framework of
Algerian laws.''
	   But the comment implied that the government would again prevent
any meeting with armed Islamic groups fighting to establish an
Islamic state.
	   Suspicions have been raised in the West that security forces or
government-armed militias may have had at least a passive role in
violence. Rights groups have accused the government of torture,
disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other atrocities.
	   Key questions are whether the delegates can visit massacre sites
_ access denied a European parliamentary delegation last February _
and meet with leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
	   In the past, Algeria had resisted such a move, calling it
interference in its internal affairs.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government
canceled second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992 that
the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
	   The Front gained support by Algerians fed up with corruption and
high unemployment in the petroleum-rich North African nation.
	   Accompanying Soares are: former Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral, former Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti,
the attorney-general of Kenya, Amos Wako, the former American U.N.
ambassador Donald McHenry, and Simone Veil, France's former health
minister.
	   Traveling with the panel are advisers on humanitarian affairs
and other experts. The mission is to issue a report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Tehran mayor found guilty, sentenced to 5 years in jail

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tehran's reformist mayor was Thursday
sentenced to five years in jail for corruption, a verdict that is
likely to escalate the power struggle between hard-liners and
moderates in Iran's ruling clergy.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was also banned from holding
public office for 20 years and sentenced to 60 lashes. But the
court said the flogging would be suspended because of his social
standing.
	   He was fined 1 billion rials (dlrs 330,000) and ordered to pay
another 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to the municipality.
	   ``The sentence was excessive. He should have been clear of all
charges,'' Karbaschi's lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz, told reporters,
adding that he will appeal the verdict within the 20 days allowed.
``I am one hundred percent certain that the appeal will clear
him,'' Keshavarz said.
	   His trial was widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in the
government to topple key officials allied with moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
	   Karbaschi was accused of using public money to run the May 1997
election campaign of Khatami, who won a landslide victory.
Karbaschi has admitted to making mistakes but denied that he ever
stole money from the government.
	   Karbaschi was not present in court Thursday. The session began
with an official reading a 39-page report, repeating the charges
that were heard during the trial, which has gripped the country
since it opened June 7.
	   Reading from Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei's statement, the
official first announced a guilty verdict. The official then
announced the sentences: three years jail on the charge of
embezzlement and two years for misappropriation of government
money.
	   The two sentences will run consecutively. Iranian courts usually
announce the verdict and sentencing together.
	   Judge Ejaei, who was present in court, did not participate in
the proceedings. However, he later told reporters that Karbaschi
will remain free on bail until the appeal.
	   Hundreds of journalists crammed into the court at the Imam
Khomeini Judicial Complex.
	   Outside, police and firefighters were on alert in case the
verdict sparks violence in favor of the popular mayor. Riots broke
out in Tehran when he was arrested in April.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that its
switchboard was jammed by callers anxious to know about the
verdict.
	   ``If he was so bad then why was he allowed to remain in office
for nearly nine years,'' said Mohammad Qaraat, a soft-drinks kiosk
owner.
	   ``He served the nation, and this is his reward,'' he said.
	   Aided by officials like Karbaschi, Khatami is trying to loosen
almost two decades of social and political restrictions imposed by
the clergy who toppled the U.S.-backed shah and seized power in the
1979 Islamic revolution.
	   But Khatami has faced stiff opposition from the hard-liners who
are backed by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Besides initiating the Karbaschi trial, the hard-liners recently
impeached the interior minister, another Khatami ally. But in a bid
to avoid a confrontation, they approved Wednesday another of
Khatami's nominee for the post.
	   During his final address on July 11, Karbaschi broke down after
telling the court that a teenage girl had sent him two gold coins
as a contribution to his defense expenses. They were her life's
savings, and she had not provided her name and address, he said.

Singapore Telecom to invest dlrs 10.5 million in overseas offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's national telecommunications
operator announced Thursday that it will invest 18 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 10.5 million) to set up seven new overseas
offices this year and eight more next year.
	   Singapore Telecom offices in Sydney, Bombay, Jakarta, Kuala
Lumpur, Manila, Taipei and Bangkok have either already begun
operations or will do so shortly, the company said in a statement.
	   Over the next 18 months, an additional eight offices will be
opened across the region, probably in Melbourne, Guangzhou,
Bangalore, Madras, Osaka, Penang, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
	   The company, which will maintain its monopoly on fixed lines in
Singapore until 2000, said the new offices are part of its planned
regional expansion.
	   The move is in line with its goal to become a carrier offering
regional support to multinational corporations operating in the
Asia-Pacific, the statement said.
	   SingTel said its existing offices in Hong Kong, Beijing,
Shanghai, Tokyo and New Delhi will be equipped with additional
capabilities and support services.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president survived an assassination
attempt Thursday that left four of his bodyguards seriously hurt in
the rebel republic, a Russian news agency said.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov's motorcade came under attack Thursday
morning as he was traveling through the Chechen capital Grozny, the
Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechen and Russian
officials.
	   The initial Interfax report said Maskhadov was wounded, but a
later report said he was able to flee the burning car without
injury.
	   Tensions in Chechnya have been rising in recent weeks as
Maskhadov and other moderates who control the government have
cracked down on Islamic fundamentalists who want to build a state
based on a strict interpretation of Shariah, or Islamic law.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis, a movement
that has its origins in Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabis include native
Chechens as well as some guerrilla fighters who came from other
Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's 1994-6 war against Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in the Chechen
capital, Grozny, in search of the Wahhabis.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to
restore law-and-order to Chechnya, which is plagued by crime and
kidnappings.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdraw at the end of 1996, but Moscow insists that the territory
remains part of Russia.

In blow to Japan, Moody's signals debt rating could be downgraded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout details, analysis; ADDS quote in 4th graf.
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a blow to Japan's position as the economic
anchor of Asia, credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc.
on Thursday put Tokyo on notice that it may downgrade its rating
for Japan's government debt.
	   The move could lead to higher borrowing costs for both the
government and world-class Japanese companies such as Toyota Motor
Corp. It comes as a humiliating blow to Japan, which has been
unable to extract itself from a prolonged economic slump.
	   ``This is a signal from Moody's to Japan to speed up the
process'' of financial reform, said Lewis Roth, a strategist at
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. ``That's the main message.''
	   The announcement, a signal that the U.S. credit rating agency
might lower its appraisal of Japan's ability to repay its debts,
sent tremors through Tokyo financial markets.
	   The dollar surged above 142 yen for the first time since July 13
before recovering to 141.68 yen at the end of Tokyo trading
Thursday _ still well above its level in Tokyo the previous day.
Japanese bond prices initially plummeted after the report was
released, but rebounded in late trading. Tokyo stocks posted a
decline.
	   Moody's offered a grim assessment of the Japanese economy _ and
the government efforts so far to repair it.
	   ``The review is prompted by deep, structural problems in Japan's
economy that have defied conventional policy remedies and an
apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a medium-term
strategy for implementing structural reform and for managing the
economy,'' Moody's said.
	   The threat of a downgrading also reflects on the emergence of
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi as the frontrunner in the race to
succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Obuchi is a
favorite of Japan's political establishment, but many doubt he has
the expertise or the reformist zeal to turn the country's economy
around.
	   Moody's had hinted at considering a review of Japan's rating as
early as April, when it changed its ``stable'' outlook for Japan's
economy to ``negative.'' Japan has come under increasing scrutiny
over the past year amid a string of failures of financial
institutions.
	   On Thursday, Moody's cited ``a public sector fiscal problem
that, unlike most other highly-rated countries, will likely
continue to worsen over the medium term, and signs of weakening in
Japan's external position.''
	   A lower rating would likely increase long-term interest rates in
Japan and make it more costly to raise money at Japanese companies
_ from bad loan-plagued banks to manufacturers with sterling credit
histories.
	   And knocking Japan down a peg would deny it membership in an
exclusive club of top-rated countries, which includes fellow
economic powerhouses such as the United States and Germany.
	   Word of the possible ratings downgrade is not expected to
burnish Moody's reputation in Japan, where it has been demonized as
a rogue power by private company officials, government leaders and
the popular press for its criticisms.
	   Yet critics note there were few complaints when Moody's awarded
Japan its triple-A rating, the highest possible, in 1981.
	   To be sure, Japan is unlikely to default on its outstanding debt
as it is the world's largest lender and saver. And most of Japan's
debt is financed domestically, so Japanese taxpayers bear the
greatest risk.
	   Moody's also noted Japan has considerable strengths, including
very high income and savings, the capacity to absorb economic
shocks, and a formidable manufacturing sector that has retained its
international competitiveness despite the appreciation of the yen
in the past decade.
	   ``The country's strong external payments position is reflected
in the considerable net foreign asset position of the Bank of Japan
and the commercial banking system,'' the rating agency said.
	   Moody's announcement comes just one day before the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party chooses a successor for Hashimoto. The
sour economy has been the focus of campaign.

	   SISSANO LAGOON, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The threat of disease
from thousands of rotting corpses is so dangerous that the
government may have to evacuate the survivors of the deadly
tsunami, a senior official said Thursday.
	   More than 1,200 people are officially confirmed dead after the
tsunami smashed villages on the north coast last Friday, but
another 6,000 villagers are missing and feared dead, their bodies
hidden in the impenetrable mangrove swamps.
	   Crocodiles, dogs, pigs and sharks are feasting on the rotting
corpses.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate told The Associated Press on Tuesday
that the government was considering sealing off the Sissano lagoon
area and evacuating all survivors.
	   Only 2,500 to 3,500 people have been found alive out of a total
population in this part of West Sepik province estimated at 8,000
to 10,000 before the disaster.
	   ``I think the government will have to go with that decision and
just abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay,
allow the bodies to just rot off,'' Andrew Kumbakor, the local
member of Parliament, who is also the vice finance minister, said
Thursday.
	   After letting nature take its course, he said, Australian
engineers could enter the area and determine if water supplies will
be safe enough to ever allow resettlement.
	   The area may have to be sealed off and resettlement banned, he
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The gruesome task of body recovery and disposal continued
Thursday. At least 30 bodies were found washed up on a beach in the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
west of the disaster zone, police said.
	   The National Disaster Committee said Thursday that 1,235 people
have been officially confirmed dead, most of them children.
	   Many bodies were cast high into the mangroves surrounding and
forming islands in the lagoon. The mangroves are impenetrable, a
tangled mass of gnarled low-lying trees, which have roots that
stick out of the mud like spikes.
	   ``Many people are caught there. We can't reach them,'' John
Tekwie, the governor of West Sepik Province province, told The
Associated Press during a tour of the lagoon.
	   Makeshift villages are already springing up on higher ground
around Sissano lagoon.
	   That is the area hit hardest by the three 23-foot (7-meter)
tsunami waves that crashed ashore last Friday evening. The waves _
triggered by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake _ arrived within
minutes, making it impossible to warn coastal villages.
	   Australian military doctors who have set up a military hospital
at Vanimo, a nearby administrative town that was not hit by the
waves, are already facing a second wave of infections among
survivors whose wounds were untreated for days.
	   Doctors performed seven amputations of gangrenous limbs
Wednesday night on villagers who only emerged from the jungle after
being driven to seek help for their festering wounds.
	   ``I just don't know when it's going to end,'' said Australian
medical officer Les Robert-Thompson.
	   Medical teams from Australia, New Zealand and Japan are working
to save survivors brought into Vanimo by relays of helicopters.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make a brief
stop in Papua New Guinea next Wednesday to discuss how the United
States can help the relief effort.
	   She will stop over en route from a meeting of Southeast Asian
and Pacific foreign ministers in Manila, the Philippines, to talks
in Sydney, Australia, with her counterpart there.
	   Pacific leaders meeting in Fiji, members of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group, will discuss Thursday how they can offer help to
Papua New Guinea. Fiji has already offered to send 50 medics to the
disaster site.

Japanese prime minister candidates make final appeal before vote
</HEADLINE>

speeches, the number of party members voting in Friday's election
from 413 to 414 and the number needed to win a majority from 207

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The three candidates fighting to succeed resigning
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made their final public appeals in
nationally televised speeches Thursday, all vowing to pull Japan
out of its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   Japan's ruling Liberal Democrat Party convenes Friday to choose
a new party president. The winner is virtually certain of being
elected prime minister in a later vote by Parliament because the
LDP commands a comfortable majority in the powerful lower house.
	   Thursday's speeches came as media surveys of the 414 voting LDP
members showed party establishment favorite Keizo Obuchi closing in
on the majority needed to win on a first ballot. If no candidate
wins a majority, a second ballot will be held immediately.
	   A poll in a major newspaper Thursday also showed the LDP's
approval ratings at an all-time low as anger rises over the
government's failure to remedy the sagging economy _ and the
party's apparent failure to come up with a reformist leader.
	   As they have in the past week of campaigning, the candidates
offered similar solutions to Japan's problems.
	   Obuchi, 61, foreign minister under Hashimoto and a party
stalwart backed by the LDP old guard, vowed Thursday to fix the
economy by first cleaning up the bad debt plaguing banks, then
cutting taxes and boosting public spending.
	   The other candidates _ former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, 72, and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56 _ have
offered much the same proposals, though Obuchi has offered the most
detailed ideas.
	   He reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth.
	   ``The first priority is resolving the bad loans. But the problem
is that may not be enough to ensure the economy will pick up,''
said Obuchi.
	   Obuchi is from the old-school of Japanese politics, adept at
forging compromises among competing political groups but colorless
in public. Reflecting that, his speech covered the important policy
points but lacked the emotion of Kajiyama's or the humor of
Koizumi's.
	   Kajiyama said his ``top priority is restoring economic growth''
_ aiming at a target of 3 percent annually. He vowed to give the
rest of his 30-year career to restoring health to Japan's
once-vibrant economy.
	   ``I may stumble along the way but I will devote my life to
economic recovery,'' the 72-year-old Kajiyama said.
	   Kajiyama drew cheers from the crowd of party members with a call
for complete disclosure of financial information from troubled
banks before devoting public money to a bailout of the financial
system.
	   For his part, the outspoken Koizumi _ who has played the role of
maverick reformer in the race _ vowed to implement drastic reforms
of the political system, including cutting by almost half the
number of Parliament members and government bureaucrats.
	   ``Some people call me an eccentric man, but as an eccentric man,
I am a man who can change things,'' Koizumi said, playing on the
similarity in Japanese between the words ``eccentric'' and
``change.''
	   ``We have to restore the trust of the people in politics,'' said
Koizumi. ``Before we ask people to endure any hardships we have to
show that the government and politicians can endure painful reforms
themselves.''
	   Friday's vote was prompted by Hashimoto's announcement last week
that he would resign to take responsibility for the party's
disastrous showing in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   The vote was considered a sign of the unpopularity of the LDP _
unpopularity that is apparently still rising. The mass-circulation
Yomiuri newspaper reported Thursday that the LDP's approval rating
has sunk to an all-time low of 20.8 percent. That was down from
28.7 percent in June. The poll, of 1,990 people, offered no margin
of error.
	   And though public opinion polls show Koizumi the most popular of
the candidates, within the party Obuchi was by far the
front-runner, according to media polls of party members.
	   A poll by Kyodo News agency released late Wednesday showed
Obuchi with nearly 200 of the 208 votes needed to win a majority in
a first ballot. The Nihon Keizai economic newspaper released a
survey on Thursday showing Obuchi with a more modest 180 votes, but
still with more than twice the support of his nearest competitor,

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court convicted Tehran's reformist mayor
of corruption Thursday and sentenced him to five years in prison in
a case that has come to symbolize the power struggle between
hard-liners and moderates in Iran's ruling clergy.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was banned from holding
public office for 20 years, fined 1.6 billion rials (dlrs 530,000)
and sentenced to 60 lashes. The court, however, said the flogging
would be suspended because of Karbaschi's social standing.
	   Hundreds of journalists crammed into the court at the Imam
Khomeini Judicial Complex to hear the culmination of a trial that
has held the nation's attention since it began on June 7. Karbaschi
was not present in the courtroom. But outside, police and
firefighters were on alert in case the verdict sparked violent
protests in favor of the popular mayor. Riots broke out in Tehran
when he was arrested in April.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that its
switchboard was jammed since morning by callers eager to hear the
court's decision.
	   Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei said Karbaschi would remain
free on bail until he decides whether he wants to appeal the
sentence: three years for embezzling public funds and two years for
misappropriation of government money.
	   Karbaschi has denied he ever stole money from the government.
	   ``The sentence was excessive. He should have been clear of all
charges,'' Karbaschi's lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz, told reporters,
adding that he will appeal the verdict within the 20 days allowed.
``I am 100 percent certain that the appeal will clear him,''
Keshavarz said.
	   The trial was widely seen as an attempt by conservatives in the
government to topple key officials allied with President Mohammad
Khatami. Karbaschi ran Khatami's 1997 election, which the president
won by a landslide. Karbaschi was convicted Thursday of using
public money to run that campaign.
	   Aided by reform-minded officials like Karbaschi, Khatami is
trying to loosen almost two decades of social and political
restrictions imposed by the clergy who took power in the 1979
Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.
	   But he has faced stiff opposition from hard-liners backed by
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Besides initiating
the Karbaschi trial, the conservatives recently impeached the
interior minister, another Khatami ally. In a bid to avoid a
confrontation, however, they approved another Khatami nominee for
the post on Wednesday.
	   Karbaschi's trial was not without drama: He accused the judge,
under Iranian law also the prosecutor, of acting unfairly by
refusing to call witnesses he had requested, and for the lengths to
which the court went to investigate him. Judge Ejaei frequently
threatened to charge Karbaschi with contempt.
	   During his final address to the court on July 11, Karbaschi
broke down after telling the court that a teen-age girl had sent
him two gold coins as a contribution to his defense expenses. They
were her life's savings, he said.

Athletic Park no fun for the athletes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ So much for the home-field
advantage _ New Zealand's rugby union team admitted Thursday it was
surprised and disappointed by the boggy conditions at Athletic
Park.
	   All Blacks coach John Hart said he didn't understand how the
field had become so heavy and the grass so long because no rugby
had been played at the venue in a month.
	   The criticism has embarrassed the Wellington Rugby Union _
executive officer David White said more work would be done on it
Friday, weather permitting, before Saturday's test match with South
Africa.
	   ``I was flabbergasted when we walked onto it,'' star winger Jeff
Wilson said after the All Blacks' training session at the park
Thursday.
	   Fullback Christian Cullen, who has scored in almost every
first-class match he has played at the ground, said he couldn't
believe the softness of the turf.
	   ``It's very hard to run on it because it just cuts through and
you get bogged in,'' he said.
	   Springboks coach Nick Mallett, who took his team for a light run
at the park on Thursday, took a diplomatic line, saying it had
improved since the previous time he set foot on it in April.
	   The ground staff blamed wet weather in Wellington over the past
several weeks.
	   Mallett, meanwhile, admitted he doesn't chat with a referee
before a match, unlike his opposite number Hart.
	   ``I personally don't believe in talking to the referee before
the game at all,'' he said. ``I don't think anything I say before
the game is going to help him.''
	   English coach Clive Woodward was critical of Hart after the New
Zealand coach spoke to Australian referee Wayne Erickson at
halftime in the first test in Dunedin last month. Woodward said it
was not in the spirit of the game.
	   Hart has since refrained from that practice, but as other
coaches normally do, he has continued to discuss some
interpretations with referees before the match.
	   Hart confirmed he would meet with Englishman Ed Morrison on
Friday before Saturday's test. (djp)

Chechnya's president survives assassination attempt

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president narrowly survived an
assassination attempt Thursday when a car bomb badly damaged his
motorcade and seriously wounded his bodyguards in the capital of
the rebel republic, news reports said.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov's motorcade was traveling through the
Chechen capital Grozny when the car bomb exploded, setting his
armored car ablaze and destroying other vehicles on the street, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov rushed from his burning car unharmed, but at least
four of his bodyguards were seriously wounded, Interfax said.
	   The president was whisked away from the scene and the street was
quickly cordoned off, the report added.
	   Tensions in Chechnya have been rising in recent weeks as
Maskhadov and other moderates who control the government have
cracked down on Islamic fundamentalists who want to build a state
based on a strict interpretation of Shariah, or Islamic law.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis. The Wahhabis
include native Chechens as well as some guerrilla fighters who came
from other Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's 1994-6 war
against Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of the Wahhabis.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to
restore law-and-order to Chechnya, which is plagued by crime and
kidnappings.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdraw at the end of 1996, but Moscow insists that the territory
remains part of Russia.

Nationwide strike disrupts traffic, flights, ferries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A nationwide general strike Thursday
disrupted traffic, airline and passenger ship schedules and closed
most public services.
	   All state-run banks, post offices and the telephone company
closed down for the day as part of the 24-hour protest against
government austerity measures aimed at bringing the country's
economy in line with the rest of the European Union.
	   No trains ran for the entire day, while delays were expected in
Olympic Airways flights due to a scheduled three-hour work stoppage
beginning at noon (0900 GMT).
	   Passenger ferry schedules also were affected, causing problems
for tourists trying to reach islands.
	   In cities, bus and trolley operators planned morning and late
evening strikes.
	   A protest march which ended outside the parliament buildings in
central Athens further disrupted traffic.
	   The strike is also being held to protest government plans to
privatize state-held banks and companies, considered essential to
Greece's efforts to qualify for the EU's single currency club by
Jan. 1, 2001.

Asian markets fall on news about Japan's credit rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices fell on major Asian markets
Thursday because of doubts about Japan's new leadership and a
possible downgrade of its debt rating.
	   Moody's Investors Service announced early Thursday that it may
downgrade its rating for Japan's government debt from the current
triple-A, the best possible.
	   Tokyo stocks fell for the fourth straight day, with the Nikkei
average down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent, closing at 16,188.01.
It had fallen more than 250 points on Wednesday.
	   Markets in Hong Kong and Seoul were down sharply.
	   Moody's said, ``The review is prompted by deep, structural
problems in Japan's economy that have defied conventional policy
remedies and an apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a
medium-term strategy for implementing structural reform and for
managing the economy.''
	   Moody's announcement comes against a backdrop of pessimism over
Japan's ability to dig itself out of its current economic slump.
	   The likelihood that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will be chosen
as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's president Friday, and
therefore become prime minister, also kept buyers away.
	   Obuchi would automatically become prime minister, since the
ruling LDP has a majority in the lower house of Parliament. Market
participants do not see him as an aggressive reformer.
	   In Seoul, the key index plunged 5.7 percent on the possible
downgrade of Japan's debt. The benchmark KOSPI index fell 20.61
points, closing at 341.46.
	   Analysts said Moody's announcement prompted speculation of a
possible second round of currency problems, with an impact on China
and Hong Kong.
	   U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's forecast that
China's gross domestic product will grow by 6.8 percent instead of
the official Beijing forecast of 8 percent has hurt investor
confidence, analysts added.
	   By midday Thursday, the Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's
key indicator of blue chips, was down 238.22 points, or 2.8
percent, to 8,182.50.

Former Wallaby coach recovering from brain surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian rugby union coach
Greg Smith says he is a new man following brain surgery that he
believes saved his life.
	   Smith also said his behavior in recent years, including during
his two seasons as Wallaby coach before his contract was not
renewed, was severely affected by the illness.
	   He had surgery to remove a brain tumor two weeks ago and faces
further radiotherapy before he can make a full recovery.
	   ``The tumor was pushing into an area of my brain that affects my
thinking and personality,'' Smith said Thursday. ``I'd known
something was wrong for a bit over 12 months.
	   ``Basically I was just not myself. I was very withdrawn, I was
having blinding headaches that would last 25 minutes, I would
sometimes lose track of my thoughts . . . it just was not me.
	   ``It had been affecting me for a long time but you tend to hide
things.''
	   Smith was rushed to hospital after complaining of severe
headaches and said had another hour passed he may not have
survived.
	   ``It was a desperate situation and I was saved by
circumstances,'' he said. ``Had I not got the emergency doctor that
night I might not have made it through to the next day.''
	   He said during his time as Wallaby coach, as his condition got
worse, he became more and more distant.
	   ``I was always in my room, I cut myself off from other people
and there was a lot of that happening,'' Smith said. ``I would come
home and have no interaction with the kids, I just wanted to go
into my room and sleep.'' (dip)

September deadline set for plea bargain for German terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A court trying a German man accused of
plotting a terror attack in Israel on Thursday gave prosecution and
defense until September to negotiate a plea bargain agreement.
	   The defendant, Stephan Smyrek, 26, has been charged with
conspiring with Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon to
carry out a suicide bombing in Israel.
	   Smyrek, who is from Braunschweig, was to have entered his plea
Thursday, but the prosecutor and the defense lawyer said they
needed more time.
	   Each blamed the other for the delay. ``I tried every way to
reach an agreement,'' said defense attorney Dan Assan. ``We are
still waiting for the accused to reply to the charges,'' said
prosecutor Dvora Chen.
	   Tel Aviv District Court Judge Amnon Straschnov asked
rhetorically: ``Do you want me to impose an agreement?'' He gave
two sides until Sept. 1 to strike a deal.
	   Assan said if no plea bargain is reached the court may have to
appoint a public defender because Smyrek has no money. ``The family
of Mr. Smyrek have let him down and not provided the funds needed.
My office cannot carry the burden of an extended trial,'' he said.
	   Smyrek was arrested on Nov. 18 as he arrived at Israel's
Ben-Gurion International Airport. Israeli authorities say he
confessed to his role in the abortive plot.
	   According to the indictment, Smyrek traveled to Lebanon last
August to train in the use of arms and explosives. Three months
later, he came to Israel via Amsterdam, equipped with a video
camera, a map of Israel and dlrs 4,000 from Hezbollah, the charge
sheet says.
	   Smyrek is charged with conspiring to carry out a terrorist
attack, harming state security and belonging to a terror
organization. The charges carry a maximum penalty of two life
sentences plus five years.

NATO troops arrest two war crimes suspects in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peacekeeping
force has arrested two Bosnian Serbs charged with war crimes, NATO
said Thursday.
	   Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad offered no resistance when
troops surrounded their house Wednesday evening in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   They were immediately flown to The Hague, site of an
international war crimes tribunal, NATO said in a statement.
	   The Banovic brothers are wanted for their alleged role as guards
at the infamous Keraterm prisoner camp near Prijedor during the
3{-year Bosnian war.
	   They are charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Convention,
torture or inhumane treatment and unlawful confinement and other
crimes.
	   No one was hurt in the operation to arrest the two, NATO said,
but no other details were immediately available.

Lawyer asks for release of Belgian man accused in pedophile

slaying &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ A lawyer for the Belgian man charged with
killing a convicted German pedophile last month in Italy has
requested his client's release from prison.
	   An appeal to free Robert van der Plancken, jailed in Pisa since
June 19, was made Wednesday, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   Plancken is accused of slaying Gert-Jan Ulrich; both were
allegedly part of an international child sex ring. Police say
Plancken was angry because Ulrich, 49, had tipped off police about
the group.
	   Dutch police are investigating the ring, which allegedly
sexually abused children as young as 12 months and put their
pictures on the Internet.
	   Following Ulrich's death, police found computer material in his
apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort containing images of
children being sexually abused.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rescue teams searched the Brittany coast Thursday
for French boy scouts whose sailboat capsized, leaving one scout
dead and three others missing. A fourth person who tried to rescue
them was also missing, authorities said.
	   Two helicopters and several boats aided in the search for the
teenage scouts, whose sailboat capsized Wednesday night off
Perros-Guirrec, on the northwestern end of Brittany, rescue
officials said.
	   Seven scouts were aboard the Caravelle when it capsized. Three
were found alive on the boat when it was found shortly after
midnight, and the body of one scout was recovered, officials said.
	   Another person was missing from his sailboat after he tried to

In bold move, China orders army to shut down enterprises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BEJ101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a bold move aimed at transforming the world's
largest army into a modern fighting force, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin has ordered China's military to close its vast commercial
empire.
	   The directive, part of a widening week-old government campaign
to eradicate pervasive smuggling and the army's role in it, was
another signal of Jiang's growing stature as China's pre-eminent
leader.
	   Taking on the entrenched business interests of the politically
powerful People's Liberation Army was once considered too risky for
Jiang, who lacks the military experience of his revolution-hardened
predecessors.
	   PLA businesses fund an estimated one-third of the military's
operating expenses and are a pervasive force in China's commercial
life, from cellular phone networks to karaoke halls.
	   In a sign of his hard-won support among PLA brass, state-run
television Wednesday night showed Jiang, flanked by senior generals
of the Communist Party's military commission, ordering the shutdown
at a closed-door meeting this week. Top commanders from the PLA and
the People's Armed Police _ a uniformed internal security force _
took notes as Jiang spoke.
	   ``All military and armed police forces must earnestly check all
kinds of commercial enterprises set up by subsidiary units and from
today on must not engage in business activities,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency quoted Jiang as saying in a report published in
major national newspapers Thursday.
	   Despite the statement's sweeping implications, the reports gave
no indications how the PLA is to divest its business interests.
	   ``They're breaking a lot of rice bowls,'' said Bates Gill, a
specialist on China's military-industrial establishment at the
Monterey Institute of International Studies. ``This raises some
very serious questions on dealing with the deeply vested interests
of individuals who are making a tidy profit.''
	   The smuggling campaign appeared to give Jiang and his supporters
in the PLA a politically convenient excuse to advance a drive to
modernize the force and make its 2.9 million members more
professional. ``Who can argue that you shouldn't stop smuggling?''
Gill said.
	   Smuggling _ everything from oil to luxury cars and cigarettes _
to evade high taxes has frustrated government efforts to set up
capitalist-style free markets. Xinhua, citing a General
Administration of Customs official, estimated that the illegal
trade costs the government and enterprises as much as 100 billion
yuan (dlrs 12 billion) a year in lost revenues.
	   Military businesses are so widespread that people have dubbed
the army PLA Inc. Beijing's swanky Palace Hotel, a favorite of
top-dollar tourists, is owned by the PLA's General Logistics
Department. Its 999 Enterprise Group makes a popular gastric pain
remedy.
	   Jiang's order confirmed suspicions that PLA members were
involved in smuggling and that their enterprises were a major
conduit for the endeavor. He told the assembled officers that the
PLA's reputation was at stake and demanded their cooperation.
	   By shaming the PLA, Jiang may be trying to overcome the kind of
resistance that foiled attempts in the early 1990s to get the
military out of business.
	   Since then, Jiang has gathered around him a coterie of career
PLA officers determined to upgrade the military. They have
recognized that military enterprises, many of them money losers,
need to be spun off and have set up a procurement division to
oversee development of weapons.
	   Jiang and his allies, however, may find it difficult to separate
the military from its enterprises. PLA morale is already sagging as
bankrupt military businesses lay off employees, many of them
officers' wives. The intricate military-industrial complex also
includes many companies that were once PLA factories but are now
ostensibly supervised by the State Council, China's Cabinet.
	   A decision last fall to cut 500,000 members from the military
over three years, however, may smooth the transformation.
Demobilized officers, once facing bleak employment prospects, may
now be able to don suits and run the corporations, Gill said.

Lawmakers upset with government secrecy over induction of nuclear
</HEADLINE>
weapons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Opposition legislators jeered India's
defense minister Thursday for his silence on whether the army will
induct nuclear weapons, accusing him of bowing to western pressure.
	   ``It will not be in the interest of national security to divulge
details,'' Defense Minister George Fernandes insisted, replying to
persistent queries in Parliament.
	   Arif Mohammed Khan, of the Bahujan Samaj party, accused
Fernandes of using national security as an excuse for secrecy, and
voiced concern India would scrap its weapons program because of
outside pressure. Other lawmakers jumped to their feet to demand an
unequivocal reply.
	   ``Being a nuclear weapons state is one thing and the sections
where you induct it is another. It is not wise to make a statement
on it,'' Fernandes said. ``There is no question of buckling under
pressure in any situation.''
	   India exploded five nuclear devices in May, prompting
international condemnation and economic sanctions. It later
dismissed demands by the five recognized nuclear powers to refrain
from developing and deploying nuclear weapons or the delivery
systems for them.
	   Pakistan quickly responded with nuclear test blasts of its own.
	   U.S. presidential envoy Strobe Talbott visited India and
Pakistan this week to pursue President Bill Clinton's effort to get
the signatures of the two countries on a global test ban treaty.
	   Fernandes also refused to disclose details of a task force
report that has recommended setting up a National Security Council.
The body would combine politicians and military officers to plan
India's defense.
	   The task force, headed by former Defense Minister K.C. Pant,
handed its report to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee last
month.

Rashid: Iraq negotiating with 22 firms to develop oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is negotiating with 22 foreign
companies that could help develop its oil fields and greatly expand
production, Iraq's oil minister was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   The weekly Al-Zawra newspaper quoted the minister, Lt. Gen. Amer
Mohammed Rashid, as telling a Parliament committee that Iraq aimed
to increase its production to 6 million barrels a day.
	   That would be nearly double its 3.4 million barrel daily output
before the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   Iraq plans to ``start production at the big and newly discovered
fields which have not been developed yet to accomplish our plan to
increase production limits to 6 million barrels per day,'' Rashid
was quoted as saying.
	   Rashid said the companies negotiating with Iraq included
France's Total and Elf Aquitaine. He did not name others, but said
they included companies ``from Europe and Southeast Asia and China
for the same purpose.'' Russia's Lukoil also is known to be holding
talks with Iraq.
	   Western oil company officials have said they will not proceed
with oil field development until U.N. trade sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait are lifted.
	   Iraq had been exporting about 1.6 million barrels per day under
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows the country to
sell limited quantities of oil for needed food and medicine for its
22 million people. An additional 800,000 barrels a day are produced
for local consumption.
	   In recent weeks, however, U.N. officials have said Iraqi exports
had risen to 2.4 million barrels a day. Oil industry experts
suggested this reflected a drawdown of stocks and said it probably
couldn't be sustained.
	   The oil-for-food program initially allowed Iraq to export dlrs 2
billion worth of oil every six months. This has been raised to dlrs
5.2 billion, but Iraq has said that production problems and low
world oil prices mean the country probably will be able to sell
just dlrs 4 billion in the current period.
	   Also Thursday, the newspaper said Iraq will import 100 trucks
from Algeria by the end of this year to use to distribute goods
under the oil-for-food program.
	   Iraq has tried to purchase as much as it can from Arab countries
to boost its relations with them, the paper noted.

Cargo plane burns up before takeoff near St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire broke out in the engine of a cargo plane
preparing to take off near St. Petersburg, and the aircraft was
completely engulfed in flames on the tarmac, a news report said.
	   All eight crew members and two passengers were evacuated from
the An-12 plane after it caught fire and swerved off the runway at
the Pulkovo military airport. One pilot suffered leg burns and was
hospitalized, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The plane, carrying 13 tons of food and 10 tons of fuel, burned
for four hours despite the presence of firefighters at the scene,
Interfax said.
	   According to emergency officials, the fire started after one of
the engines failed and the pilot aborted the takeoff. A bird may
have flown into the engine, causing it to shut down, Interfax said.
	   The plane was owned by the Norilsk aviation company.

Sri Lanka's top athlete cleared of drug charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Asia's fastest woman athlete has been
cleared of charges that she took a banned performance-enhancing
drug at the World Track Championships last year, sports officials
said Thursday.
	   Susantika Jayasinghe, who finished ahead of Merlene Ottey at the
Athens meet, was not immediately available for comment, but a
family member said she was thrilled by the decision.
	   ``She has gone to the temple to pray and express gratitude,''
said the family member who did not give her name when reached by
telephone.
	   The vote was 2-1 in her favor by a panel of experts, the sports
officials said.
	   Jayasinghe, 23, tested positive for Nandralone-19 when a random
sample was taken after she sprinted to victory. She claimed she had
taken a drug to control her menstrual cycle, but not Nandralone-19.
	   Jayasinghe accused Sri Lankan officials of tampering with the
bottles that were used to collect urine samples, saying some of
them were angry because she had rebuffed their advances.
	   Two of the 3-member panel, Wijeyadasa Rajapakse and Rajah Dep,
ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove the charges. But
the third member, Ravindra Fernando, professor of forensic medicine
and head of the National Poisons Information Center, said it was
proved beyond reasonable doubt that Jayasinghe had committed a
doping offense.
	   Jayasinghe tested positive for Nandralone-19 once before, at the
1995 Asian Championship. She was banned from further participation.
Subsequently, the International Amateur Athletic Federation lifted
the ban following medical evidence that a drug taken by women to
delay the menstrual cycle has similar organic compounds as
Nandralone-19.

Tokyo stock market's main index falls for fourth day, dollar
</HEADLINE>
climbs &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond prices, comments,
other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell Thursday on the latest worrisome
sign about Japan's economy _ news that the country's credit rating
could be downgraded. The U.S. dollar climbed against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 105.05 points,
or 0.64 percent, closing at 16,188.01. Including a 263.63-point
fall, or 1.6 percent, on Wednesday, the Nikkei now has fallen a
total of 543.91 points in four trading days.
	   With Japan's economy in its worst recession since the end of
World War II, the U.S. rating agency Moody's Investors Service said
it was reviewing the rating of Japan's government debt for a
possible downgrade.
	   ``The review is prompted by deep, structural problems in Japan's
economy that have defied conventional policy remedies and an
apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a medium-term
strategy for implementing structural reform and for managing the
economy,'' Moody's said in a statement.
	   Traders said the announcement sparked early afternoon selling,
but the selling quickly eased as traders recalled that Moody's
already had announced in April that it was considering the action.
	   Earlier, the market had been mixed, with many investors awaiting
the outcome of Japan's ruling party's presidential election on
Friday. The party head will become Japan's prime minister because
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party enjoys a comfortable majority
in Parliament's more powerful lower house.
	   Trading was moderate, with an estimated 410 million shares
changing hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 396
million. Declines outnumbered advances 785 to 346, with 143 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 7.98 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,249.87. It
had fallen 19.32 points, or 1.15 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 141.68 yen, up 1.02 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 141.24 yen overnight.
	   Traders said yen-selling accelerated in the early afternoon
after the announcement by Moody's.
	   ``Moody's announcement was quite a surprise, triggering waves of
cut-loss selling of the yen,'' said Minoru Shioiri, senior trader
at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   The dollar later met profit-taking by Japanese exporters and
overseas investors, traders said.
	   In Thursday's trading, the dollar moved between 140.60 yen and
142.10 yen, its highest intraday level in Tokyo since 144.50 yen on
July 13.
	   The yen had already come under pressure overnight in New York on
indications that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was likely to
succeed resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Obuchi is seen as less aggressive on economic reforms than other
candidates the ruling party leadership race. Last week, Hashimoto
announced his resignation to take responsibility for his party's
stunning defeat in the July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.335 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.385 percent, driving its price up to 110.86 yen from 110.50 yen.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In an apparently leaked verdict, Spanish
newspapers reported Thursday that the Supreme Court has found a
former Interior Minister and 11 others guilty in the so-called GAL
death-squad case that has dominated Spanish politics for several
years.
	   The leading daily El Pais and other papers said the ex-minister,
Jose Luis Barrionuevo, would be sentenced to 13 years in prison for
his role in the kidnapping of a French businessman by the GAL death
squad that targeted Basque separatists in the early 1980s.
	   The 22-day trial ended July 14.
	   If confirmed, the sentence will come as a major blow to former
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who has consistently denied his
1982-96 governments ran the death squads to combat the armed Basque
separatist group ETA.
	   The GAl scandal contributed greatly to the defeat of Gonzalez's
Socialist party in elections in March 1996 after nearly 14 years in
office.
	   El Pais said seven of the 11 judges on the court's tribunal had
voted in favor of the verdict while four voted against. It said the
verdict would be officially released next week.
	   Nobody at the court was available for comment on the report
early Thursday.
	   National radio said conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, currently on a visit to Turkey, had refused to comment on
the matter.
	   In the trial, the prosecution asked for jail sentences of 23
years for Barrionuevo, Interior Minister between 1982-88, and his
secretary for security, Rafael Vera, for their role in the
kidnapping businessman Segundo Marey in 1983.
	   Lesser sentences were sought for 10 others, who, unlike
Barrionuevo and Vera, had pleaded guilty. News reports said Vera
will also be sentenced to 13 years.
	   El Pais said the court had found Barrionuevo and Vera guilty of
illegal detention and misuse of public funds. They were absolved of
the charge of belonging to an armed group.
	   The paper said a proposal that a pardon recommendation should be
included in the sentence was rejected by the court.
	   Marey's abduction is taken as the first operation of the
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which killed 27 people in
a drive against ETA in southern France between 1983 and 1987.
	   Eight of its victims proved to have no ties to ETA, which has
killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for Basque
independence.
	   Marey was held for 10 days. He was released after his kidnappers
realized he was not the ETA hitman they were chasing.
	   The prosecution contended GAL was organized by Gonzalez's
government to combat ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym
for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
	   On June 23, Gonzalez told the court the trial was part of a plot
to discredit him and his Socialist party.

Rashid: Iraq negotiating with 22 firms to develop oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to restore cycle designator &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is negotiating with 22 foreign
companies that could help develop its oil fields and greatly expand
production, Iraq's oil minister was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   The weekly Al-Zawra newspaper quoted the minister, Lt. Gen. Amer
Mohammed Rashid, as telling a Parliament committee that Iraq aimed
to increase its production to 6 million barrels a day.
	   That would be nearly double its 3.4 million barrel daily output
before the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
	   Iraq plans to ``start production at the big and newly discovered
fields which have not been developed yet to accomplish our plan to
increase production limits to 6 million barrels per day,'' Rashid
was quoted as saying.
	   Rashid said the companies negotiating with Iraq included
France's Total and Elf Aquitaine. He did not name others, but said
they included companies ``from Europe and Southeast Asia and China
for the same purpose.'' Russia's Lukoil also is known to be holding
talks with Iraq.
	   Western oil company officials have said they will not proceed
with oil field development until U.N. trade sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait are lifted.
	   Iraq had been exporting about 1.6 million barrels per day under
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, which allows the country to
sell limited quantities of oil for needed food and medicine for its
22 million people. An additional 800,000 barrels a day are produced
for local consumption.
	   In recent weeks, however, U.N. officials have said Iraqi exports
had risen to 2.4 million barrels a day. Oil industry experts
suggested this reflected a drawdown of stocks and said it probably
couldn't be sustained.
	   The oil-for-food program initially allowed Iraq to export dlrs 2
billion worth of oil every six months. This has been raised to dlrs
5.2 billion, but Iraq has said that production problems and low
world oil prices mean the country probably will be able to sell
just dlrs 4 billion in the current period.
	   Also Thursday, the newspaper said Iraq will import 100 trucks
from Algeria by the end of this year to use to distribute goods
under the oil-for-food program.
	   Iraq has tried to purchase as much as it can from Arab countries
to boost its relations with them, the paper noted.

German opposition's economics designate would cut subsidies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The man named to be Germany's economics
minister if the Social Democrats gain power in September says he
would seek faster subsidy cuts for old industries such as coal.
	   The comments Jost Stollmann in a newspaper interview published
Thursday were close to the pro-market line of Social Democratic
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, the front runner for the
Sept. 27 election.
	   ``The phaseout of subsidies for old industries must be speeded
up,'' the 43-year-old software company founder told the Rheinische
Post.
	   Stollmann also disagreed with parts of the Social Democrats'
election platform, designed to balance Schroeder's centrist
approach with the party's left-leaning traditions.
	   He said the platform's call for continued government aid to
households with children even if the family earns well is
``nonsense.''
	   ``My family donates that money to charity,'' he said.
	   Schroeder was giving a speech on his economic plans at a
conference in Berlin later Thursday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry has set up a new post in Singapore to better collect
information on the regional economic crisis, a MITI official said
Thursday.
	   The activity will be carried out by a single trade ministry
staffer working out of the Singapore office of the Japan External
Trade Organization, a semi-governmental body under MITI's
supervision.
	   Kyoji Yoshino, an official with MITI's International Trade and
Administration Bureau, said the move was in line with JETRO's
recent steps to focus more attention on Asia.
	   Ministry monitoring activities were previously weighted in favor
of the United States and major European countries, he said.
	   In January, JETRO opened its first office in Myanmar to promote
trade with Japan.
	   JETRO maintains offices in major cities around the world and in
Asia.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and Kobe Steel
Ltd. said Thursday they have jointly developed the world's smallest
network audio player.
	   The two companies plan to commercialize the player, tentatively
called SolidAudio, in the first half of the next fiscal year, which
starts in April 1999.
	   The credit card-sized player obtains audio contents by
downloading from network-computer ports in houses, offices and
public places, and its 16-megabyte memory enables it to play back
at compact disc quality, the two companies said.
	   NTT and Kobe Steel said they aim to ship 1 million players by
the year 2002, and anticipate sales of 30 billion yen (dlrs 210
million) by adding related audio networking services.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's cash-strapped Ministry of
Defense made a profit of more than 200 million baht (dlrs 4.8
million) this year selling mosquito repellent to neighboring
Malaysia, local papers reported Thursday.
	   The Thai military has been forced to accept budget cuts because
of the country's economic crisis, and the defense ministry has been
searching for alternate sources of income.
	   Thailand and Malaysia contain pockets of forest where malaria, a
mosquito-borne disease, is still a threat.
	   The repellent is made by the military's pharmaceutical plant and
the sale of each lot needs Cabinet approval, said Defense Permanent
Secretary Yuthasak Sasiprap, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   Yuthasak also said the ministry was profiting by selling
explosives to Malaysia and other countries, although he did not
give details.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines Inc. asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to give it 60 more days to
detail a rehabilitation plan aimed at nursing the cash-strapped
airline back to profitability.
	   The initial 30-day period, within which Philippine Airlines
enjoys a reprieve from paying debts, was given to the airline on
June 24 and will expire Thursday. Last week, the company sought
another 30-day extension to file the detailed plan, citing
difficulties in working out the plan.
	   But after some of its ground crew personnel went on strike
Wednesday, Philippine Airlines said it will need two more months _
instead of one _ ``to prepare and submit a sound and viable
rehabilitation plan.''
	   Broadly, the airline wants to reduce its fleet and work force
and restructure debts amounting to dlrs 2.1 billion owed primarily
to banks and aircraft lessors.
	   The airline also asked the SEC to postpone a hearing scheduled
for Friday, where the company was supposed to present its
rehabilitation plan to creditors.
	   The SEC had indicated its readiness to grant another extension,
but first wanted an assurance it would be the first and last.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's leading automaker
Hyundai Motor was sending a letter of intent Thursday to bid for
Kia Motors Corp. and its commercial vehicle maker, Asia Motors Co.,
a Hyundai spokesman said.
	   Earlier this week, Samsung Motors Inc. sent its letter, becoming
the first to do so among 23 automakers invited to join in the
auction of the two troubled companies.
	   Last week, Korea Development Bank put Kia and Asia Motors up for
international sale as part of its efforts to end the controversy
over the companies' future.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ After much haggling over the past few
weeks, the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications finally signed the contract
Thursday to build the country's massive north-to-south rail line.
	   ``The rail project will surely boost Taiwan's economic growth
... and will create 97,000 new jobs per year'' in the cement, steel
and infrastructure sectors, Premier Vincent Siew said at the
signing ceremony.
	   The build-operate-transfer rail link will connect the northern
capital of Taipei with the southern port city of Kaohsiung at a
cost of more than 400 billion Taiwan dollars (dlrs 11.62 billion).
	   The signing was delayed twice over disputes about the
government's ability to complete 20 infrastructure projects related
to the rail line and about a deposit placed by Taiwan High Speed
Rail. It was originally supposed to be signed July 1.

Death toll rises to 126 as flood situation worsens in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of paramedics fanned out
across flooded lowlands Thursday to prevent the outbreak of
waterborne diseases, with nearly one-fourth of Bangladesh under
water, officials and newspapers reported.
	   Another 13 people were reported to have died Wednesday from
drowning or were crushed under collapsing houses, raising the
number of flood-related deaths to 126 in the past two weeks, The
Independent newspaper said.
	   Unrelenting rain lashing the flood-hit districts hampered relief
efforts, officials said. Hundreds of schools were turned into
relief camps.
	   Nearly 18,000 health workers carried water purifying tablets,
dry food and lifesaving drugs to the 15 worst-hit districts,
including Kurigram where nearly 100 people were stricken with
diarrhea and dysentery. Kurigram is 240 kilometers (150 miles)
north of Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital.
	   Fed by the monsoon rains upstream in India, the Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers are swelling, displacing 10 million
people across 29 of Bangladesh's 64 districts in the north, center
and west, newspaper reports said.
	   The floods have caused massive damage to crops, washed away
mud-and-straw dwellings and disrupted road and rail communications
across the country.
	   Bangladesh is a low-lying delta nation of 120 million people.
Floods and cyclones kill hundreds of people every year.

South Korea's militant labor group suspends strike plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with management's protest, grafs 10-11 bgng, `The
Korea Employers'...' &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant labor group suspended plans
to call a nationwide strike Thursday, reporting ``significant
progress'' in talks with the government to limit rising layoffs.
	   But Hyundai Motor Co. workers, who began an indefinite strike
Monday, said they will continue their walkout until management
cancels mass layoff plans.
	   In response to a call by the maverick Confederation of Korean
Trade Unions, subway, telephone and hospital workers were to have
joined a strike that was begun earlier in the week by union members
in the auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But the umbrella labor group abruptly suspended plans to expand
the strike to all of its 500,000 members, saying it was making
progress in overnight talks with the government, which continued
late Thursday morning.
	   ``We have suspended our full strike plans because of significant
progress and to give impetus to efforts by both sides to forge an
agreement,'' said Oh Dong-jin, a spokesman for the confederation.
	   Oh said, however, that the decision was not binding on workers
at Hyundai Motor Co. and other individual work sites who have
``special reasons'' to continue their protest.
	   In overnight talks, the government promised to try to limit
layoffs in the country's large auto plants, banks and a dozen
state-run companies ordered to slim down to cut costs and improve
efficiency.
	   The government also promised to reconsider its decision to
arrest about 100 union leaders charged with instigating illegal
strikes.
	   ``We have heard such promises before. This time we want more
concrete commitments from the government,'' Oh said.
	   The Korea Employers' Federation accused the government of
dealing with ``lawbreakers,'' and threatened to pull out of
government-sponsored talks with labor to settle layoffs and other
disputes.
	   ``We cannot sit down at the same table with lawbreakers,'' the
federation said in a statement urging punishment for illegal
strikers.
	   In Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, Hyundai
workers said they will continue to protest the company's plan to
lay off 2,678 workers next week. The nation's largest auto firm
earlier shed 5,000 workers.
	   But workers of Daewoo Motor Co., the nation's second largest
auto company, returned to work Thursday when the company reopened
its main plant outside Seoul after a three-day shutdown.
	   Since May, the labor confederation has called several
short-lived strikes to protest layoffs by manufacturers seeking to
cut costs in the face of plummeting sales.
	   The government called the strikes illegal and threatened to
arrest some 100 union leaders. It fears labor unrest will scare
away needed foreign investment.
	   Layoffs are spreading as South Korea struggles to overcome its
worst economic crisis ever. A flexible labor market aimed at
restructuring South Korea's bloated industries is a key condition
of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have collapsed in the
past six months under the IMF-set conditions. The number of jobless
people has doubled to 1.5 million and is expected to reach 2
million by year's end.
	   One of the hardest hit sectors is the automobile industry, which
has seen sales drop by more than 50 percent. Hyundai, for example,
is operating at 40 percent of its capacity of 1.25 million vehicles
a year.

Laid-off Thai textile workers still negotiating compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The owner of one of Thailand's largest
textile companies has agreed to pay more than 5,000 laid-off
workers a full month's salary, but the workers want more, a Labor
Ministry official said Thursday.
	   Thai Melon Textile Co. closed its factory July 16 because, with
Thai banks suffering a liquidity crunch, it could no longer obtain
loans to buy raw materials. The closure left more than 5,000
employees without jobs.
	   Legally, more than 1,000 of the workers who are 20-year veterans
of the company are entitled to 6.5 months' severance. Others are
also entitled to several months compensation depending on length of
service.
	   Negotiations between the two sides are continuing, the Labor
Ministry official said.
	   Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai authorized the
government to seize the assets of Thai Melon and liquidate them to
compensate the employees.
	   The seizure, however, would be a measure of last resort, and the
government has said it would try to help Thai Melon stay in
business.
	   The Bangkok Post on Thursday quoted Labor Minister Trairong
Suwannakhiri as saying the government is prepared to fight on
behalf of the workers.
	   Following the closing last week, some 3,000 employees refused to
leave the factory grounds until they received assurances their
demands would be heard.
	   More than 1 million Thais have become unemployed since the
nation's financial crisis began in July 1997.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Nine Russian peacekeepers were wounded
when a radio-activated mine blew up their truck in Georgia's
separatist region of Abkhazia, an official said Thursday.
	   The attack took place Wednesday night outside the Khumeni
village, where Russian peacekeepers are stationed, said Interior
Ministry spokesman Murad Andzhaparadze. Five Russian troops were
killed July 11 in a similar incident.
	   Russian military spokesman Alexei Vlasov blamed the attack on
``gunmen waging an undeclared war in the zone controlled by Russian
peacekeepers,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He did not name any group specifically, but his remarks appeared
to be a reference to militias loyal to Georgia's central
government. They have been blamed for a number of previous attacks
against Russian peacekeepers and rebels in Abkhazia.
	   But Andzhaparadze, the Georgian official, said Abkhazian
separatists were to blame.
	   ``The region is controlled now by peacekeepers and Abkhazian
fighters. Abkhazian fighters plant mines and it is not the first
time that peacekeepers and the population have suffered from
this,'' he said.
	   Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war between Georgian
government troops and Abkhazian separatists. The peacekeepers have
helped prevent a resumption of full-scale fighting, but occasional
clashes still occur.
	   More than 60 Russian peacekeepers have been killed in the region
since 1994.
	   In another development, Georgian officials identified a man
suspected of killing a Polish United Nations worker in the Georgian
capital Tbilisi, Interfax said, citing an announcement from
Georgia's Interior Ministry.
	   The 20-year-old suspect, Zurab Bregvadze, allegedly shot Maria
Magdalena Wewiorska at point-blank range four times in the head as
she returned to her apartment last week. Georgian police are still
searching for Bregvadze, Interfax said.

Flash flood hits Polish resort, four feared dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Flood waters from heavy storms swept
through a resort area in southwestern Poland, leaving one man dead
and three people missing, officials said Thursday.
	   The overnight flash flood damaged about 100 houses in Duszniki
Zdroj, Szczytna and Polanica Zdroj near the border with the Czech
Republic, said Piotr Michalski, spokesman for Walbrzych province.
	   One man was reported drowned in Duszniki after the water level
in the Dusznica Bystrzycka river jumped 1.5 meters (59 inches),
overflowed its banks and flooded the town.
	   Three people were missing after the wave tore away part of their
house in Duszniki, some 460 kilometers (285 miles) southwest of
Warsaw, police said.
	   About 90 residents were evacuated overnight, Michalski said.
Waters receded quickly, but helicopters continued to bring people
out Thursday morning, he said.
	   A road to the border crossing with the Czech Republic at Kudowa
Zdroj was temporarily closed by the flooding. It was expected to
reopen late Thursday, Michalski said.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.

Philips reports net operating profit increase in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Royal Philips Electronics NV said
Thursday its net operating profit in the first half rose to 1.57
billion guilders (dlrs 785 million), up from 1.15 billion guilders
(dlrs 575 million) in the same period a year ago.
	   Philips said the period was characterized by a higher price
erosion, which amounted to 8 percent from 6 percent in the first
half of 1997.
	   Net operating profit in the second quarter rose to 854 million
guilders (dlrs 427 million) from 693 million guilders (dlrs 346
million) a year ago.
	   In the first half, extraordinary gain totaled 1.02 billion
guilders (dlrs 510 million), up from 481 million guilders (dlrs 240
million) previously.
	   The gain came from the sale of Philips Car Systems to Germany's
Mannesmann VDO and the sale of the Optoelectronics unit to Uniphase
Corp.
	   Philips is also in the process of selling its 75 percent stake
in the entertainment group PolyGram NV to Canada's Seagram Co.,
which also owns Universal Studios.
	   Turning to the remainder of the year, the electronics giant said
business performance will in part depend on the influence of Asia's
financial crisis on the rest of the world.
	   ``The problems in Asia are more fundamental and longer lasting
than was anticipated,'' Philips said in a statement.
	   But the company added it would continue to focus on issues which
are within its control like costs, productivity, capital
expenditure and working capital.

Hong Kong stocks close lower on doubts about Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stock prices finished lower Thursday
on doubts about Japan's new leadership and a possible downgrade of
its debt rating.
	   U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's forecast that
China's gross domestic product will grow by 6.8 percent instead of
the official Beijing forecast of 8 percent also hurt investor
confidence.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
lost 244.47 points, or 2.9 percent, closing at 8,176.25. It was the
lowest level since July 14.
	   Moody's Investors Service announced early Thursday that it may
downgrade its rating for Japan's government debt. Japan's current
triple-A is the best possible rating.
	   With Greenspan's pessimistic forecast of China's GDP, analysts
said Moody's announcement prompted speculation of a possible second
round of currency problems, and a ``trickle-down negative effect''
of a weakening yen on China and Hong Kong.
	   ``A weaker yen has a major impact on Southeast Asian exports and
Hong Kong's re-exports of Chinese goods. All these would slow
down,'' said Kent Rossiter, senior investment adviser at Nikko
Securities.
	   The announcement by Moody's comes against a backdrop of
pessimism over Japan's ability to dig itself out of its slump.
	   The likelihood that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will be chosen
as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's president Friday, and
therefore become prime minister, also kept buyers away.
	   Obuchi would automatically become prime minister, since the
ruling LDP has majority of the lower house of parliament. He is
viewed as not aggressive on economic reform.
	   The day's biggest loser was banking giant HSBC Holdings,
shedding 8.00 Hong Kong dollars, or 4.1 percent, to close at
189.50.
	   Nearly all blue chips followed. Hutchison Whampoa shed 70 cents
to 38.50, and Cheung Kong Holdings lost 40 cents to 35.90.

Turkey's parliament approves tax reform aimed at cutting fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ After over a month of heated debate,
parliament has approved a tax reform bill that cracks down on fraud
and increases incentives for investments.
	   Deputies passed the bill in Turkey's single chamber on a vote of
219-66; only 285 deputies of the 550-member chamber were present.
	   The bill introduces prison terms of up to three years for tax
evaders and makes filing easier.
	   ``This new tax regime is a big step in the battle against
inflation and will help economic development,'' Finance Minister
Zekeriya Temizel said after the vote.
	   The government, which has been pushing reform since it came to
power a year ago, has vowed to half the country's 100 percent
annual inflation by the end of the year.
	   The tax reform provides for a variety of exemptions on
investment capital.
	   It also raises the taxes soccer players pay on salaries which
have soared in this soccer-fanatic country. Under the reforms,
players can be taxed up to 45 percent of their income.
	   Soccer players now pay 15 percent _ 10 percent below the average
rate for millions of people making the monthly minimum wage of dlrs
150.
	   The bill also includes tax breaks for civil servants.

Mavericks launch push to stop frontrunner's bid to become Japanese
</HEADLINE>
premier
 &UR; With BC-Japan-Politics
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Rebel lawmakers are threatening to bolt the ruling
party and boycott the vote for Japan's new prime minister in a
last-ditch effort to prevent the frontrunner from winning, a
legislator's spokesman said Thursday.
	   Softspoken Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was reportedly closing
in on a winning majority of votes in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's ballot for party president _ a post that virtually
guarantees the premiership in a vote in Parliament expected next
week.
	   But a band of LDP dissidents backing Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi is now trying to spoil Obuchi's chances with threats to
break away from the party, said a spokesman for LDP lawmaker
Shinichiro Kurimoto, a Koizumi supporter.
	   The threat would not directly jeapardize Obuchi's run for party
president on Friday, and the numbers of rebel lawmakers _ not even
two dozen _ would probably not be enough to derail his chances of
winning the vote for premier in Parliament.
	   But a breakaway would be a major embarrassment for the LDP as it
struggles to restore trust in its leadership in the wake of its
devastating defeat in upper house elections on July 12, which
toppled Prime Minister Hashimoto's administration.
	   ``If these mad mavericks are talking about a rebellion then
there's trouble in the horizon for the LDP,'' said John Neuffer, a
political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, a Tokyo
think tank.
	   The rebel lawmakers are saying they may keep away from the
ballot next week in Parliament if Obuchi is the LDP candidate, said
Kurimoto's spokesman, who identified himself only by his surname
Asahina.
	   The handful of dissidents urged drastic action at a meeting of
20 younger lawmakers Wednesday night to derail Obuchi's bid after
seeing polls showing him far ahead of his two rivals, Kyodo News
agency reported Thursday, citing participants. The rebels suggested
refecting from the party or abstaining from the Parliament vote,
Kyodo said.
	   If party discipline rules, the new party head is virtually
guaranteed to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
because the LDP has a majority in the lower house which votes for
the premier.
	   Last week, a wave of protest by some of the same legislators
disrupted the LDP's usually placid consensus-building procedure to
rally around a single candidate for party president. The dissidents
lashed out at the backroom maneuvering that had propelled Obuchi
into the frontrunner's seat, and their objections heralded the
arrival of Koizumi and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama into the race.
	   The young lawmakers argued that behind-the-scenes
decision-making had contributed to the LDP's upper house election
defeat and that the party needed forceful leadership to woo back
the disgruntled Japanese public.
	   Many of the rebels have thrown their support behind Koizumi in
the hope that he will be able to match the appeal of the main
opposition Democratic Party's leader, Naoto Kan, widely considered
Japan's most popular politician.
	   However, surveys of LDP members eligible to vote suggest that
Obuchi is once again the clear favorite to win Friday's contest,
having secured between 180 and 200 of the 208 votes he needs to
gain a majority.
	   But analysts said the contest is far from over.
	   ``Hedge your bets,'' Neuffer said. ``The situation's still very
fluid.''

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ In a show of political strength,
Cambodian leader Hun Sen mustered convoys of trucks and thousands
of supporters Thursday to parade through the Cambodian capital and
countryside three days before parliamentary elections.
	   But Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-premier Hun Sen deposed in
a coup last year, demonstrated his continued personal popularity in
a surprise visit to the capital's main market. He was mobbed by
enthusiastic vendors and shoppers who knocked over goods and
smashed glass booths as they crushed into the narrow aisles.
	   ``They know that only a government led by me, myself, will get
international support to rebuild this country,'' Ranariddh
enthused.
	   Cambodia's senior Buddhist monk led a chant for peace to calm
nerves frayed by the violence-marred campaign. There have been
daily reports of opposition activists murdered, and fear is
widespread that Hun Sen would call out the army to retain power if
the vote goes against him. He denies it.
	   Several motorcades comprising hundreds of trucks drove through
Phnom Penh in the morning, rolling past the fairy-tale Royal Palace
and along the Bassac river with bullhorns blaring slogans for the
ruling Cambodian People's Party. Supporters waved flags and
shouted, ``Chai-yo!'' or ``Bravo!''
	   Party officials said they were part of a larger demonstration
that would put 11 separate convoys totaling 743 trucks and some
28,000 supporters on the roads from Kandal province, a Hun Sen
stronghold that surrounds Phnom Penh. Not all the convoys were
intended to go through the capital. Each supporter was paid 10,000
riels (about dlrs 2.50).
	   The motorcades demonstrated Hun Sen's unrivaled party
organization in the provinces, but generated little enthusiasm
among people in the capital, where memories remain fresh of tank
and mortar fire from last year's takeover.
	   By contrast, Ranariddh's appearance at the Central Market
resembled the arrival of a rock star. Surrounded by bodyguards to
make room to breathe, the prince was doused in sweat as he greeted
mobs of vendors and shoppers pushing forward to see and touch him.
Glass display cases were smashed by people crushing forward.
	   The cases would normally have contained gold, but nervous
traders have closed this week amid fears of a wave of kidnappings
and possible post-election violence.
	   Ranariddh said: ``I feel very encouraged, not only here in Phnom
Penh, but all over.''
	   While he was confident Cambodians would support his royalist
FUNCINPEC party, he was worried that Hun Sen's control of the
electoral machinery would lead to rampant cheating.
	   ``We have to be absolutely cautious about counting to prevent
cheating,'' Ranariddh said. ``I am still worried about what will
happen after election day.''
	   Jacques Carrio, an official with the U.N. agency overseeing 678
foreign observers, said no major problems had been reported with
his teams.
	   ``We've had a few logistical last-minute adjustments but nothing
serious,'' Carrio said. ``In most cases, everyone has reached his
or her duty station. Unfortunately, two Norwegians came down with
dengue fever.''
	   But questions still lingered over how many Cambodian observers
would be deployed, and whether they would come from Hun Sen-linked
groups or independent watchdog bodies.
	   Sam Rainsy, the other main opposition candidate and probably
even more popular in Phnom Penh than the prince, was campaigning in
the provinces. Hun Sen recuperated at home from an emergency
appendectomy last Friday.
	   Election results are not expected to be announced for a week.
	   Earlier, Buddhist patriarch Maha Ghosananda, who has been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for heading peace marches
through war-torn territory, led several score monks and nuns in a
chant and three minutes of meditation for a peaceful election.
	   Ranariddh's party finished atop U.N.-sponsored elections backed
by 20,000 peacekeepers in 1993, but he was forced to share power
when Hun Sen threatened civil war.
	   Hun Sen came to power in 1985 under the harsh Vietnamese
military occupation that succeeded the genocidal Khmer Rouge
regime. He has permitted Ranariddh to return to contest the
elections to win back international legitimacy and aid.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president narrowly survived a
car bombing Thursday that badly damaged his motorcade and killed
one of his bodyguards in the capital of the rebel republic.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov was traveling through the streets of
Grozny when the powerful car bomb exploded, setting his
four-wheel-drive vehicle ablaze and destroying other vehicles in
the road, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov rushed from his burning car unharmed, but one
bodyguard was killed and six were wounded, officials said at a news
conference shortly after the attack.
	   The blast completely destroyed several cars and shattered
windows in nearby buildings.
	   The bombing escalated an already tense situation in Chechnya,
where Maskhadov's moderate government has been unable to restore
law-and-order despite the end of the 1994-6 war between Chechen
rebels and the Russian government.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell
on Islamic militants who have been feuding with Maskhadov's
government in recent weeks.
	   Maskhadov has cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists who
want to build a state based on a strict interpretation of Shariah,
or Islamic law.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis. The Wahhabis
include native Chechens as well as some guerrilla fighters who came
from other Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's war against
Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of the Wahhabis.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild its shattered economy.
	   Chechnya and Russia have been holding periodic negotiations,
mostly about economic cooperation, but they have made no
breakthroughs on the key issue of Chechnya's political status.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.

Indonesia appoints team to investigate deadly riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government appointed a
19-member fact-finding team Thursday to investigate the cause of
riots in May that left about 1,200 people dead.
	   The scale of the mayhem in the capital, Jakarta, and other
cities shocked Indonesians and foreign investors alike and helped
force President Suharto to step down, ending 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   The government said it had appointed senior army and police
generals along with bureaucrats, human rights activists and members
of several private organizations to the team.
	   Critics of the government and the military accuse both of doing
little to stop the violence on May 13 and 14.
	   Others have suggested that the riots were organized to shake
Suharto's grip on power, which already had been weakened by
unrelenting student protests and the worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Justice Minister Muladi, a former member of the National Human
Rights Commission, said the investigation would be carried out in
an open and transparent manner to find out who was responsible for
the violence.
	   He said the appointment of the team ``is a reflection of the
government's concern for the protection of human rights.''
	   Women's groups say gangs committed at least 168 rapes. Thousands
of homes and buildings were looted, ransacked and burned.
Rock-throwing mobs smashed windows and destroyed cars.
	   The main targets of the violence were members of Indonesia's
Chinese minority, who have been made scapegoats for soaring
inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Chinese account for only a tiny fraction of Indonesia's 202
million people. However, they control much of the economy and are
resented by some indigenous Indonesians.
	   On Wednesday, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie,
formed a separate independent commission to investigate rapes
during the riots.
	   Women's groups claim most of the rape victims were Chinese women
and girls, as young as 9 years old. At least 20 of them died after
being attacked.
	   Also Wednesday, Habibie reassured a group of ethnic Chinese
business people that the government and armed forces would protect
them.
	   Analysts say that many Chinese have left Indonesia and have
withdrawn capital from its struggling economy.

German baritone Hermann Prey dead at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German baritone and director Hermann
Prey, who sang on some of the world's greatest opera stages, has
died, his management agency said Thursday. He was 69.
	   Prey apparently suffered a heart attack late Wednesday or early
Thursday, agency spokeswoman Gesine Lange said. He died at his home
near Munich.
	   Prey was on stage at a Munich theater only last Sunday, Lange
said.
	   A Berlin native, he made his debut at the State Theater in
Wiesbaden in 1952. He sang at New York's Metropolitan Opera, the
Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, in London and in Dresden.
	   He also directed, notably Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro'' at
festivals in the Austrian composer's home town of Salzburg.
	   Prey is survived by a wife and three children. Funeral
arrangements were not immediately announced.

Buddhist monks hold chanting ceremony for peaceful election

	   TAKHMAU, Cambodia (AP) _ Buddhist monks and nuns did their part
for a peaceful election Thursday, chanting and meditating in a bid
to bring calm as a violence-marred campaign draws to a close.
	   Scores of Buddhist clergy, who have been staging a peace march
for the past week, stopped at the home of the country's election
chief for a ceremony attended by diplomats and hundreds of ordinary
citizens.
	   The prayers were led by Maha Ghosananda, the country's supreme
Buddhist patriarch, who has been nominated several times for the
Nobel Peace Prize for leading peace marches into war-torn,
mine-infested parts of the country.
	   The elections have been marred by more than 20 reported
political killings since mid-June. The opposition blames most of
them on leader Hun Sen, who has called the polls in an effort to
win back international legitimacy and aid after deposing his
co-prime minister last year.
	   Chheng Phon, chairman of the National Election Commission, which
is packed with Hun Sen supporters, gave a speech thanking the
international community for its support. Many hope the election
will bring stability after last year's coup.
	   ``This is the first time Cambodians have conducted an election
by themselves,'' Chheng Phon said. ``All of us should be proud.
This is a historical moment.''
	   In fact, it is the first time Cambodia has conducted its own
election since 1993, when the United Nations supervised a national
poll as part of a dlrs 3 billion peacekeeping mission.
	   The 1993 election was the first democratic vote in decades.
Backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, it was meant to usher in a new era
of peace and democracy after decades of civil war and the genocidal
Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s, when as many as 2 million
people died.
	   The Khmer Rouge was still a guerrilla force to be reckoned with
in 1993, but is virtually extinct today after mass defections and
the loss of nearly all the territory it once controlled. The U.N.
role this time is largely limited to coordinating 678 foreign
observers.
	   In the ceremony, one monk chanted and another beat a drum as
Maha Ghosananda led the marchers down a dusty road and around a
bend to an open-air pavilion.
	   For the least few meters (yards), he was joined by ambassadors
from the United States, Japan, Russia and Singapore and senior U.N.
officials.
	   ``One of the concerns about the election is violence,'' said
U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Quinn. ``Ghosananda is in some way
deterring violence and giving people in Cambodia a hope for
reconciliation and that's why I'm here today.''
	   Ghosananda was shielded from a baking sun by a saffron parasol
printed with the slogan, ``Put down the gun, pick up the dharma,''
a Buddhist term for cosmic order.
	   Other marchers carried flags and placards saying: ``We want a
non-violent election.''
	   Chheng Phon called for ``all Cambodians to come out and vote and
show the will of the nation.''

Privatization: big step toward facing Americans, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The privatization of France's Aerospatiale, aimed
at restructuring Airbus and Europe's defense industry, is a major
step toward facing the American aerospace giants, France's finance
minister said Thursday.
	   ``If we want to fight back, and we can, ... we have to regroup
our forces,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the morning after the
leftist government announced the selloff and merger with
Lagardere's Matra.
	   ``Those large regroupings happened in the United States,
especially around Boeing, with the formation of aerospace giants
much stronger than before and involved in civil as well as military
aerospace,'' he said.
	   They are giants that ``France alone, England alone, Germany
alone'' cannot compete with, the finance minister told RTL radio.
	   Strauss-Kahn, who has spearheaded the leftist government's
pragmatic economic policies, said that ``obviously the role of the
state diminishes. It's the price of something aimed at allying with
the German Dasa and British Aerospace.''
	   The price in terms of jobs was unclear. Officials have yet to
say how the merger will affect what will be a combined work force
of 56,000 people. French unions have long fought privatizations of
the country's large state sector, fearing layoffs.
	   The government said the Aerospatiale-Matra merger will create
the fourth largest defense company in the world, with over 80
billion francs (about dlrs 13 billion) in annual sales.
	   The government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced the
merger late Wednesday night, in which Aerospatiale would acquire
Lagardere's Matra Hautes Technologies.
	   In return, Lagardere will get a sizable stake in Aerospatiale _
30 to 33 percent _ and will be the company's largest private
shareholder.
	   Matra Hautes Technologies is a holding company for all of
Lagardere's defense and space activities.
	   The state's share of Aerospatiale would be less than 50 percent,
the statement said.
	   They also said Aerospatiale's capital ``could later be opened to
other French or European private industrial companies, depending on
the European consolidation to come.''
	   Aerospatiale is a partner in the European aviation consortium
Airbus Industrie and ranks as France's heaviest hitter in the
aerospace and defense sector.
	   The governments of France, Germany, Spain and Britain have been
pushing for the creation of a unified European civil and military
aerospace company to rival U.S. giants Lockheed Martin Corp. and
Boeing.
	   The French government's reluctance to part with its majority
ownership in Aerospatiale was a sticking point in discussions. It
complicated efforts toward turning Airbus into a private company
able to issue stock to raise funds for further expansion as it
takes on Boeing.

Japanese, South Korean officials discuss new fisheries treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan and South Korea opened two days of
working-level talks Thursday on a new fisheries treaty, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.
	   It was the third round of working-level talks since April.
	   Japan pulled out of the 1965 fisheries pact with South Korea in
January after nearly two years of talks failed to produce an
agreement on redrawing exclusive fishing zones under the 1994 U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
	   South Korea retaliated quickly by allowing its boats to fish
freely in waters close to Japan. Those waters outside Japan's
statutory 12-nautical mile (22.4-kilometer) zone were off-limits to
South Korean fishing boats under a separate bilateral accord.
	   Taking a conciliatory stance, however, South Korea decided early
this month to restore the ban.
	   The U.N. Convention allows a country to claim exclusive fishing
rights within 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) of its shores.
	   Japan and South Korea are less than 400 nautical miles (740
kilometers) apart, so their exclusive zones would overlap in some
places.
	   Officials of the two nations have agreed to resolve the
fisheries dispute before South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
visit to Japan, scheduled for this fall.

Russian Central Bank reserves down to dlrs 13.6 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Central Bank's hard-currency reserves
edged down to dlrs 13.6 billion this week from dlrs 13.7 billion on
July 10, the bank's press service said Thursday.
	   Central Bank reserves have been slipping during the country's
financial crisis in recent months. The bank has spent large sums to
defend the Russian ruble, which has remained relatively steady at
around 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The pressure on the ruble has eased since Russia reached an
agreement earlier this month with the International Monetary Fund
and other lenders for dlrs 17 billion in new loans this year and
next.
	   Much of the money is expected to stay in the Central Bank to
boost its reserves.

Aborigines try to charge Australia's prime minister with genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aborigines on Thursday launched court
proceedings against Prime Minister John Howard, accusing him and
his government of genocide under a United Nations convention.
	   It is highly unlikely that Australia's court system will take
the case seriously.
	   Judge Ken Crispin spoke to the Aborigines at a protest campsite
outside the country's old Parliament House.
	   Seated by a smoking log campfire, the judge heard several
Aborigines allege genocide through conquest and its consequences
over the entire 210 years of white settlement in the land they once
occupied alone.
	   Aboriginal elder Ray Swan said the crime of genocide, now
recognized by the United Nations, has extended well beyond the
early days of white settlement, when his ancestors were pushed off
their tribal lands at gunpoint.
	   He said modern laws, such as the restriction of native land
rights that Howard pushed through Parliament earlier this month,
are still forcing Australia's 386,000 Aboriginal people to live in
ways that are killing them.
	   As a result, Aborigines are generally sicker than the other 18
million mostly white Australians. On average, they die some 20
years earlier.
	   The loss of Aboriginal languages and culture also amount to
genocide under the United Nations' 1948 genocide convention, Swan
said.
	   The Aboriginal lawyers handling the case also want to charge
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, right-wing populist leader
Pauline Hanson, and independent Tasmanian Sen. Brian Harradine,
whose last-minute compromise allowed Howard to get his plan
restricting Aboriginal land rights through Parliament.
	   Aboriginal elder Wadjularbinna told the judge, in a formal
courtroom hearing later, that although Australia had ratified the
U.N. convention against genocide, it had not backed it up with
national laws of its own.
	   The Aborigines are asking Crispin to order another court to
start proceedings.
	   The judge said the legal issues, on which he had to rule, are
narrow and technical.
	   But Wadjularbinna, a woman from the Gulf of Carpenteria, in
Australia's far north, disagreed.
	   ``I think you today can wash your hands, like Pontius Pilate
did,'' she said.
	   ``Or you can go down in history and say I am going to stand up
and step a little bit further,'' she added.
	   Howard did not appear in court.
	   The case was adjourned until Aug. 10.

Lawyer asks for release of Belgian man accused in pedophile slaying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with extradition request from Dutch authorities.

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ A lawyer for the Belgian man charged with
killing a convicted German pedophile last month in Italy has
requested his client's release from prison.
	   An appeal to free Robert van der Plancken, jailed in Pisa since
June 19, was made Wednesday, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   Plancken is accused of slaying Gert-Jan Ulrich; both were
allegedly part of an international child sex ring. Police say
Plancken was angry because Ulrich, 49, had tipped off police about
the group.
	   Dutch police are investigating the ring, which allegedly
sexually abused children as young as 12 months and put their
pictures on the Internet.
	   Dutch authorities have already requested Van der Plancken's
extradition, said police spokesman Jaap Hage in the Netherlands.
	   The extradition might take some time since Italian authorities
must first complete their own case, added Hage.
	   Following Ulrich's death, police found computer material in his
apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort containing images of
children being sexually abused.

ABB reports first-half net profits up 13 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-Swedish electrotechnical giant
Asea Brown Boveri on Thursday reported a net profit for the first
half of 1998 up 13 percent on the same period last year.
	   The engineering and power generator company earned dlrs 638
million over the six months, up from dlrs 567 million a year
earlier.
	   But group orders for the period fell to dlrs 17.91 billion from
dlrs 18.92 billion in 1997, while sales fell to dlrs 14.49 billion
from dlrs 15.2 billion. Both orders and sales declined by 5
percent.
	   Overall demand ``continued to grow in most of Europe, the
Americas, the Middle East and Africa,'' ABB said in a statement.
	   ``As expected, ongoing economic and political uncertainties in
Asia reduced demand in that region,'' it added.
	   ``We had a very strong first half year in 1997 and this was
difficult to match,'' chief financial officer Renato Fassbind said.
	   In February, ABB reported a net annual profits for 1997 of dlrs
572 million, compared with dlrs 1.23 billion in 1996.
	   That drop was largely due to the cost of moving some of its
western European and U.S. operations to Southeast Asia, taking
advantage of the cheaper operating costs following the financial
turmoil there, the group said.
	   A positive impact on earnings from that cost will ``only be felt
in full from 1999 onwards,'' Fassbind said.

South Africa replace Ntini with Elworthy; England bowl first
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa surprised everyone at
Trent Bridge on the opening morning of the fourth cricket test
against England on Thursday by making a last-minute team reshuffle.
	   Debutant fast bowler Steve Elworthy, who was not in the 12-man
squad Wednesday, was brought into the starting side to replace
Makhaya Ntini as doubts were raised over the fitness of the Proteas
strike bowlers.
	   Ntini was carrying a bruised heel but reports indicated tour
selectors were not convinced with the fitness of Allan Donald or
Shaun Pollock, and decided Elworthy could shoulder the extra
bowling work-load.
	   Pollock returned to the side after missing the third test with a
strained quadriceps, while Donald has been restricted by an
impinging bone in his left ankle.
	   England, faced with a must win situation to keep the series
hopes alive, won the toss and decided to bowl first on an evenly
grassed Nottingham pitch.
	   The home side opted for the experience of Angus Fraser and
released left arm medium paceman Allan Mullally from the 12,
although selectors made four changes to the team which played the
third test at Old Trafford.
	   South Africa made two changes _ Pollock and Elworthy for the
injured Lance Klusener and Ntini respectively.
	   England: Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec

Arafat holds secret meeting with an Israeli negotiator

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the latest Mideast muddle,
Israel said Thursday it expected to resume negotiations with the
Palestinians shortly while the Palestinians announced they would
not return to the table.
	   Both sides have appealed to the United States for help, but have
been rebuffed by the Clinton administration which says Israel and
the Palestinians should try harder to reach agreement on a West
Bank troop pullback without U.S. mediation.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for a gradual Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, to coincide with
greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan, but Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the pullback
and has demanded better Palestinian security guarantees.
	   The Palestinians have said that in three negotiating sessions
this week, Israel did not raise any new ideas and that there was no
point in resuming the talks.
	   Late Wednesday, Netanyahu dispatched his envoy, Yitzhak Molcho,
to persuade Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree to more
talks. However, Arafat wants to hold off on further negotiations
until Israel accepts the American peace proposal, said a senior
Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Despite the Palestinians' position, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai was optimistic Thursday. ``I think the talks will
continue soon. I think there is a basis for progress in the
talks,'' Mordechai said.
	   The negotiations were arranged by the United States after it
announced earlier this month that it has exhausted its role as
mediator. The talks were widely seen as a last chance for Israel
and the Palestinians to reach agreement on a troop pullback.
	   The United States appeared in no hurry to return to the scene.
	   The sides ``ought to try harder'' to solve their differences,
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in response to appeals by
both Israel and the Palestinians that the United States intervene.
	   In another attempt to bring the United States back into the
picture, Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called U.S.
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on Netanyahu's behalf,
Israel army radio said.
	   Sharansky asked that U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross return to
the region for another shuttle mission, but Berger rejected the
idea, the radio said.

Tribunal investigation exonerates prison staff in inmate suicide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Staff at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal were not to blame in the suicide of a Serb suspect who
hanged himself in his cell last month, an internal investigation by
the U.N. court found.
	   ``All the rules of the detention unit concerning security and
safety were observed,'' tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said
Thursday. ``No negligent behavior was identified.''
	   Slavko Dokmanovic's lifeless body was found hanging on the hinge
of a wardrobe in his cell in the early hours of June 29. His death
was the first in the tribunal's cells.
	   Chartier revealed that Dokmanovic had made two earlier attempts
to take his life the same evening but they were not spotted by
guards who checked his cell every 30 minutes.
	   A post mortem investigation showed that Dokmanovic had attempted
to slash veins in his arm and to hang himself before he finally
succeeded in taking his life.
	   The half-hourly checks, which consisted of a guard looking
through a small window in Dokmanovic's cell door, were ``one of the
highest levels of supervision'' at the tribunal's disposal,
Chartier said.
	   The internal investigation was carried out by tribunal judge
Almiro Rodrigues. Dutch authorities are conducting a separate probe
into the suicide and are expected to publish their findings within
a week.
	   In his final report, Rodrigues recommended setting up a working
group to study prison suicides and suggest possible amendments to
the tribunal's rules of detention.
	   Dokmanovic's trial had ended days before his death. He had
pleaded innocent to playing a key role in the November 1991
massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs near the eastern Croatian city
of Vukovar.
	   The victims allegedly were rounded up from the city's hospital
and driven by Serb forces to a nearby farm where they were severely
beaten before being executed and buried in a mass grave.
	   The case was closed following Dokmanovic's death.
	   Dokmanovic, 48, was one of 27 suspects in tribunal custody. The
court has publicly indicted 60 people for alleged atrocities in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   Dokmanovic complained of depression before his trial and on the
night of his death had expressed fears for his family's safety to a
prison physician, Chartier said.
	   After being examined by the physician, he was placed under
supervision and checked by guards every 30 minutes. Guards decided
against stripping his cell of potentially dangerous objects
including razor blades and ties.
	   Dokmanovic, Vukovar's former mayor, was last seen alive at 11:30
p.m. on June 28. When a guard next passed by his cell around
midnight, the light was off and the body was found dangling in the
darkened cell, Chartier added.
	   Dokmanovic's lawyer, Toma Fila said his client was
psychologically disturbed and was taking medication ``so he could
stand the trial.''
	   Fila reportedly had warned the tribunal in a faxed message that
Dokmanovic was suicidal. Chartier declined to comment on the fax's
content.
	   Dokmanovic was allowed regular meetings with a psychiatrist
because of his depression but he had never been identified as a
suicide risk.
	   Dokmanovic did not leave a suicide note, but he did call his
wife early on the day before his death, Chartier said. The contents
of the phone call were not revealed.

Malaysian share prices hit nine-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's new economic recovery
plan failed to impress the stock market, where share prices fell
Thursday to a nine-year low on fears of weakness in the banking
sector and growing corporate debt problems.
	   The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Index fell 6.51
points, or 1.5 percent, closing at 415.40.
	   About 162 million shares changed hands, compared with 93.4
million shares Wednesday.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, weakened to 4.16 to the U.S.
dollar from 4.12 Wednesday.
	   The nation's new economic recovery plan, announced Thursday
afternoon, focused on maintaining currency and price stability,
while continuing the country's social policies.
	   Daim Zainuddin, the special economics minister, outlined the
plan, which also included liberalized rules for foreign investment
in the manufacturing industry to boost the slagging economy.
	   Dealers said there was some disappointment that the recovery
plan didn't allow for increased foreign ownership in banks. That
cap currently stands at 30 percent.
	   Moreover, banking stocks took a beating following Standard and
Poor's announcement Wednesday that it was putting banking giant
Malayan Banking Bhd. on credit watch with negative implications.
The agency suggested that government pressure to increase lending
could adversely affect the bank's asset quality.
	   In other bad news for the market, United Engineers (Malaysia)
Bhd. said its 45 percent-owned unit Mekar Idaman was put into
receivership because of its default on 570 million ringgit (dlrs
139 million) in debt.
	   Although UEM said the default would not have a financial impact,
this latest corporate default has raised pessimism.

Chechnya's president survives assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comments from Chechen president. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president narrowly survived a
powerful car bomb attack that badly damaged his motorcade and
killed his top bodyguard Thursday in the capital of the rebel
republic.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov was traveling through the streets of
Grozny when the car bomb exploded, damaging his Nissan Patrol
four-wheel-drive vehicle and destroying other vehicles in the road.
	   Maskhadov emerged from his car with only a minor knee wound, but
one bodyguard was killed and six were wounded, the president told a
news conference shortly after the attack.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who spoke
energetically and appeared well. ``To my great regret, my best
bodyguard was killed.''
	   The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments, and at least
two cars in the president's motorcade were completely burned. The
blast also shattered windows in nearby buildings.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   The bombing escalated an already tense situation in Chechnya,
where Maskhadov's moderate government has been unable to restore
law-and-order despite the end of the 1994-6 war between Chechen
rebels and the Russian government.
	   ``The main thing now is not to allow a civil war,'' the
president said.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell
on Islamic militants who have been feuding with Maskhadov's
government in recent weeks.
	   Maskhadov has cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists who
want to build a state based on a strict interpretation of Shariah,
or Islamic law.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis. The Wahhabis
include native Chechens as well as guerrilla fighters who came from
other Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's war against Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of the Wahhabis.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild its shattered economy.
	   Chechnya and Russia have been holding periodic negotiations,
mostly about economic cooperation, but they have made no
breakthroughs on the key issue of Chechnya's political status.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.

Outspoken Iranian newspaper shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An outspoken newspaper that criticized
government officials in Iran has shut down after losing an appeal
to have its license restored, court sources and newspaper editors
said Thursday.
	   The Farsi-language daily Jameah's license was revoked last month
by the Justice Department, which is controlled by conservative
clergymen. Jameah was accused of publishing ``insults and lies.''
	   Its appeal was turned down by the appeals court on Wednesday,
court sources said in exchange for anonymity.
	   Earlier this year, owners of two other newspapers were fined for
allegedly publishing falsehoods. One of them closed his paper,
anticipating that the judiciary would cancel his license.
	   The crackdown on the press is the result of the power struggle
between influential hard-liners in the government and the moderate
President Mohammad Khatami who favors a free press and an open
society.
	   While newspaper licenses are given by the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance _ headed by a Khatami loyalist _ the power to
revoke the licenses rests with the Justice Department, which can
shut down any publication that it says has violated the country's
strict Islamic laws.
	   Jameah had started publishing last year after Khatami's election
in May 1997, and quickly became popular for its frank views on
Iranian politics and criticism of government officials.
	   Jameah's publishers now intend to bring out the newspaper under
a different name to skirt the rules, said editors who did not wish
to be identified.

Three Festina officials placed in custody over drug scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Three officials from the Festina team
expelled from the Tour de France were placed in custody Thursday
for their role in the doping scandal that has overshadowed the
famous cycling race.
	   Sporting directors Miguel Moreno and Michel Gros, as well as
logistical director Joel Sabiron, were placed in custody after
being questioned early Thursday by investigating judge Patrick
Keil, judicial officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
	   The team's cyclists, including last year's Tour runner-up, team
leader Richard Virenque and world champion Laurent Brochard, will
be questioned later Thursday and on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the French newspaper Le Parisien reported Thursday
that a Belgian judge investigating the case has documentation
proving that the team's riders took the banned drug EPO.
	   Belgian judge Eric Van de Sijpe has medical records and computer
files proving that EPO was supplied to team riders, Le Parisien
said.
	   Tour de France officials expelled the Festina team from the
three-week race last Friday after team director Bruno Roussel
admitted that EPO was being used by the team.
	   The Festina team is based in Lyon, south east France.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Iran has successfully tested a missile with a
range of about 800 miles (1,287 kilometers), meaning it could hit
Israel or Saudi Arabia and U.S. forces in the region, according to
published reports Thursday. U.S. intelligence agencies detected the
test late Tuesday or early Wednesday, tracking the launch and path
of the medium-range missile, according to reports in The New York
Times and The Washington Times. The officials, while sure of the
test, could not provide immediate information on the location of
the launch or landing, both inside Iran. ``This weapon would allow
Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey
and a tip of Russia,'' a senior official with U.S. President Bill
Clinton's administration told The New York Times. Another official,
also unidentified, told the Washington newspaper: ``It is a
significant development because it puts all U.S. forces in the
region at risk.'' Intelligence experts believe Iran bought the
missile from North Korea. (US-MISSILE TEST)
	   SISSANO LAGOON, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Faced with the threat of
disease from thousands of rotting corpses, Papua New Guinea may
resort to sealing off the area hardest-hit by a tidal wave and
evacuating the survivors, a senior official said Thursday. ``I
think the government will have to go with that decision and just
abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay,'' said
Andrew Kumbakor, the local member of Parliament, who is also the
vice finance minister. After letting nature take its course, he
said, engineers could enter the area and determine if water
supplies will be safe enough to ever allow resettlement. More than
1,200 people are confirmed dead after the tsunami smashed villages
on the north coast Friday, but another 6,000 villagers are missing
and feared dead, their bodies hidden in the impenetrable mangrove
swamps. (PAPUA NEW GUINEA-TSUNAMI)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court convicted Tehran's reformist mayor
of corruption Thursday and sentenced him to five years in prison in
a case that has come to symbolize the power struggle between
hard-liners and moderates in Iran's ruling clergy. The mayor,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was banned from holding public office for
20 years, fined 1.6 billion rials (dlrs 530,000) and sentenced to
60 lashes. The court said the flogging would be suspended because
of Karbaschi's social standing. Karbaschi has denied he ever stole
money from the government. The trial was widely seen as an attempt
by conservatives in the government to topple key officials allied
with moderate President Mohammad Khatami. (IRAN-MAYOR'S TRIAL).
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In their final appeals to Japanese voters, the
three candidates fighting to succeed Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto all promised Thursday to pull Japan out of its deepest
recession since World War II. Leading candidate Keizo Obuchi vowed
in his nationally televised speech to fix the economy by first
cleaning up the bad debt plaguing banks, then cutting income tax
and boosting public spending. The other candidates _ former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Health Minister Junichiro
Koizumi _ have offered much the same proposals, though Obuchi has
offered the most detailed ideas. Obuchi, foreign minister under
Hashimoto, is the favorite of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
establishment. Whoever the party picks at a meeting Friday is
virtually assured of becoming the next prime minister.

Chinese police release dissident, charge another

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly two weeks after hauling him away, Chinese
police freed a prominent dissident Thursday only to place him under
surveillance at home, a human rights group said.
	   Wang Donghai, detained for trying to form an opposition
political party, returned to his home in eastern Hangzhou city
Thursday afternoon, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Under the terms of his release, Wang may not leave his home
without police permission, the Hong Kong-based Information Center
said.
	   With Wang's release, four of at least 15 dissidents rounded up
in a widening crackdown on dissent remain in custody. Police have
focused the brunt of their action on the would-be China Democracy
Party, detaining 12 people with ties to the group.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center said one of the three
party organizers still being held, Wang Youcai, has been charged
with threatening state security, bringing him a step closer to
either prosecution or imprisonment without trial in a labor camp.
	   A labor rights activist not connected to the party but detained
in the clampdown, Zhang Shanguang, has been charged with the same
crime in southern Hunan province, the U.S.-based Human Rights in
China reported.
	   The arrests, detentions and the sentencing of one other
dissident mark the most concerted police action against China's
embattled dissident community in recent years.
	   Police began the sweep on July 10, a week after U.S. President
Bill Clinton wrapped up a nine-day tour of China during which he
called for greater political and religious freedoms.
	   Organizers of the China Democracy Party used Clinton's visit to
test the ruling Communist Party's tolerance and challenge its
political monopoly by setting up the party.
	   Wang Donghai and Wang Youcai, along with Lin Hui, who is still
being held, announced the party's formation on July 25, the day
Clinton arrived in China. But Chinese officials refused to let the
party register, as required by law.
	   The democracy campaigners' attempts to use Chinese leaders' own
campaign to build a rule of law to set up an opposition group have
drawn support from other dissidents at home and abroad.
	   Two veteran government critics whose campaigning dates to the
late 1970s, Mao Qingxiang and Wang Rongqing, applied Thursday for
police permission to hold a protest in Hangzhou in support of Wang
Youcai and the others detained, the Information Center said.
	   More than 100 exiled dissidents and Chinese scholars, mostly
based in the United States, signed a petition that also demanded
the democracy campaigners' release. The petition was released by
the U.S.-based Free China Network.
	   Zhang Shanguang, the detained labor activist arrested Wednesday,
was among 79 people who signed a petition last week protesting the
crackdown on the China Democratic Party. He was planning to form
his own association to protect the rights of laid-off workers, the
Information Center said.

NATO troops arrest two war crimes suspects in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers have
arrested two Bosnian Serbs charged with war crimes, a NATO press
release said Thursday.
	   Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad did not resist when troops
surrounded their house Wednesday evening to arrest them in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   They were immediately flown to The Hague, Netherlands, site of
an international war crimes tribunal, the NATO statement said.
	   The Banovic brothers are wanted for their alleged role as guards
at the infamous Keraterm prisoner camp near Prijedor during the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war. They are charged with grave breaches of the
Geneva Convention, torture or inhumane treatment and unlawful
confinement and other crimes.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier confirmed that the twins
had arrived in The Hague. Their arraignment, at which they will be
asked to enter pleas to the charges against them, likely will take
place Monday afternoon, Chartier said.
	   Predrag Banovic is charged with 32 counts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity, his brother Nenad is faces 10 counts.
	   ``This is one more corner which has been turned by this
tribunal,'' Chartier said. ``Today, the number of accused in our
jurisdiction, 30, is higher than the number of accused still at
large, namely 29. This is obviously a welcome development.''
	   No one was hurt in the operation to arrest the two, NATO said.
	   The father of the two arrested, Sreten Banovic, recently told a
local Bosnian Serb newspaper he had hoped his sons would slowly be
forgotten.
	   The newspaper Reporter described him as a man who had aged
considerably more than his years. He talked of the crimes his sons
allegedly had committed with a stone face.
	   ``The poorest always pay the most. I want to go and ask (Bosnian
Serb leader Momcilo) Krajisnik if we are all doomed because of the
leaders and whether only those without any money will have to pay
in the end.''
	   Sreten Banovic told Reporter he wished he could go to The Hague
in his sons' place. ``They were only soldiers, and everyone knows
soldiers have to follow orders,'' he said.

Malaysia liberalizes rules on foreign investment

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Thursday announced
liberalized rules for foreign investment as part of a new plan to
propel its economy on a recovery route.
	   The National Economic Recovery Plan suspends the current equity
cap of 51 percent if foreign companies invest in manufacturing
industries before Dec. 31, 1999. The only exceptions are industries
identified as strategic.
	   It was not immediately clear whether foreigners would be allowed
100 percent ownership in new investments.
	   ``The present economic conditions require that the potentials of
the manufacturing sector be maximized to generate growth, exports
and employment,'' said the plan.
	   The 191-page document is a blueprint for Malaysian recovery,
said Daim Zainuddin, a senior Cabinet minister who is also Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's chief economic aide. The plan has the
Cabinet's approval.
	   ``The situation we face is serious,'' said Daim, who heads an
economic firefighting unit. The government concedes the economy
could shrink by up to 2 percent this year.
	   ``But we must not be pessimistic. Economic recovery might not
come tomorrow, but it will come,'' he said.
	   Daim also announced that a politically sensitive affirmative
action program was being relaxed to allow non-Malays and possibly
foreigners to buy stakes in companies currently reserved for
Malays.
	   Under the quota system, at least 30 percent of the stake in any
Malaysian company has to be held by Malays, or Bumiputera, who form
60 percent of the 22 million citizens.
	   The move was intended to help many Malay shareholders suffering
in the hemorrhaging stock market. But it could also dilute the
holding of the dominant community in big companies.
	   The plan outlined six objectives for economic rehabilitation:
stabilizing the ringgit; restoring market confidence; maintaining
financial market stability; strengthening economic fundamentals;
continuing the equity and affirmative action program for indigenous
Malays; and restoring the adversely affected sectors.
	   The strategy was put together over the last seven months by the
National Economic Action Council, which was conceived by Mahathir
last year as a means of rapidly addressing the country's economic
problems.
	   Daim hoped that the economy would begin to pull out of recession
next year and reach growth of 5 percent in 2000.
	   He forecast that inflation would rise to about 8 percent this
year, while the rate of unemployment would double to 6.4 percent
from last year's 2.7 percent. Independent analysts have predicted a
higher rate for both.
	   Daim said the once-booming construction sector would be singled
out for government aid in the hope that it would generate spinoffs
in other sectors, such as steel and timber.
	   ``We have to recognize that the construction sector is one key
sector that should be encouraged,'' he said.
	   In recent weeks, the government has announced two fiscal
packages totaling 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion) to revive
many infrastructure and civil works projects that were stalled last
year at the onset of the currency and stock market tumble.
	   Daim said Malaysia would continue to decline help from the
International Monetary Fund, though it already had accepted a dlrs
1 billion loan from the World Bank. He said Malaysia was hopeful of
getting another dlrs 1 billion from Taiwan and had already received
dlrs 300 million from Japan.

Privatization: big step toward facing Americans, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news conference
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The privatization of France's Aerospatiale, aimed
at restructuring Airbus and Europe's defense industry, is a major
step toward facing the American aerospace giants, France's finance
minister said Thursday.
	   ``If we want to fight back, and we can, ... we have to regroup
our forces,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the morning after the
leftist government announced the partial selloff and merger with
Lagardere's Matra.
	   ``Those large regroupings happened in the United States,
especially around Boeing, with the formation of aerospace giants
much stronger than before and involved in civil as well as military
aerospace,'' he said.
	   They are giants that ``France alone, England alone, Germany
alone'' cannot compete with, the finance minister told RTL radio.
	   Strauss-Kahn, who has spearheaded the leftist government's
pragmatic economic policies, said that ``obviously the role of the
state diminishes. It's the price of something aimed at allying with
the German Dasa and British Aerospace.''
	   The price in terms of jobs was unclear for the new giant, with a
combined work force of 56,000 people. French unions have long
fought privatizations of the country's large state sector, fearing
layoffs.
	   ``This regrouping won't be a layoff machine,'' insisted Philippe
Camus, co-chief of Lagardere, at a news conference Thursday. But he
also said the new group ``will be a private company directed in
that fashion.''
	   The government has stopped short of using the leftist-sensitive
word ``privatization'' to describe the deal, noting instead that
the state interest combined with stock issued to the unionized
employees will still be over 50 percent.

	   KAWASAKI, Japan (AP) _ Yasuko Okumura is full of fears _ that
Japan's sour economy will ruin her husband's business, that her
pension fund will go bust, that her little girl's future will be
burdened by worries.
	   But as the three ruling party candidates to succeed resigning
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto blitz the media with promises to
lift Japan out of its worst economic slump in decades, Okumura just
shrugs.
	   ``It won't make any difference who gets elected, because
factional politics will win out,'' the 30-year-old housewife said
while her toddler daughter played in a park in Kawasaki, a gritty
blue-collar factory city just south of Tokyo.
	   Popular discontent is weighing heavily on the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party as members prepare to vote Friday for a new party
president _ and most likely Japan's next prime minister, since the
party controls the powerful lower house of Parliament.
	   Anger at the government and worry over the economy in urban
areas like Kawasaki are at the center of Japan's political turmoil:
they triggered the losses in July 12 upper house elections that
brought down Hashimoto's government _ losses suffered most
devastatingly in the cities.
	   That disillusionment also could mean deeper troubles down the
road for the LDP, especially as politicians are slowly forced to
wean themselves from backroom politicking and appeal more directly
to voters.
	   ``The successor to the Hashimoto administration should know that
he will be severely punished by voters in the next lower house
election if he fails,'' the Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial
this week.
	   The choice on Friday is in the hands of 414 LDP members. The
winner will then go before the Parliament sometime late next week
for a vote for prime minister.
	   The Liberal Democrats increased the number of members who will
vote Friday from 413 to 414 after an independent politician joined
the party Thursday, which also hiked the number of votes needed for
a majority from 207 to 208.

Japanese prime minister candidates make final appeal before vote

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The three candidates fighting to succeed resigning
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made their final public appeals in
nationally televised speeches Thursday, all vowing to pull Japan
out of its deepest recession since the end of World War II.
	   Japan's ruling Liberal Democrat Party convenes Friday to choose
a new party president. The winner is virtually certain of being
elected prime minister in a later vote by Parliament because the
LDP commands a comfortable majority in the powerful lower house.
	   Thursday's speeches came as media surveys of the 414 voting LDP
members showed party establishment favorite Keizo Obuchi closing in
on the majority needed to win on a first ballot. If no candidate
wins a majority, a second ballot will be held immediately.
	   A poll in a major newspaper Thursday also showed the LDP's
approval ratings at an all-time low as anger rises over the
government's failure to remedy the sagging economy _ and the
party's apparent failure to come up with a reformist leader.
	   As they have in the past week of campaigning, the candidates
offered similar solutions to Japan's problems.
	   Obuchi, 61, foreign minister under Hashimoto and a party
stalwart backed by the LDP old guard, vowed Thursday to fix the
economy by first cleaning up the bad debt plaguing banks, then
cutting taxes and boosting public spending.
	   The other candidates _ former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, 72, and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56 _ have
offered much the same proposals, though Obuchi has offered the most
detailed ideas.
	   He reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in new
spending to kickstart economic growth.
	   ``The first priority is resolving the bad loans. But the problem
is that may not be enough to ensure the economy will pick up,''
said Obuchi.
	   Obuchi is from the old-school of Japanese politics, adept at
forging compromises among competing political groups but colorless
in public. Reflecting that, his speech covered the important policy
points but lacked the emotion of Kajiyama's or the humor of
Koizumi's.
	   Kajiyama said his ``top priority is restoring economic growth''
_ aiming at a target of 3 percent annually. He vowed to give the
rest of his 30-year career to restoring health to Japan's
once-vibrant economy.
	   ``I may stumble along the way but I will devote my life to
economic recovery,'' the 72-year-old Kajiyama said.
	   Kajiyama drew cheers from the crowd of party members with a call
for complete disclosure of financial information from troubled
banks before devoting public money to a bailout of the financial
system.
	   For his part, the outspoken Koizumi _ who has played the role of
maverick reformer in the race _ vowed to implement drastic reforms
of the political system, including cutting by almost half the
number of Parliament members and government bureaucrats.
	   ``Some people call me an eccentric man, but as an eccentric man,
I am a man who can change things,'' Koizumi said, playing on the
similarity in Japanese between the words ``eccentric'' and
``change.''
	   ``We have to restore the trust of the people in politics,'' said
Koizumi. ``Before we ask people to endure any hardships we have to
show that the government and politicians can endure painful reforms
themselves.''
	   Friday's vote was prompted by Hashimoto's announcement last week
that he would resign to take responsibility for the party's
disastrous showing in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   The vote was considered a sign of the unpopularity of the LDP _
unpopularity that is apparently still rising. The mass-circulation
Yomiuri newspaper reported Thursday that the LDP's approval rating
has sunk to an all-time low of 20.8 percent. That was down from
28.7 percent in June. The poll, of 1,990 people, offered no margin
of error.
	   And though public opinion polls show Koizumi the most popular of
the candidates, within the party Obuchi was by far the
front-runner, according to media polls of party members.
	   A poll by Kyodo News agency released late Wednesday showed
Obuchi with nearly 200 of the 208 votes needed to win a majority in
a first ballot. The Nihon Keizai economic newspaper released a
survey on Thursday showing Obuchi with a more modest 180 votes, but
still with more than twice the support of his nearest competitor,
Koizumi.
	   The Liberal Democrats increased the number of members who will
vote in Friday's election from 413 to 414 after independent
lawmaker Naoki Tanaka joined the party Thursday. That hiked the
number of votes needed for a majority from 207 to 208.
	   The new LDP president will serve out the rest of Hashimoto's
term until the end of September 1999.

European Union prepares to defend new banana regime at WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The European Union Thursday told the World Trade
Organization it was changing its banana import regime to bring it
into line with the trade body's rules.
	   But the United States and Latin American banana-producing
opponents of the EU regime, which had been found by the WTO to
favor imports from Caribbean and African countries that for most
part are colonies or former colonies of European countries, say the
changes don't go far enough.
	   The Latin American countries signaled to the European Union
Thursday that they and the United States may formally ask the WTO
this fall to examine the new regime again to determine whether it
complies with world trade rules, a U.S. trade official said
Thursday.
	   EU officials Thursday said they are prepared to defend the new
regime. They say it complies with a previous WTO dispute panel
ruling that judged the EU's banana import policy to be out of line.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said.
	   The United States, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and
Mexico complained to the WTO that European import rules unfairly
favor imports of Caribbean and African bananas via a complex system
of tariffs, quotas and import licenses.
	   They claimed the EU regime was costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   A WTO dispute settlement panel subsequently ruled in favor of
the United States and the Latin Americans and told the union to
reform the system.
	   The EU's problem since then has been to figure out how to have a
single market for bananas, comply with WTO obligations and also
respect the Lome agreement, a pact which commits it to favorable
treating imports from a large group of developing countries,
including colonies and ex-colonies of European countries.
	   New EU regulations for banana imports would be applicable from
Jan. 1, 1999, the time limit set for the EU by an arbitrator for
bringing the rules into line, Abbott said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fleeing some of the worst fighting
in weeks, thousands of Albanian civilians have reportedly jammed a
rebel-held village, severely straining food and medical supplies in
the long-isolated community.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and ethnic Albanian officials are accusing each
other of atrocities in the five-day battle for Orahovac, which
ended in a guerrilla retreat and thousands of Albanians streaming
toward rebel strongholds.
	   Hundreds of Serbs also sought refuge in nearby villages during
fighting, which ended before dawn Wednesday.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said a Serb policeman was killed late
Wednesday in an ambush near Pec, the province's second-largest city
near the Albanian border.
	   On Thursday, the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore reported
that 13,000 people had fled Orahovac for Malisevo, a stronghold of
the Kosovo Liberation Army about 16 kilometers (ten miles) to the
northeast.
	   The newspaper said 75 people were crowded into a single house,
whose owner was down to two sacks of flour. Supplies of food,
medicine and clothing were rapidly dwindling.
	   According to the daily, a makeshift hospital has been set up in
Malisevo to care for the wounded. But medical supplies are scarce,
and there is no running water.
	   The village, which had a population of about 8,000, has been cut
off for weeks from normal commerce because of Serb roadblocks
between the community and Pristina, the Serb-ruled provincial
capital.
	   Also Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross
reported Thursday that almost 20,000 people _ Serbs and Albanians _
had fled the fighting in Orahovac.
	   The ICRC also said it delivered 5 tons of flour and over 1,000
food parcels to Malisevo in the past few days. The ICRC also said
the KLA had handed over 35 Serbs, including a nun and seven monks,
whom they kidnapped during the fighting around Orahovac.
	   They were brought here with ICRC escorts.
	   The local Serbian Christian Orthodox authorities said the Serbs
were abducted Tuesday from a monastery where they had taken refuge.
Two grenades damaged the monastery and the monks immediately ran
into the chapel and started praying, the private FoNet news agency,
based in Belgrade, reported.
	   They waved a white flag and surrendered to approaching
guerrillas, who released them after several hours.
	   One of them, Branko Krstic, 61, told FoNet that one of the monks
was beaten.
	   Another group of hostages _ Serbs who had fled fighting in
Croatia three years ago _ were handed over Wednesday to the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees. The Croatian Serbs had been living
in makeshift shelters in the vineyards on the edge of the town.
	   ``The shooting started Friday afternoon,'' one of the Croatian
Serbs, Aleksandar Graovac, told The Associated Press. ``Bullets
were hitting our huts, too, and we laid low, without food and
water. We didn't dare go out for three days. There was so much
fighting. I suppose many died.''
	   Similar allegations of mistreatment were leveled by the
Albanians against the Serbs.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed,
including some dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... The situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the group said.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence from the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.

Asian markets fall on news about Japan's credit rating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures in regional markets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices fell on most Asian markets
Thursday because of doubts about Japan's new leadership and a
possible downgrade of its debt rating.
	   Moody's Investors Service announced early Thursday that it may
downgrade its rating for Japan's government debt from the current
triple-A, the best possible rating.
	   Tokyo stocks fell for the fourth straight day, with the Nikkei
average down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent, closing at 16,188.01.
It had fallen more than 250 points Wednesday.
	   Markets in Hong Kong and Seoul were down sharply.
	   Moody's said ``the review is prompted by deep, structural
problems in Japan's economy that have defied conventional policy
remedies and an apparent lack of consensus among policy makers on a
medium-term strategy for implementing structural reform and for
managing the economy.''
	   The likelihood that Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi will be chosen
as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's president Friday, and
therefore become prime minister, also kept buyers away.
	   Obuchi would automatically become prime minister, since the
ruling LDP has a majority in the lower house of parliament. The
markets view Obuchi as not an aggressive reformer.
	   In Seoul, the key index plunged 5.7 percent on the possible
downgrade of Japan's debt. The benchmark KOSPI index fell 20.61
points, closing at 341.46.
	   U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's forecast
Wednesday that China's gross domestic product will grow by 6.8
percent instead of the official Beijing forecast of 8 percent also
hurt investor confidence, analysts said.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, lost 244.47 points, or 2.9 percent, closing at
8,176.25. It was the lowest level since July 14.
	   With Greenspan's pessimistic forecast of China's GDP, analysts
said Moody's announcement prompted speculation of a possible second
round of currency problems, and a ``trickle-down negative effect''
of a weakening yen on China and Hong Kong.
	   ``A weaker yen has a major impact on Southeast Asian exports and
Hong Kong's re-exports of Chinese goods. All these would slow
down,'' said Kent Rossiter, senior investment adviser at Nikko
Securities.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares ended lower as investors pulled back
to await corporate earnings reports due over the next month. The
All Ordinaries Index fell 18.8 points, or 0.68 percent, closing at
2,748.70.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares closed higher, led by gains of New Zealand
Telecom Corp., dissipating nervousness over Japan. The NZSE-40
Index rose 5.36 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,133.75.
	   JAKARTA: Shares closed lower on continued profit-taking _
especially in mining shares _ in line with bearishness in regional
markets. The JSX Index was down 9.2 points, or 1.95 percent, to
473.805.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed as late foreign buying of banking
shares and blue-chips propped up the index. The Straits Times Index
closed 9.60 points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,062.26.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices fell to a new nine-year
low, hammered by fears about the strength of the banking sector and
growing corporate debt. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Index fell
6.51 points, or 1.60 percent, to 415.40.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed 3.6 percent lower as investors
sold banking and finance stocks after financial companies reported
huge half-year losses. The SET index dropped 10.32 points to
276.20.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares were dragged lower by the overnight fall
in U.S. equity markets. The Weighted Price Index was down 1.17
points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,879.89.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended lower following Greenspan's
assessment that suffering Asian economies have made meager
progress. The PSE Index was down 33.59 points, or 2 percent,
closing at 1,673.16.

Russia, Japan prepare for naval maneuvers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three Japanese warships were expected to arrive in
the Russian Far Eastern port of Vladivostok on Friday for the first
joint naval maneuvers between the two countries.
	   The exercises will take place on July 29, some 390 kilometers
(240 miles) east of Vladivostok, said Kimio Kumagai, a spokesman
for Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force. Two Russian warships will
join the three Japanese vessels and seven planes in a simulated sea
rescue.
	   Five decades after World War II, Russia and Japan have yet to
sign a peace treaty because of a territorial dispute over the Kuril
Islands, which Soviet troops seized from Japan in the closing days
of the war.
	   But relations have warmed up recently, and contacts between the
two nations became much more frequent.
	   Japanese naval ships visited Vladivostok in July 1996, and
Russian naval ships visited Tokyo in June 1997, for joint
communication training.

 &UR; World champion leaves Williams to join BAR Eds: adds Williams

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Formula One auto racing champion Jacques
Villeneuve confirmed Thursday that's he's leaving Williams to team
up with the new British American Racing team.
	   The 27-year-old Canadian, who has struggled this season behind
the McLarens and Ferraris, is a close friend of BAR's managing
director, Craig Pollock, and will join the former Tyrrell outfit as
soon as his contract with Williams ends at the end of this season.
	   Although Villeneuve won the world title driving for Williams, he
has been frustrated this season that the latest model can't compete
with the cars being driven by Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard
(both McLaren) and Michael Schumacher (Ferrari).
	   ``I have told every journalist who covers Formula One racing in
recent weeks that I would go with a team that would allow me to
compete at the front of the grid,'' he said.
	   Pollock wants his team to be up there with McLaren and Ferrari
next season.
	   ``Jacques' presence in our team will go a long way towards our
goal of being competitive in the shortest time possible,'' he said.
	   Williams managing director Frank Williams confirmed Villeneuve
would not be driving for his team next season.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, he said Williams Grand Prix
Engineering would not be announcing its driver line-up until early
September.
	   It is widely believed Heinz-Harald Frentzen will also be leaving
Williams next season.
	   Although IndyCar series leader Alex Zanardi has also been linked
with a possible move back into Formula One with either of two
European teams, including Williams.

Killer of Dutch woman executed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Vietnamese man has been executed for
killing a young Dutch woman during a purse-snatching attempt, a
court official said Thursday.
	   Ngo Vung Ben, 39, went before a firing squad at the Thu Duc
firing ground outside Ho Chi Minh City Saturday, with more than
1,000 people attending, the official said.
	   Ben was convicted of fatally stabbing Judith Wagman, 26, in the
heart in June 1997 when she resisted attempts to snatch her handbag
in broad daylight.
	   Wagman, who was visiting to explore business opportunities, died
on the spot at Ben Thanh, the city's biggest market.
	   Attacks and robberies against foreign tourists and businessmen
have been rising sharply in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's southern
commercial hub.

Seoul appellate court overturns spying charge against ex-professor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An appellate court partially
overturned the conviction of a former college professor on spy
charges Thursday, ruling he did not pass secrets to North Korea.
	   However, the appellate judges upheld the conviction of Koh
Young-bok, 70, a former sociology professor at Seoul National
University, on two lesser charges.
	   His prison sentence was reduced from seven to two years.
	   Koh's conviction on charges of contacting and aiding North
Korean spies was upheld by the appellate court. But it said he gave
them only non-classified material, not ``national secrets'' as the
prosecution had alleged.
	   Koh was arrested last November along with five other South
Koreans in what officials said was the largest North Korean spy
case in years.
	   The Koreas have been bitter enemies since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a bloody three-year war in the early 1950s.

Fires threaten seaside Athens suburb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Brush fires gutted several homes and
threatened a seaside suburb Thursday, one day after four
firefighters were killed fighting a blaze on the edge of the
capital.
	   Firefighters battled a number of wind-driven blazes that broke
out near the small port of Nea Makri, 15 kilometers (nine miles)
east of Athens. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Another brush fire near the southern port of Patra seriously
injured a farmer who was trying to extinguish it after it
threatened to burn his crops.
	   Fire crews also closely watched for any major rekindling of a
fire in a pine forest on the Imittos mountain east of the city
center. That blaze killed three firemen and a volunteer fire
fighter Wednesday.
	   The Imittos blaze destroyed a large tract of one of the few
remaining wooded spots in the overpopulated Athens basin.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades.

Reactor shut down at Ukraine's Rivne nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor at Ukraine's Rivne nuclear power
plant was shut down before dawn Thursday because of a steam
generator failure, a news agency reported. No change in radiation
levels was reported.
	   Reactor No. 1, the only one currently operational at Rivne, was
partially restarted and is expected to be back at full capacity
later in the day, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Olexandr Smyshlyayev, head of the Environment Ministry's nuclear
division, said the malfunction, which released no radiation, could
have been prevented by proper attention during annual repairs in
April and May.
	   Thursday's accident was the 14th at the Rivne plant since the
beginning of the year. The plant ranks second among Ukraine's
nuclear facilities by the number of malfunctions registered in
1998.
	   Another reactor at Rivne was shut down this week for more than a
month of scheduled repairs.
	   Smyshlyayev complained earlier this month that the number of
malfunctions at Ukraine's nuclear power plants had started to grow
because of outdated equipment and disregard for safety rules.
	   A total of 37 malfunctions and disruptions of work occurred at
the country's five atomic power plants in the first half of 1998,
or 1.5 times more than during the same period last year.
	   Ukraine relies on nuclear energy for more than half of its
electricity, and says it does not have enough money to convert to
other forms of energy or build safer nuclear plants.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices fell on major Asian markets
Thursday because of doubts about Japan's new leadership and a
possible downgrade of its debt rating. Moody's Investors Service
announced that it may downgrade its rating for Japan's government
debt from the current triple-A, the best possible. Tokyo stocks

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia said Thursday it was
liberalizing its rules for foreign investment as part of its effort
to revive its economy. The National Economic Recovery Plan suspends
the current equity cap of 51 percent if foreign companies invest in
manufacturing industries before 2000. The only exceptions are
industries identified as strategic. It was not immediately clear
whether foreigners would be allowed 100 percent ownership in new
investments. Malaysia's government concedes the economy could
shrink by 2 percent this year. ``The situation we face is
serious,'' said Daim Zainuddin, who heads an economic firefighting
unit. ``But we must not be pessimistic. Economic recovery might not
come tomorrow, but it will come,'' he said. (MALAYSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to give strong
support to measures to halt the region's economic slide in their
annual meeting starting Friday in Manila. The gathering will also
enable ASEAN ministers to press the point to Japanese officials
that there can be no meaningful recovery in the region unless Japan
sorts out its economic and financial problems. Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan said ASEAN member countries expect Japan to
implement ``new measures to revive the regional economies and pull
us all out.'' (Philippines-ASEAN-CURRENCY CRISIS).
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Central Bank's hard-currency reserves
edged down to dlrs 13.6 billion this week from dlrs 13.7 billion on
July 10, the bank's press service said Thursday. Central Bank
reserves have been slipping during the country's financial crisis
in recent months. The bank has spent large sums to defend the
Russian ruble, which has remained relatively steady at around 6.2
to the U.S. dollar. The pressure on the ruble has eased since
Russia reached an agreement earlier this month with the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders for dlrs 17 billion
in new loans this year and next. Much of the money is expected to
stay in the Central Bank to boost its reserves. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY).

Portugal urges U.N. chief to visit Angola to prevent return to war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
has urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to visit Angola as soon
as possible to halt the southwest African country's imminent slide
back into civil war, officials said Thursday.
	   In a letter sent to Annan on Monday, Gama said there was a
``dangerous crisis'' in the former Portuguese colony because the
former rebel movement UNITA was not observing the 1994 peace pact
with the Angola government which ended a two-decade civil war.
	   The political and military situation in Angola ``has
deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, prompting legitimate fears
that we may be about to see the outbreak of a generalized
conflict,'' the letter said.
	   The letter was published in Thursday's edition of daily Diario
de Noticias and confirmed as official by the Foreign Ministry.
	   UNITA, which was to have demobilized its 70,000-strong guerilla
army under the United Nations-brokered peace deal, ``has maintained
military activities in several Angolan provinces,'' Gama wrote.
	   The Angolan government is displaying ``clear signs of impatience
with the deadlock'' in fully implementing the peace accord, he
added.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ refuses to hand over its central
highland strongholds to the government, alleging that police have
committed human rights abuses in areas already handed over.
	   Dozens of civilians and police have been killed in ambushes in
remote areas of the vast country over the past two months.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for the attacks, saying the
former rebels want to destabilize the country, though Jonas
Savimbi's movement has denied involvement.
	   The U.N. mission overseeing the delayed implementation of the
peace accord has just 1,200 staff in Angola and has been unable to
verify the government's claims.
	   Gama said Annan's personal intervention was essential to restore
confidence between the former foes.
	   U.N. sanctions against UNITA, including an oil and weapons ban,
have failed to nudge the former rebels into full compliance with
the accord. Implementation has been slowed by lingering hostility
between the two factions.
	   Angola's civil war erupted after the country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people were killed in the fighting between
UNITA and the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, or MPLA.

Nitric acid spilled in Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two months after a huge cyanide spill in
Kyrgyzstan, a truck operated by the same company has been in
another accident, this time involving toxic nitric acid, a news
report said Thursday.
	   The truck was going to the town of Balykchi, near Lake Issyk
Kul, with a cargo of nitric acid, when a faulty drain system sprang
a leak Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing the
Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   Some 70 liters (18 gallons) of the highly corrosive acid have
been spilled, the report said. Authorities said there was no
serious environmental damage.
	   The truck belonged to the Kumtor Operating Company, a subsidiary
of Canada's Cameco Co.
	   The same firm was involved in a May 20 accident when a truck
carrying 20 tons of sodium cyanide powder veered off a mountain
road and crashed into the Barskaan River, partially polluting Lake
Issyk Kul. Four deaths and hundreds of illnesses have been blamed
on the spill.

Report: Libyan Lockerbie suspects ready for trial in Holland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am
bombing are ready to hand themselves over for trial in Holland,
their lawyer was quoted as saying Thursday.
	   The Al-Hayat newspaper quoted lawyer Ibrahim el-Ghoweily as
saying that he had told his clients, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, about the possibility of a trial in the
Netherlands.
	   ``My clients said they are ready,'' he was quoted as saying in
an telephone interview from the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   El-Ghoweily could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   On Tuesday, the United States and Britain said they are
considering a third-country trial for the two Libyans, accused of
planting a bomb aboard Flight 103 in December 1988 that killed 259
people on board and 11 on ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   Libya's refusal to hand over the two intelligence agents for
trial in either Scotland or the United States resulted in U.N.
sanctions in 1992.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has sought a trial in a neutral
country, saying the suspects will not get a fair deal in Britain or
the United States.
	   Given the lack of progress in the case, Britain recently started
talks with the United States and the Dutch government about the
possibility of a trial in Holland under Scottish law with Scottish
judges, rather than an international panel of judges.
	   A senior Libyan diplomat described the report as ``a positive
step'' although, he said, ``discussions and negotiations'' with the
United States and Britain would have to be conducted first.
	   ``We think first there should be a political agreement and then
a legal agreement on the procedures,'' Abdel Atti el-Obeidi, the
Libyan diplomat in charge of the Europeans affairs, told Al-Hayat
in a separate interview.
	   El-Obeidi's reference to ``a political agreement'' indicates
that Tripoli may expect an end to the sanctions and restoration of
political ties with Washington and London in return for the handing
over of the Libyans for trial.
	   The U.N. sanctions ban international flights to and from Libya
but the embargo has been defied recently by three African heads of
states who flew to Libya.

As rains swell Yangtze River, floods also ravage north China
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with storms in Wuhan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ One of central China's key industrial
centers, already waist-deep in water, braced Thursday for more of
the torrential rains that have brought the Yangtze River to danger
levels.
	   A flood crest from days of heavy rains upstream passed along the
Yangtze through Wuhan city without overflowing protective
embankments that have been reinforced with sandbags and kept under
constant watch.
	   But officials were looking at the sky with trepidation, worried
that the downpours forecast for Thursday night would inundate more
of the city of 7 million inhabitants. Transportation through the
low-lying downtown area remained difficult, with many streets still
flooded.
	   Tuesday brought Wuhan its heaviest rains on record, causing one
death and stranding 600,000 people, the Communist Party flagship
People's Daily reported. Little rain fell during the day Thursday,
allowing authorities to drain some flooded areas.
	   More than 1,000 people have already died from flooding in China
from seasonal rains that came earlier and fell harder than usual.
Six provinces that lie along the Yangtze, the world's third longest
river, have been among the hardest hit.
	   Dikes that are the only shield protecting millions of people
along the river are waterlogged by more than two weeks of constant
rainfall and could collapse, according to state-run media reports.
	   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and residents have been
mobilized to man dikes and fill sandbags, newspapers reported.
	   Floods reportedly washed away a 3,000-meter (1.8-mile) section
of newly constructed dikes and opened a 600-meter (1,970-foot)
crack in an embankment in Hunan province, upstream from Wuhan.
	   Down the river, waters were reported about 1 meter (one yard)
above warning levels in Nanjing city, where the river broadens
before flowing into the sea near Shanghai.
	   Heavy rains have also left 113 people dead and 90,000 homeless
in northern China, the official China Daily reported.
	   Torrents that began in early July have destroyed 22,000 homes
and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland and washed away
roads, power lines and food supplies in Shaanxi province _ normally
an arid swath of barely tillable hills, the China Daily reported.

Actor Gerard Depardieu given suspended sentence for drunken crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further Depardieu comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ A court on Thursday convicted actor
Gerard Depardieu of driving drunk when he crashed his motorcycle
last May, but it slapped him on the hands with a three-month
suspended sentence and a 10,000-franc (dlrs 1,600) fine.
	   What will likely hurt more was the court's decision to suspend
Depardieu's driver's license for 15 months.
	   ``I decompressed like a Moujik,'' France's most popular actor
told the court in this Paris suburb, likening himself to a drunken
Russian peasant. He was more than five times over the legal limit
at the time of the crash.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ``Green Card,'' and ``The
Return of Martin Guerre,'' suffered leg and facial injuries in the
May 18 accident in nearby Clairefontaine.
	   At the time, he was filming the movie ``Asterix,'' directed by
Claude Zidi. He missed a month's filming as a result of his leg
injury.
	   Depardieu told the court Thursday that he had been drinking
heavily in Cannes the night before the crash, after clinching a
contract to distribute three French films in the United States.
	   ``I drank a lot,'' he said. ``Champagne, and everything that was
there.''
	   He said he then continued drinking on a flight to Paris, and
then slept for ``four or five hours.''
	   ``But I never thought there would still be alcohol in my
blood,'' the day after, Depardieu said. ``I'm against drunk
driving, and I think this punishment is correct.''

Georgia, Abkhazia look for common ground in new talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Negotiators from Georgia and its breakaway
Abkhazia region on Thursday met to search for common ground in the
wake of an outbreak of fighting that has uprooted thousands more
refugees.
	   ``Tension is high and the potential for a new outbreak of
hostilities is real,'' said chairman Liviu Bota, the U.N.
secretary-general's special representative for Georgia, in a
downbeat opening address.
	   Abkhazian rebels seized the lush Black Sea province in a bloody
1992-1993 war, which turned some 300,000 ethnic Georgians into
refugees.
	   In May, some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled the Ghali
region during fighting between Abkhazian separatists and militia
groups that support Georgia's central government. The U.N. refugee
agency says some 1,600 houses were burned down.
	   The meeting, expected to last two or three days, is to review
areas where real progress could be made, consider the refugee
problem and look at economic issues.
	   It is taking place ``in the most difficult circumstances
possible,'' Georgian Foreign Minister Irakli Menagarishvili told
delegates.
	   Bota called for ``badly needed political will'' from both sides.
He noted that the agreement reached at a November meeting in
Geneva, which set up an international council to deal with the
crisis, hadn't been fully implemented.
	   Russia, which has deployed a peacekeeping force in the region,
is present as an intermediary.
	   Delegation leader Lev Mironov said the peace process is
``working with a lot of obstructions and is constantly getting
bogged down.''
	   Last fall, the leaders of Georgia and Abkhazia held several
unprecedented meetings in the most serious attempt since the war to
reach a peace settlement.
	   But there has been little progress on the key issue of
Abkhazia's status. The separatists demand sovereignty, while the
Georgian government says Abkhazia should settle for broad autonomy
as part of Georgia.

 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president narrowly survived a
powerful car bomb attack that badly damaged his motorcade and
killed his top bodyguard Thursday in the capital of the rebel
republic.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov was traveling through the streets of
Grozny when the car bomb exploded, damaging his Nissan Patrol
four-wheel-drive vehicle, destroying other cars, and leaving a
large hole in the road.
	   Maskhadov emerged from his car with only a minor knee wound, but
one bodyguard was killed and six were wounded, the president told a
news conference shortly after the attack.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who spoke
energetically and appeared well. ``To my great regret, my best
bodyguard was killed.''
	   The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments, and at least
two cars in the president's motorcade were completely burned. The
blast also shattered windows in nearby buildings.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   The bombing escalated an already tense situation in Chechnya,
where Maskhadov's moderate government has been unable to restore
law-and-order despite the end of the 1994-6 war between Chechen
rebels and the Russian government.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maskhadov
blamed unspecified ``special services'' and their allies inside
Chechnya.
	   ``Explosions and incidents are inevitable in a country that has
gone through such a grave war,'' he said. ``The most important
thing is that I have not allowed the situation to develop the way
it did in Tajikistan, Afghanistan or Algeria,'' all countries torn
by civil conflict.
	   Potential suspects include Islamic militants who have been
feuding with Maskhadov's government in recent weeks. In the past,
Chechnya has also accused Russia of plotting attacks against the
republic's leaders.
	   Maskhadov has cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists who
want to build a state based on a strict interpretation of Shariah,
or Islamic law.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis. The Wahhabis
include native Chechens as well as guerrilla fighters who came from
other Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's war against Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of the Wahhabis.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild its shattered economy.
	   Chechnya and Russia have been holding periodic negotiations,
mostly about economic cooperation, but they have made no
breakthroughs on the key issue of Chechnya's political status.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.

China: Continued normal U.S. trade relations wise choice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Foreign Ministry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday welcomed the U.S. Congress'
decision to approve normal trade relations for another year but
urged Washington to grant Beijing permanent trading rights.
	   Annual renewal of China's trading rights has become an occasion
for divisive debate in Congress that harms business and diplomatic
relations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said in
comments carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.
	   Washington should make trade terms permanent for the sake of
``continued, healthy and stable'' trade relations, Tang was quoted
as saying.
	   The House of Representatives voted 264-166 Wednesday not to
revoke President Bill Clinton's decision to continue offering China
the same low tariffs enjoyed by almost all other American trading
partners.
	   ``The approval is a wise decision and will be conducive to the
advancement of the China-U.S. trade relations,'' Hu Zhaoqing, a
spokesman for China's Foreign Trade Ministry, was quoted by Xinhua
as saying.
	   China has enjoyed the low-tariff trading rights since 1980, but
U.S. law still requires the president to seek an annual waiver to
extend normal trade terms to totalitarian states.
	   The annual debate gives U.S. politicians a chance to criticize
China for real and perceived sins ranging from human rights abuses
to weapons proliferation. In recent years, the debate has included
China's growing trade surplus with the United States _ nearly dlrs
50 billion last year.
	   China sees the annual debate as a forum for bashing China and
warns that revoking those terms would be catastrophic for U.S.
consumers and Chinese exporters, whose biggest market is the United
States.
	   This year's vote shows ``those attempting to use China's trade
status to sabotage China-U.S. relations and China-U.S. trade
relations are less and less supported,'' Xinhua quoted Tang saying.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Mirjana Lucic, Croatia's 16-year-old
tennis star, is nowhere to be found two days before the Fed Cup
against Netherlands, organizers told media Thursday.
	   Just two days before the match is to begin Lucic is the only
member of the Croatian team who has not arrived at the tournament
venue in Bol, Vjeran Friscic, an organizer of the Cup told Jutarnji
list daily. He also said neither Lucic nor her coach, Ivan Brixi,
have contacted tournament officials and nobody is available at her
contact numbers.
	   Officials in Bol, on the island of Brac on the Croatian Riviera,
last heard that Lucic withdrew from the last week's A&AMP;P Classic
USTA Women's Challenger in New Jersey because of a high fever
related to the children pox she had earlier this year.
	   Friscic said they would wait for Lucic till midday Friday and
one of the young Croat players will jump in if she has not showed
up by then.
	   Croats Iva Majoli, Silvija Talaja and Jelena Kostanic, as well
as Dutch players Miriam Oremans, Amanda Hopmans, Manon Bollegraf
and Caroline Vis are already training in Bol.
	   Lucic, ranked 44th on the WTA list, has a bad year so far. She
managed to win only her first-round matches at the Australian Open,
Key Biscayne, Florida and Makarska tournaments. She also was
defeated in the doubles' semifinals in Wimbledon.

Portugal urges U.N. chief to visit Angola to prevent return to war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
has urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to visit Angola as soon
as possible to halt the Southwest African country's imminent slide
back into civil war, officials said Thursday.
	   In a letter sent to Annan on Monday, Gama said there was a
``dangerous crisis'' in the former Portuguese colony because the
former rebel movement UNITA was not observing the 1994 peace pact
with the Angola government that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   The political and military situation in Angola ``has
deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, prompting legitimate fears
that we may be about to see the outbreak of a generalized
conflict,'' the letter said.
	   The letter was published in Thursday's edition of daily Diario
de Noticias and confirmed as official by the Foreign Ministry.
	   UNITA, which was to have demobilized its 70,000-strong guerilla
army under the United Nations-brokered peace deal, ``has maintained
military activities in several Angolan provinces,'' Gama wrote.
	   The Angolan government is displaying ``clear signs of impatience
with the deadlock'' in fully implementing the peace accord, he
added.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ refuses to hand over its central
highland strongholds to the government, alleging that police have
committed human rights abuses in areas already handed over.
	   Dozens of civilians and police have been killed in ambushes in
remote areas of the vast country over the past two months.
	   The government has blamed UNITA for the attacks, saying the
former rebels want to destabilize the country, though Jonas
Savimbi's movement has denied involvement.
	   The U.N. mission overseeing the delayed implementation of the
peace accord has just 1,200 staff in Angola and has been unable to
verify the government's claims.
	   Gama said Annan's personal intervention was essential to restore
confidence between the former foes.
	   U.N. sanctions against UNITA, including an oil and weapons ban,
have failed to nudge the former rebels into full compliance with
the accord. Implementation has been slowed by lingering hostility
between the two factions.
	   Angola's civil war erupted after the country's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people were killed in the fighting between
UNITA and the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, or MPLA.

Israel: reported Iranian missile test not immediate threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister said Thursday he was
concerned about reports that Iran has tested a medium-range
missile, but said this did not pose an immediate threat to Israel.
	   Israeli officials said they did not have immediate independent
confirmation of U.S. newspaper reports Thursday that Iran this week
successfully tested a missile with a range of 800 miles (1,287
kilometers), which meant it could hit Israel or Saudi Arabia.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he did not believe the
missile tested could reach Israel, but that ``the very fact that
... missiles are being tested by Iran is a very serious matter.''
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said although Israel has
repeatedly expressed concern over the Iranian missile program, it
is as much a threat to Iran's neighbors as to Israel.
	   ``The potential threat to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States
and Western interests, particularly those of the United States, is
as great as the threat to Israel, if not greater,'' Fogel told The
Associated Press.
	   Military analyst Barry Rubin dismissed speculation cited by The
New York Times in its story on the missile test Thursday that
Israel might possibly retaliate against Iran.
	   ``I don't think Israel is going to attack Iran just because Iran
has tested a medium-range missile. After all Syria has lots of
missiles and that has not led to a military response,'' said Rubin,
a researcher at the Besa Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan
University.

Rover cuts jobs, blames high value of British pound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with Rover announcement, comments from
executives, worker, deleting dated material, no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The automaker Rover said Thursday it will
eliminate at least 1,500 jobs and put some workers on a four-day
work week as it fights to undo the damage caused by the high value
of the British pound.
	   Rover, owned by German carmaker BMW, said it hopes it can reduce
its workforce, which now stands at about 39,000, through voluntary
and early retirements, without resorting to forced layoffs.
	   The company will cut jobs by the end of the year in all areas of
its business except research, design and engineering.
	   ``These measures will protect the business for the short term
without threatening long-term investment _ our lifeblood for the
future _ and will maintain progress toward our strategic objective
of profitability by the end of the decade,'' said Walter Hasselkus,
the Rover Group chairman.
	   Rover said it is also planning to start buying hundreds of
millions of dollars in components from abroad _ a move that could
affect thousands of workers in Britain's automotive sector.
	   Rover has become more productive since BMW bought it from
British Aerospace PLC in 1994, but the high value of the pound has
made its automobiles far less competitive in other markets, while
making imported cars cheaper for British consumers.
	   ``Our revenue from vehicles sold abroad is reduced, while cheap
imports are sucked into our home market,'' Hasselkus said.
	   Rover has not specified how much money the unfavorable currency
rates has cost it, but British news reports have placed the figure
at around 200 million pounds (dlrs 330) million yearly.
	   ``Obviously, it's a great concern to everybody who works for
Rover, but the strong pound is killing exports and it's not just at
Rover,'' said Dave Hillman, an integration manager arriving for
work at Rover's Longbridge plant.
	   Economists say the strength of sterling has pushed many British
manufacturers into recession.

EU OKs Daimler-Benz-Chrysler merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Thursday approved
the merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.
	   The two automakers announced plans in May to form a new company
called DaimlerChrysler AG.
	   The EU Commission, executive arm of the 15-nation bloc, said the
merger will affect the passenger car sector of the economy, but
that the effect would be minor.
	   ``Given the minor overlap of market shares and the strength of
the parents' competitors, the operation will only have a limited
effect in terms of industry concentration,'' the Commission said in
a statement.
	   For all passenger cars, the combined market share won't exceed
10 percent in the EU or any individual member state, the Commission
said.
	   In some areas of the passenger car sector, however, notably for
executive and sports cars, the new company will hold higher
combined market shares in some member states.
	   ``However, the reinforcement of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler's
position in these segments though the merger is limited as the
overlap between their product ranges is small,'' the Commission
noted.
	   The Commission said the position of other well-established
competitors such as BMW/Rover and General Motors - will be
unaffected by the merger.
	   ``These competitors will be able to limit the effect of the
concentration,'' the EU competition watchdog said.
	   In an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Daimler-Benz chief executive
Juergen Schrempp said the integration of the two automotive giants
will be nearly seamless. He predicted the merger would close in
November or December.

<SLUG> Italian Wages Talks Launched, Union Calls For General Strike </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's government, unions and employers on Thursday
started _ then promptly recessed _ talks on a five-year-old wage
pact credited with taming once-rampant inflation.
	   Any breakdown in the talks would be a serious blow to Italy's
credibility in the European economic and monetary union and its bid
to conform with EMU requirements.
	   Labor Minister Tiziano Treu met with union leaders and the
employers' association separately, but made no progress on
resolving their differences. The talks were to resume in September.
	   Sergio D'Antoni, leader of the Cisl, one of Italy's biggest
unions, called for a general strike in September. But leaders of
two other leading unions, the Cgil and the Uil, refused to back his
call.
	   Giorgio Fossa, the head of Confindustria, the employers'
association, said Confindustria will keep pressing for changes in
the 1993 wage pact. The association in April threatened to abandon
it if the government goes through with the 35-hour work week.
	   The 1993 accord helped curb inflation to 1.8 percent last year;
it was 4 percent in 1996 and 5.4 percent in 1992. It also eased
labor tensions. It gives workers guaranteed wage increases, but
puts a ceiling on the hikes.
	   Keeping a lid on inflation is critical because it will help
allay fears among EMU members that Italy's high debt is a time bomb
that could trigger interest rate hikes.

North Korea gives new indication Kim Jong Il about to become
</HEADLINE>
president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A North Korean broadcast has given the latest
indication that Kim Jong Il is about to become president, formally
taking on the last of the high offices left vacant by his father's
death four years ago.
	   Since the 1994 death of his father Kim Il Sung, the 56-year-old
son has been running the Stalinist country as the supreme military
commander and head of the ruling Workers' Party.
	   But he has yet to assume full formal power by taking over the
other title left vacant by his father _ president.
	   In a broadcast Thursday, a senior North Korean official has
referred for the first time to Kim Jong Il assuming the president's
post, the Japanese monitoring agency Radiopress said.
	   It said a Korean-language broadcast by the North's Korean
Central Radio quoted Ri In Gyu, a vice foreign minister, as saying
senior officials of Pakistan, Malaysia and Peru have expressed
their desire for Kim to take the post.
	   The Korean radio said Ri was replying to questions about foreign
reaction to Kim's candidacy for a seat in North Korea's parliament
in elections July 26.
	   The radio also said in a commentary on the election that
``people desire the respected Kim Jong Il to take Kim Il Sung's
highest Korean position. The desire is overflowing in heaven and
earth.''
	   Earlier indications that Kim was about to become president came
in North Korean reports of outpourings of support for Kim's
candidacy for the parliament.

Havel hospitalized for checks before colon surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel was
hospitalized for medical tests Thursday, three days before
follow-up surgery to remove a tube from his colon.
	   The hospital stay will prepare for an operation, tentatively
Sunday, to remove a tube inserted after Havel suffered a ruptured
colon and acute peritonitis while on holiday in Austria in April,
said Martin Krafl, Havel's spokesman.
	   Surgeons removed 35 centimeters of the president's colon and
inserted an artificial duct in an emergency operation.
	   Havel's recovery was complicated after phlegm blocked his
windpipe, forcing doctors to perform a tracheotomy.
	   The news agency CTK quoted Havel's personal doctor Ilja Kotik as
saying Thursday the exact date of the surgery will be set Saturday
after the arrival of Austrian surgeon Ernst Bodner who will perform
the operation.
	   Doctors said earlier this month Havel would undergo the surgery
on July 27. On Tuesday, Boris Stastny, member of the team of
doctors
	   treating Havel, said the date was changed for Sunday at the
president's request.
	   Doctors say Havel must remain in hospital for about two weeks
after the surgery and will need another six weeks to fully recover.

Ethiopia secures dlrs 37 million in grants and loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Germany approved a dlrs 12 million
technical assistance grant to Ethiopia a month after it suspended
new funding to Addis Ababa because of tensions with neighboring
Eritrea, the Ethiopian News Agency said Thursday.
	   The African Development Bank has also loaned Ethiopia dlrs 25
million for maintenance and renovation of the highway connecting
the capital Addis Ababa to the country's main coffee growing
regions in the south, the state-run news agency said.
	   In an agreement signed Wednesday by German Ambassador Wiltrud
Holick and Ethiopia's vice minister of economic development Mulatu
Teshome, Germany granted 85 million Birr (dlrs 12 million) for
technical training and studies in Ethiopia, the news agency said.
	   Germany had suspended the grants after border clashes that
erupted May 6 between Ethiopia and Eritrea and Ethiopia escalated
into full-scale fighting in early June.
	   A German delegation slated to arrive last month to discuss
technical assistance cancelled its visit.
	   There have been no reports of fighting since mid-June, although
both sides still have troops massed along their common border.
	   Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin visited Germany and four other
western European countries earlier in the month to explain
Ethiopia's position on the conflict.
	   Ethiopia claims Eritrea has occupied areas along the border that
are Ethiopian. Eritrea denies the claim, saying it is on its
rightful territory.
	   Following the signing Wednesday, Mulatu said the accord was
further proof that Germany recognizes ``Ethiopia's preoccupation
with all-around development despite the tension resulting from the
Ethiopia-Eritrea dispute,'' the news agency said.
	   The report said dlrs 8.4 million would be used to upgrade and
equip technical training institutes around the country. The
remainder would be used for the Ethiopia Biodiversity Institute,
the only one of its kind in Africa.
	   One of the poorest countries of the world, Ethiopia has been
following an ambitious development policy that has heightened
tensions with equally poor Eritrea _ a country with which Ethiopia
once conducted much of its business and trade.
	   Ethiopian officials have maintained that the border conflict
will not affect its development scheme, pointing to the fact that
nearly 30 percent of its 1998/9 budget was allocated for capital
expenditures.
	   Earlier this year, the African Development Bank approved an dlrs
80 million loan for livestock and educational development projects.
	   The bank is considering a request for a dlrs 25 million loan to
finance health sector development.
	   Ethiopia will rely on counterpart funds, bilateral and
international technical assistance and loans to meet 3.4 billion
birr (dlrs 485 million) or 30 percent of its budgeted expenses for
1998/99.

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Megan Murray and her Wyckoff
Torpedoes teammates wore World Cup T-shirts that read: ``This is my
game. This is my future. Watch me play.''
	   The New Jersey team, which plays indoors and outdoors
year-round, is 57-3, and on Wednesday it met another group that's
used to winning _ the U.S. women's national soccer team.
	   ``The girls are absolutely thrilled,'' Wyckoff coach Bill Reed
said. ``These are their heroines. They have their posters up on the
wall. Some of the players on the team could aspire to be at this
level if they continue to work.''
	   The Torpedoes were on hand at Giants Stadium for a workout by
the national team, which is preparing for the Goodwill Games soccer
tournament that begins Saturday.
	   The young players collected autographs from many members of the
national squad, including star forward Mia Hamm.
	   Hamm, who led the U.S. women to an Olympic gold medal in 1996
and will be at center stage when the Women's World Cup comes to the
United States next year, said the chances of a U.S. women's
professional league remained uncertain.
	   ``We're told different things all the time,'' she said. ``One of
the things is let's see how successful this World Cup is. We're all
planning on it being a success. After that, I think it's vital to
ensure the level of play on the national team and the level of play
in the country.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOT TIME AT THE BEACH: New York is gripped by a heat wave, and
when beach volleyball opened its Goodwill Games' run Wednesday, the
players knew the only thing cool would be their sunglasses.
	   The temperature at the side of the sand court in Central Park
was 110 degrees as the No. 1 U.S. team of Karch Kiraly and Adam
Johnson defeated Canada's John Child and Marke Heese 15-8.
	   ``The sand was extra hot and my feet were burning,'' Heese said.
``I couldn't stand still to start my approach.''
	   Kiraly, a 38-year-old from Southern California who has played in
all kinds of weather, said the conditions were not too severe.
	   ``It's definitely hot out there, but it's nothing that we're not
used to,'' he said.
	   The volleyball beach, in what is usually an ice-skating rink,
features some of the best scenery at the Goodwill Games, set
against a backdrop of trees and skyscrapers.
	   ``It's a beautiful setting,'' said Martin Conde of Argentina,
who teamed with Esteban Martinez to defeat Paul and Mark Laciga of
Switzerland 15-6. ``I never thought I would play in Central Park in
my life.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MEDALIST ARRESTED: Erick Walder won the long-jump silver medal
at the Goodwill Games in New York. The next day, he was booked on
misdemeanor charges stemming from an argument at the University of
Arkansas.
	   Walder was arrested Tuesday on charges of assault and
terroristic threatening for allegedly pushing traffic warden Robert
A. Gilbride twice in an argument June 12, police said.
	   Gilbride was trying to put a vehicle boot on Walder's car when
the athlete pushed him, according to university police reports.
	   Walder apparently surrendered to the Fayetteville, Arkansas,
police department after a warrant for his arrest was issued by the
city prosecutor's office.
	   Walder was a nine-time All-American at Arkansas from 1991-94,
and his 28-foot long jump remains a school record four years after
it was set.
	   He jumped 27-6 Monday night to finish second to Cuba's Ivan
Pedrozo, who went 28-\.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fleeing some of the worst fighting
in weeks, thousands of ethnic Albanian civilians have reportedly
jammed a rebel-held village in Kosovo, severely straining food and
medical supplies in the isolated community.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and ethnic Albanian officials are accusing each
other of atrocities in the five-day battle for Orahovac, which
ended with a guerrilla retreat and thousands of Albanians streaming
toward rebel strongholds.
	   Hundreds of Serbs also sought refuge in nearby villages during
fighting, which ended before dawn Wednesday.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said a Serb policeman was killed late
Wednesday in an ambush near Pec, the province's second-largest
city, near the Albanian border.
	   On Thursday, the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore reported
that 13,000 people had fled Orahovac for Malisevo, a stronghold of
the Kosovo Liberation Army about 16 kilometers (10 miles) to the
northeast.
	   The newspaper said 75 people were crowded into a single house,
whose owner was down to two sacks of flour. Supplies of food,
medicine and clothing were dwindling.
	   According to the daily, a makeshift hospital has been set up in
Malisevo to care for the wounded. But medical supplies are scarce,
and there is no running water.
	   The village, which had a population of about 8,000, has been cut
off from normal commerce for weeks because of Serb roadblocks
between the community and Pristina, the Serb-ruled provincial
capital.
	   Also Thursday, the International Red Cross reported Thursday
that almost 20,000 people _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians _ had fled
the fighting in Orahovac.
	   The Red Cross also said it delivered 5 tons of flour and over
1,000 food parcels to Malisevo in the past few days. The Red Cross
also said the KLA had handed over 35 Serbs, including a nun and
seven monks, whom they kidnapped during the fighting around
Orahovac.
	   They were brought here with Red Cross escorts.
	   The local Serbian Christian Orthodox authorities said the Serbs
were abducted Tuesday from a monastery where they had taken refuge.
Two grenades damaged the monastery and the monks immediately ran
into the chapel and started praying, the private FoNet news agency,
based in Belgrade, reported.
	   They waved a white flag and surrendered to approaching
guerrillas, who released them after several hours.
	   One of them, Branko Krstic, 61, told FoNet that one of the monks
was beaten.
	   Another group of hostages _ Serbs who had fled fighting in
Croatia three years ago _ were handed over Wednesday to the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees. The Croatian Serbs had been living
in makeshift shelters in the vineyards on the edge of the town.
	   ``The shooting started Friday afternoon,'' one of the Croatian
Serbs, Aleksandar Graovac, told The Associated Press. ``Bullets
were hitting our huts, too, and we laid low, without food and
water. We didn't dare go out for three days. There was so much
fighting. I suppose many died.''
	   Similar allegations of mistreatment were leveled by the
Albanians against the Serbs.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed,
including some dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... The situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the group said.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence from the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.

BMW says six-month profits up 17 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rover announcement that it will cut jobs and
production. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Rover &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German automaker BMW said Thursday its
net profit rose to 511 million marks (dlrs 285 million) in the
first six months from 435 million marks (dlrs 243 million) in the
same period last year.
	   BMW said it expects production, sales and earnings for the full
year to top those of 1997, even though the strength of the British
pound is a ``serious burden'' for sales of its British unit, Rover.
	   Rover announced in Birmingham, England, that it would eliminate
at least 1,500 jobs and put some workers on a four-day work week to
offset effects of the strong pound.
	   BMW, or Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said overall sales rose to
31 billion marks (dlrs 17.3 billion) in the first six months, up
from 29.1 billion marks (dlrs 16.3 billion) a year earlier.
	   Deliveries of BMW, Rover, Land Rover, Mini and MG brand vehicles
remained unchanged at about 600,000, though auto production rose 1
percent in the January-June period.

Boy accuses father in slaying of 8-year-old playmate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An 11-year-old boy who had confessed to killing an
eight-year-old playmate has retracted his story and is now accusing
his father.
	   He also told investigators his 59-year-old father sexually
abused him, his brothers and sisters, news reports said Thursday.
	   The father, a poor fisherman, is in custody in a Rome jail; he
denies the charges.
	   Simeone Nardacci's body was found by a police dog Monday in a
shabby Ostia neighborhood, on the seacoast outside Rome.
Authorities said the eight-year-old had been beaten and left to
die.
	   The 11-year-old initially told police he had murdered Simeone
because he refused to join in ``erotic games.'' He later changed
his story.

ASEAN ministers unlikely to agree on changes in non-interference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Efforts by Thailand and the
Philippines to broaden the ability of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to become involved in the problems of individual
members were set back Thursday as several countries expressed
disapproval.
	   Since its founding 31 years ago, ASEAN has observed a policy of
non-intervention in the internal affairs of its member countries,
making it difficult for it to deal with issues such as forest fires
in Indonesia that blanketed much of the region in haze.
	   Thailand and the Philippines are proposing that ASEAN shift
instead to a policy of ``flexible engagement,'' which is to be
discussed during the annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers
starting Friday in Manila.
	   But foreign ministers from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia
rejected the proposed shift.
	   ``I prefer the policy of non-intervention,'' Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi told reporters after arriving Thursday.
	   ``The success of ASEAN cooperation is that we have been
comfortable. Any feeling that you will be criticized, any finger
pointing, will make you uncomfortable.''
	   Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar also declared his
opposition to any change, and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas has said ASEAN should not tinker with a fundamental
principle.
	   The proposed shift comes as Southeast Asian countries are
becoming more aware that problems in one nation _ such as currency
devaluations, political unrest or environmental degradation _ often
affect its neighbors.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said ASEAN's nine member
countries should sit down and discuss the proposed change as a
family, adding that differences in opinions don't need to lead to a
squabble.
	   ``I think it's appropriate to say that it's a family adjustment
by some family members, for changing times, a changing situation,
changing realities,'' Pitsuwan said. ``We'll see what we can make
out of it.''
	   A shift was also supported Thursday by a meeting of human rights
groups in Manila, including Amnesty International.
	   Formed in Bangkok in 1967, ASEAN became the world's most rapidly
growing region until speculative currency attacks ravaged Thailand
a year ago and spread into a regionwide financial crisis.
	   ASEAN's willingness to consider such a critical change in its
basic policy demonstrates it is now maturing, Philippine Secretary
of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon said.
	   ``Times have changed. After 31 years, we are now adults and we
should be able to discuss our problems frankly,'' he said. ``The
realization that we are all together in the same boat is becoming
clear.''
	   Siazon said he does not expect an immediate consensus from
ASEAN, which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN began to stretch its non-intervention policy last year
when it postponed Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup
led by co-premier Hun Sen. Since then ASEAN has urged the Cambodian
government to normalize politics by holding elections, which are
scheduled for Sunday _ during the ASEAN meetings.
	   The foreign ministers also plan to discuss the currency crisis
and recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. Next week, they
will meet with 10 ``dialogue partners,'' including the United
States, China, Japan and the European Union, to discuss security
issues.

Human rights groups urge ASEAN to adopt `flexible engagement'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Human rights activists urged the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Thursday to adopt a proposed
``flexible engagement'' policy to promote democracy and economic
development among members of the regional group.
	   The proposal, made by Thailand and supported by the Philippines,
has been opposed by other members of ASEAN because it would depart
from the group's longstanding principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of member countries.
	   The human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the
Philippine-based Initiatives for International Dialogue, held
meetings this week on Asia-Pacific security ahead of the annual
ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting starting Friday in Manila.
	   Debbie Stothard of Altsean, a group based in Thailand that
supports democracy activists in Myanmar, said ASEAN should be more
open to dialogue among governments and also between governments and
their people.
	   ``We are now in a region of countries without fences. What
happens in one country impacts on another,'' she said.
	   In a statement, Amnesty International said security problems in
the region, particularly in Cambodia and Myanmar, are the ``shadow
of human rights violations.''
	   ``Conflicts cannot be resolved, confidence cannot be built and
multilateral cooperation cannot be strengthened unless regional
security issues are addressed at their root cause _ the violation
of human rights,'' the group said.
	   Naing Aung, the exiled chairman of the All Burma Students'
Democratic Front, said ASEAN should ``convince'' the military junta
in Myanmar to release all political prisoners and resume a
substantive dialogue with the opposition led by Nobel laureate Aung
San Suu Kyi.
	   Agio Pereira of the East Timor Relief Association said ASEAN
countries should also push the Indonesian government to hold a
referendum to determine whether the Timorese people want
independence or integration with Indonesia.
	   Indonesia is among the countries that oppose a ``flexible
engagement'' policy. It annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after
sending in troops.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon says speaking out on
common concerns among ASEAN members is now timely in view of their
growing economic integration, but such a shift to ``flexible
engagement'' does not mean interference in domestic affairs.
	   Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said the ASEAN
foreign ministers will have ``very extensive discussions'' of the
proposed shift.

Italian Wages Talks Launched, Union Calls For General Strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's government, unions and employers on Thursday
started _ then promptly recessed _ talks on a five-year-old wage
pact credited with taming once-rampant inflation.
	   Any breakdown in the talks would be a serious blow to Italy's
credibility in the European economic and monetary union and its bid
to conform with EMU requirements.
	   Labor Minister Tiziano Treu met with union leaders and the
employers' association separately, but made no progress on
resolving their differences. The talks were to resume in September.
	   Sergio D'Antoni, leader of the Cisl, one of Italy's biggest
unions, called for a general strike in September. But leaders of
two other leading unions, the Cgil and the Uil, refused to back his
call.
	   Giorgio Fossa, the head of Confindustria, the employers'
association, said Confindustria will keep pressing for changes in
the 1993 wage pact. The association in April threatened to abandon
it if the government goes through with the 35-hour work week.
	   The 1993 accord helped curb inflation to 1.8 percent last year;
it was 4 percent in 1996 and 5.4 percent in 1992. It also eased
labor tensions. It gives workers guaranteed wage increases, but
puts a ceiling on the hikes.
	   Keeping a lid on inflation is critical because it will help
allay fears among EMU members that Italy's high debt is a time bomb
that could trigger interest rate hikes.

Lebanese minister retracts statement on slain Bahraini
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's foreign minister on Thursday
retracted a statement that a man found shot dead in a mountain town
this week was a Bahraini intelligence agent.
	   ``Preliminary information had indicated that the slain Bahraini
(was an intelligence agent),'' a statement issued by Foreign
Minister Fares Bweiz's office said. But the Bahraini foreign
minister ``did not confirm this, pending more accurate information
on this subject,'' the terse statement added.
	   It did not elaborate.
	   On Wednesday, Bweiz said the Bahrain government has confirmed to
his ministry that the person whose body was discovered on Monday
was an intelligence agent.
	   Lebanese newspaper reports identified him as Tawfik Abdel-Nabi
al-Baharna. Bahrain confirmed the name but denied that he had any
link with the country's security apparatus. However, Bahrain also
did not say what he was doing in Lebanon.
	   Al-Baharna's body was found in Beit Mery town with a gunshot
wound to his head and a pistol in his left hand to imply that he
committed suicide.
	   Local media reports said police investigators were acting on two
theories: the victim was either spying on exiled Bahraini
dissidents, or he ran into heavy losses at a casino and that
somehow was a motive behind his death, be it suicide or murder.
	   Al-Baharna was staying at a Beit Mery hotel.
	   The As-Safir reported Thursday that according to investigators
al-Baharna was a regular customer at the casino.

Gore tours Chernobyl, urges Ukraine to shut remaining reactor

<TEXT>
	   CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al
Gore circled by helicopter over the dome of concrete and steel that
seals Chernobyl's ruined reactor, getting a first-hand look
Thursday at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   He gazed at the top of the hastily-constructed structure through
the open door of the chopper, then landed and walked up to it for a
close-up inspection.
	   The vice president also toured the nearby ghost town of Pripyat,
walking through abandoned apartment blocks and a children's
playground. He spoke quietly to one Chernobyl plant worker who used
to live there but was evacuated following the accident because of
high radiation levels.
	   Gore made no remarks during the trip, saying he was collecting
his thoughts and would speak later in the day.
	   Gore, who has made environmental issues one of his political
priorities, has been discussing the fate of the reactor and its
deteriorating sarcophagus on a two-day visit to Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian officials say they need Western help to shore up the
weakening concrete sarcophagus over reactor No. 4, which was
destroyed in the 1986 nuclear accident. They also want aid to shut
down the last reactor that remains in operation at Chernobyl.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has promised to close
Chernobyl's only working reactor by 2000, but top Ukrainian
officials say the government first wants dlrs 1.2 billion
compensation for lost energy.
	   ``It's imperative for the safety of the Ukrainian people, for
the safety of Europe, for the well-being of the world, for the
remaining reactor ... to be shut down as soon as it is feasible to
do so,'' Gore insisted Wednesday.
	   ``I'm confident that we will be able to help them replace that
power and that they will live up to their commitment to shut down
that reactor by the year 2000,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Kuchma remained non-committal about a closure date. He said that
Ukraine had decided in principle to close Chernobyl but needs more
foreign aid to replace the lost energy capacity.
	   ``This is a normal negotiating process,'' he said.
	   Gore plans to hold discussions on a new international effort to
raise funds to rebuild the deteriorating Chernobyl shelter. That
project is expected to cost dlrs 750 million, and Kuchma said
Ukraine has so far secured only dlrs 390 million.
	   Gore and Kuchma have agreed to set up a joint laboratory to
studying the effects of radiation at Chernobyl.
	   In talks Wednesday, they reached a deal on textile trade and
cooperation in combating crime, and discussed Ukraine's deep
economic troubles.
	   The United States has expressed displeasure with the pace of
economic reforms in Ukraine, and had threatened to withhold part of
its dlrs 225 million in aid for 1998. Ukraine is the third-largest
recipient of U.S. aid.
	   Kuchma called for more assistance, saying, ``Ukraine's financial
crisis is no less complex and threatening than in Russia,'' which
has just received billions of dollars in international loans.
	   Ukraine is negotiating a dlrs 2.5 million loan from the
International Monetary Fund, and Gore warned that the outcome of
those talks is up to Ukraine.
	   ``Bold reform is ... critical for Ukraine's ability to reach a
successful conclusion in its negotiations with the IMF,'' Gore
stressed. ``In the absence of those terms, it would be very
difficult for an agreement to be reached.''

Police refuse opposition figure rally permit in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police on Thursday refused to grant a
prominent opposition figure a permit to stage a rally to mark the
anniversary of a bloody 1996 crackdown against her supporters, the
official Antara news agency said.
	   Jakarta police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman said the
planned ceremony would pose security problems.
	   Opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri said the ban was
inconsistent with government promises to deliver political reform.
	   She said she would defy the ban and hold the rally in a central
Jakarta sports ground Monday.
	   About 5,000 people are expected to attend, she added.
	   Megawati is the daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno and commands the support of tens of thousands of
supporters.
	   In 1996, she gained wide popularity after she criticized the
autocratic policies of then President Suharto.
	   Within months, she was ousted as head of the minority Indonesian
Democratic Party in a party maneuver backed by the government.
	   Thousands of her supporters took control of the party's Jakarta
headquarters in protest. They were later forced out by hundreds of
police and troops in an assault that triggered rioting across the
capital.
	   Five people were confirmed dead and 16 are still listed as
missing.
	   Since then, supporters of her faction within the party have
clashed with rivals on several occasions.
	   Suharto came to power in 1966 after Sukarno was forced to quit
amid social and economic chaos.
	   In May, Suharto's 32-year grip on power ended when he stepped
down following riots and protests brought on by the worst economic
crisis since the Sukarno era.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to
liberalize the country's tightly controlled political system and to
stage free elections next year.
	   However, Megawati and several other government critics recently
said few Indonesians had confidence in Habibie's ability to bring
change or to overcome the nation's deep economic problems.
	   Instead, they urged him to form a coalition of reform groups to
transform Indonesia's political and economic structure.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In the latest Mideast muddle,
Israel said Thursday it expected to resume negotiations with the
Palestinians shortly while the Palestinians announced they would
not return to the table.
	   Both sides have appealed to the United States for help, but have
been rebuffed by the Clinton administration which says Israel and
the Palestinians should try harder to reach agreement on a West
Bank troop pullback without U.S. mediation.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for a gradual Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, to coincide with
greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan, but Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the pullback
and has demanded better Palestinian security guarantees.
	   The Palestinians have said that in three negotiating sessions
this week, Israel did not raise any new ideas and that there was no
point in resuming the talks.
	   On Thursday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat received
Netanyahu's coalition chairman, Meir Shetreet, who delivered a
message from the Israeli prime minister.
	   Shetreet said he delivered new proposals in his talks with
Arafat and that he expected a Palestinian response by tomorrow.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians
would study the message over the weekend. However, a senior
Palestinian official has quoted Arafat as saying that the talks
would not resume until Israel accepted the U.S. proposal.

Syrian paper blasts Israeli bill on Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ A government-controlled newspaper on
Thursday criticized a proposed Israeli legislation stipulating that
a Golan Heights withdrawal must be approved by referendum.
	   ``It is actually a declaration of war against the region and the
peace process and a direct defiance of the international
community,'' the Al-Baath said in a front page editorial.
	   Israel captured the strategic heights from Syria in the 1967
Mideast war. Syria insists that no peace talks can be held until
Israel agree to return the territory first.
	   On Wednesday, Israeli parliament gave preliminary approval to
the bill by the Third Way, a party staunchly opposed to a troop
withdrawal from Golan Heights.
	   The bill also stipulates that a special majority of 61 members
of the 120-seat parliament must approve a Golan pullback.
	   The decision ``unveiled Israel's aggressive image and its
intentions to torpedo the peace process once and forever,''
Al-Baath said.
	   Critics in Israel say the legislation could make it even more
difficult to negotiate a peace agreement with Syria. Negotiations
between the two countries were suspended in February 1996.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Israel said Thursday it expected to
resume negotiations with the Palestinians shortly _ but the
Palestinians said they would not return to the table anytime soon.
	   Both sides have appealed to the United States for help, but have
been rebuffed by the Clinton administration, which says Israel and
the Palestinians should try harder to reach agreement on a West
Bank troop pullback without U.S. mediation.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for a gradual Israeli troop
withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank, to coincide
with greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic
militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan, but Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the scope of the pullback
and has demanded better Palestinian security guarantees.
	   The Palestinians have said that in three negotiating sessions
this week, Israel did not raise any new ideas and that there was no
point in resuming the talks.
	   Late Wednesday, Netanyahu dispatched his envoy, Yitzhak Molcho,
to persuade Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree to more
talks. However, Arafat wants to hold off on further negotiations
until Israel accepts the American peace proposal, said a senior
Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Despite the Palestinians' position, Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai was optimistic Thursday. ``I think the talks will
continue soon. I think there is a basis for progress in the
talks,'' Mordechai said.
	   The negotiations were arranged by the United States after it
announced earlier this month that it has exhausted its role as
mediator. The talks were widely seen as a last chance for Israel
and the Palestinians to reach agreement on a troop pullback.
	   The United States appeared in no hurry to return to the scene.
	   The sides ``ought to try harder'' to solve their differences,
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in response to appeals by
both Israel and the Palestinians that the United States intervene.
	   In another attempt to bring the United States back into the
picture, Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky called U.S.
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on Netanyahu's behalf,
Israel army radio said.
	   Sharansky asked that U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross return to
the region for another shuttle mission, but Berger rejected the
idea, the radio said.

Islamic group sets up own party in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's largest Islamic
organization re-entered the political arena Thursday when it
established its own party to contest elections scheduled for next
year.
	   The ``National Awakening Party,'' formed by the 30
million-member Nahdlatul Ulama group, is the latest of dozens of
new political parties created in the two months since authoritarian
former President Suharto quit after 32 years in power.
	   Suharto strictly controlled Indonesia's political system and
allowed only three parties to operate, under strict supervision.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to end a ban
on the creation of new political parties.
	   But he has said that to avoid sectarian divisions, all new
organizations must be open to all Indonesians regardless of race or
religion.
	   Nahdlatul Ulama leader Gus Dur said membership in the new party
would be open to all despite the party's Muslim roots. The party
would also act independently of Nahdlatul Ulama itself.
	   In a speech to about 500 people, he predicted that the party
would grow to be a major political force.
	   Before 1973, Nahdlatul Ulama operated as a political party in
its own right, but it later joined forces with other Muslim
parties. In 1984, it ended all its political activities.
	   Party officials said the group was setting up the new party to
take part in the democratization of Indonesia.
	   They announced no specific policies but said the party would
reflect the importance of nationalism and religion in line with the
aspirations of Nahdlatul Ulama's members.
	   Several other Muslim groups have also announced the
establishment of Islamic parties.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Muslim nation.
	   Last week, Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid said 42 new
political parties had been established in recent weeks.
	   Indonesia's Parliament is drafting new electoral laws that will
determine which parties will be allowed to operate.

Rees-Jones' lawyer attacked in street
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French lawyer for bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones,
sole survivor of the crash that killed Princess Diana, was attacked
in the street and is demanding police protection.
	   Contacted Thursday by The Associated Press, lawyer Christian
Curtil confirmed he was attacked on Tuesday, but declined to
comment further.
	   Judicial sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Curtil was punched in the face by a large man wearing a turban, who
waited for him as he left his Paris office.
	   Curtil, who says he's received written and telephoned death
threats for the last few weeks, told investigators that a few hours
after the attack, someone called him and said ``The second time, I
won't miss you.''
	   His client, Rees-Jones, was badly injured in the crash last Aug.
31 that killed Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed, and their driver,
Henri Paul.
	   Rees-Jones was an employee of Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father,
who owns the Ritz Hotel. But in May, he quit working for Al Fayed.
He has filed as a civil party in the case, meaning he has access to
the case file and could receive damages if someone is implicated in
the crash.
	   Recently, Curtil asked investigating judge Herve Stephan to
interview the management of the Ritz Hotel, specifically director
Frank Klein.
	   Curtil hasn't wanted to comment on who would possibly be making
death threats against him. He has, however, asked for police
protection.

Cambodian election observer delegation comes across dead man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A delegation of European Union
observers and journalists covering Cambodia's parliamentary
elections came across the body of a shooting victim at a roadside
Thursday, a reminder of the violence that has become endemic in
Cambodia.
	   Human rights workers were summoned to investigate the case.
There was no immediate indication that the killing was politically
motivated. Local residents near the town of Kompong Cham, where the
body was found, identified the victim as a motorcycle taxi driver.
	   Marie-Ange Lescure, information officer for the EU election
observation mission, said the body was found on the road near a
plantation. The victim had been shot in the back of the head and
appeared to have been dead a few hours.
	   The delegation included some observers, provincial election
officials and journalists covering the trip of EU mission chief
Glenys Kinnock to Kompong Cham. Kinnock had flown back to Phnom
Penh by helicopter and did not see the body.
	   Murder and violence are rampant in Cambodia, which has a fragile
law enforcement system after some 30 years of civil war and the
Khmer Rouge genocide of the late 1970s, which killed most of the
country's lawyers and judges.
	   The election campaign has been marred by accusations of
widespread violence and intimidation by strongman Hun Sen, who has
called the polls in an effort to win back legitimacy and foreign
aid lost when he toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, last year in a bloody coup. Voting is Sunday.

Steven Spielberg's project on Holocaust survivors nears its target
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Available &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a ``race against time,'' Hollywood director
Steven Spielberg's project to film 50,000 separate interviews with
Holocaust survivors in nearing its goal, the project leader said
Thursday.
	   Since Spielberg launched the endeavor four years ago, it has
amassed 46,600 interviews with World War II Holocaust survivors and
witnesses, totaling almost 100,000 hours of material.
	   ``We have amassed enough tape to circumnavigate the globe,''
Michael Berenbaum, president of Spielberg's Shoah Visual History
Foundation, told a news conference. ``To see that material would
take you until 2010 if you worked 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, without stop.''
	   The project, spawned by Spielberg's Oscar-winning movie
``Schindler's List,'' has no commercial aims. When completed it
will be made available to schools, libraries and other users around
the world.
	   ``Survivors made two commitments,'' said Berenbaum, ``they were
asked _ no _ they were commanded to say: remember, and don't let
the world forget.''
	   ``By testifying, they have remembered, and, by making this
material public, we will not let the world forget,'' he said.
	   An estimated 6 million Jews have died in the Holocaust carried
out by Nazi Germany.
	   Filming the survivors has been especially difficult in the
former Soviet Union because of poor communications and a long
history of anti-Semitism that makes many survivors reluctant to
speak of their past.
	   ``We're in a race against time, because if we don't do it now we
would never be able to do it,'' Berenbaum said.
	   Some 4,600 interviews have been filmed in 360 cities throughout
the former Soviet Union _ making Russian the second leading
language after English in a project that involves 53 countries and
31 languages.
	   ``We now have a new atmosphere in Russia where this material can
be used freely and creatively, where the word `Jew' is no longer a
forbidden word or a dirty word ... and the experience of the Jews
can be shown truthfully, fully and completely,'' Berenbaum said.
	   The former Soviet Union is particularly important, ``because so
much of the experience of the Holocaust happened on these
territories, so little of that experience is known and, most
importantly, for many years the truth of this experience couldn't
be told,'' he said.
	   In Belarus, he noted, ``we send people to villages days away
from telephones and we discover one or two Jews who are the last
(survivors) of cities and towns and villages that once had
thousands and tens of thousands of Jews.''
	   In Belarus alone, an estimated 810,000 Jews were killed by the
Nazis, some 200,000 of them citizens of the former Soviet republic
and the rest brought by the Nazis to Belarus from other European
states.
	   Berenbaum said he had held a series of meetings with Russian
government officials, filmmakers and bankers and proposed making
the material available in future exhibitions, museums and
elsewhere.

Gough grabs two wickets in South Africa's 67 for two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ English pace bowler Darren Gough took
two quick wickets to give the home team an early upper hand in the
fourth cricket test against South Africa at Trent Bridge Thursday.
	   Gough removed both openers _ Gehardus Liebenberg and Gary
Kirsten _ in successive overs.
	   South Africa, sent into bat when England won the toss, struggled
to 67 for two at lunch.
	   Alec Stewart's decision to send South Africa into bat puzzled
some pundits but Gough's early breakthrough vindicated the
decision.
	   Jacques Kallis and Daryll Cullinan batted South Africa safely
through to lunch remaining unbeaten on 14 and 30 respectively.
	   After a brief 19-minutes break for rain Gough, bowling from the
pavilion end, had South Africa on the back foot.
	   The heavy cloud cover worked to Gough's advantage. Liebenberg,
who had survived a confident shout for a catch off Dominic Cork's
bowling, was dismissed nine balls later.
	   Having crisply driven Gough for his first boundary, Liebenberg
(13) went for an expensive drive and edged a catch to Stewart.
	   Kirsten (seven) tried to withdraw from a disconcertingly bounced
delivery but was too late as the ball hit the toe of the willow and
cannoned onto the stumps.
	   Test debutant Andrew Flintoff found the edge of Cullinan's bat,
but the ball didn't carry to Graeme Hick at second slip.
	   Cullinan was the dominant partner _ hitting three boundaries _
as South Africa brought up the 50 off 117 balls.
	   Gough's two wickets has cost him 27 runs.

Rwanda tribunal registrar rejects charges of mismanagement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The top administrator of the Rwanda
genocide tribunal Thursday rejected charges of incompetence and
mismanagement lodged against it by one of its six judges.
	   Registrar Agwu Ukiwe Okali said he was ``infuriated'' by the
decision of Swedish Judge Lennart Aspegren to resign in protest
over what he called bad management and inadequate working
conditions.
	   Last week, Aspegren told journalists from his Swedish home that
the tribunal, founded in November 1994, had made no progress in
improving its management despite the dismissal last year of the
previous administrator.
	   ``All his statements are false,'' Okali, who was named registrar
in February 1997, said. ``These are all sound effects with no
factual bases. He's impressed by no one but himself.''
	   Okali said the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will
hand down its first verdict and impose its first sentence next
month in the 1994 Hutu-government-orchestrated genocide in which at
least half a million people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed.
	   The tribunal, which is holding 35 suspects, will sentence former
Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, who has pleaded guilty, and convict
Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former Hutu mayor in central Rwanda, Okali
said.
	   Both were charged with overseeing or ordering the killings
carried out during 90 days from April to July 1994.
	   Tutsi-led rebels ousted the government in July 1994 and ended
the killing.
	   In addition, Okali said, by the end of the year, the tribunal
will conclude the three trials which opened last year, and open a
another against former Rwandan army commander, Lt. Col. Theoneste
Bagasora.
	   Okali said Aspegren never produced any evidence to support his
allegations of mismanagement and incompetence of the tribunal,
based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   He said Aspegren's comments will tarnish the reputation of the
tribunal at a time the institution was struggling to restore its
credibility.
	   Tribunal officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was upset by the latest
allegations. They came a little more than a year after Okali, a
Nigerian, was named to head the troubled administrative wing after
a 1996 U.N. investigation cited incompetence, financial
mismanagement and cronyism throughout the body.
	   Aspegren charged that the suspects in detention are allowed to
visit each other, make international phone calls and produce
brochures which they can distribute to their supporters.
	   Okali responded that he was merely implementing exisiting U.N.
detention rules, and that all calls were monitored expect those
between a client and a lawyer.
	   Okali was meeting Rwandan officials with the chief U.N.
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, who arrived to boost the tribunal's
credibility in the country.
	   Critical of the tribunal's slow pace, the Rwandans have been
conducting their own trials. On April 24, the first 22 genocide
convicts were executed by firing squad in public.
	   The most extreme penalty the Arusha tribunal can impose is life
in prison. It has not yet been determined where defendants
convicted and sentenced to life would serve their sentences.

Spanish giants Madrid, Barcelona battle for De Boer twins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ In what is looking increasingly like a
Dutch invasion, Spanish clubs Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have
become locked in a battle to sign up Netherlands' World Cup twins
Frank and Ronald De Boer, news reports said Thursday.
	   A week after contracting Dutch national coach Guus Hiddink,
reigning European Champion Real Madrid has stepped up its bid to
buy the two 28-year-olds who have both expressed a desire to leave
their current club Ajax of Amsterdam.
	   But already in a with a firm offer for the twins is Madrid's
arch rival, FC Barcelona, a side bursting with Dutch stars and
which happens to be coached by former Ajax boss, Dutchman Louis Van
Gaal.
	   In the middle of it all is the Dutch Arbitration Tribunal which
is expected to rule July 28 on whether Ajax can keep the two
players who have contracts with the club until 2004.
	   Frank, a defender, and Ronald a forward, were key members of the
squad Hiddink led to the semifinal of the 1998 World Cup. They have
also been crucial to Ajax's trophy-filled success in recent years.
	   Meanwhile, if the twins are to part ways, Real has expressed
preference for Ronald while Barcelona has its eyes set on Frank.
English champion Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are also reported to
be in the running for the two.
	   ''Our main target is Ronald but if its possible to get the two,
we won't hold back,'' Real chairman Lorenzo Sanz told Spain's
leading sports daily Marca.
	   Meanwhile, Van Gaal confirmed that his ''first choice is
Frank... but I'm not discarding Ronald if he is on the market.''
	   According to Frank, both players already have their minds made
up.
	   ''If I leave Ajax, it will be to play for Barcelona,'' Frank
told Marca.
	   About Ronald? ``The only thing for sure is that he won't be
going to Barcelona'' Frank said, explaining that his brother feels
there are too many Dutch players at Barcelona and too many eligible
for his position.
	   Barcelona last month signed Dutch world Cup star Phillip Cocu.
It already boasts national team players Michael Reiziger and
Winston Bogarde as well as Dutch goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.
	   Real Madrid, meanwhile, has Dutch international Clarence Seedorf
on its books.

After a week, Spanish pilot gets OK to leave Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Spanish pilot was given approval to
leave Vietnam Thursday, a week after he was grounded because
officials said he hadn't received permission to fly in.
	   Michel Gordillo, 43, said he had filed a flight plan to
Vietnamese officials and, after hearing no rejection, had assumed
it was OK to pilot his handmade plane to Ho Chi Minh City.
	   Gordillo, a pilot for Spain's Iberia airlines, claimed such an
arrangement is standard operating procedure.
	   But when he arrived in the former Saigon last Thursday, he was
taken to immigration officials, who confiscated his passport
because he had no visa.
	   Jordi Carrasco, a Spanish Embassy official, said Gordillo left
at 12:05 p.m. (0505 GMT) en route to Danang, the furthest he could
reasonably travel during daylight. His plane is not equipped to fly
at night. He then planned to depart at dawn Friday for China.
	   Taking advantage of virtually every daylight hour, he hopes to
overfly Russia, then cross the Bering Straits and arrive in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on Aug. 3, the night before the Experimental
Aircraft Association convention there ends.
	   ``In the end, all the political hassles have been resolved,''
Carrasco said by telephone. ``He was very happy when he left.''
	   Vietnamese officials have not commented on the snafu. Gordillo
earlier said his case had been bounced from civil aviation
authorities to the military to the Police Ministry.
	   Gordillo, who lives in a small village outside Madrid, left
Spain on June 24. He originally had planned to overfly Laos to get
to China. But permission from Laos, requested a month in advance,
did not come in time, so he rearranged his course.
	   Gordillo, who said he began making model airplanes when he was
7, spent four years making his first full-size plane.
	   It has a maximum weight of 650 kilograms (1,430 pounds), a
32-foot (10-meter) wingspan and an 80-horsepower engine. It can
manage 1,200-1,300 kilometers (745-810 miles) per day.

Israel: reported Iranian missile test not immediate threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with information about engine tests &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister said Thursday he was
concerned about reports that Iran has tested a medium-range
missile, but said this did not pose an immediate threat to Israel.
	   Israeli officials said they did not have immediate independent
confirmation of U.S. newspaper reports Thursday that Iran this week
successfully tested a missile with a range of 800 miles (1,287
kilometers), which meant it could hit Israel or Saudi Arabia.
	   However, military analyst Gerald Steinberg said Israeli
intelligence was aware that Iran had been testing the missile's
engine over the past year.
	   ``This (testing the engine) is a normal prelude for testing the
missile itself,'' said Steinberg, a researcher at the Besa Center
for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. ``There is nothing
surprising in the fact of an Iranian test. It has been expected.''
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he did not believe an
Iranian missile could reach Israel, but that the reported missile
tests were ``a very serious matter.''
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said that although Israel has
repeatedly expressed concern over the Iranian missile program, it
is as much a threat to Iran's neighbors as to Israel.
	   ``The potential threat to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States
and Western interests, particularly those of the United States, is
as great as the threat to Israel, if not greater,'' Fogel told The
Associated Press.
	   Military analyst Barry Rubin dismissed speculation cited by The
New York Times in its story on the missile test Thursday that
Israel might possibly retaliate against Iran.
	   ``I don't think Israel is going to attack Iran just because Iran
has tested a medium-range missile. After all Syria has lots of
missiles and that has not led to a military response,'' said Rubin,
who is also a researcher at the Besa Center.
	   Both Rubin and Steinberg noted that until recently U.S.
intelligence downplayed Israeli warnings that Iran was getting
close to acquiring ballistic missiles.
	   ``They (the Americans) were wrong ... and about six months ago
they suddenly turned round and said Iran was very close to
obtaining the missiles.'' Rubin said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rescue teams searched the Brittany coast Thursday
for survivors after a sailboat full of French boy scouts capsized,
leaving at least four scouts dead, French radio reported.
	   Two people were still missing Thursday afternoon after the boat
overturned with seven aboard off the wind-blown coast overnight,
raising questions over whether the Paris-area teenagers lacked
supervision.
	   Rescuers who found three of the scouts alive and were looking
for one more, as well as another person who went missing from his
sailboat after he tried to help the boys, France Info reported.
Authorities earlier reported at least three dead.
	   Two helicopters and several boats aided in the search off
Perros-Guirec, on the northwestern end of Brittany, rescue
officials said.
	   A Brittany prosecutor opened an investigation Thursday into who
was responsible for the accident.
	   ``We know that there was no adult on that boat,'' prosecutor
Philippe Astruc told reporters. ``Those minors, some of whom were
16 years old, did they have the qualifications? ... That's what I'm
trying to determine.''

Australia pledges to keep strong business ties with Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's foreign minister
pledged Thursday to stand by Malaysia and maintain strong business
ties during the Southeast Asian nation's economic woes.
	   ``Australia is a friend of Malaysia not only during easy times
but in a long haul,'' Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told
reporters after meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   ``I made it clear to the prime minister that Australian
businesses throughout the economic crisis will remain engaged and
will not just walk away during this difficult time,'' said Downer,
who arrived in Malaysia Wednesday for a three-day visit.
	   Downer also met Thursday with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Daim Zainuddin, minister in charge of
economic recovery.
	   Downer said Australian businessmen understood that Malaysia
needed time to recover from its economic troubles.
	   ``They also realize that if they walk away now from the
Malaysian economy, they will find it very hard to get back into the
Malaysian market when the good times return,'' Downer was quoted as
saying by the government news agency Bernama.
	   Downer was scheduled to talk to businessmen Thursday night about
Australia's commitment to Malaysia and the Southeast Asian region,
the Malaysia-Australia Business Council said.
	   Downer said his discussion with Mahathir focused on the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur in
November.
	   Downer said he suggested to Mahathir that APEC countries develop
a system by which member countries could address the Asian economic
crisis and provide assistance.
	   He also said that the number of Malaysian students studying in
Australia had dropped by 17 percent since last year, when the
crisis started.
	   Downer will leave for Manila Friday to attend the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and post-ministerial
conferences July 26-29.

Flash flood hits Polish resort, killing four

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Flood waters from heavy storms swept
through a resort area in southwestern Poland, killing four people,
officials said Thursday.
	   The overnight flash floods damaged more that 100 houses in
Duszniki Zdroj, Szczytna and Polanica Zdroj near the border with
the Czech Republic, said Piotr Michalski, spokesman for Walbrzych
province.
	   Two men were reported drowned in Duszniki after the water level
in the Dusznica Bystrzycka river jumped 1.5 meters (60 inches),
overflowed its banks and flooded the town, police spokeswoman
Halina Wieczor said.
	   Police found bodies of two other victims in Szczytna, some 450
kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, the spokeswoman said.
	   About 90 residents were evacuated overnight, Michalski said.
Waters receded quickly, but helicopters continued to bring people
out Thursday morning, he said.
	   The wave was not very high, reaching about one meter (one yard)
above the ground floor of the houses. But it came through fast and
with great force, causing a lot of damage, Michalski said.
	   A road to the border crossing with the Czech Republic at Kudowa
Zdroj was temporarily closed by the flooding. It was expected to
reopen late Thursday, Michalski said.
	   Police set a detour for cars heading for the crossing.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.

German baritone Hermann Prey dead at 69
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from career, newspaper quote &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo FRA1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German baritone Hermann Prey, whose
versatile career took him to most of the world's great stages, has
died. He was 69.
	   Prey apparently suffered a heart attack late Wednesday or early
Thursday, his manager's wife, Gesine Lange, said Thursday. He died
at his home near Munich.
	   Prey sang at a matinee at a Munich theater only last Sunday,
Lange said.
	   Equally at home in operas by Rossini, Mozart, Wagner or Richard
Strauss, Prey was also considered the greatest contemporary
performer of Franz Schubert's songs. He started an annual Schubert
festival that rotates between New York and Vienna.
	   ``Even after more than four decades on stage, Prey's lyrical
baritone still exudes a wonderful sonorous warmth,'' the Berlin
newspaper Tagesspiegel wrote last year after a Schubert concert.
	   A Berlin native, Prey made his debut at the State Theater in
Wiesbaden in 1952. He sang at New York's Metropolitan Opera, the
Wagner Festival in Bayreuth, at Milan's Scala, in Vienna and in
London.
	   He was also a director, notably of Mozart's ``The Marriage of
Figaro'' at festivals in the Austrian composer's home town of
Salzburg.
	   Prey is survived by a wife and three children. Funeral
arrangements were not immediately announced.

NATO troops arrest two war crimes suspects in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers have
arrested two Bosnian Serbs indicted for war crimes, a NATO press
release said Thursday.
	   Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad did not resist when troops
surrounded their house Wednesday evening to arrest them in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   They were immediately flown to The Hague, Netherlands, site of
an international war crimes tribunal, the NATO statement said.
	   In their July 1995 indictment, prosecutors alleged the twins
were among guards who tortured and beat to death Muslim inmates at
the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the summer of 1992.
	   They are charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Convention,
torture or inhumane treatment and unlawful confinement and other
crimes.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier confirmed that the twins
had arrived in The Hague. Their arraignment, at which they will be
asked to enter pleas to the charges against them, likely will take
place Monday afternoon, Chartier said.
	   Predrag Banovic is charged with 32 counts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity, his brother Nenad is faces 10 counts.
	   ``This is one more corner which has been turned by this
tribunal,'' Chartier said. ``Today, the number of accused in our
jurisdiction, 30, is higher than the number of accused still at
large, namely 29. This is obviously a welcome development.''
	   On one evening in July 1992, Predrag Banovic beat to death with
a baseball bat a prisoner identified as Fikret Avdic, prosecutors
allege. He is also charged with other beating deaths and stealing
possessions of prisoners at Keraterm.
	   According to the tribunal's indictment covering the Keraterm
camp, inmates were regularly beaten by guards and other Serbs who
visited the camp.
	   ``Killings, beatings, sexual assaults and other cruel and
humiliating actions were committed on every shift and were often
inflicted in full view of the other detainees,'' the indictment
alleges.
	   ``The corpses of detainees were piled next to a garbage area.''
	   The father of the two arrested, Sreten Banovic, recently told a
local Bosnian Serb newspaper he had hoped his sons would slowly be
forgotten.
	   The newspaper Reporter described him as a man who had aged
considerably more than his years. He talked of the crimes his sons
allegedly had committed with a stone face.
	   ``The poorest always pay the most. I want to go and ask (Bosnian
Serb leader Momcilo) Krajisnik if we are all doomed because of the
leaders and whether only those without any money will have to pay
in the end.''
	   Sreten Banovic told Reporter he wished he could go to The Hague
in his sons' place. ``They were only soldiers, and everyone knows
soldiers have to follow orders,'' he said.

Australia's Conran takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AOMORI, Japan (AP) _ Australia's Steven Conran, unbothered by
rain, shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday and took a one-stroke
first-round lead in the 100 million yen (dlrs 714,000) Aiful Cup
Golf Tournament.
	   The 32-year-old Conran, seeking his first victory since joining
Japan's pro tour in October 1996, shot seven birdies on the
6,941-yard, par-72 Aomori Country Club course.
	   ``Some people might have been affected by the rain, but I could
play my golf as usual,'' Conran said of the downpour that
interrupted play for more than one hour.
	   Hiroshi Tominaga of Japan, winless in 11 years as a pro, shot a
66 with seven birdies and one bogey.
	   Tied for third at 68 were Zaw Moe of Myanmar and three Japanese
_ Hidemichi Tanaka, Tsukasa Watanabe and Kosaku Hirano.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, winner of last week's Yonex Open
Hiroshima, shot a 71 and stood 29th.
	   The winner will receive 18 million yen (dlrs 129,000). A field
of 156 players, including 17 non-Japanese, teed off Thursday.

Internet brand-name `pirates' lose British legal fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A court told two entrepreneurs Thursday that they
cannot register famous brand names as Internet domains and then try
to sell them to companies that own the brands.
	   Six British companies _ retailer Marks and Spencer PLC; Richard
Branson's Virgin empire; the bookmaker Ladbroke Group PLC;
telephone companies British Telecommunications PLC and Cellnet; and
grocer Sainsbury PLC _ scored a victory in the case before the
Court of Appeals.
	   Lawyers for Virgin called the entrepreneurs ``domain name
pirates,'' and the appeals court characterized the names they
registered as ``instruments of fraud.''
	   The businessmen, Richard Conway and Julian Nicholson, registered
domain names for 150 pounds (dlrs 250) each, but then tried to
charge companies much more for their use.
	   For example, after registering one Internet domain _
``burgerking.co.uk'' _ they tried to sell it to the Burger King
hamburger chain for 25,000 pounds (dlrs 40,000).
	   Other names Conway and Nicholson registered included
``marksandspencer.com,'' ``spice-girls.net'' and
``buckinghampalace.org.''
	   Conway and Nicholson denied any wrongdoing, comparing their
actions to someone who buys up several pieces of adjacent real
estate with hopes of selling it all at a profit to a property
developer.
	   They operated their business under three names, One In A Million
Ltd., Global Media Communications and Junic.
	   A High Court judge ruled against Conway and Nicholson in
November, and Thursday's final decision by the appeals court ``will
act as a powerful deterrent to those engaging in this activity in
the United Kingdom,'' said Richard Penfold, a lawyer for Virgin.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A man who was shouting and pointing a knife at
himself was arrested Thursday just outside the headquarters of
Japan's governing party as it was preparing to choose a new prime
minister, police said.
	   No one was injured, and the nature of his protests against the
Liberal Democratic Party was not immediately clear, police added.
His shouting was incomprehensible, they said.
	   Police said he had fliers condemning the party, but did not
immediately provide their contents.
	   The man identified himself as Ryuji Tanaka, a 36-year-old member
of an ultrarightist group, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department
said.
	   The man apparently slipped into the party headquarters' parking
lot and began shouting while pointing a kitchen knife at his
stomach in a harakiri-like motion, police said.
	   Earlier Thursday, the three candidates seeking to replace
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made their final appeals
in nationally televised speeches.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation last week to take
responsibility for his party's humiliating defeat in July 12
elections for Parliament's upper house.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party convenes Friday to choose a new
party president, who is virtually certain of becoming the next
prime minister in a later parliamentary vote. The LDP has a
comfortable majority in the powerful lower house.

Japan to give emergency aid to Papua New Guinea

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government has decided to provide dlrs
300,000 in aid and 40 million yen (dlrs 282,000) worth of emergency
goods to help survivors of the deadly tsunami in Papua New Guinea,
officials said Thursday.
	   Among the emergency goods are tents, tarps, carpentry tools and
medicine, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   Earlier, the government sent a Japanese medical team, which
arrived at the disaster site in the country's West Sepik province
on Wednesday carrying medicine and medical equipment worth a
combined 35 million yen (dlrs 247,000).
	   More than 1,200 people are officially confirmed dead after a
tsunami smashed villages on the north coast last Friday, and
another 6,000 villagers are missing and feared dead.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The NATO-led peacekeeping
force in Bosnia has arrested two Bosnian Serb brothers charged with
torturing and killing Muslim inmates at a prison camp, NATO said
Thursday.
	   With the arrests, the number of Bosnian war crimes suspects who
have been taken into custody _ 30 _ now exceeds the number still at
large _ 29, said Christian Chartier, spokesman for the
international tribunal prosecuting crimes committed during the
bloody break-up of Yugoslavia.
	   ``This is one more corner which has been turned by this
tribunal,'' Chartier said.
	   Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad offered no resistance when
troops surrounded their house Wednesday evening in the
Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo.
	   They were immediately flown to The Hague, Netherlands, site of
an international war crimes tribunal, the NATO statement said.
	   In their July 1995 indictment, tribunal prosecutors alleged the
twins were among guards who tortured and beat to death Muslim
inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp in summer 1992.
	   They are charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Convention,
torture or inhumane treatment, unlawful confinement and other
crimes.
	   Their arraignment, at which they will be asked to enter pleas,
likely will take place Monday afternoon, Chartier said.
	   Predrag Banovic is charged with 32 counts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity. His brother Nenad is faces 10 counts.
	   On one evening in July 1992, Predrag Banovic beat to death with
a baseball bat a prisoner identified as Fikret Avdic, prosecutors
allege. He is also charged with other beating deaths and stealing
possessions of prisoners at Keraterm.
	   According to the tribunal's indictment covering the Keraterm
camp, inmates were regularly beaten by guards and other Serbs who
visited the camp.
	   ``Killings, beatings, sexual assaults and other cruel and
humiliating actions were committed on every shift and were often
inflicted in full view of the other detainees,'' the indictment
alleges.
	   ``The corpses of detainees were piled next to a garbage area.''
	   The father of the two arrested, Sreten Banovic, recently told a
local Bosnian Serb newspaper he had hoped his sons would slowly be
forgotten.
	   The newspaper Reporter described him as a man who had aged
considerably more than his years. He talked of the crimes his sons
allegedly had committed with a stone face.
	   ``The poorest always pay the most. I want to go and ask (Bosnian
Serb leader Momcilo) Krajisnik if we are all doomed because of the
leaders and whether only those without any money will have to pay
in the end.''
	   Sreten Banovic told Reporter he wished he could go to The Hague
in his sons' place. ``They were only soldiers, and everyone knows
soldiers have to follow orders,'' he said.

Killer elephant runs berserk in Colombo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A killer elephant ran berserk on a
main road in Sri Lanka's capital on Thursday, chasing office
workers and bringing rush-hour traffic to a standstill.
	   No one was injured. Thousands looked on from a safe distance as
a Buddhist monk and the elephant's trainer, or mahout, tried to
lure it into a nearby park with candy and bread.
	   It was not clear how the elephant, called Rajah, broke loose
from the Gangaramaya Buddhist temple in downtown Colombo. Rajah had
killed seven people in the past.
	   Heavily armed policemen training for the south Asian summit next
week watched helplessly as the trumpeting elephant tore tree
branches and stomped wildly. At late evening, the elephant remained
at large.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Efforts by Thailand and the
Philippines to broaden the ability of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to become involved in the problems of individual
members were set back Thursday as several countries expressed
disapproval.
	   Since its founding 31 years ago, ASEAN has observed a policy of
non-intervention in the internal affairs of its member countries,
making it difficult for it to deal with issues such as human rights
or economic policies such as currency devaluations.
	   Thailand and the Philippines are proposing that ASEAN shift
instead to a policy of ``flexible engagement,'' which is to be
discussed during the annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers
starting Friday in Manila.
	   But foreign ministers from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia
rejected the proposed shift in comments Thursday.
	   ``I prefer the policy of non-intervention,'' Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi told reporters after arriving Thursday.
	   ``The success of ASEAN cooperation is that we have been
comfortable. Any feeling that you will be criticized, any finger
pointing, will make you uncomfortable.''
	   Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar also declared his
opposition to any change, and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said ASEAN should not tinker with a fundamental principle.
	   ``If the proposal is to replace the policy of non-interference,
then Indonesia won't accept it,'' he said.
	   He said it would be appropriate for ASEAN to privately discuss
``trans-national'' issues such as haze caused by Indonesian forest
fires, but not political policies or human rights.
	   The proposed shift comes as Southeast Asian countries are
becoming more aware that problems in one nation _ such as currency
devaluations, political unrest or environmental degradation _ often
affect its neighbors.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said ASEAN's nine member
countries should sit down and discuss the proposed change as a
family, adding that differences in opinions don't need to lead to a
squabble.
	   ``I think it's appropriate to say that it's a family adjustment
by some family members, for changing times, a changing situation,
changing realities,'' Pitsuwan said. ``We'll see what we can make
out of it.''
	   A shift was also supported Thursday by a meeting of human rights
groups in Manila, including Amnesty International.
	   Formed in Bangkok in 1967, ASEAN became the world's most rapidly
growing region until speculative currency attacks ravaged Thailand
a year ago and spread into a regionwide financial crisis.
	   ASEAN's willingness to consider such a critical change in its
basic policy demonstrates it is now maturing, Philippine Secretary
of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon said.
	   ``Times have changed. After 31 years, we are now adults and we
should be able to discuss our problems frankly,'' he said. ``The
realization that we are all together in the same boat is becoming
clear.''
	   Siazon said he does not expect an immediate consensus from
ASEAN, which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN began to stretch its non-intervention policy last year
when it postponed Cambodia's bid for membership because of a coup
led by co-premier Hun Sen. Since then ASEAN has urged the Cambodian
government to normalize politics by holding elections, which are
scheduled for Sunday _ during the ASEAN meetings.
	   The foreign ministers also plan to discuss the currency crisis
and recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. Next week, they
will meet with 10 ``dialogue partners,'' including the United
States, China, Japan and the European Union, to discuss security
issues.

Yeltsin appoints former Politburo member to Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with long-time Communist appointed to Cabinet, ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin appointed a former
Politburo member and long-time Communist Party member to his
Cabinet on Thursday in an apparent move to improve his testy
relations with the hard-line parliament.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, 60, a former deputy chairman of the Soviet
planning agency Gosplan, was named Minister for Industry and Trade.
	   A gesture of this sort has been expected from the president for
weeks, because parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has
blocked many of Yeltsin's moves to reform the economy and improve
the state's finances.
	   The Duma's reluctance to approve higher taxes and budget cuts
has dismayed international lenders. The International Monetary Fund
approved its part of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout for Russia this
week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800 million to
protest the Duma's rejection of the austerity measures.
	   Lawmakers have complained that IMF-influenced economic policies
are destroying the economy and have frequently demanded what they
call a ``government of national reconciliation'' in which
Communists and other Yeltsin opponents would serve in the Cabinet.
	   Russia's economy has been in a steep decline for months, and the
Finance Ministry predicted Wednesday that GDP will shrink by 0.5
percent by the end of the year.
	   The ministry had originally estimated 2 percent growth for 1998,
following a 0.8 percent increase last year _ Russia's first growth
since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Maslyukov, deputy chairman of Gosplan under Mikhail Gorbachev,
is a member of the Duma where he serves as head of the committee on
economic policy.
	   Maslyukov's new post is likely to carry relatively minor
responsibilities. The ministry was created in April, when Yeltsin
abolished the Ministry of Foreign Trade in a cabinet shakeup.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank said its hard-currency
reserves edged down to dlrs 13.6 billion this week from dlrs 13.7
billion on July 10.
	   Central Bank reserves have been slipping during the country's
financial crisis in recent months. The bank has spent large sums to
defend the Russian ruble, which has remained relatively steady at
around 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The pressure on the ruble has eased since Russia reached
agreement on the international bailout which, with previously
approved loans, will total dlrs 22.6 billion over the next two
years.

2,000 Philippine bar hostesses protest forced AIDS testing plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAVAO, Philippines (AP) _ At least 2,000 bar hostesses warned
Thursday they will take to the streets to protest a plan by a
southern Philippine mayor to require them to undergo AIDS testing.
	   On Monday, Davao Mayor Benjamin de Guzman said he is considering
the inclusion of AIDS testing among the health tests required
before bar hostesses are given licenses to work.
	   The proposal followed the discovery in Davao two weeks ago of a
prostitute who tested positive for the HIV virus, which causes
AIDS.
	   Before that, seven people, all prostitutes, tested positive for
the virus in Davao. Of these, four are known to have developed AIDS
and three have died. Two of the others have gone into hiding.
	   Lawig Bubai, an association of at least 2,000 bar hostesses,
said forcing people to undergo AIDS tests is a human rights
violation.
	   Michelle Valera, a spokeswoman for the group, said the plan also
would violate an AIDS prevention act that became law earlier this
year.
	   Nationwide, 1,086 people have tested positive for the HIV virus,
including 340 who are known to have full-blown AIDS.
	   The health office estimates, however, that about 33,000 people
in the country are afflicted with the disease without knowing it.
	   ``We advise sex workers to include AIDS testing in the
examination they undergo but they are not forced to do it if they
don't want to,'' said a Department of Health doctor.

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president narrowly survived a
car bomb attack that badly damaged his motorcade and killed his top
bodyguard Thursday in the capital of the rebel republic.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov was traveling through the streets of
Grozny when the bomb exploded, damaging his Nissan Patrol
four-wheel-drive vehicle, destroying other cars and leaving a large
hole in the road.
	   Maskhadov suffered only a minor knee wound, but one bodyguard
was killed and six were wounded, the president told a news
conference shortly after the attack.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who spoke
energetically and appeared well. ``To my great regret, my best
bodyguard was killed.''
	   The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments, and at least
two cars in the president's motorcade were completely burned. The
blast also shattered windows in nearby buildings.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   The bombing escalated an already tense situation in Chechnya,
where Maskhadov's moderate government has been unable to restore
law and order despite the end of the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maskhadov
blamed unspecified ``special services'' and their allies inside
Chechnya.
	   ``Explosions and incidents are inevitable in a country that has
gone through such a grave war,'' he said. ``The most important
thing is that I have not allowed the situation to develop the way
it did in Tajikistan, Afghanistan or Algeria,'' all countries torn
by civil conflict.
	   In the past, Chechnya has accused Russia of plotting attacks
against the republic's leaders. Other potential suspects include
Islamic militants, who have been feuding with Maskhadov's
government in recent weeks.
	   Maskhadov has cracked down on armed Islamic fundamentalists who
want to build a state based on a strict interpretation of Islamic
law.
	   Russia's former security chief Alexander Lebed, who had
negotiated the end of the Chechen war in 1996, blamed radical sects
for the attack on Maskhadov.
	   ``A great deal of outside money has been invested in various
religious organizations and extremist groups in Chechnya,'' Lebed
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ``Maskhadov has
been taking radical steps: disbanding some armed formations and
strengthening the fight against crime and extremism.''
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis. The Wahhabis
include native Chechens as well as guerrilla fighters who came from
other Islamic countries to fight in Chechnya's war against Russia.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of Wahhabis.
	   Russian presidential envoy to the republic, Ivan Rybkin, also
blamed the power struggle between various forces in Chechnya for
the attack. He said that Maskhadov's death would be a ``disaster''
for the republic, Interfax reported.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild its shattered economy.
	   The attack was a ``logical continuation of the struggle for
power among Chechnya's military elite,'' prominent lawmaker
Vladimir Lysenko said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``A large number of field commanders refuse to go along with the
attempt to eliminate their power, their influence, and, in effect,
eliminate the lawlessness that has been gripping Chechnya over the
past two years,'' Lysenko said.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.

Election media access for Cambodian opposition unequal: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The opposition in Cambodia's
parliamentary elections has been given almost no air time on
government-controlled television and radio, a United Nations report
said Thursday.
	   Between June 1 and July 15, strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party appeared on main news programs 1,364 times compared
to 45 times for Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC and 28 times
for prominent dissident Sam Rainsy's party, said the report.
	   Faring just a little worse at 20 times was Ieng Sary, the former
Khmer Rouge foreign minister who was pardoned in 1996 for his
crimes in exchange for leading thousands of guerrillas to make
peace. He is now a tacit ally of Hun Sen. The Khmer Rouge killed as
many as 2 million Cambodians when it ruled between 1975 and 1979.
	   The opposition has claimed that Hun Sen has stacked the
elections Sunday in his favor by restricting media access, packing
the electoral authorities with his supporters, and using violence
and intimidation against opposition supporters.
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister last year in a
bloody takeover. He has called the elections in an effort to win
back international legitimacy and aid.

Gore tours Chernobyl, urges Ukraine to shut remaining reactor

<TEXT>
	   CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al
Gore got a first-hand look Thursday at the site of the world's
worst nuclear accident, circling by helicopter over the sarcophagus
of concrete and steel that seals Chernobyl's ruined reactor.
	   He gazed at the top of the hastily constructed structure through
the open door of the military chopper, then landed and walked up to
it for a close-up inspection.
	   Gore spoke to some Chernobyl officials and then toured the
nearby ghost town of Pripyat, walking through a central square with
weeds and moss growing through the concrete pavement, past
abandoned buildings with gaping black holes instead of windows.
	   Gore then walked over to what once was a children's playground
and spoke quietly to a former Chernobyl reactor operator who used
to live there. He was evacuated following the accident because of
high radiation levels and now works in the United States.
	   The vice president _ the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit
the site _ displayed little emotion and made no remarks during his
90-minute blitz tour.
	   But later in the day, speaking at the Chernobyl museum in Kiev,
he expressed shock.
	   ``I saw an amusement park that looked like a haunted playground,
with a large Ferris wheel rusted over. A merry-go-round turned
slowly in the wind... four-lane streets leading to nowhere. And I
wondered - what has become of all the people who lived here? What
has become of the children?'' Gore said.
	   The nuclear plant, he said ``looms like a menacing monument to
mistakes of the century now slipping away from us, a hulking symbol
of human decisions unworthy of our children.''
	   Gore, who has made environmental issues one of his political
priorities, has been discussing the fate of the reactor and its
deteriorating sarcophagus on a two-day visit to Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian officials say they need Western help to shore up the
weakening concrete seal over reactor No. 4, which was destroyed in
the 1986 explosion and fire. They also want aid to shut down the
last reactor that remains in operation at Chernobyl.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has promised to close that
reactor by 2000, but top Ukrainian officials say the government
first wants dlrs 1.2 billion compensation for lost energy.
	   ``It's imperative for the safety of the Ukrainian people, for
the safety of Europe, for the well-being of the world, for the
remaining reactor ... to be shut down as soon as it is feasible to
do so,'' Gore insisted Wednesday.
	   Kuchma said Thursday that he and Gore have decided to call a
conference of private donors to raise funds to rebuild the
deteriorating Chernobyl shelter.
	   That project is expected to cost dlrs 750 million, and Kuchma
said Kiev has so far secured only dlrs 390 million.
	   Gore and Kuchma also agreed to set up a joint laboratory to
study the effects of radiation at Chernobyl.
	   The two leaders have also tackled Ukraine's deep economic
troubles. The United States has expressed displeasure with the pace
of economic reforms in Ukraine, and had threatened to withhold part
of its dlrs 225 million in aid for 1998. Ukraine is the
third-largest recipient of U.S. aid.
	   Kuchma called for more assistance, saying, ``Ukraine's financial
crisis is no less complex and threatening than in Russia,'' which
has just received billions of dollars in international loans.
	   Ukraine is negotiating a dlrs 2.5 million loan from the
International Monetary Fund, and Gore warned that the outcome of
those talks is up to Ukraine.
	   ``Bold reform is ... critical for Ukraine's ability to reach a
successful conclusion in its negotiations with the IMF,'' Gore
stressed. ``In the absence of those terms, it would be very
difficult for an agreement to be reached.''

Turkish employees of U.S. military facilities on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Some 1,400 employees working for U.S.
military facilities in Turkey went on strike Thursday demanding
higher salaries.
	   Many facilities in bases in Ankara, Izmir as well as Incirlik,
near the southern city of Adana, were at a standstill Thursday
morning.
	   In Incirlik -- base to 45 British and U.S. planes that patrol
the no-fly zone in Iraq -- the dining hall, laundry services and
military taxis were disrupted, U.S. Air Force Capt. Max Torrens,
spokeswoman to the base, said.
	   Strikers picketed buildings in Incirlik, some 490 kilometers
(300 miles) south of Ankara.
	   Harb-Is, the Union of Defense Industry and Allied Workers that
organized the strike, said collective bargaining talks had failed
and accused the U.S Air Force of trying to do away with a series of
social benefits, such as education grants for the employee's
children.
	   ``The strike will continue until our demands are met,'' said
Ibrahim Yalcin, deputy head of Harb-Is.
	   Torrens said that employees whose posts could not be left
vacant, such as firefighters and medical personnel, had not taken
part in the strike.

region for another day, a news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin has been vacationing since the weekend at the government
lakeside resort of Shuiskaya Chupa, near the border with Finland.
But he's been stuck indoors the entire time, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Rains canceled a presidential appearance at the opening
ceremonies of a sailing race on Lake Onega on Thursday.
	   Instead, the president is ``working on the mail'' said aide Yuri
Yarov, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Cloudy and windy weather is expected to continue in the region,
but Yeltsin still hopes to go fishing, ITAR-Tass and the Interfax
news agency said.
	   Yeltsin has not said how long he plans to stay in Karelia,
though aides have said he will not return to work at the Kremlin
before the end of August.

Taiwan hopes high-speed rail project can bolster economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The government and a local consortium on
Thursday signed a 430 billion Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.6
billion) contract to build Taiwan's first high-speed railroad.
	   The Taiwan HSR Consortium, backed by French and German
technology, was selected to build the 330-kilometer (205-mile) line
from Taipei in the north to Kaohsiung in the south on land provided
by the government. The consortium will have the right to operate
the railroad for 35 years.
	   Premier Vincent Siew said at the signing that the project could
boost the economy and industries that have been hurt by Asia's
economic turmoil, and create 97,000 jobs a year.
	   Officials said construction will begin early next year, with
service starting in 2003.
	   The signing, originally scheduled for July 1, was delayed twice
by disputes over the government's ability to complete 20 smaller
infrastructure projects related to the rail line and a government
deposit demanded by Taiwan HSR.
	   The government agreed to speed up its work and let a third party
arbitrate any future disputes.
	   A rival bidder, Chunghwa HSR Consortium, has questioned Taiwan
HSR's ability to raise the promised capital and gain bank
financing.
	   The falling value of the Taiwan dollar, dragged down by the
regional financial turmoil, had added uncertainties to the project
because it would increase the costs of the engines, trains and
technology to be provided by German Siemens AG and French GEC
Alsthom.
	   Ying Chi, chairman of Taiwan HSR, said a final decision on the
train system will be made within 12 months.
	   Priority will be given to the European train system, but the
consortium does not rule out the use of the Japanese Shinkansen
bullet train, she said.
	   Officials said both European banks and Japanese banks have
expressed a desire to provide part of the financing to help
companies from their countries to win the contract.

NATO troops mistakenly arrest two men as war criminals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tribunal spokesmen saying two arrested men are

 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers have
mistakenly arrested two Bosnian Serbs they believed were two war
crimes suspects, the spokesman for a war crimes tribunal in The
Hague said Thursday.
	   The two men were believed to have been Predrag Banovic and his
brother Nenad. Prosecutors alleged in a July 1995 indictment that
the twins were among guards who tortured and beat to death Muslims
inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the summer of
1992.
	   It was located near the Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175
kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, where the two men
were arrested late Wednesday by members of the NATO-led peace
force.
	   The two men were immediately flown to The Hague, Netherlands,
site of the tribunal, the NATO statement said.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said the two men thought
to be Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad were not in fact the
brothers.
	   ``The office of the prosecutor has been able to assert now that
the two persons who joined us this morning are not the Banovic
brothers.
	   ``These are two brothers, they are even twins but they have
another family name and ... other Christian names,'' he said.
	   Chartier said prosecutors had been helped by Sarajevo
authorities in identifying the brothers.
	   He did not release the identities of the brothers who were
mistakenly arrested.
	   Tribunal officials were negotiating with the NATO-led peace
force in Bosnia to have the brothers returned to Sarajevo as soon
as possible.
	   The Banovic twins are charged with grave breaches of the Geneva
Convention, torture or inhumane treatment and unlawful confinement
and other crimes.

World champion leaves Williams to join BAR
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: adds background, speculation about other moves &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Formula One auto racing champion Jacques
Villeneuve confirmed Thursday that's he's leaving Williams to team
up with the new British American Racing team.
	   The 27-year-old Canadian, who has struggled this season behind
the McLarens and Ferraris, is a close friend of BAR's managing
director, Craig Pollock, and will join the former Tyrrell outfit as
soon as his contract with Williams ends at the end of this season.
	   The widely-expected transfer has prompted speculation of other
big moves as the major teams prepare for next season.
	   IndyCar series leader Alex Zanardi has been linked with a
possible move back into Formula One. Some reports have suggested he
will team up with Villeneuve, a former IndyCar champion, or would
replace him at Williams.
	   It also has been suggested that Williams' other driver,
Germany's Heinz-Harald Frentzen, might be moving on. Damon Hill,
who won the F-1 world title driving for Williams in 1996, moved on
to Arrows and then Jordan but has threatened to quit if he doesn't
find a competitive car.
	   Although Villeneuve won the world title driving for Williams,
he, like Hill, has been frustrated this season that the latest
model can't compete with the cars being driven by Mika Hakkinen and
David Coulthard (both McLaren) and Michael Schumacher (Ferrari).
	   ``I have told every journalist who covers Formula One racing in
recent weeks that I would go with a team that would allow me to
compete at the front of the grid,'' said Villeneuve whose best
results this season were fourth place finishes at San Marino and
the French GP.
	   Pollock, who is building a new complex at Brackley, near
Silverstone in central England and hopes to open it in October,
wants his team to be up there with McLaren and Ferrari next season.
	   ``Jacques' presence in our team will go a long way towards our
goal of being competitive in the shortest time possible,'' he said.
	   Williams managing director Frank Williams confirmed Villeneuve
would not be driving for his team next season.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, he said Williams Grand Prix
Engineering would not be announcing its driver line-up until early
September.
	   ``We would like to take this opportunity of thanking Jacques for
his contribution to both the 1996 and 1997 FIA Formula One world
constructors' championships and to congratulate him on his own 1997
FIA Formula One world drivers' title,'' the Didcot-based team said
in a statement.
	   ``It has been, and will continue to be until the end of this
year, a great pleasure to work with Jacques. We all wish Jacques
every success in his new appointment.''

 &UR; Frightened Serbs tell of capture by Albanian guerrillas during
Orahovac fighting &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PRI101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dazed and exhausted, a group of
elderly Serb villagers huddled inside the local Red Cross office
Thursday and recounted their terrifying days in the hands of
Albanian rebels.
	   ``Armed Albanians came into the village, killed one villager and
loaded seven of us women and eight men aboard a truck,'' muttered
Darinka Misic, 70, speaking an archaic form of Serbian rarely heard
outside remote villages.
	   ``One man raised his head for a while and got a blow from a
rifle butt,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Misic, from a village near Orahovac, was among 35 Serbs _
most of them elderly _ who were handed over to the International
Red Cross on Wednesday by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Most had been captured six days earlier at the start of the
rebels' biggest attack in weeks. The battle around Orahovac ended
before dawn Wednesday when the KLA retreated.
	   International aid organizations rushed to the area to locate and
care for survivors.
	   The freed captives were brought Wednesday to the local Red Cross
office in Pristina, capital of Kosovo province about 50 kilometers
(30 miles) northeast of Orahovac.
	   According to Mrs. Misic, the captives were driven to another
village, Suva Reka, where the women were given bread and water by
their captors.
	   ``The men were taken away and beaten,'' she said. ``We heard
them scream.''
	   A few days later, the captives were transported to a third
village -- Zociste -- site of the 14th century Serbian Orthodox
Church monastery of St. Kozma and St. Damjan.
	   On Tuesday, she said, the KLA raided the monastery, but the
seven monks and one nun who had taken refuge there raised a white
banner and surrendered.
	   The monks and nun were loaded onto the truck along with the
others and driven to yet another village, where they were handed
over to the Red Cross. The local Red Cross office says another 21
are listed as KLA captives.
	   A separate group of 43 Serb captives _ trapped by the fighting
in Orahovac _ were rescued Wednesday to the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees. Half were brought Wednesday to a Pristina hotel and
the rest were expected to be transported here by U.N. officials
later in the day.
	   Those Serbs had fled their homes in the former Yugoslav republic
of Croatia three years ago after the Croat army recaptured part of
the country seized by rebel Serbs at the outbreak of civil war
there in 1991.
	   After arriving in Kosovo in 1995, the Croatian Serbs had been
living in shacks on the edge of Orahovac's vineyards. Driven once
from their homes by war, they found themselves again homeless in
yet another Balkan ethnic conflict.
	   ``I suppose many died, you can't have that much shooting going
on without many killed,'' said one of the Croatian Serbs,
Aleksandar Graovac. ``For us, there is no life here. And my house
in Croatia was burned to the ground.''

Rios advances into quarterfinals of Mercedes Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios proved too steady
for Hendrik Dreekmann Thursday as he swept into the quarterfinals
of the Mercedes Cup in straight sets.
	   Rios, who beat the German, 6-3, 6-4, would vault past Pete
Sampras onto the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings if he reaches the
final of the dlrs 1.04 million event.
	   Rios, who briefly wrestled the top spot away from the American
this spring, next faces the winner between Spain's Felix Mantilla
and Boris Becker.
	   With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104 F) courtside,
Rios jumped on Dreekmann's mistakes to break the German early in
both sets.
	   Upsets have already claimed a number of seeds at the tournament
including defending champion Alex Corretja of Spain and former
French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
	   Becker beat Rios two weeks ago in the semifinals of the Swiss
Open, kindling his hopes of finally claiming a clay court title
before his career winds down.
	   But he was beaten by Corretja in the final _ the six time he has
come up short in a final on clay.
	   Becker, a former world No. 1, has 49 career titles. He was a
semifinalist twice at the French Open.

 &UR; Gore to urge Russian lawmakers to ratify Start II &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore said Thursday
he will urge the reluctant Russian parliament to ratify the START
II nuclear arms reduction treaty.
	   ``I'm going to Moscow tonight, in part to urge them to do so,''
Gore said in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, at the end of a two-day
visit.
	   Gore is scheduled to meet Friday with Russian officials,
including Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   President Clinton has asked Gore to use the Moscow trip to
prepare the agenda for his summit with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, scheduled for September.
	   The U.S. administration had earlier said it would prefer to hold
the summit after the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament, ratified START II.
	   But Clinton's announcement of the summit earlier this month
appeared to mean that he was willing to go without START II
ratification.
	   The Duma had been scheduled to debate START II ratification this
month, but announced in June that it was delaying action until the
fall.
	   Many lawmakers in the Communist-dominated Duma oppose START II
on the grounds that it puts Russia at a strategic disadvantage and
would be costly to implement fully. The hard-liners also argue that
Russia cannot reduce its nuclear arsenal when NATO is expanding
eastward.

Russia tailoring its foreign policy toward cooperation with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian foreign policy for the next century is
being tailored on the expectation that China will be one of
Moscow's major partners, Russia's foreign minister said Thursday.
	   Yevgeny Primakov said the partnership between Russia and China
was easing what he called the ``painful transition'' toward a
multipolar world since the end of the Cold War.
	   ``Our strategic partnership will help to build a more stable
world, a more peaceful world,'' Primakov, speaking through a
translator, said at a news conference after meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
	   Primakov, who arrived Wednesday, said his five-day visit was
mainly aimed at laying the groundwork for a summit between Jiang
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Russia in September.
	   Among the ``very wide'' range of issues the two leaders could
discuss were regional matters, economics and politics, as well as
strategic and defense questions, Primakov said.
	   The informal nature of the summit, their fifth in less than
three years, will allow the two presidents ``to discuss very
sensitive and highly complicated issues,'' he added.
	   Beijing and Moscow see their relations as a counterbalance to
Washington's dominant global influence since the Cold War ended.
	   Primakov said the ``strategic partnership'' between Russia and
China was aimed at the 21st Century.
	   ``China will be one of our major partners and we are
constructing our foreign policy on this notion, that we'll be
closely cooperating with China,'' Primakov said.
	   But he also said relations with China did not contradict
Russia's ties with other nations and ``are not aimed against third
countries.''
	   Although China and Russia have succeeded in burying their Cold
War rivalry, problems remain. Most nagging is slipping commerce.
Trade fell 10 percent last year to dlrs 6.1 billion and the two
want to raise the total to dlrs 20 billion by 2000.
	   On Wednesday, Primakov and his Chinese counterpart, Tang
Jiaxuan, discussed the ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo
region and the stalled Middle East peace process. They also talked
about possible international strategies for stopping the nuclear
arms race between India and Pakistan and preventing its effects

	   Tang and Primakov noted that their governments share consensus
on most major issues and that, in Tang's words, they have a ``good
cooperative, strategic partnership.''

Greece slams US over description of Cyprus as `conflict'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Thursday slammed the United
States for describing the Turkish occupation of Cyprus as part of a
``conflict,'' claiming the phrase was weaker than U.N. resolutions
denouncing the military action.
	   Greek cooperation is important in U.S.-led efforts to end the
24-year division between Greek- and Turkish-speaking communities on
the eastern Mediterranean island.
	   ``The Cyprus problem is one of the invasion and occupation of a
large part of the island by the Turkish army,'' government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in response to comments by White
House spokesman Mike McCurry.
	   ``This is accepted by the international community and this is
the basis on which the United Nations has taken decisions and has
set the political framework for finding a solution to the
problem,'' he added.
	   But almost 100 UN resolutions against Turkey do not use the word
``invasion'' but refer to ``unilateral military action undertaken
against the Republic of Cyprus.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, McCurry said the 1974 incident was
``a conflict, and I think it's been well characterized.''
	   ``These statements are unacceptable,'' Reppas retorted.

Delegates agree on agenda for second round of peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Delegates to the second round of
all-party peace talks aimed at ending ethnic conflict in Burundi
finally adopted an agenda Thursday, a spokesman said.
	   Hashim Mbita, aide to former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere
who is mediating the talks, said the agenda included rules of
procedure, a general debate on the root causes of the conflict and
the setting up of five committees to deal with specific areas like
peace and security and democracy and good governance.
	   ``We're hoping that things will move as planned tomorrow,''
Mbita said, referring to a plenary session that should have opened
Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile in Burundi, 20 people were reported killed Wednesday
in fighting between the army and Hutu rebels outside Bujumbura, and
another 3,000 were ordered into government-protected areas.
	   A cease-fire was supposed to have begun Monday to coincide with
the second round of peace talks.
	   The delay in coming up with an agenda was due to the failure of
all 19 parties to the talks to agree on basics like whether the
government of President Pierre Buyoya was a legtimate.
	   Former Burundi President Jean-Baptiste Bazaga, who was
overthrown by Buyoya in 1987 and whose hard-line Tutsi Parena party
opposes any accommodation with majority Hutus, said it was not.
	   Parena is one of 19 participants in the talks which are expected
to last several several weeks.
	   The political arms of two Hutu rebel groups _ the Council for
the Defense of Democracy (CNDD) and the Palipehutu _ are also
represented at the talks.
	   Some Brussels-based members of the CNDD have protested the
presence in Arusha of former Burundian Interior Minister Leonard
Nyangoma, whom Nyerere recognizes as head of the organization.
	   The Tanzanian has been attempting to mediate between the warring
parties in Burundi since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the
country's first Hutu president in October 1993 and plunged the
country into another round of politically inspired ethnic violence.
	   Buyoya, a retired army major and former president, overthrew a
weak coaltion government in July 1996, claiming he alone could stop
that bloodshed that has resulted in the deaths of at least 200,000
people, most of them civilians, since 1993.
	   Although 65 percent of Burundi's 6 million people are Hutus, the
minority Tutsis who make up 14 percent have controlled the country
for all but four months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   In 1972, several hundred thousand Hutus were slaughtered after a
Hutu uprising sought to overthrow the Tutsi leadership.

Russia will sell aircraft carrier to India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will sell India a used aircraft carrier for
about dlrs 2 billion, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   During negotiations in Moscow, the two sides agreed India will
acquire the Admiral Gorshkov, which was built in 1982 for Russia's
northern fleet, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The sale is part of new agreements between Russia and India to
shift their military relationship from outright purchases to joint
development of military hardware.
	   The Soviet Union was India's closest ally during the Cold War,
supplying most of its military equipment.

European ministers clinch landmark deal on marine pollution policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) _ European environment ministers Thursday
reached what they called a landmark deal on reducing marine
pollution in the northeast Atlantic, including new rules on
dismantling disused oil rigs and curbing radioactive discharges.
	   The ministers from 12 European Union nations and Norway and
Iceland agreed that most decommissioned oil rigs must be dismantled
on shore.
	   At the insistence of Britain and Norway, in whose waters most of
the 720 rigs are located, the ministers shied away from a total ban
on sinking rigs at sea.
	   The dismantling of 40 of the largest offshore installations _
those weighing more than 10,000 tons _ will depend on the
conclusions of case-by-case technical feasibility studies, the
ministers said after a two-day meeting here.
	   The rigs' stumps, or footings, may be allowed to stay on the sea
bed because of the engineering difficulties involved in removing
them.
	   Addressing another key issue at the conference, the ministers
also agreed to reduce discharges of radioactive waste to ``close to
zero'' by 2020. No specific target was set.
	   Nuclear companies had warned that adopting the so-called ``zero
option'' for radioactive discharges would put them out of business.
	   Officials declined to estimate the cost of the measures which
could run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   The meeting in this town on Lisbon's outskirts was the first of
the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the
Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR) at ministerial level.
	   The decisions are legally binding on OSPAR members whose waters
stretch from the Arctic circle in the north to Portugal on Europe's
southwestern tip.
	   ``I doubted we'd clinch a deal. It was very difficult,''
Portuguese Environment Minister Elisa Ferreira said. All-night
negotiations lasted until 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) Thursday.
	   British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott emphasized that jobs
and investment would be generated by dismantling disused rigs.
	   ``This deal is a very good example of how gain comes out of an
environmental objective,'' he told reporters.
	   Britain and France were at the center of the negotiations on
levels of radioactive waste.
	   More than 90 percent of all radioactive waste discharges into
the sea covered by OSPAR come from three nuclear reprocessing
plants which are located at Sellafield and Dounreay in Britain and
at La Hague in France.
	   French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet said the agreement
represented ``a huge step forward'' in environmental affairs.
	   Norwegian Minister Guro Fjellanger said she was still worried by
discharges from Sellafield, which are amassing on the Scandinavian
coastline, but said the deal was ``an important first step.''
	   The accords were also welcomed by Greenpeace, which had observer
status at the meeting.
	   ``Today is a great victory for Greenpeace,'' the organization's
spokesman Remi Paramentier said.
	   OSPAR members agreed to hold their next meeting in five years'
time.

Thai clergy order monk to paint over murals deemed lewd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Buddhist clergy has ordered
a monk, already in trouble over a statue, to paint over murals on
his temple walls that have been deemed lewd and sexually
provocative, a government official said Thursday.
	   The murals depict the Biblical story of Adam and Eve, which is
not part of the Buddhist religion, and the men and women in the
paintings are naked.
	   The order to paint over the murals came from the Sangha Supreme
Council, the highest decision-making body of the Thai Buddhist
clergy, said Chamras Sudanich, deputy director of the government's
Religious Affairs Department.
	   The council also ordered the monk to destroy a phallic sculpture
and an automatic holy water dispenser.
	   Earlier this week, the council ordered the abbot of the temple
in Chachoengsao province, 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Bangkok,
to modify his statue of the Buddha, the religion's founder.
	   The statue portrays the Buddha with his foot on top of a globe
and arms raised as if in victory.
	   Many Buddhists feel the pose is too aggressive, and therefore
against the Buddha's teachings. They believe what the monk has done
is symbolic of how many members of the clergy are distorting and
debasing the Buddha's teachings.
	   They want the statue destroyed, but the abbot at the temple and
many people in his town want it kept because it has become a
tourist attraction.
	   The monk has threatened to put a curse on anyone who dares to
destroy his creation. He claimed the 21-year-old statue is part of
an anti-communist propaganda campaign, according to Chamras.
	   In the mid-1970s, while fears in Thailand rose because Indochina
had fallen under communist rule, some well-known Thai Buddhist
monks told their followers that it was not a sin for a Buddhist to
kill communists.
	   Chamras said provincial authorities throughout the country have
been ordered to survey the Buddhist temples in their provinces to
see if others are housing objects that violate Buddhist teachings.

Portuguese club Benfica sells land, begins paying debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Cash-strapped Lisbon club Benfica has
sold some of its real estate to raise money and pay off some of its
massive debts, according to news reports Thursday.
	   The 30-time champion raised 900 million escudos (dlrs 4.9
million) from the sale of a plot next to its 120,000-capacity
Stadium of Light, sports daily A Bola reported.
	   Benfica vice-president Jose Capristano said the club had paid an
overdue first installment of 150 million escudos (dlrs 824,000) on
a bank loan of 600 million escudos (dlrs 3.2 million), according to
the paper.
	   A Lisbon judge last May froze Benfica's bank accounts because of
nonpayment of the installment.
	   Capristano reportedly told Portuguese journalists in Austria,
where the Benfica squad has a pre-season training camp, that
players would be paid their June and July salaries when they return
to Portugal next week.
	   Capristano also said Benfica would pay English club Manchester
United the outstanding sum, believed to be about dlrs 3 million, on
Czech player Karel Poborsky, signed last season, according to A
Bola.
	   Benfica President Joao Vale e Azevedo last week paid 180 million
escudos (dlrs 990,000) from his private bank account to settle
outstanding social security payments.
	   Benfica faced court action and relegation to the second division
if it did not pay the back taxes by the end of this week.

Police detain TVM officials as cycling drug scandal grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and recasted throughout, with information on TVM,
arrival of Festina riders for questioning, more on Le Parisien
report &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - As French police began questioning cyclists from
the disgraced Festina team Thursday, the doping scandal
overshadowing the Tour de France grew still further when
investigators summoned officials from the TVM team.
	   Police in Pamiers ordered TVM's sporting director, doctor and
chief mechanic to answer questions about their role in the possible
use of illegal doping substances, according to judicial sources.
	   TVM, a Dutch team, came under the spotlight earlier this week
when it emerged that the substance EPO had been found in the car of
one of its officials in March.
	   The International Union of Cycling (UCI), the sport's governing
body, asked the Dutch cycling federation to carry out an inquiry
and tour organizers threatened to expel TVM from the race.
	   Judicial sources said Thursday that police found evidence of
used drugs in a suitcase and trashcan during a search of the team's
hotel in Toulouse and Metz, though the nature of the drugs is still
not known.
	   Meanwhile, six riders from the Festina team thrown out of the
Tour de France for using EPO arrived at a Lyon police station for
questioning.
	   They included Richard Virenque, Pascal Herve, Didier Rous, Alex
Zulle, Armin Meier and Laurent Dufaux.
	   Earlier in the day, three other officials at the Festina team
were detained for questioning the first time, according to judicial
sources.
	   They included the team's two joint sporting directors, Miguel
Moreno and Michel Gros, and logistical director Joel Sabiron.
	   Festina team director Bruno Roussel, doctor Eric Ryckaert and
physiotherapist Willy Voet are already being detained by police
investigating the scandal.
	   The already tarnished image of the Tour was damaged yet further
Thursday when the French newspaper Le Parisien reported that the
Belgian judge investigating the Festina case has proof that the
team's riders took EPO.
	   Belgian judge Eric Van de Sijpe has medical records and computer
files proving that the drug was supplied to team riders, Le
Parisien said.
	   It reported that in March the judge ordered a search of the
Festina team doctor's offices.
	   Investigators unearthed computer data, all coded, which detailed
the use of EPO by specific riders, its absorption by the body and
the development of red cells in the blood stream.
	   The code name ``Willy'' appeared in many of the computer files,
but until the arrest of Voet on July 8, the judge was unable to
trace the person's identity.
	   The Belgian judge told the newspaper that he is ready to send
his findings to French investigators if they ask for it.

Government commission pledges openness in Hong Kong airport
</HEADLINE>
inquiry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of a government commission to
investigate problems at Hong Kong's new airport pledged Thursday
that the commission would not limit public debate or interfere with
other inquiries.
	   ``There is no question of stopping the public, including members
of the media, from discussing matters about the airport. Indeed,
any member of the public and the media ... may very well assist the
inquiry,'' commission chairman Justice Woo Kwok-hing said in a
statement.
	   Woo said Wednesday that his investigation, ordered by Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa, would operate under rules of a judicial
inquiry, meaning unfair public discussion of the case during the
investigation could constitute contempt of court.
	   The announcement raised fears that the commission's
investigation would limit media discussion and interfere with two
other separate investigations by the government ombudsman and the
legislature.
	   ``There was and can be no attempt to stifle any other inquiry
that is ongoing or may be instituted, nor was or can there be any
attempt to gag the media,'' Woo said.
	   Meanwhile, services of a high-speed railway linking the remote
new dlrs 20 billion airport to downtown were disrupted early
Thursday for nearly four hours when mechanical failure stopped one
of the trains.
	   Chek Lap Kok airport replaced the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport on
July 6. It has been hit with a series of problems, the most serious
of which is the cargo terminal's inability to handle all of Hong
Kong's cargo shipments.

Rwanda tribunal registrar rejects charges of mismanagement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS in 6th graf that tribunal will render judgement in
Akayesu case, not convict him; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The top administrator of the Rwanda
genocide tribunal Thursday rejected charges of incompetence and
mismanagement lodged against it by one of its six judges.
	   Registrar Agwu Ukiwe Okali said he was ``infuriated'' by the
decision of Swedish Judge Lennart Aspegren to resign in protest
over what he called bad management and inadequate working
conditions.
	   Last week, Aspegren told journalists from his Swedish home that
the tribunal, founded in November 1994, had made no progress in
improving its management despite the dismissal last year of the
previous administrator.
	   ``All his statements are false,'' Okali, who was named registrar
in February 1997, said in an interview. ``These are all sound
effects with no factual bases. He's impressed by no one but
himself.''
	   Okali said the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will
hand down its first verdict and impose its first sentence next
month in the 1994 Hutu-government-orchestrated genocide in which at
least half a million people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed.
	   The tribunal, which is holding 35 suspects, will sentence former
Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, who has pleaded guilty, and render
judgement in the case of Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former Hutu mayor in
central Rwanda, Okali said.
	   Both were charged with overseeing or ordering the killings
carried out during 90 days from April to July 1994.
	   Tutsi-led rebels ousted the government in July 1994 and ended
the killing.
	   In addition, Okali said, by the end of the year, the tribunal
will conclude the three trials which opened last year, and open a
another against former Rwandan army commander, Lt. Col. Theoneste
Bagasora.
	   Okali said Aspegren never produced any evidence to support his
allegations of mismanagement and incompetence of the tribunal,
based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   He said Aspegren's comments will tarnish the reputation of the
tribunal at a time the institution was struggling to restore its
credibility.
	   Tribunal officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was upset by the latest
allegations. They came a little more than a year after Okali, a
Nigerian, was named to head the troubled administrative wing after
a 1996 U.N. investigation cited incompetence, financial
mismanagement and cronyism throughout the body.
	   Aspegren charged that the suspects in detention are allowed to
visit each other, make international phone calls and produce
brochures which they can distribute to their supporters.
	   Okali responded that he was merely implementing exisiting U.N.
detention rules, and that all calls were monitored expect those
between a client and a lawyer.
	   Okali was meeting Rwandan officials with the chief U.N.
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, who arrived to boost the tribunal's
credibility in the country.
	   Critical of the tribunal's slow pace, the Rwandans have been
conducting their own trials. On April 24, the first 22 genocide
convicts were executed by firing squad in public.
	   The most extreme penalty the Arusha tribunal can impose is life
in prison. It has not yet been determined where defendants
convicted and sentenced to life would serve their sentences.

Malaysian minister calls for support from opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sports minister urged
Malaysia's political opposition Thursday to rally behind the
government to help make the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games a
success.
	   Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin asked Malaysians of all
religious denominations and ethnic groups to contribute to the
games' effort. Sixty percent of Malaysia's 22 million people are
Malay Muslims. The rest are Chinese and Indian minorities.
	   ``Sports is for everyone and there should be no hindrance with
regard to political ideology or religious beliefs and as such
cooperation from everyone was crucial for the success of Kuala
Lumpur '98,'' he told reporters in the northeastern city of Kuala
Terengganu.
	   Muhyiddin said preparations for the games village at Kuala
Lumpur's Bukit Jalil Sports Complex were going smoothly.
	   Work at the 1,400 living units for 6,000 athletes and officials
were in the final stages and they would be fully ready in three
weeks, he said.
	   All athletes would be staying in the games village, he said.
	   ``This is to encourage all athletes to mix around with the
others when they are not at the competition venues because the
Commonwealth Games aim to promote solidarity and friendship.''
	   More than 200 buses have been arranged for the athletes and
officials to commute from the village to the 23 sports venues.
	   Six thousand personnel would be deployed for handling security
and traffic, while 7,000 other volunteers would be on hand to help
in the various arenas during the 10-day games starting Sept. 11.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police said Thursday they were
searching for two more police officers allegedly involved in the
kidnapping of a food vendor last week.
	   Police already had arrested two officers and two civilians in
the kidnapping case. They had demanded a 1 million baht (dlrs
23,800) ransom for the vendor.
	   The victim's husband said police raided his wife's shop looking
for amphetamines, and when they didn't find any, they kidnapped
her.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers have
mistakenly arrested two Bosnian Serbs they believed were two war
crimes suspects, the spokesman for a war crimes tribunal in The
Hague said Thursday.
	   The two men were believed to have been Predrag Banovic and his
brother Nenad. Prosecutors alleged in a July 1995 indictment that
the twins were among guards who tortured and beat to death Muslims
inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the summer of
1992.
	   It was located near the Serb-controlled town of Prijedor, 175
kilometers (110 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, where the two men
were arrested late Wednesday by members of the NATO-led peace
force.
	   The two men were immediately flown to The Hague, Netherlands,
site of the tribunal, the NATO statement said.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said the two men thought
to be Predrag Banovic and his brother Nenad were not in fact the
brothers.
	   ``The office of the prosecutor has been able to assert now that
the two persons who joined us this morning are not the Banovic
brothers.
	   ``These are two brothers, they are even twins but they have
another family name and ... other Christian names,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, Maj. Sheena Thompson, a spokeswoman for the
NATO-led Stabilization Force, said ``SFOR conducted the detention
based on evidence and information ... Regrettably, two innocent
people were detained. SFOr will now transport them to Prijedor.''
	   Meanwhile, Zdravko Banovic, the father of the two real suspects,
and their younger brother Petar told The Associated Press by
telephone the two were not in Prijedor last night.
	   ``They left eight months ago for England, and the last time we
talked to them was two weeks ago, on the phone,'' Zdravko Banovic
said.
 &UR; Chartier said, 8th graf pvs.

As pedophile scandal grows, government trumpets its anti-porn
</HEADLINE>
record &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government Thursday published
figures claiming it is battling hard to keep images of child abuse
off the Internet as international attention focused on a
Dutch-based pedophile ring.
	   ``Fighting child pornography is a priority of the Dutch ministry
of justice,'' said justice minister Winnie Sorgdrager in a
statement.
	   Her comments came as the discovery last week of a child
pornography ring in the Dutch seaside town of Zandvoort drew
widespread media attention.
	   Although the investigation is still in progress and no arrests
have been made, the ring had allegedly sexually abused children as
young as 12 months and distributed child pornography on the
Internet.
	   In her statement, Sorgdrager declined comment on the case,
saying ``it is necessary to wait and see'' what the investigation
will reveal.
	   But she was quick to trumpet her own anti-pornography record.
	   Sorgdrager said the maximum prison sentence for the production
of child pornography had been increased in recent years, and since
then, the number of such cases taken on by the prosecutor's office
also has increased.
	   In the first half of 1997, 28 child pornography cases were
prosecuted, compared with 16 cases in the whole year of 1996, said
Sorgdrager.
	   The ministry will also finalize plans with prosecutor's office
and police to speed up actual investigation of reports of child
pornography on the Internet, said Sorgdrager.
	   As part of the Zandvoort case, Dutch authorities have requested
the extradition of a Belgian man, Robert van der Plancken, who is
suspected of killing convicted German pedophile Gerrit Ulrich.
	   It was in Ulrich's apartment in Zandvoort that thousands of
shocking images of sex with children were discovered on computer
disks.
	   Van der Plancken has been jailed in Pisa, Italy since June 19,
following Ulrich's death but media reports have suggested he may
soon be released on bail, prompting the extradition request.

Croatian Indoors tournament ceases to exist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The Croatian Indoors tournament will stop
operating because of financial losses and ``attacks ... from
incompetent but influential persons,'' one of its owners announced
Thursday.
	   Co-owner Srdjan Ivanisevic, father of tennis star Goran
Ivanisevic did not elaborate in an open letter published in
Croatia's dailies. But he apparently was alluding to the head of
Croatian Tennis Association, Suad Rizvanbegovic, who is close to
the country's leadership.
	   In its three years of existence, the Croatian Indoors hosted
such tennis celebrities as Boris Becker, Thomas Enquist, Greg
Rusedski, Andrei Medvedev and Goran Ivanisevic, who won the title
last year playing against Becker.
	   The last tour was held in Split in February, and Srdjan
Ivanisevic complained then of financial losses, saying big
companies refused to sponsor the event. He said without elaborating
that Rizvanbegovic, a top executive in Croatia's largest insurance
company and a confidante of President Franjo Tudjman, was behind
the lack of sponsors.
	   The quarrel started when Rizvanbegovic ousted Zeljko Franulovic,
a former tennis pro and Ivanisevic's partner, from the Croatian
Tennis Association. The elder Ivanisevic then resigned, while his
son accused Rizvanbegovic of trying to purge the association of
critics.
	   When the younger Ivanisevic refused to play the Davis Cup until
Rizvanbegovic resigns, he was served a draft notice. An appeal to
Tudjman, an avid tennis fun who recently called Ivanisevic Jr.
``Croatia's finest ambassador,'' to intervene, produced no reply.
	   The elder Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic are currently suing each
other for libel. But many feel the deeper issue is who controls
tennis in Croatia, professionals or the government.
	   ``We perhaps would be ready to cover financial losses ourselves
just to keep such an important sports event in Croatia,''
Ivanisevic wrote, ``but we cannot tolerate anymore constant attacks
and intrigues coming from incompetent, but influential persons.''

Trial of suspects in killing of British victim adjourns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) - A magistrate Thursday adjourned until next
week the trial of two men charged with killing a British tourist,
saying he would rule then whether to admit as evidence a signed
confession from one of the defendants.
	   Peter Hiuhu Gachau has told the court he was coerced into making
the confession.
	   Principal Magistrate Julius S. Mushelle will rule on the
question Wednesday.
	   Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu are charged with the murder of
British tourist Roy Chivers on Feb. 5 on the grounds of Aberdare
Country Club, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kenya's
capital, Nairobi.
	   Police Inspector David Kibe testifed for the prosecution that he
had followed the rules when he recorded Gachau's confession March
3.
	   Gachau told the court on May 11 that police beat him to extract
the confession.
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest while
strolling on the grounds of the resort with his wife Sandra
Christine. He died while being flown to a Nairobi hospital.
	   The defendants are also charged with robbing the Chivers of two
cameras and a pair of binoculars.
	   The police inspector testified that both suspects had signed
statements of confession that had been translated into English from
the Kikuyu language in which they gave them.
	   ``I complied with the judge's rules when extracting the
statement from the suspect, and he voluntarily recorded it,'' Kibe
told the court.
	   Gachau, who is acting as his own counsel, said Thursday he
objected to the statement and said he did not record a confession.
	   Two other inspectors told the court in May that they had
videotaped the defendants voluntarily demonstrating how they had
entered the grounds of country club where Chivers was killed.
	   On May 29, Gachau told the court that police had broken his leg
trying to beat a confession from him.
	   Criminal Investigations Officer Samuel Murey testified in the
same session that Gachau fractured his leg when he tried to escape
custody by jumping into a river after leading officers to the place
where he said he had hidden Chivers' stolen video camera.
	   Last week, police testified that blood samples taken from the
clothing of one of the suspects did not match the victim's blood
type.
	   Earlier this month, the two defendants were convicted and
sentenced to death in a separate trial in the same court for the
murder and robbery of a Kenyan farmer in January.

Thai clergy order monk to paint over murals deemed lewd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Buddhist clergy has ordered
a monk to paint over murals of Adam and Eve on his temple walls,
deeming them lewd and sexually provocative, a government official
said Thursday.
	   The Biblical story of Adam and Eve is not part of the Buddhist
religion, and the men and women in the paintings at the temple in
Chachoengsao province, 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Bangkok,
are naked.
	   The order to paint over the murals came from the Sangha Supreme
Council, the highest decision-making body of the Thai Buddhist
clergy, said Chamras Sudanich, deputy director of the government's
Religious Affairs Department.
	   The council also ordered the monk to destroy a phallic sculpture
and an automatic holy water dispenser.
	   Earlier this week, the council ordered the temple's abbot to
modify his statue of the Buddha, the religion's founder.
	   The statue portrays the Buddha with his foot on top of a globe
and arms raised as if in victory.
	   Many Buddhists feel the pose is too aggressive, and therefore
against the Buddha's teachings. They believe what the monk has done
is symbolic of how many members of the clergy are distorting and
debasing the Buddha's teachings.
	   They want the statue destroyed, but the abbot at the temple and
many people in his town want it kept because it has become a
tourist attraction.
	   The monk has threatened to put a curse on anyone who dares to
destroy his creation. He claimed the 21-year-old statue is part of
an anti-communist propaganda campaign, according to Chamras.
	   Chamras said provincial authorities throughout the country have
been ordered to survey the Buddhist temples in their provinces to
see if others are housing objects that violate Buddhist teachings.

Rescue workers comb villages for missing in wake of Slovak flood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Rescue workers are combing villages
for up to 50 people missing after flash floods killed 36 earlier
this week in eastern Slovakia, said a local official Thursday.
	   Officials fear many of the missing died when a sudden downpour
flooded the Sabinov district of eastern Slovakia late Monday,
causing water levels in local streams to rise six meters in a
matter of hours, said Emil Alaxy, a district spokesman. The flood
wiped out area roads and bridges, trapping dozens of victims, at
least 50 of whom are still unaccounted for.
	   ``Its very likely that, in panic, many ran away to other
villages and they don't feel the need to register with the
authorities,'' said Alaxy.
	   The Czech daily Pravo quoted Slovak officials Thursday as saying
that water in the local streams had hit the highest levels in 500
years. It also said that authorities fear possible outbreaks of
epidemics in the region.
	   Worst hit was the village of Jarovnice, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) northeast of the capital Bratislava. Most of the victims
were Gypsies, also known as Roma, who lived in a settlement of
shacks that were completely washed away.
	   Hundreds of volunteers and soldiers continued cleanup efforts
Thrusday.
	   Heavy rains also flooded the neighboring Czech Republic
overnight Thursday, killing an elderly man. Two people missing were
also reported missing and dozens of others evacuated, said the CTK
news agency.
	   It said the villages Dobruska and Opocno, 120 kilometers (75
miles) east of Prague, were hit the hardest.

FIFA, UEFA warn Polish government, federation to solve dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Polish sides could be barred from
international competitions unless the national soccer federation
and the government solve their current difficulties by Aug. 7, FIFA
and UEFA said Thursday.
	   The international soccer bodies sent a joint delegation to
Warsaw earlier this week to mediate between the federation and the
country's sports ministry.
	   In May, Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended 22 Polish Soccer
Federation administrators because they refused to submit to a probe
of mismanagement accusations.
	   Ministry spokesman Pawel Krzykowski said then authorities were
trying to free Polish soccer from ``an atmosphere of scandal, of
mismanagement, of unclear associations.''
	   Soccer officials argue the government had no right to suspend
the administrators.
	   The move came a day after the administrators held a meeting and
rejected Debski's appointment for a supervisor of a control board
to look into the federation's books.
	   On April 20, federation officials, most of them holdovers from
the communist days, refused to turn over documents for control.
	   The chairman, his deputy and secretary general were fired the
next day. Eight more officials were fired two weeks later.
	   During a three-day visit to Poland, UEFA and FIFA
representatives ``specified a plan of action taking into account
(the sides') basic interests and aiming to restore dialogue between
them,'' the bodies said in a joint statement.
	   No details were given of the plan's contents. However, UEFA and
FIFA said that, while the Polish Soccer Federation accepted it
without reservation, the sports minister ``set out some conditions
contrary to the statutory provisions of FIFA and UEFA.''
	   The Polish government argues that an investigation should take
place before the soccer officials are reinstated.
	   FIFA and UEFA were ``obliged to request'' that the suspensions
``and the consecutive decisions are lifted as soon as possible,''
by Aug. 7 at the latest.
	   Failure to do so could result in the Polish federation being
immediately and indefinitely suspended by both international
bodies, the joint statement said.
	   Poland's national and club sides would be barred from
international competitions if the federation is suspended.

Central and Pacific Leagues tie 3-3 in nine innings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toshihisa Nishi, in position after a single and
stolen base, scored on a wild pitch in the ninth inning Thursday,
giving the Central League a 3-3 tie with the Pacific League in the
final game of Japan's two-game all-star series.
	   All-star rules limit the games to nine innings. The Central
League had won the opening game 4-1 Wednesday.
	   In the top of the ninth, Nishi, of the Yomiuri Giants, singled,
advanced to second on a grounder, stole third and scored on a wild
pitch by Akinori Otsuka of the Kintetsu Buffaloes.
	   The Central League had taken a 2-0 lead in the third inning on
Giants outfielder Hideki Matsui's second home run of the series.
	   The Pacific League tied the game on a home run by Naoyuki Oomura
of the Buffaloes in the bottom of the third and a one-run double in
the fifth by Mitsuchika Hirai of the Chiba Lotte Marines, playing
in his home stadium before more than 24,000 spectators.
	   In the sixth, Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix BlueWave, who leads the
Pacific League with a .386 average, doubled, advanced to third on a
single and scored on a grounder, putting the Pacific team ahead
3-2.
	   The most valuable player award of 2 million yen (dlrs 14,000)
went to Matsui, who leads the Central League in homers this season
with 20.
	   South Korean Cho Sung-min of the Giants gave up one hit, struck
out three and walked two in the last two innings. Cho is 7-6 in the
regular season with a 2.75 ERA.
	   Former Milwaukee Brewers player Julio Franco of the Marines hit
a triple in two at-bats.
	   Former Boston Red Sox player Tuffy Rhodes of the Buffaloes flied
out as a pinch hitter in the seventh with two outs and no runners.
	   Overall in Japanese all-star games, the Central League has 52
victories against 68 defeats. Seven games have ended in ties.

Russia urges Taliban leaders to protect aid workers in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia urged Afghanistan's Taliban government to
ensure the safety and free movement of humanitarian aid workers in
that country, a news agency said Thursday.
	   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Valery Nesterushkin expressed ``deep
concern'' over poor treatment of aid workers by Taliban Islamic
militants in the capital city of Kabul and around Afghanistan, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Two Afghan nationals working for the United Nations were
kidnapped July 13 and later killed, but no one has admitted to the
killings.
	   And more than 200 aid workers were expelled Monday from Kabul
after they refused to obey a Taliban order to relocate to old
university dormitories. The workers feared for their safety in the
empty buildings, and said they did not have money to refurbish
them.
	   Only aid workers from the United Nations and the international
Red Cross remain in Kabul.
	   Relations between the Taliban army and international aid groups
have been strained since 1996 when the religious militia swept into
Kabul and imposed its harsh version of Islamic law.
	   The Taliban fighters now control an estimated 85 percent of
Afghanistan.

World champion leaves Williams to join BAR
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from Schumacher, Coulthard &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Formula One auto racing champion Jacques
Villeneuve confirmed Thursday that's he's leaving Williams to team
up with the new British American Racing team.
	   The 27-year-old Canadian, who has struggled this season behind
the McLarens and Ferraris, is a close friend of BAR's managing
director, Craig Pollock, and will join the former Tyrrell outfit as
soon as his contract with Williams ends at the end of this season.
	   Although Villeneuve won the world title driving for Williams,
he, like Hill, has been frustrated this season that the latest
model can't compete with the cars being driven by Mika Hakkinen and
David Coulthard (both McLaren) and Michael Schumacher (Ferrari).
	   ``I have told every journalist who covers Formula One racing in
recent weeks that I would go with a team that would allow me to
compete at the front of the grid,'' said Villeneuve whose best
results this season were fourth place finishes at San Marino and
the French GP.
	   The widely-expected transfer has prompted speculation of other
big moves as the major teams prepare for next season.
	   IndyCar series leader Alex Zanardi has been linked with a
possible move back into Formula One. Some reports have suggested he
will team up with Villeneuve, a former IndyCar champion, or would
replace him at Williams.
	   It also has been suggested that Williams' other driver,
Germany's Heinz-Harald Frentzen, might be moving on. Damon Hill,
who won the F-1 world title driving for Williams in 1996, moved on
to Arrows and then Jordan but has threatened to quit if he doesn't
find a competitive car.
	   Michael Schumacher, whose victory at the British Grand Prix, put
him within two points of Hakkinen with seven races to go, said
Villeneuve might encounter difficulties with a new team.
	   ``It's a different experience to build a new team and to start
from scratch,'' the German two-time world champion said during
practice for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
	   ``It will be interesting to see which way it will go. It could
go either way. There is more uncertainty with a new team.''
	   Coulthard, who is third in the drivers' championship but 26
points behind the leader, agreed that Villeneuve would be facing up
to the unknown.
	   ``It's always more of a gamble to go to a new team,'' said the
Scot. ``On paper, it looks good. They seem to have good funding.
It's hard to say what will happen.''
	   Pollock, who is building a new complex at Brackley, near
Silverstone in central England and hopes to open it in October,
wants his team to be up there with McLaren and Ferrari next season.
	   ``Jacques' presence in our team will go a long way towards our
goal of being competitive in the shortest time possible,'' he said.
	   Williams managing director Frank Williams confirmed Villeneuve
would not be driving for his team next season.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, he said Williams Grand Prix
Engineering would not be announcing its driver line-up until early
September.
	   ``We would like to take this opportunity of thanking Jacques for
his contribution to both the 1996 and 1997 FIA Formula One world
constructors' championships and to congratulate him on his own 1997
FIA Formula One world drivers' title,'' the Didcot-based team said
in a statement.
	   ``It has been, and will continue to be until the end of this
year, a great pleasure to work with Jacques. We all wish Jacques
every success in his new appointment.''

Namibia ratifies land mine ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia has become the 24th country to
ratify the Ottawa Convention banning land mines.
	   The ban on use, production and stockpiling of the anti-personnel
weapon has been signed by 127 countries. The treaty must be
ratified by 40 countries to become official.
	   The National Assembly ratified the treaty on Wednesday.
	   The treaty also requires member states to destroy existing
mines.
	   Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said Namibia, located on
Africa's southwest Atlantic coast, would keep a small number of
mines for training in destruction and research.
	   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its former
leader Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for their
work in bringing world attention to the issue.

Parliament rejects bill on tax-free bonds profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's leftist-dominated parliament on
Thursday overwhelmingly rejected the government's draft law to make
profits from domestic state bonds, or T-bills, tax-free.
	   Lawmakers said such a law would mean lower budget revenues and
fewer bank loans to businesses, since banks would be more
interested in making tax-free profits from bonds, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The 241-6 vote against the bill, which would have abolished the
30 percent tax on T-bill profits, also nullified a corresponding
decree by President Leonid Kuchma, signed last month.
	   Ukraine's government, which faces serious financial
difficulties, has been struggling to support its shaky bond market.
Foreign investors have been withdrawing the money they keep in
bonds and the government has pleaded with commercial banks to buy
T-bills.
	   Foreigners, who held more than 50 percent of Ukraine's T-bill
market at the beginning of the year, accounted for only 28 percent
in June, according to National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko.
	   The central bank, along with the country's commercial banks,
have had to purchase a major share of Finance Ministry bonds in the
last few months.
	   Stable performance of the T-bill market is critical for the
government, since it uses revenues from bonds sales as a primary
source of financing the budget deficit.

FIFA, UEFA warn Polish government, federation to solve dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Polish sides could be barred from
international competitions unless the national soccer federation
and the government solve their current difficulties by Aug. 7, FIFA
and UEFA said Thursday.
	   The international soccer bodies sent a joint delegation to
Warsaw earlier this week to mediate between the federation and the
country's sports ministry.
	   In May, Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended 22 Polish Soccer
Federation administrators because they refused to submit to a probe
of mismanagement accusations.
	   Ministry spokesman Pawel Krzykowski has said authorities were
trying to free Polish soccer from ``an atmosphere of scandal, of
mismanagement, of unclear associations.''
	   Soccer officials argue the government had no right to suspend
the administrators.
	   During a three-day visit to Poland, UEFA and FIFA
representatives ``specified a plan of action taking into account
(the sides') basic interests and aiming to restore dialogue between
them,'' the bodies said in a joint statement.
	   No details were given of the plan's contents. However, UEFA and
FIFA said that, while the Polish Soccer Federation accepted it
without reservation, the sports minister ``set out some conditions
contrary to the statutory provisions of FIFA and UEFA.''
	   The Polish government argues that an investigation should take
place before the soccer officials are reinstated.
	   FIFA and UEFA were ``obliged to request'' that the suspensions
``and the consecutive decisions are lifted as soon as possible,''
by Aug. 7 at the latest.
	   Failure to do so could result in the Polish federation being
immediately and indefinitely suspended by both international
bodies, the joint statement said.

Yemeni kidnappers free two Belgian tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesman freed two Belgian tourists
Thursday, a day after they were seized, a security official said.
	   Gunmen of the Baqeel tribe grabbed the tourists Wednesday in
al-Haima, 35 kilometers (22 miles) west of the capital San`a, said
the official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Legislator Mohammed Sharda negotiated the release of the men and
promised the tribe that the government would look into their
demands, the official said. He gave no details on the tribe's
demands.
	   Yemeni tribes frequently kidnap tourists, oil workers and
diplomats in a bid to extort money or government funds for local
projects. The hostages all have been released unharmed.
	   The identities of the tourists were not immediately known and
Belgian diplomats were not available for comment Thursday.
	   The government of Yemen, a poor state in the southwest corner of
the Arabian Peninsula, has yet to establish its authority over
large parts of the country where tribes live beyond the law.

Julich newest American to challenge for Tour lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France - (AP) - An American is in
contention for the title in the Tour De France. And he isn't named
Greg LeMond.
	   Bobby Julich of Glenwood Springs, Colorado is within 71 seconds
of defending champion Jan Ullrich with the Tour taking a rest day
before heading to the Alps.
	   Thursday is a rest day before the Tour starts up again with a
222-kilometer (137-mile) leg from Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde
on Friday. The Tour is slowly making its way across southern France
before hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   To be challenging for the top spot in the Tour was unexpected
for the 26-year-old Julich, who rides for the French Cofidis team.
He was recruited for the team last year along with three other
Americans -- Lance Armstrong, Frankie Andreu and Kevin Livingston.
	   Armstrong never rode for Cofidis, recovering from testicular
cancer last year and signing with the U.S. Postal team along with
Andreu. Livingston is still with Cofidis.
	   Julich rewarded Cofidis for their confidence with a 17th in the
Tour last year.
	   ``Since last year I knew I could have a good result this year,''
Julich said. ``When I started this year's Tour I hoped to be in the
top 10.''
	   ``After the first week, I though `OK. Maybe the top 15'. Now I
see myself in Paris in the top three,'' he said.
	   What caused him to change his mind was a series of performances
that kept him close to Ullrich.
	   Last Saturday Ullrich won the first time trial but Julich was
third, a minute 18 seconds behind.
	   Julich stayed with Ullrich in the two stages in the Pyrenees. He
was fourth Tuesday and third Wednesday with Ullrich coming in
eighth both times. Ullrich relaxed a little, giving up seven
seconds to Julich to allow the American to creep within 71 seconds
of the overall lead.
	   That has been the closest an American has come to the lead of
the Tour since the glory days of LeMond, who won in 1986, 1989 and
1990 before retiring in 1994.
	   ``I realize now how much Greg influenced me in participating in
the Tour and being American,'' Julich said. ``Perhaps some day I
can do the same thing for kids in my country.''
	   During the early 1990s, Julich was a rising star in the junior
ranks, coming in fifth in the Tour DuPont in 1991 as a 19-year-old.
	   Yet he never really blossomed. He even had to work without a
team one year before joining the U.S. Motorola team, the successor
of the 7-Eleven team.
	   He came along to Cofidis with with Armstrong after Motorola
dropped out of cycling.
	   Julich is now the leader of the team after co-leader Francesco
Casagrande, sixth in last year's Tour, crashed on Tuesday and
dropped out of the Tour.
	   Bernard Quilfen, director of the Cofidis team, is confident that
his team can help Julich.
	   ``The riders are ready to protect and defend the second place of
Bobby,'' Quilfen said. ``He showed he is a good rider after his
fourth place in the Disneyland time trial last year. Now he is a
year older and has really matured this year.''
	   There are three stages before three days in the Alps could
decide things.
	   Julich knows it will be tough to overcome the advantage that
Ullrich has. Ullrich won the Tour last year but more than nine
minutes.
	   ``Ullrich is very, very strong. He has a lot of experience and I
respect him a lot,'' said Julich. ``But I hope there will be a big
battle in the Alps.''
	   The three days in the Alps will have 12 climbs with two of the
climbs on Monday being rated ``out of category'' on a scale of
steepness, length and difficulty.
	   If there is a narrow gap between the riders coming out of the
mountains, it may come down to the 52-kilometer (32-mile) time
trial to Le Creusot on Saturday, Aug. 1, the day before the Tour
finishes in Paris.

Yeltsin appoints former Politburo member to Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with IMF sending 1st part of loan after 4th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin appointed a former
Politburo member and long-time Communist Party member to his
Cabinet on Thursday in an apparent move to improve his testy
relations with the hard-line parliament.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, 60, a former deputy chairman of the Soviet
planning agency Gosplan, was named Minister for Industry and Trade.
	   A gesture of this sort has been expected from the president for
weeks, because parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has
blocked many of Yeltsin's moves to reform the economy and improve
the state's finances.
	   The Duma's reluctance to approve higher taxes and budget cuts
has dismayed international lenders. The International Monetary Fund
approved its part of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout for Russia this
week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800 million to
protest the Duma's rejection of the austerity measures.
	   The IMF sent part of the first installment Thursday,
transferring dlrs 4.3 billion to the Russian Central Bank. Another
dlrs 4.8 billion will be sent by the end of the week, Interfax
reported.
	   Lawmakers have complained that IMF-influenced economic policies
are destroying the economy and have frequently demanded what they
call a ``government of national reconciliation'' in which
Communists and other Yeltsin opponents would serve in the Cabinet.
	   Russia's economy has been in a steep decline for months, and the
Finance Ministry predicted Wednesday that GDP will shrink by 0.5
percent by the end of the year.
	   The ministry had originally estimated 2 percent growth for 1998,
following a 0.8 percent increase last year _ Russia's first growth
since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Maslyukov, deputy chairman of Gosplan under Mikhail Gorbachev,
is a member of the Duma where he serves as head of the committee on
economic policy.
	   Maslyukov's new post is likely to carry relatively minor
responsibilities. The ministry was created in April, when Yeltsin
abolished the Ministry of Foreign Trade in a cabinet shakeup.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank said its hard-currency
reserves edged down to dlrs 13.6 billion this week from dlrs 13.7
billion on July 10.
	   Central Bank reserves have been slipping during the country's
financial crisis in recent months. The bank has spent large sums to
defend the Russian ruble, which has remained relatively steady at
around 6.2 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The pressure on the ruble has eased since Russia reached
agreement on the international bailout which, with previously
approved loans, will total dlrs 22.6 billion over the next two
years.

Willi Reimann new coach at FC Nuremberg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Willi Reimann Thursday signed a
one-year contract to coach FC Nuremberg, taking over just three
weeks before the Bundesliga season starts.
	   Reimann, fired by VfL Wolfsburg in March, was signed just six
days after Felix Magath resigned. He was also coach of Hamburger SV
from 1987 to 1990.
	   Nuremberg had scrambled to find a new coach after Magath, the
former German national team player, quit following a dispute with
the team president.
	   Magath, who guided Nuremberg out of the second division last
season, wanted the team to invest in new players instead of
reducing the club debt.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Old guard favorite Keizo Obuchi bolstered his lead
in the race for prime minister, wrapping up his campaign Thursday
by pledging to pull Japan out of its worst recession in decades
with tax cuts and reform of the banking sector.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Friday chooses among
Foreign Minister Obuchi, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, 72, and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56, for party
president. The victor is nearly certain to win the premiership in
an upcoming Parliament vote.
	   Surveys of the party showed Obuchi, the pick of party elders,
within striking distance of the majority needed to win on a first
ballot. If no candidate wins a majority _ 208 of the 414 LDP
members voting _ a run-off will be held immediately.
	   A win for Obuchi _ seen as an LDP loyalist but not a brilliant
innovator _ would mark a victory for the party's long-time power
brokers over younger dissidents who have called for more dynamic
leadership. Discontented voters have been looking for a zealous
reformer.
	   The three candidates laid out their proposals for nursing the
economy to health Thursday in nationally televised speeches.
Obuchi, 61, portrayed himself as the only choice with the know-how
and political backing to get the job done.
	   ``I am determined to tackle these problems with my ability to
bring people together, by listening to the voice of each Parliament
member, using the power of the Japanese people and drawing on my
long experience,'' he declared.
	   Obuchi reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in
new spending to kick start economic growth and spur lagging
consumption.
	   Kajiyama, the favorite of the markets for his backing of
extensive economic reform, said his administration would aim for 3
percent annual growth _ a turnaround for an economy that shrank for
the first time in two decades in the fiscal year that ended in
March.
	   ``I may stumble along the way but I will devote my life to
economic recovery,'' he said.
	   The outspoken Koizumi _ a maverick backed by younger dissident
lawmakers _ vowed to implement drastic reforms of the political
system, including cutting by almost half the number of Parliament
members and government bureaucrats.
	   ``Some people call me an eccentric man, but as an eccentric man,
I am a man who can change things,'' Koizumi said, playing on the
similarity in Japanese between the words ``eccentric'' and
``change.''
	   The three are battling to take over from resigning Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced last week he was quitting
after the LDP was trounced in July 12 elections for the upper house
of Parliament. His successor will finish out his term as party
president, which ends in September 1999.
	   The winner will also take over a nation in turmoil _ both
financial and political.
	   Japan's most glaring problems are economic. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are mounting at their
fastest rate since the end of World War II. Japanese banks' are
saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans.
	   In a major blow to the country's economy and ego, U.S. credit
rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced Thursday it will
review its rating for Japan's government debt _ a move that could
lead to higher borrowing costs for the government and companies.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy _ and fear among
ruling party lawmakers that they had better change their image in a
hurry. Younger lawmakers forced the party to hold a more open race
for president instead of choosing a successor behind closed doors.
	   The candidates fell over each other to take the banner of reform
and openly appealed to voters in a string of news conferences,
speeches and a TV debate last weekend.
	   The effort doesn't appear to have paid off.
	   The mass-circulation newspaper Yomiuri reported Thursday that
the LDP's approval rating has sunk to an all-time low of 20.8
percent _ down significantly from 28.7 percent in June. The poll,
of 1,990 people, offered no margin of error.
	   And despite the attempt at an image make-over, the man who would
have had the nomination sewed up in an old-style backroom deal _
Obuchi _ was clearly the front-runner going into the home-stretch
of the campaign, despite public polls that showed Koizumi as more
popular.
	   A survey of LDP members by Kyodo News agency released late
Wednesday showed Obuchi with nearly 200 of the 208 votes needed to
win a majority in a first ballot. The Nihon Keizai economic
newspaper released a survey on Thursday showing Obuchi with a more
modest 180 votes, but still with more than twice the support of his
nearest competitor, Koizumi.
	   Some of Koizumi's more rebellious followers in the party reacted
to the poll numbers by threatening to defect from the party or
abstain from the Parliament vote in an attempt to derail Obuchi's
bid, but their numbers were considered too small to have much
impact.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama
has urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to visit Angola as soon
as possible to halt the Southwest African country's imminent slide
back into civil war, officials said Thursday.
	   In a letter sent to Annan on Monday, Gama said there was a
``dangerous crisis'' in the former Portuguese colony because the
former rebel movement UNITA was not observing the 1994 peace pact
with the Angola government that ended a two-decade civil war.
	   The political and military situation in Angola ``has
deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, prompting legitimate fears
that we may be about to see the outbreak of a generalized
conflict,'' the letter said.
	   The letter was published in Thursday's edition of daily Diario
de Noticias and confirmed as official by the Foreign Ministry.
	   UNITA, which was to have demobilized its 70,000-strong guerilla
army under the United Nations-brokered peace deal, ``has maintained
military activities in several Angolan provinces,'' Gama wrote.
	   The Angolan government is displaying ``clear signs of impatience
with the deadlock'' in fully implementing the peace accord, he
added.
	   The U.N. mission in the Angolan capital Luanda said Thursday
that the government army has recently been forcibly recruiting
young males.

A look at the candidates and issues in Japan's ruling party ballot

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A look at the candidates and issues in Friday's
ballot for the ruling Liberal Democratic Liberal Party's nomination
for successor to resigning Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto:
	   ___
	    &QC; WHO'S RUNNING:
	   _Keizo Obuchi, 61, foreign minister and head of the largest
faction in the ruling party. The most likely successor and
front-runner in surveys of party members. He is known as a party
insider and master of LDP politics, but not seen as a brilliant
innovator.
	   _Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, senior lawmaker in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and chief secretary in Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's first Cabinet. Since leaving the Cabinet, he has pushed
for faster action to deal with bad loans hobbling Japanese banks.
	   _Junichiro Koizumi, 56, health minister, a favorite of the LDP's
younger lawmakers and a leader in public opinion polls. He is
considered a maverick and reformer and has pushed for the
privatization of Japan's massive postal-savings system. But he has
little chance of winning.
	   ___
	    &QC; WHO'S VOTING:
	   A total of 414 LDP lawmakers and prefectural representatives in
a secret ballot. The winner will then go before the Parliament,
probably late next week, for the vote for prime minister. The LDP
candidate is expected to win since the party commands a majority in
the powerful lower house.
	   ___
	    &QC; WHAT'S AT STAKE:
	   Japan's troubled economy _ in its worst recession since World
War II _ has dominated the campaign. Employment is at a record high
of 4.1 percent and bankruptcies are mounting. Japan is coming under
increasing pressure from allies to fix its economy to help stop the
Asian financial crisis from spreading to other regions.
	   ___
	    &QC; CANDIDATES' PROPOSALS:
	   The policies pushed by all three candidates are similar:
personal income and corporate tax cuts to boost lagging
consumption; an overhaul of Japan's financial sector, which is
saddled with loads of bad debt; a continuation of the government
deregulation program started under Hashimoto.

Diplomatic team admits little progress in mission in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- An international team back from
Yugoslavia reported Thursday a ``total lack of trust'' between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians and said it failed convince the
government to let a permanent diplomatic mission return to Kosovo.
	   A team of senior diplomats from the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, came back Wednesday
after a week-long visit to Yugoslavia, which included meetings with
senior Yugoslav officials and separatist Albanian politicians.
	   The team hoped the visit would pave the way for a permanent OSCE
mission to be based in Kosovo and for a visit by former Spanish
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to help mediate the crisis on behalf
of the European Union.
	   But in its report, the team, which included American, Russian,
Austrian, German, Polish, Norwegian and Danish diplomats, said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stuck by his demand that
Yugoslavia's membership in the OSCE be restored before he would
accept a permanent mission or Gonzalez's mediation.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.
	   The team, led by the former German ambassador to Belgrade
Hansjoerg Eiff, also reported finding a ``total lack of trust
between the two communities in Kosovo,'' meaning the Serbs and
Albanians, who form 90 percent of the province's population.
	   The team also said Albanian politicians and the Serb-dominated
government in Belgrade remain far apart ``as to how the conflict
could be resolved.'' Milosevic has offered to negotiate autonomy
for the province, which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But Milosevic -- as well as the Americans and Europeans --
opposes independence as demanded by both moderate Albanian
politicians and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is battling Serb
security forces in the province.
	   On Thursday, the Vienna newspaper, The Standard, said Milosevic
was expected to announce shortly that he would be prepared to raise
Kosovo's legal status from a Serbian province to a full republic
within the Yugoslav federation.
	   That would give the province equal footing along with Serbia and
Montenegro, which together form all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   The newspaper quoted a Montenegrin Cabinet member, Predrag
Drecun, as saying Milosevic had advised the European Union of his
plan, which would be announced ``soon.''
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
degree of mistrust between the Albanians and Milosevic was so great
that they were skeptical it would satisfy even the more moderate
separatists.

 &UR; Schumacher says Ferrari should be fast on the A1-Ring &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPIELBERG, Austria (AP) _ The revamped A1-Ring in the
southeastern Austrian hills reminds Michael Schumacher of the
Magny-Cours circuit in France. The Ferrari driver won in France and
he figures he has a good chance here as well.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, will be aiming for
his fourth straight victory in Sunday's Grand Prix of Austria.
	   ``It's the same type of circuit and we think we have a good
chance to win,'' Schumacher said Thursday as the drivers gathered
here for the season's 10th race.
	   The German comes into the race brimming with confidence after
winning in Canada, France and Britain.
	   With seven races left in the season, he trails Mika Hakkinen of
McLaren- Mercedes by two points in the drivers' standings, 56-54.
	   After dominating the early part of the season, the McLarens have
been staring at Ferrari's tail lights.
	   Hakkinen's fourth and last victory of the season was in Monaco
on May 24. He was second in water-logged Silverstone behind
Schumacher in a finish that is still being contested.
	   As Hakkinen took the checkered flag, Schumacher was in the box
sitting out a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag.
But the German was awarded the victory, pending a McLaren appeal.
	   Schumacher said he was not worried about having the victory
taken away. ``I never saw the flag in the rain,'' he said.
	   His McLaren teammate David Coulthard had to retire in three of
the last four races as the previously so superior cars began to
experience sudden problems.
	   ``It's impossible to say who will have the advantage here,''
Coulthard said. ``It will probably come down to the tires.''
	   Schumacher denied that he will be racing with a new, more
powerful engine in his Ferrari.
	   ``It's not a new engine. I'd love to have 30 horsepower more,
but that's not the case,'' he said. ``But we are always working on
the car and trying to improve it.''
	   The Austrian race will be Schumacher's first since he extended
his contract with Ferrari until the year 2002 in a deal that
reportedly makes him one of the highest paid sportsmen in the
world. No financial details have been given of the agreement.
	   ``The money was not my first priority. It's the people around
you, the trust, the support, the respect we have for each other,''
Schumacher said.
	   ``I want to achieve my target and that's to win the World
Championship for Ferrari,'' he said.
	   Unofficial practice is scheduled for Friday, with the official
qualifying set for Saturday.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, the reigning Formula One champion who won
the Austrian race last year, announced Thursday that he was leaving
Williams to join the new British American racing team next season.

Chilean striker ready to fight for place on Inter's lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano said
Thursday that he was prepared to fight off a tough competition to
earn a starting place on Inter Milan's lineup next season.
	   ``I know there are many good forwards on Inter's roster ... but
I'm not afraid of the competition ... the coach (Gigi Simoni) knows
we can always rely on this old warrior,'' Zamorano said.
	   The Chilean striker made his remarks after undergoing medical
tests in Milan, before joining his Inter teammates in the Aosta
valley, where the Milan team is preparing for the next Serie A
campaign which starts on Sept. 13.
	   Zamorano, who scored decisive goals for Inter last season
although being often rotated with other international forwards,
welcomed the arrival at Inter of Italian veteran star Roberto
Baggio.
	   ``With Baggio we can only improve our chances to win the
(league) title and do well in the Champions League,'' Zamorano
said.
	   Newly-signed Baggio became part of Inter's stellar forward line
including Zamorano, Brazilian star Ronaldo, Uruguayan Alvaro
Recoba, Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu and Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff.
	   About Ronaldo, Zamorano said he suffered a lot from the rivalry
inside the Brazilian national team.
	   ``I know him, he's a child, he does not want to be a star. I
think Brazil lost (the World Cup final to France) because it's a
team with too many individual talents and little teamwork,'' he
said.
	   Zamorano added he was looking forward to next season's duel with
his long-time friend and national team partner Marcelo Salas who
joined Lazio of Rome.
	   ``Lazio will be one of the toughest title contenders, with Salas
leading its offense. However I think Inter still is a better, more
motivated team.''

 &UR; Gore calls on India and Pakistan to abandon nuclear weapons,

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al Gore made an
impassioned plea to India and Pakistan on Thursday to abandon their
nuclear weapons and start peace negotiations ``in the name of your
children.''
	   ``Pakistani and Indian children playing, eating, and laughing in
those two countries, while the adults threaten one another with the
possibility of nuclear war _ shall we betray those children, or
choose instead to safeguard their future?'' Gore said.
	   India carried out a surprising series of underground nuclear
tests last May. The United States cut loans and aid to India and
other countries imposed sanctions
	   India's neighbor and rival, Pakistan, responded by carrying out
its own nuclear tests, raising fears that the countries' 50-year
standoff could result in a nuclear war.
	   Gore, speaking during a visit to Ukraine, said that a Pakistani
nuclear attack on India would affect many countries in the region.
An Indian attack on Pakistan would backfire, with prevailing winds
in the area pulling the radioactive plume back into India, he said.
	   ``We are all connected,'' Gore stressed.
	   Gore said India and Pakistan should follow the examples of
former Cold War rivals, the United States and the then-Soviet
Union.
	   ``Come to the table. Sign the Comprehensive Ban Treaty. Accept
meaningful constraints on the deployment of ballistic missiles.
Help work toward a treaty to cut off production of fissile
material,'' Gore said.
	   ``We appeal to the wisdom of the Indian and Pakistani peoples
and their leaders,'' he added. ``Sit down together, negotiate, make
peace in the name of your children.''

In blow to Japan, Moody's signals debt rating could be downgraded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, RECASTS and changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dealing a blow to Japan's struggling economy, U.S.
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Thursday put
Tokyo's top-grade rating under review, threatening to raise
borrowing costs for the country's government and companies.
	   The announcement, a signal that Moody's might lower its
appraisal of Japan's ability to repay its debts, came as the ruling
party prepared to choose its nominee for prime minister and sent
tremors through Tokyo financial markets.
	   The dollar surged above 142 yen for the first time since July 13
before easing to 141.68 yen in late Tokyo trading Thursday.
Japanese bond prices initially plummeted after the report was
released, but rebounded in late trading. Tokyo stocks declined.
	   ``There's no doubt that this is a signal that there is a very
urgent need to resolve the bad debt problem and make the financial
sector as a whole healthy,'' said Takatoshi Ito, a professor at
Hitotsubashi University.
	   Moody's portrayed Japan as an economy in trouble _ and one not
expected to pull out of its morass any time soon.
	   ``Deep, structural problems in Japan's economy ... have defied
conventional policy remedies,'' Moody's said.
	   A lowering of the rating could hamper Japan's efforts to pull
out of its slump. For example, such a move could raise the cost for
Japan of issuing bonds, something it has done more of lately as it
tries to spend its way out of recession.
	   The review also affects corporate borrowing by the nation's
top-ranked companies, such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
have Moody's triple-A grade. NTT is the world's largest phone
company.
	   Dropping Japan down a notch would also deal a blow to its ego,
removing the world's second-largest economy from the short list of
top-rated countries, which includes powerhouses such as the United
States and Germany.
	   Moody's also took aim directly at Japanese policy makers,
already under attack by voters angry over the government's
inability to pull the country out of recession. The ruling party
was pummeled in July 12 elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   Moody's said the review was prompted by ``an apparent lack of
consensus among policy makers on a medium-term strategy for
implementing structural reform and for managing the economy.''
	   The announcement could not have come at a worse time for the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which is trying to convince voters
that its candidates to take over for resigning Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto will be able to turn the economy around.
	   The LDP was set to vote Friday on a new party president _ who is
nearly certain to win the race in Parliament for prime minister
since the party commands a comfortable majority in the powerful
lower house.
	   ``The timing is surprising,'' said Ron Bevacqua, an economist at
Merrill Lynch. ``They appear to be playing a bit of politics
here.''
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was the leading candidate for the
post, although he was seen as less likely than his rivals to act
decisively to boost the economy.
	   Ironically, the agency cited one of Japan's rare policy
successes _ the much-praised financial system reform dubbed the
``Big Bang'' _ as another reason to worry about the country because
of the potential for Japanese shifting their assets into foreign
currencies.
	   Already that has happened. Since Japan lifted a restriction in
April on investing overseas, capital has flowed abroad,
contributing to a decline in the yen against the dollar.
	   To be sure, the move announced Thursday was only a review and
some analysts said Moody's may choose to leave Japan with a top
rating. Despite the country's recent economic problems, a triple-A
rating would not be unwarranted, they argued.
	   Japan is highly unlikely to default on any of its debt as it is
the world's largest lender and saver. And most of Japan's debt is
financed domestically, so Japanese taxpayers bear the greatest
risk.
	   Moody's noted Japan has considerable strengths, including the
capacity to absorb economic shocks, and a formidable manufacturing
sector that has retained its international competitiveness despite
the appreciation of the yen in the past decade.
	   But whether the rating is downgraded ``does depend on the
policies the new prime minister will offer in the next few
months,'' said Matthew Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers
Japan.

Ukraine prepares for talks with IMF on key loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian officials prepared Thursday for
weekend talks with an IMF mission on a key dlrs 2.5 billion loan
for the economically struggling country.
	   Some members of the International Monetary Fund mission were to
arrive in the capital, Kiev, on Thursday, with mission leaders
joining them Saturday for the first in-depth negotiating session
with Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Tyhypko.
	   The IMF mission will assess Ukraine's implementation of the
requirements the former Soviet republic has to meet to qualify for
the loan.
	   Also Saturday, the mission is to discuss with Finance Minister
Ihor Mityukov the country's revised 1998 budget, which the
government has yet to introduce.
	   Approval of the new budget, which would cut the deficit by one
percentage point to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, is a key
IMF requirement for disbursement of the loan.
	   During its weeklong visit, IMF officials are also scheduled to
meet with President Leonid Kuchma, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko.
	   Kuchma and other government officials have expressed confidence
that this might be the final trip by an IMF delegation to Ukraine
before it recommends approval of the loan.
	   ``The IMF mission is traveling to Ukraine in good spirits, with
the wish to complete consideration of the program ... and approve
it,'' Kuchma said last week.
	   Kuchma has introduced by decree a series of reform measures
recently, aiming to fulfill dozens of conditions set by the IMF for
disbursement of the loan.
	   The approval of the dlrs 2.5 billion loan would signal
resumption of the fund's aid to Ukraine, which was suspended this
spring because of stalled reforms and government spending.
	   The IMF rejected a similar loan to Ukraine last year, when Kiev
failed to meet the requirements set by the fund.
	   Ukraine needs foreign financial aid urgently to make big foreign
debt repayments in the next few months, including dlrs 500 million
in August alone.
	   It also hopes the IMF loan will leader to a more-than dlrs 1
billion loan from the World Bank, which has suspended cooperation
with Ukraine, in line with the IMF.

Angry Bosnian Serb mob forces postponement of to Muslim's funeral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An angry Bosnian Serb
crowd gathered Thursday at the site of a mosque blown up during the
war to protest the funeral of Banja Luka's Muslim spiritual leader.
	   Mufti Ibrahim Halilovic died Monday and a funeral procession and
traditional Muslim burial ceremony were requested by the Islamic
community of Banja Luka, the largest city in the Serb half of
Bosnia.
	   Banja Luka authorities refused permission for the funeral at the
site of the Ferhadija mosque, which Serbs blew up in a rampage of
ethnic hatred during the war.
	   About 1,000 ultranationalist Bosnian Serbs gathered Thursday at
the mosque's site, shouting anti-Muslim slogans and chanting: ``We
won't give up Serb land.''
	   The crowd dispersed after several hours, since no funeral
procession appeared and after police forced organizers to take down
loudspeakers.
	   Crowd members, however, smashed two cameras and hit a Serb
journalist, mistakenly believing that the equipment and reporter
were with television stations from the Muslim-Croat half of the
country.
	   The mufti's funeral will take place Friday in Sarajevo, capital
of all of Bosnia, said Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's oil exports have fallen by 325,000
barrels a day this month, in line with an agreed cut in output to
try to firm up prices, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   The agency did not say how much oil Iran was exporting, but the
Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated the June exports
at 3.6 million barrels a day.
	   The July reduction complied with Iran's pledge last month to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the agency quoted
National Iranian Oil Company official Hojjatollah Ghanimfard as
saying.
	   At the June OPEC meeting, Iran promised to cut its output by
305,000 barrels a day to 3.318 million barrels a day. The move was
part of an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members to reduce
production by more than 3.1 million barrels a day until July 1,
1999.
	   OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela. The non-OPEC producers who agreed to the cuts are
Russia, Oman, Egypt and Norway.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
continued an upward trend this week, closing at 2,154.8 points _ a
rise of 27.5 points, or 1.29 percent _ from the previous week, the
National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said the rise would continue
with expectations that the National Assembly will approve a
government proposal to reschedule the payment of billions of dinars
in bad debts.
	   It was feared that debtors would resort to selling their stock
in order to make a payment in early September.
	   The government took over debts of 6.7 billion dinars (dlrs 21.89
billion) from local banks after Kuwait's 1991 liberation from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation. The debts were caused by a 1982 stock
market crash and the Iraqi invasion. A number of lawmakers have
opposed the rescheduling, which the assembly is expected to debate
soon.
	   Some 422.15 million shares changed hands this week, up 31.34
percent from last week. The value of these shares rose 37.86
percent, reaching 97.20 million dinars (dlrs 317.64 million).
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, 66 were traded this
week, the report said. Seventeen companies closed higher, 27 closed
lower, and 22 were unchanged.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices increased, but turnover
dropped on the Jordanian Stock Market this week, a market report
said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the fall in turnover to weak trading by
foreign investors.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said that the 60-company general share prices
index rose by 0.77 percent to 180.22 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks increased by 2.55 percent, insurance
sector shares by 0.45 percent, but industrial stocks dropped by
3.56 percent, and service sector by 0.16 percent.
	   Turnover fell by 36 percent to 14.34 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 20.2 million), the report said.
	   Stocks of 101 firms were traded during the week.

German archivists say key documents on Nazi gold disappeared by the
</HEADLINE>
mid-1970s &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German officials have concluded that
key documents on gold stolen by the Nazis from Jewish victims
disappeared by the mid-1970s, an official at the federal archive
agency said Thursday.
	   But the archive agency denied a German television report that
searchers concluded the documents from the former Nazi central bank
probably were destroyed.
	   U.S. researchers, German archivists and Germany's Bundesbank
have been searching for records of the so-called ``Melmer''
accounts to help determine where the gold ended up.
	   The final report on the German search, carried out by the
archives and the Bundesbank, is to be released next month.
	   The archive official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would
say only that the search has been fruitless and that the documents
disappeared by the mid-1970s.
	   He said it was possible the documents were destroyed but there
was not enough evidence to confirm it.
	   The ARD TV report late Thursday said the missing documents
involved the World War II-era accounts linked with SS Capt. Bruno
Melmer, who was in charge of valuables stolen from Nazi victims
between 1942 and 1944.
	   A U.S.-based panel of historians has concluded that the Nazi
regime's central bank, the Reichsbank, obtained at least dlrs 2.5
million in melted-down gold from teeth fillings, eyeglass frames
and jewelry of concentration camp victims.
	   The U.S. Army had access to the Melmer accounts and other
records of the Bundesbank after World War II. It microfilmed most
of the material, but for some reason did not record the 26 books
and folders on the Melmer accounts, the researchers have found.
	   The documents were handed over to the Bundesbank of Germany's
postwar government in 1948.
	   ARD quoted the German draft report as saying the archives and
the Bundesbank find the disappearance of the documents
``inexcusable.''
	   ``The unbiased observer will not be able to understand that
documents that are so closely linked with Nazi crimes ... could
have disappeared,'' ARD quoted the draft report as saying.

UNICEF official presses for further aid to avoid wider disaster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE CHAVRANSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A top UNICEF official on Thursday blasted the
international community for not doing more to stop a widening
famine in war-torn Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of people
face starvation.
	   Sudan's Islamic government and Christian rebels agreed last week
to a three-month truce, allowing aid workers to enter the southern
region wracked by a drought and 15 years of civil war.
	   Despite ``Operation Lifeline'' by U.N. agencies and aid groups,
the international community ``has absolutely not realized the scope
of the disaster,'' Claire Brisset, director of information for the
United Nations Children's Fund, told a news conference.
	   Nearly 2 million people need immediate aid -- 1.5 million in the
south and about 350,000 encamped in a ``belt of misery'' around the
northern capital of Khartoum, said Brisset, who returned Wednesday
from a trip to Sudan with UNICEF Director-General Carol Bellamy.
	   UNICEF needs dlrs 50 million but has received barely half that,
said Brisset, and she criticized her native France for earmarking
only dlrs 3 million on Wednesday. She called it ``ridiculous
compared to the need.''
	   In a front-page commentary Thursday in the newspaper Le Monde,
Brisset said that during her trip she saw ``the living dead'' who
arrived in a town after walking 1,000 kilometers (600 miles).
	   ``Women give birth on the ground to babies who don't weigh 1
kilo (2.2 pounds,'' she wrote. ``Will the donors finally understand
that this disaster could become comparable to the Ethiopian famine
of 1984?''
	   Already an estimated 1.5 million people have died since the
civil war broke out in 1983. In addition to humanitarian aid to
fight the famine, Brisset told the news conference, ``the best
remedy is peace.''

10 killed in Yemen clashes after government convoy ambushed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Ten people were killed and more than 25
injured in clashes between security forces and tribesmen who had
ambushed a Cabinet ministers' convoy, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Tribesmen captured 20 soldiers and three tanks during the
clashes, which began with the Tuesday ambush and lasted until a
truce was declared late Wednesday, the opposition newspaper
al-Thawri said.
	   A government spokesman said some of the tribesmen involved in
the ambush in a hilly region 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast
of the capital San`a had fled to Saudi Arabia.
	   Al-Thawri did not say how many tribesmen and how many members of
the security forces were killed. The government spokesman, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity, gave no details.
	   The newspaper said the tribesmen released the 20 soldiers as
part of the truce.
	   The clashes took place after tribesmen opened fire on a convoy
carrying Yemen's interior minister, local administration minister
and other high-ranking officials, the newspaper said.
	   A provincial governor and six guards were injured in the initial
fighting.
	   The ambush was carried out by tribesmen protesting a 40 percent
government hike in fuel prices.
	   The ministers went to the region to review government troops
sent in to quell unrest, which started June 19 when the government
raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas to meet
International Monetary Fund demands to remove subsidies.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms in settling scores with rivals or to
express discontent with the government.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen mustered convoys
of trucks to carry thousands of supporters through the capital in a
show of strength Thursday as Cambodia's violence-marred election
campaign neared a close.
	   But citizens gave an unofficial vote of popularity to his rival,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was deposed by Hun Sen as co-prime
minister last year in fighting that devastated parts of the capital
with tank, mortar and rocket fire.
	   The prince was mobbed by vendors and shopkeepers when he paid a
surprise visit to the main market. People knocked over goods and
broke glass display cases as they crowded to see and touch him.
	   By contrast, citizens showed little interest as hundreds of
trucks bearing supporters of the ruling Cambodian People's Party
rolled through the streets. Most were from Kandal province, a Hun
Sen stronghold. Party officials said 743 trucks and 28,000 people
from Kandal had hit the roads, though not all came to Phnom Penh.
Each was paid 10,000 riels (dlrs 2.50).
	   A similar but more somber demonstration was planned by Sam
Rainsy, the other main opposition candidate, for Friday, the last
day of campaigning. Rainsy was to lead a truck convoy and rally
supporters outside the National Assembly, where 16 people were
killed in a grenade attack at a protest he was leading March 30,
1997. Hun Sen has been widely blamed.
	   Ranariddh took the enthusiasm that greeted his arrival at the
central market as a sign of popular support, but said he feared
cheating or that Hun Sen will not relinquish power.
	   ``I am still worried about what will happen after election
day,'' said Ranariddh. ``Only a government led by me, myself, will
get international support to rebuild this country.''
	   The elections are the first since the United Nations dispatched
20,000 peacekeepers and spent some dlrs 3 billion in 1993 to usher
in a new era of democracy following decades of civil war and the
Khmer Rouge genocide of the late 1970s that caused the deaths of as
many as 2 million people.
	   Ranariddh and his royalist FUNCINPEC party finished first. But
Hun Sen, who came to power in 1985 during the Vietnamese military
occupation that followed the Khmer Rouge, forced his way into a
co-premiership by threatening civil war.
	   Hun Sen permitted Ranariddh to return from post-coup exile to
contest the vote in a bid to win back lost international legitimacy
and aid.
	   But opponents say Hun Sen has ensured he will win through
systematic violence, including murder, intimidation, and packing
the electoral machinery with his supporters.
	   A United Nations report showed that between June 1 and July 15,
Hun Sen's party appeared on state-controlled main news programs
1,364 times, compared to 45 times for Ranariddh's party and 28 for
Sam Rainsy's.
	   A delegation of European Union election observers and
journalists returning from the provincial town of Kompong Cham came
across the body of a motorcycle taxi driver who had been shot in
the head and left at roadside. There was no immediate indication
that the killing was political, but it was a sobering reminder of
Cambodia's rampant violence.
	   The delegation had accompanied the EU's mission chief, Glenys
Kinnock, to Kompong Cham, but she returned to the capital by
helicopter and did not see the body. Kinnock will have the major
say in the EU's judgment over whether the election is credible.
	   The United States has already said it perceives the election as
fundamentally flawed and may issue a separate verdict from the U.N.
mission coordinating 678 foreign observers.
	   Questions still lingered over how many Cambodian observers will
be deployed, and whether they come from Hun Sen-linked groups or
independent watchdog bodies.
	   In contrast to 1993, Cambodians are organizing the election and
foreigners have been invited only to help.
	   The National Election Committee, which is overseeing the
election, said Thursday the election will cost dlrs 34 million,
with at least dlrs 28 million coming from foreign donors. The main
donors are the EU, Japan, Australia and Canada. The United States
is limiting aid to private organizations.
	   Election results are not expected to be announced for a week.

EBRD to loan dlrs 40 million to Kazak bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development said Thursday it has agreed to loan dlrs 40 million
to one of Kazakstan's largest banks, Kazkommertsbank.
	   The agreement gives the EBRD the option to acquire shares in
Kazkommertsbank.
	   ``It is our ultimate goal to be shareholders,'' Ilaria Benucci,
principal banker at EBRD, said at a news conference.
	   The loan will be used to finance medium- and long-term projects
in industry, transportation, construction and services.
	   The EBRD has doubled its investment in the former Soviet
republic in Central Asia over the past nine months to dlrs 700
million, said Martyn Nicholls, EBRD representative in Kazakstan.
	   ``We like the reform program here,'' he said. ``We think the
economy is in a good and stable state.''

Grasshoppers invade Danube Delta destroying fields of crops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of grasshoppers
have invaded the Danube Delta, destroying thousands of acres of
corn and sunflower crops, an agricultural official said Thursday.
	   A swarm of grasshoppers invaded the region last week and high
temperatures have helped them multiply to a density of more than 20
insects per one square meter (yard), said Valeriu Pasca, who heads
the Institute of Plants Protection in the Danube Delta.
	   ``If the grasshoppers are not killed immediately their number
will increase and they will migrate to other regions and destroy
the crops,'' he said.
	   So far, the insects have destroyed 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres)
of crops in the region, located some 275 kilometers (170 miles)
northeast of capital on the edge of the Black Sea, said Pasca.
	   Farmers are using planes to spread insecticide over the affected
areas, but do not have enough chemicals to eliminate the invaders.

Australian PM to skip South Pacific Forum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard has
decided not to attend the South Pacific Forum because of the
imminent release of the government's tax reform policy and a
looming election.
	   Howard will be the first Australian leader in seven years to
miss the regional summit.
	   The forum of leaders from 14 Pacific island states and Australia
and New Zealand is to be held in Pohnpei, the capital of the
Federated States of Micronesia, on Aug. 24-25.
	   But Howard's office said the prime minister had written to
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer asking him to attend instead.
	   ``We are sorry to miss this year's forum but due to pressing
domestic commitments, including work on tax reform in the lead-up
to the general election, that will preclude his attendance,'' a
spokesman for Howard said.
	   The last time an Australian prime minister missed the forum was
in 1991, when Bob Hawke opted not to attend just weeks after Paul
Keating made his first unsuccessful bid to oust him as prime
minister.
	   Keating attended all four forums keld during his term in office,
while Howard attended both of the last two forums.
	   Howard had intended to miss last year's forum in the Cook
Islands but was forced to attend when a Treasury briefing paper
containing highly confidential and embarrassing assessments of
Pacific leaders was accidentally given to a journalist.
	   However, Howard's bid to mend fences at the meeting backfired
when his refusal to support demands by island states for tough
targets on cutting greenhouse gases infuriated other leaders and
almost split the forum.
	   Keating also caused embarrassment at his first forum in the
Solomon Islands in 1992 when he missed the start of the opening
ceremony and offended his hosts because talks with his New Zealand
counterpart Jim Bolger ran over time.

Police order more detentions as cycling drug scandal grows

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The doping scandal overshadowing the Tour de France
grew still further Thursday when investigators summoned officials
from the TVM team and police began questioning cyclists from the
disgraced Festina team.
	   Police in Pamiers ordered TVM's sporting director, doctor and
chief mechanic to answer questions about their role in the possible
use of illegal doping substances, according to judicial sources.
	   TVM, a Dutch team, came under the spotlight earlier this week
when it emerged that the substance EPO had been found in the car of
one of its officials in March.
	   The International Union of Cycling (UCI), the sport's governing
body, asked the Dutch cycling federation to carry out an inquiry
and tour organizers threatened to expel TVM from the race.
	   Judicial sources said Thursday that police found evidence of
used drugs in a suitcase and trashcan during a search of the team's
hotel in Toulouse and Metz, though the nature of the drugs is still
not known.
	   Meanwhile, nine riders from the Festina team thrown out of the
Tour de France for using EPO arrived at a Lyon police station where
they were formally placed under custody for questioning.
	   They included Richard Virenque, Pascal Herve, Didier Rous, Alex
Zulle, Armin Meier and Laurent Dufaux.
	   Earlier in the day, three other officials at the Festina team
were detained for questioning the first time, according to judicial
sources.
	   They included the team's two joint sporting directors, Miguel
Moreno and Michel Gros, and logistical director Joel Sabiron.
France 2 television reported Moreno and Gros were formally detained
for questioning.
	   Festina team director Bruno Roussel, doctor Eric Ryckaert and
physiotherapist Willy Voet are already being detained by police
investigating the scandal.
	   The already tarnished image of the Tour was damaged yet further
Thursday when the French newspaper Le Parisien reported that the
Belgian judge investigating the Festina case has proof that the
team's riders took EPO.
	   Belgian judge Eric Van de Sijpe has coded medical records and
computer files proving that the drug was supplied to team riders,
Le Parisien said.
	   The code name ``Willy'' appeared in many of the computer files,
but until the arrest of Voet on July 8, the judge was unable to
trace the person's identity.
	   The president of the French Cycling Association, Daniel Baal,
reacted to the growing scandals by saying that although they risk
being very harmful to the image of the sport, ``good will come out
of bad.''
	   ``Once we know about these methods,'' he told French television
station LCI, ``we will know how to prevent it. We can start a real
war against doping.''

Finance minister: High interest rates to stay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim said Thursday his relatively tight monetary policy would
stay put, but the government would consider the impact of high
interest rates on businesses.
	   ``Therefore, our intention is that while we recognize the need
to continue with the tight monetary policy, we must ensure that
interest rates are not prohibitive and will not discourage vibrant
businesses,'' Anwar told reporters.
	   Anwar said the cut in the amount of deposits commercial banks
keep at the central bank has allowed the banks to reduce lending
rates, but overall, the tight monetary policy must stay to contain
inflation.
	   Malaysia has been trying to balance the dangers of capital
flight that could be caused by lower interest rates with the
interests of local businesses, which are complaining about the high
cost of borrowing.
	   ``We're gradually reducing interest rates,'' he said, in
reference to domestic lending rates currently around 15 percent.
	   The government has also been trying to goad banks into lowering
interest rates and relaxing curbs on lending. But few of the banks,
already burdened by non-performing loans, have complied.

MiG-29 fighter jet crashes, killing pilot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Hungarian Air Force MiG-29 fighter
jet crashed Thursday during a training flight, killing the pilot,
said a Defense Ministry spokesman.
	   ``The accident occurred ... during a maneuver close to the
ground,'' said Lt. Col. Jozsef Stummer by telephone. ``The pilot
did not have time to eject.''
	   No further information on the pilot, training for an annual
international air show, was immediately available.
	   The jet went down near the Kecskemet military airfield, 120
kilometers (70 miles) southeast of Budapest. It crashed in a nearby
field, starting an extensive fire which destroyed numerous bales of
wheat, according to the MTI news agency.
	   The single-seat MiG-29 was one of 28 fighter planes that Hungary
acquired from Russia in 1993 as compensation for an outstanding
debt and the first one to crash in Hungary. The Russian-made
aircraft is highly maneuverable and is considered on par with
Western equivalents.

American plans 11 more days of coasting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Now that he's broken his own record on
a roller coaster and seen off a Candian challenger, Richard
Rodriguez has decided to keep on riding _ for 11 more days.
	   Rodriguez broke his own record of 549 hours more than a week ago
but stayed on the Big Dipper at Blackpool's Pleasure Beach to stay
ahead of Canadian Normand St. Pierre. St. Pierre gave up Wednesday
at the La Ronde Park in Montreal but Rodriguez kept on coasting.
	   ``I was thinking about going on and 1,000 hours seemed like a
good threshold to go for,'' Rodriguez said Thursday.
	   Rodriguez follows the strict guidelines imposed by the
``Guinness Book of Records'' before it stopped tracking the roller
coaster competition several years ago. He has to stay on board the
two minute 30 second ride for 22 hours a day, with a five minute
break every hour. And he has endursed appalling weather.
	   ``It's been so wet and windy, it has made it that much more
difficult. But I was never going to give up, it means too much for
me,'' said Rodriguez, who lectures in communications at Miami
University in Coral Gables, Fla.
	   Rodriguez, a diabetic, is donating sponsorship funds to diabetes
research.

Tribunal staff, procedures not to blame for suicide in custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; Recasts throughout; ADDS new quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Concerned about his depressed
state, U.N. guards kept Serb war crimes suspect Slavko Dokmanovic
under close watch, checking his cell every 30 minutes. It still
wasn't enough.
	   Racked by depression and groundless fears for his family's
safety, Dokmanovic, 48, hung himself in his Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal cell June 29.
	   An internal investigation into the U.N. court's first death in
custody published Thursday concluded that neither guards nor
detention procedures were to blame for the death.
	   ``All the rules of detention had been observed and no negligent
behavior on anyone's part was identified,'' tribunal spokesman
Christian Chartier said.
	   Dokmanovic hung himself with a tie knotted around the top hinge
of a wardrobe in his cell just after midnight on June 29.
	   Earlier the same evening he had twice tried to take his own
life, first slashing his arm with a razor blade and then trying to
hang himself.
	   Guards checking his condition every half hour because of fears
about his mental health failed to notice the suicide bids. They
only came to light after Dokmanovic's lifeless body was examined.
	   The half-hourly checks, which consisted of a guard looking
through a small window in Dokmanovic's cell door, were ``one of the
highest levels of supervision'' at the tribunal's disposal,
Chartier said.
	   Examinations of Dokmanovic by a Belgrade psychiatrist shortly
after his June 1997 arrest identified Dokmanovic as suffering from
depression.
	   He was placed under round-the-clock observation including
installing a closed circuit television camera in his cell. The
camera was removed in December after the psychiatrist said that
Dokmanovic's mental condition no longer merited such observation.
	   The day before his suicide, Dokmanovic talked to a medical
officer at the tribunal detention unit after a sleepless night.
	   ``He talked about his fears of his family being murdered,''
Chartier said. ``His fears of the U.N. arresting his family and a
possible suicidal tendency. He recognized that none of this was
realistic.''
	   Dokmanovic's Belgrade lawyer, Toma Fila, claims he warned the
tribunal in a fax days before his client's death that Dokmanovic
was possibly suicidal.
	   But in two phone calls to his wife made hours before his death,
Dokmanovic did not mention suicidal feelings, Chartier said.
	   Dokmanovic's trial had ended days before his suicide. He had
pleaded innocent to playing a key role in the November 1991
massacre of 200 Croats and non-Serbs near the eastern Croatian city
of Vukovar.
	   The case was closed following Dokmanovic's death.
	   Dokmanovic was one of 27 suspects in tribunal custody. The court
has publicly indicted 60 people for alleged atrocities in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   The court took custody of two more Serbs Thursday but had to
free them almost immediately after it was discovered that NATO
forces trying to arrest twin brothers accused of 1992 atrocities in
eastern Bosnia had grabbed the wrong twins.
	   The Dokmanovic investigation, conducted by tribunal judge Almiro
Rodrigues, recommended establishing a working group to investigate
suicides in custody. If necessary, the group will recommend
possible changes to the tribunal's procedures.
	   The tribunal ``wants to ensure that all lessons are taken from
this tragic event,'' Chartier said.

UEFA asks national bodies to state positions on breakaway league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ European soccer's governing body said
Thursday it has asked its member associations and national leagues
to officially state their positions on a breakaway Super League.
	   In a statement, UEFA stressed ``its readiness and capacity to
further develop the existing European club competitions.''
	   On Sunday, the owners of several of Europe's top soccer clubs
reportedly met in secret with a view to forming their own breakaway
Super League in the 2000-2001 season.
	   According to reports in Germany and England, the main movers
behind the idea were powerhouses AC and Inter Milan, Juventus, Real
Madrid, FC Barcelona, Paris St. Germain, Ajax Amsterdam, Manchester
United and Bayern Munich.
	   The idea of a Super League, which would effectively undermine
UEFA's own competitions, has been around for two decades.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``expressed its surprise that this
matter has remained unnoticed by the national associations and
leagues concerned.''
	   UEFA said it is willing to develop its competitions ``in
accordance with the wishes and needs of all components within the
structure of European football'' to satisfy both the grass-roots
and the elite.
	   Aware of what damage it would do to the Champions Cup, UEFA has
already taken steps to try and stop a Super League taking shape.
	   Four seasons ago it changed the format to bring in a group
structure at the mid-point of the competition and changed the name
of the tournament to Champions League.
	   To make it more attractive to the big clubs, UEFA then altered
the rules so that runners up in the high profile leagues also would
take part. That opened up the prospect of the Champions Cup being
won by a team that wasn't a champion.
	   The latest move is to change the league format from six groups
of four to four groups of six to ensure even more matches and make
it even more of a league structure.

10,000 displaced as floating islands block flow of White Nile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ten thousand people have been forced to
flee their homes in central Uganda because of flooding caused by
floating islands blocking the northward flow of the White Nile,
U.N. officials said Thursday.
	   Known as ``sudd'' _ the Arabic word for barrier _ the islands
are made up masses of waterlogged vegetation that attached
themselves to lake beds over time.
	   But 12 of the ``sudd'' were washed down river from Lakes Kwania
and Kyoga during heavy rains caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
	   They have blocked the river's normal flow at a confluence 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of Kampala, causing the Nile to
overflow and flood villages along its banks, said Apollo Lawoko,
assistance program officer for the U.N. World Food Porgram.
	   U.N. officials say they are cooperating with Ugandan officials
to check the disaster caused by the floods and find ways of
eliminating the islands, possibly by blowing them up.
	   The world's longest river, the Nile is formed by the White Nile,
which rises in Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, which rises in
Lake Tana in Ethiopia. They join at Khartoum, Sudan.
	   News reports said a technical team from Egypt had arrived in
Uganda to assess the extent of the blockage.
	   Egyptian diplomat Amr el Elhenawa told The Associated Press the
blockage is wasting Nile waters that would otherwise flow to Egypt,
but he did not yet know the results of the team's survey.
	   Earlier this week, U.N. and government officials flew over the
area to assess the damage.
	   Lawoko said U.N. agencies are discussing with the government the
possibility of using explosives to blow up the 12 islands.
	   ``We do not know the consequences of blowing it up. All
repercussions are being explored. We are talking to the army,
engineers and technicians. We are involving all those,'' he said.

Marcos family willing to negotiate sharing his wealth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The family of the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos is willing to open a new round of talks on sharing
his dlrs 540 million Swiss bank deposits with the government, his
daughter said Thursday.
	   ``I hope we can start the talks so that we can put an end to
this Marcos issue,'' Imee Marcos-Manotoc told reporters.
	   She declined to say whether her family is willing to use part of
the money to pay damages to 9,539 victims of human rights
violations during the Marcos administration who won a class action
suit against his estate and are claiming the deposits.
	   The government of President Joseph Estrada is inclined to favor
an out-of-court settlement with the Marcoses because years of legal
battles to recover their alleged ill-gotten wealth have yielded
little, according to presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora.
	   ``Settlement talks with the present administration are very
welcome and in fact we're willing to cooperate in any way just to
settle the whole issue,'' said Mrs. Manotoc, who is now a member of
the House of Representatives.
	   Zamora said the government will not settle for less than 75
percent of the Swiss accounts.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986 and died
three years later in exile in Hawaii.
	   His Swiss deposits, frozen for the past 12 years, have been
transferred to an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   The money can be released to the Philippine government if it
wins a criminal conviction of Marcos' widow, Imelda, in connection
with the funds. It also can acquire the funds through an
out-of-court settlement with the Marcos family.
	   The Presidential Commission on Good Government, which is in
charge of recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth, negotiated a
75-25 division of the Marcos wealth in 1993 in favor of the
government.
	   In exchange, the Marcoses were to be granted immunity from
future suits.
	   But the agreement fell through because the Marcoses failed to
provide a list of all their assets, according to the government.
	   Mrs. Manotoc, however, said, ``We have disclosed as much as we
know.''

its bid to enter the World Trade Organization, officials said.
	   With the agreement, Taiwan has completed bilateral talks with
all who wanted negotiations over its bid to join the world trade
body.
	   Officials said they hope completion of the talks will allow
Taiwan to join the WTO early next year. But much depends on China's
attitude, because China has said Taiwan must not be admitted ahead
of it.
	   A preliminary agreement was signed in Brussels after Taiwan
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang concluded talks with officials
representing the European Union, the Economics Ministry said in a
statement.
	   Taiwan has agreed to cut car import tariffs gradually from the
current 30 percent to 17.5 percent by 2008, the statement said.
	   Taiwan also has agreed to import up to 159,220 cars from Europe
the first year after it enters the WTO, and increase the quota by
20 percent each year after that.

Tourist arrivals in Thailand up 10.5 percent in April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Tourist arrivals in Thailand in April
rose 10.5 percent from a year earlier, the largest increase for any
April in a decade, the Tourism Authority of Thailand said Thursday.
	   Thailand is in the midst of a tourism promotion campaign, called
Amazing Thailand, intended to attract more tourists and revitalize
the industry. The campaign runs from 1998-99.
	   The TAT called the increase ``stunning'' considering that April,
the hottest month of the year in Thailand, is usually the beginning
of the low season for tourism.
	   Tourist arrivals from Europe increased by more than 32 percent,
offsetting a decline in tourist arrivals from East Asia.

South Africa 179 for four at tea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Test debutant Andrew Flintoff
provided a vital breakthrough before tea just as South Africa
threatened to wrest the initiative from England in the fourth
cricket test on Thursday.
	   Flintoff, the 20-year-old all-rounder, had Jacques Kallis caught
behind for 47 and ended a threatening fourth wicket stand and South
Africa went to tea at 179 for four at Trent Bridge.
	   Hansie Cronje, with an unbeaten 51, and the inform Jonty Rhodes
(18 not out) batted out 29 minutes together adding a further 32
runs for the fifth wicket.
	   After South Africa had been sent into bat, Darren Gough removed
both openers _ Gary Kirsten and Gehardus Liebenberg _ in successive
overs and soon after lunch Angus Fraser had Daryll Cullinan caught.
	   The pair scored 79 for the fourth wicket after coming together
at 68 for three in the second over after lunch when Cullinan (30)
flicked a catch to Mark Ramprakash at square leg.
	   The hopes of ending the fourth wicket stand with Ian Salisbury
only backfired on England, as Cronje and Kallis slogged the leg
spinner to all corners of Trent Bridge.
	   Cronje, undoubtedly one of the best players of spin bowling,
hammered Salisbury for a six _ just one of the six boundaries taken
of Salisbury's bowling in the session.
	   Salisbury, who replaced Robert Croft in the England line-up in a
bid to spark a change in the team's fortunes, has been hit out of
the attack _ conceding 41 runs in seven overs.
	   Flintoff could have added the prized wicket of Cronje had Mark
Butcher, fielding at cover point, moved swiftly to intercept an
ill-directed cut shot. Instead, Butcher flung his left hand out and
managed to get his finger tips to it with Cronje on 44.
	   Cronje, fresh from a fine 195 against Derbyshire in his latest
first-class outing, went on to complete his third half century in
as many innings in the current series.
	   He scored 81 at Lord's and an unbeaten 69 in Old Trafford after
he managed just one in the first test at Birmingham.
	   In an overcast morning, Gough (2-39), fully vindicated Alec
Stewart's decision to send South Africa into bat by claiming
wickets in his fourth and fifth overs.
	   Liebenberg's poor run with the bat continued as he edged a drive
to Stewart and in his next over forced veteran opener Gary Kirsten
to play on.
	   South Africa, resumed on 67 for two after lunch, and in the
second over lost Cullinan to Fraser.
	   Cullinan, who hit three fours in his 63-minute stay, failed to
add to his lunch score.

US and Latin Americans may ask WTO to break banana deadlock
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and updates to include U.S. reaction; CHANGES
overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States and Latin American banana
producers said Thursday they may ask the World Trade Organization
to help break a deadlock reached with the European Union over its
controversial banana import regime.
	   On Thursday, the European Union told the WTO that changes it is
making to its policy will bring it into line with the world trade
body's rules.
	   But the United States and Latin Americans argue that, even with
the changes, the regime will still favor traditional EU banana
suppliers in Africa and the Caribbean.
	   They say they may request a WTO dispute settlement panel to be
reconvened to determine whether the changes to the EU's policy
allow it to comply.
	   A previous WTO dispute panel ruling judged the EU's policy to be
out of line after the United States, Honduras, Panama, Mexico and
Ecuador and Guatemala complained that European import rules
discriminate against them via a complex system of tariffs, quotas
and import licenses.
	   They claimed the EU regime was costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   ``We still consider the measures taken by the (EU) to be
primarily cosmetic,'' said a statement from the United States, and
others, read to a meeting of the WTO in Geneva.
	   A U.S. trade official said that, if the European Union doesn't
satisfy their demands by January 1, 1999 - the time limit set for
the EU by an arbitrator to bring the rules into line - they may
take retaliatory trade measures.
	   EU officials said they are prepared to defend the new regime.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said.
	   The EU's problem has been to figure out how to have a single
market for bananas, comply with WTO obligations and also respect
the Lome agreement, a pact which commits it to favorable treating
imports from a large group of developing countries, including
colonies and ex-colonies of European countries.

Rios and Becker to face each other in quarterfinals of Mercedes
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios made it look easy, while
Boris Becker struggled and cursed, but both claimed victories
Thursday at the Mercedes Cup.
	   Now the two former world no. 1's will face each other in
Friday's quarterfinals at the dlrs 1.04 million event, with each
having something at stake.
	   Rios, who would vault past Pete Sampras to the top spot on the
ATP computer if he reaches the final, proved too steady for
Germany's Hendrik Dreekman in a 6-3, 6-4 win.
	   Becker, still looking for that elusive first clay court title of
his long career, needed two hours, 8 minutes and several outbursts
of temper to oust Spain's Felix Mantilla, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   The 30-year-old German complained bitterly to the umpire about
being disturbed by Mantilla's loud grunts, which came long after
the Spaniard had hit the ball.
	   But Becker, despite struggling with his serve and temper, also
saved his best tennis against the world No. 14 for the crucial end
of both sets.
	   In the match's most spectacular exchange, Becker and Mantilla
traded drop shots and lightning volleys at the net before the
German emerged with a 5-1 lead in the first set tie break.
	   Becker needed a net roller to gain a 6-5 break in the second
set, but had put himself in position for the crucial point by
rifling several forehand winners.
	   With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104 F) courtside,
Rios jumped on the 23-year-old Dreekmann's mistakes and was never
really challenged.
	   Dreekmann lone chance to turn around the match against the
world's second-ranked player disappeared when he failed to gain a
break while trailing at 3-4 in the final set.
	   Rios and Becker faced each other just two weeks ago at the Swiss
Open, with the German claiming the semifinal match in straight
sets.
	   Becker beat Rios two weeks ago in the semifinals of the Swiss
Open, kindling his hopes of finally claiming a clay court title
before his career winds down.
	   But he was beaten by Corretja in the final _ the sixth time he
has come up short in a final on clay.
	   Becker, a former world No. 1, has 49 career titles. He was a
semifinalist twice at the French Open.
	   Upsets have already thinned the number of seeds at the
tournament, with defending champion Alex Corretja of Spain and
Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov among the upset victims.
	   But on the other side of the draw from the two former world No.
1's is the French Open champion, Carlos Moya. The second seed is
scheduled to play later Thursday.

	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Serie A club Fiorentina has shipped
veteran defender Michele Serena to Spain's Atletico Madrid, the

	   Serena will report to Atletico Madrid, coached by former Italian
national team boss Arrigo Sacchi, by the weekend. The player signed
a four-year deal for 2 billion lire (dlrs 1.2 million) per season
with Atletico, which paid Fiorentina about 15 billion lire (dlrs 9
million), ANSA said.
	   The 28-year-old leaves Fiorentina after three seasons. He has
also played for Juventus of Turin, Verona and Sampdoria of Genoa in
Italy's first division.

Nine Russian peacekeepers wounded in breakaway Georgian province

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Nine Russian peacekeepers were wounded
when a radio-activated mine blew up their truck in Georgia's
separatist region of Abkhazia, an official said Thursday.
	   The attack took place Wednesday night outside the village of
Khumeni, where Russian peacekeepers are stationed, said Interior
Ministry spokesman Murad Andzhaparadze. Five Russian soldiers were
killed July 11 in a similar incident.
	   Russian military spokesman Alexei Vlasov blamed the attack on
``gunmen waging an undeclared war in the zone controlled by Russian
peacekeepers,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He did not name any group specifically, but his remarks appeared
to be a reference to militias loyal to Georgia's central
government. They have been blamed for a number of previous attacks
against Russian peacekeepers and rebels in Abkhazia.
	   The Russian Defense Ministry also released a statement saying
the attack was ``aimed at destabilizing the situation in the
region.'' The ministry will ``take appropriate measures to deal
with terrorist groups'' in the regions controlled by peacekeepers,
according to Interfax.
	   Andzhaparadze, the Georgian official, blamed Abkhazian
separatists.
	   ``The region is controlled now by peacekeepers and Abkhazian
fighters. Abkhazian fighters plant mines and it is not the first
time that peacekeepers and the population have suffered from
this,'' he said.
	   Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war between Georgian
government troops and Abkhazian separatists. The peacekeepers have
helped prevent a resumption of full-scale fighting, but occasional
clashes still occur.
	   More than 60 Russian peacekeepers have been killed in the region
since 1994.
	   Also Thursday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
discussed the conflict with Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Talbott told reporters the U.S. government backs Georgia's
attempt to achieve ``independence, democracy, and peace'' in the
region.
	   In another development, Georgian officials identified a man
suspected of killing a Polish United Nations worker in the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, Interfax said, citing the Interior Ministry.
	   The 20-year-old suspect, Zurab Bregvadze, allegedly shot Maria
Magdalena Wewiorska at point-blank range four times in the head as
she returned to her apartment last week. Georgian police are still
searching for Bregvadze, Interfax said.

Angry Bosnian Serb mob forces postponement of to Muslim's funeral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An angry Bosnian Serb
crowd gathered Thursday at the site of a mosque blown up during the
war to protest the funeral of Banja Luka's Muslim spiritual leader.
	   Mufti Ibrahim Halilovic died Monday and a funeral procession and
traditional Muslim burial ceremony were requested by the Islamic
community of Banja Luka, the largest city in the Serb half of
Bosnia.
	   Banja Luka authorities refused permission for the funeral at the
site of the Ferhadija mosque, which Serbs blew up in a rampage of
ethnic hatred during the war.
	   About 1,000 ultranationalist Bosnian Serbs gathered Thursday at
the mosque's site, shouting anti-Muslim slogans and chanting: ``We
won't give up Serb land.''
	   The crowd dispersed after several hours, since no funeral
procession appeared and after police forced organizers to take down
loudspeakers.
	   Crowd members, however, smashed two cameras and hit a Serb
journalist, mistakenly believing that the equipment and reporter
were with television stations from the Muslim-Croat half of the
country.
	   The mufti's funeral will take place Friday in Sarajevo, Bosnia's
capital, said Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency.

Tudjman orders review of bill granting politicians pay hikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman ordered the
government on Thursday to scrap a recently approved measure to
considerably increases his own salary and grant lawmakers a 300
percent raise.
	   The measure, part of a bill passed earlier this month by
parliament, outraged Croats who suffer increasing economic
hardships on an average monthly wage of dlrs 400 (one dollar  &QC;  6.5
Croat Kuna).
	   In a statement from Tudjman's vacation resort in Brioni in the
northern Adriatic, the president demanded the government not
implement the bill until it is revised in the next parliament
session, in September.
	   The bill was to increase the wage of a parliamentary deputy from
dlrs 1,000 per month to dlrs 3,125 per month.
	   Tudjman's net monthly salary would have reached dlrs 7,800. He
hasn't disclosed his current salary.
	   The bill came a few days after the government, which is
dominated by Tudjman's party, refused teachers' demands for a 12
per cent pay hike and nixed an increase in pension payments which
now average dlrs 200 per month.
	   Under the measure, Tudjman's annual gross salary would be nearly
twice that of his counterpart in the Czech Republic and more than
four times that of Hungary's president.

Pakistan Embassy says Swiss handed over 766 pages in Bhutto case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss officials handed over 766 pages
of documents to the Pakistan government after indicting the husband
of former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto on money-laundering
charges, officials said Thursday.
	   The Pakistan Embassy said the documents related to the
money-laundering charges filed last week against Asif Ali Zardari
by Geneva Judge Daniel Devaud, who has been investigating
allegations against him, Ms. Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto.
	   Devaud has said he is checking Ms. Bhutto's ability to invoke
diplomatic or parliamentary immunity before deciding whether to
indict her as well.
	   The documents, given to the embassy by federal police this week,
included a covering letter from Devaud, an embassy statement said.
The embassy is passing them to Pakistani courts handling cases
against Ms. Bhutto and her family.
	   The Pakistan government maintains kickbacks from Pakistani
government contracts flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   Last month Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens _ two who were
executives of companies that did business with Pakistan and a
lawyer who served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in Switzerland.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule, which she claims are concocted by political opponents.
Zardari was widely blamed for her downfall.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family frozen in seven Geneva banks.

 &UR; Violence stirring in Russia's borderlands &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's fringes have long been rough, ragged
regions, but recently they appear to be fraying faster than usual.
	   A series of clashes and killings in recent days has underscored
the fact that the former Soviet Union remains troubled by deep,
volatile conflicts.
	   Some politicians, including likely presidential candidate
Alexander Lebed, have warned that unrest in Chechnya or other
regions could flare into open warfare and spread into other areas.
	   ``Some people think: Let the Chechens fight it out and
everything will be fine,'' Lebed said this week, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``It would not be fine. Everybody would
fight.''
	   Others see the upsurge as part of a regular cycle of violence in
these regions, where ethnic groups and historical grievances have
long been on a slow boil.
	   Here are some of the regions that are experiencing increased
violence.
 &UR; CHECHNYA
	   Chechnya's president narrowly escaped a car bomb attack Thursday
that gutted his car and killed a bodyguard.
	   The attack comes amid growing tensions between the government's
secular leaders and Islamic fundamentalists, who would like to rule
the southern Russian republic according to Islamic law.
	   Internecine conflicts have contributed to the republic's
lawlessness since the end of its war of secession against Russia
two years ago. Since then, Chechnya has largely governed itself
even though no country recognizes it as independent.
 &UR; DAGESTAN
	   Dagestan borders Chechnya and has been troubled by spillover
violence as well as its own conflicts.
	   On Wednesday, unidentified attackers fired grenades at the
offices of the mayor of Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala. Mayor Said
Amirov was not hurt in what he said was the seventh attempt on his
life, one of which left him partly paralyzed.
	   In May, gunmen loyal to the leader of a local Muslim ethnic
group, the Laks, stormed a government building, starting gunbattles
that killed two police officers. Wahhabis in Dagestan have also had
standoffs with police who have tried to disarm them.
 &UR; GEORGIA
	   Georgia's northern region of Abkhazia has been fighting a war of
succession since 1992. Although Russian peacekeepers have been
deployed in the region since 1994, clashes between separatists and
pro-Georgian forces are frequent.
	   Nine Russian peacekeepers were injured Wednesday when their
truck struck a radio-activated mine. Five Russian soldiers were
killed July 11 in a similar incident.
	   Georgia has accused Russian peacekeepers of being too
sympathetic to the separatists, and has suggested they may not
renew their mandate when it comes up for renewal at the end of the
month. Peace talks are stalled.
 &UR; TAJIKISTAN
	   Tajikistan's government and mostly Muslim opponents ended their
five-year civil war with a peace deal last year, but clashes
continue.
	   Four members of a U.N. observer mission were ambushed, shot and
killed on Monday. The president blamed forces trying to undermine
the peace agreement.
	   Various warlords continue to battle among themselves, and 15
people were killed in such a fight earlier this month. Clashes also
continue between government troops and remnants of the rebel
forces, and one battle in late April left at least 45 dead.

Mexico's foreign trade deficit increased in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's foreign trade deficit reached dlrs
530 million in June, up from dlrs 313 million in May and dlrs 308
million in June 1997.
	   The Treasury Department reported Wednesday that exports for June
totaled dlrs 10.3 billion, up 9.8 percent from the like 1997 month,
while imports in June grew 18.9 percent to dlrs 10.8 billion.
	   Contributing to the deficit in June were lower oil prices and
crude oil export volumes and reduced agricultural exports due to
drought, as well as increased imports of grain and consumer goods
such as cars and gasoline.
	   Exports of manufactured goods totaled dlrs 9.335 billion in
June, up 13.4 percent over June 1997.
	   Oil exports totaled dlrs 588 million, down dlrs 78 million from
May. The average price of Mexico export crude was dlrs 10.01 per
barrel, compared to dlrs 10.79 in May.
	   Agricultural exports of dlrs 340 million were up 29.6 percent
from June 1997 but down dlrs 47 million from May. Mining exports
reached dlrs 38 million, up 3.1 percent from June 1997.
	   Manufactured products accounted for 90.6 percent of the total,
up from 88.8 percent in May. Petroleum products accounted for 5.7
percent, agricultural goods for 3.3 percent and mining products for
0.4 percent of the total exports in June.
	   Import growth slowed to 15.9 percent in the second quarter of
the year, compared to 27.4 percent in the first quarter.
	   Consumer goods accounted for 8.4 percent of imports in June,
intermediate goods for 77.4 percent and capital goods for 14.2
percent.

German opposition's economics designate would cut subsidies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede BONN &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from Schroeder, union leader,
government spokesman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, the front runner in Germany's
election campaign, sought Thursday to placate labor unions angered
by tough free-market talk from his shadow economics minister.
	   Speaking at a German-British economics conference in Berlin, the
Social Democrats' chancellor candidate renewed his proposal for
talks between government, business and labor to try to agree on
ways to combat unemployment.
	   Unions have complained that Schroeder's pick for economics
minister is not committed enough to that idea, which they strongly
support.
	   Union representatives renewed their criticism Thursday of Jost
Stollmann, a businessman with no party affiliation, following his
published comments that he would seek faster subsidy cuts for old
industries such as coal.
	   Hubertus Schmoldt, head of the mining union IG Bergbau, said
Stollmann did not have enough knowledge of the energy industry to
talk about coal subsidies.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman, Otto Hauser, also lashed out
at Stollmann and said the government remained committed to a plan
agreed last year for continued coal subsidies.
	   Schroeder's approach was to back both Stollmann and his
``Alliance for Work'' proposal to create jobs.
	   ``I stand behind Mr. Stollmann without any reservations. I
expect the people that work with me to formulate, not mine, but
their own thoughts,'' Schroeder said, who leads Kohl in opinion
polls ahead of the Sept. 27 elections.
	   After becoming the party's chancellor candidate, Schroeder has
tried to push the Social Democrats in a pro-market direction. The
result has been a balance between Schroeder's centrist approach and
the party's left-leaning traditions.
	   Stollmann goes further than Schroeder.
	   The 43-year-old software company founder told the Rheinische
Post that he disagreed with the party platform's call for continued
government aid to households with children even if the family earns
well, saying that is ``nonsense.''
	   ``My family donates that money to charity,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cruises, concerts, even a trip to the
circus! You never know what might sway a U.N. delegate.
	   In the fall, the General Assembly will pick five new countries
to be represented on the 15-member Security Council, the most
important decision-making body at the United Nations. They will
replace Kenya, Portugal, Sweden, Costa Rica and Japan, all of which
are winding up two-year stints.
	   The battle this year is fiercest within the regional group that
encompasses Western Europe and North America. The group has two
seats to fill but three candidates: Canada, the Netherlands and
Greece.
	   The other three seats were expected to go to the single
candidates put forth by other regional groups: Malaysia
representing Asia, Namibia for Africa and Argentina for Latin
America.
	   The campaign for the contested seats, which are nonpermanent
positions on the council, attracted attention after Greece invited
U.N. delegates for a weeklong visit that some diplomats here have
dubbed a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes.
	   Greece's U.N. ambassador, Christos Zacharakis, denied the trip
was related to Greece's council bid. He said it was intended to
promote an ``Olympic Truce'' under which warring nations would stop
fighting during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
	   Greece isn't the only one wining and dining delegates.
	   The Netherlands organized a moonlit cruise down the East River
in New York last month and invited delegates to a performance in
New York of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.
	   Canada also went the cultural route, offering tickets to
Canada's biggest attraction in New York this summer, the
Fellini-esque rock 'n' roll circus Cirque du Soleil.
	   There are 10 nonpermanent seats on the council and five
permanent ones: the United States, Britain, China, France and
Russia. Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats come up for
election to a two-year term.
	   Despite the fun and games, the campaign for one of the two
available seats is serious. Ambassadors, foreign ministers and even
heads of state get involved in lobbying.
	   Canada plays a significant role in peace and security around the
world, and contributes to U.N. development, human rights, social,
economic and environmental programs, said Andras Vamos-Goldman, a
political affairs official in the Canadian mission. Since the early
1960s, Canada has given dlrs 30 billion in overseas development
assistance, he said.
	   The Netherlands also touts its contributions to peacekeeping and
development, citing its ranking as the second-largest donor for
development initiatives such as the World Food Program and UNICEF.
``We think we've got a good track record for all the things the
U.N. stands for,'' said spokesman Rob Zaagman.
	   Greece outlined its pitch in the latest issue of Thesis, a
quarterly journal from the Foreign Affairs Ministry. It cited its
participation in U.N. peacekeeping missions and its concern about
disarmament, the environment and human rights.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, the last one being
1983-84.

Chilean striker ready to fight for place on Inter's lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Chilean veteran striker Ivan Zamorano said
Thursday that he was prepared to fight off tough competition to
earn a starting place on Inter Milan's lineup next season.
	   ``I know there are many good forwards on Inter's roster ... but
I'm not afraid of the competition ... the coach (Gigi Simoni) knows
we can always rely on this old warrior,'' Zamorano said.
	   The Chilean striker made his remarks after undergoing medical
tests in Milan, before joining his Inter teammates in the Aosta
valley, where the Milan team is preparing for the next Serie A
campaign which starts on Sept. 13.
	   Zamorano, who scored decisive goals for Inter last season even
though he was being rotated with other international forwards,
welcomed the arrival at Inter of Italian veteran star Roberto
Baggio.
	   ``With Baggio we can only improve our chances to win the
(league) title and do well in the Champions League,'' Zamorano
said.
	   Newly-signed Baggio became part of Inter's stellar forward line
including Zamorano, Brazilian star Ronaldo, Uruguayan Alvaro
Recoba, Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu and Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff.
	   About Ronaldo, Zamorano said he suffered a lot from the rivalry
inside the Brazilian national team.
	   ``I know him, he's a child, he does not want to be a star. I
think Brazil lost (the World Cup final to France) because it's a
team with too many individual talents and little teamwork,'' he
said.
	   Zamorano added he was looking forward to next season's duel with
his long-time friend and national team partner Marcelo Salas who
joined Lazio of Rome.
	   ``Lazio will be one of the toughest title contenders, with Salas
leading its offense. However I think Inter still is a better, more
motivated team.''

FIFA, UEFA warn Polish government, federation to solve dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final grafs with letter from Polish sports
minister, EDITS to trim. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Polish sides could be barred from
international competitions unless the national soccer federation
and the government solve their current difficulties by Aug. 7, FIFA
and UEFA said Thursday.
	   The international soccer bodies sent a joint delegation to
Warsaw earlier this week to mediate between the federation and the
country's sports ministry.
	   In May, Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended 22 Polish Soccer
Federation administrators because they refused to submit to a probe
of mismanagement accusations.
	   Ministry spokesman Pawel Krzykowski said then authorities were
trying to free Polish soccer from ``an atmosphere of scandal, of
mismanagement, of unclear associations.''
	   Soccer officials argue the government had no right to suspend
the administrators.
	   During a three-day visit to Poland, UEFA and FIFA
representatives ``specified a plan of action taking into account
(the sides') basic interests and aiming to restore dialogue between
them,'' the bodies said in a joint statement.
	   No details were given of the plan's contents. However, UEFA and
FIFA said that, while the Polish Soccer Federation accepted it
without reservation, the sports minister ``set out some conditions
contrary to the statutory provisions of FIFA and UEFA.''
	   The Polish government argues that an investigation should take
place before the soccer officials are reinstated.
	   FIFA and UEFA were ``obliged to request'' that the suspensions
``and the consecutive decisions are lifted as soon as possible,''
by Aug. 7 at the latest.
	   Failure to do so could result in the Polish federation being
immediately and indefinitely suspended by both international
bodies, the joint statement said.
	   Poland's national and club sides would be barred from
international competitions if the federation is suspended.
	   In a letter to the presidents of FIFA and UEFA published by
Poland's PAP news agency, Debski said the government is acting
according to Polish law.
	   In blocking an investigation, the soccer federation is
``opposing Polish law and shows a complete lack of willingness to
compromise,'' Debski wrote.
	   Poland will seek ``a solution through international
arbitration'' if a ban on Polish sides is imposed, he added.

UEFA asks national bodies to state positions on breakaway league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ European soccer's governing body said
Thursday it has asked its member associations and national leagues
to officially state their positions on a breakaway Super League.
	   In a statement, UEFA stressed ``its readiness and capacity to
further develop the existing European club competitions.''
	   On Sunday, the owners of several of Europe's top soccer clubs
reportedly met in secret with a view to forming their own breakaway
Super League in the 2000-2001 season.
	   According to reports in Germany and England, the main movers
behind the idea were powerhouses AC and Inter Milan, Juventus, Real
Madrid, FC Barcelona, Paris St. Germain, Ajax Amsterdam, Manchester
United and Bayern Munich.
	   The idea of a Super League, which would effectively undermine
UEFA's own competitions, has been around for two decades.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``expressed its surprise that this
matter has remained unnoticed by the national associations and
leagues concerned.''
	   UEFA said it is willing to develop its competitions ``in
accordance with the wishes and needs of all components within the
structure of European football'' to satisfy both the grassroots and
the elite.
	   Aware of what damage it would do to the Champions Cup, UEFA has
already taken steps to try and stop a Super League taking shape.
	   Four seasons ago it changed the format to bring in a group
structure at the midpoint of the competition and changed the name
of the tournament to Champions League.
	   To make it more attractive to the big clubs, UEFA then altered
the rules so that runners up in the high profile leagues also would
take part. That opened up the prospect of the Champions Cup being
won by a team that wasn't a champion.
	   The latest move is to change the league format from six groups
of four to four groups of six to ensure even more matches and make
it even more of a league structure.

Government decides to sell state banks to private sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Majority stakes in two state banks
will be offered to private investors for the first time, officials
announced Thursday.
	   The sales were among conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund in exchange for further loans to the economically
struggling country, where attempts to institute a market economy
have been delayed by inefficiency and political bickering.
	   Bogdan Baltazar, director of the Romanian Bank for Development,
told reporters that City Bank of the United States, ABN Amro
Holding NV of the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank of Germany have
expressed an interest in his bank.
	   By the end of the year, the government will offer up to 51
percent to a foreign bank, and another 10 percent might be shared
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
World Bank, he said.
	   Baltazar said that RBD employees could also buy 10 percent of
the shares and the rest of the bank's assets would offered for sale
next year.
	   A 45-percent share of Banc Post, the other state bank, will
initially be offered for sale, said Elena Petculescu, that bank's
president.

development initiatives such as the World Food Program and UNICEF.
``We think we've got a good track record for all the things the
U.N. stands for,'' said spokesman Rob Zaagman.
	   Greece outlined its pitch in the latest issue of Thesis, a
quarterly journal from the Foreign Affairs Ministry. It cited its
participation in U.N. peacekeeping missions and its concern about
disarmament, the environment and human rights.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, the last one being
1983-84.

Vatican tightens rules for bishops' conferences
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has tightened control of
national bishops' organizations, setting down new rules Thursday
that may make it difficult for them to intervene on doctrinal
issues without the consent of the Vatican.
	   Through the years, national bishops' conferences, an outgrowth
of the Second Vatican Council reforms of the 1960s, and their
committees have issued pronouncements on a wide range of doctrinal
and social issues. Some have drawn Vatican opposition.
	   From now on, bishops' conferences must give unanimous support to
doctrinal declarations or else receive approval from the Vatican,
``which will not give it if the majority requesting it is not
substantial,'' the pope wrote.
	   The requirement for unanimity may effectively hamstring the
conferences in countries with large numbers of bishops such as the
United States, Brazil and Italy. There are nearly 300 active U.S.
bishops.
	   However, Bishop Anthony M. Pilla, president of the U.S. National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said he welcomed the pope's letter
because it clarified a situation under discussion for some years.
	   The pope made it clear that actions by national bishops'
conferences must be in line with the Vatican's position when
dealing with ``new questions posed by the accelerated social and
cultural changes characteristic of present times.''
	   The papal document did not cite specific issues. But Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger, a powerful Vatican voice, said at a news
conference that a recent letter by U.S. bishops addressed to
parents of gay children would ``in my personal opinion'' require
unanimous approval should the bishops' conference as a whole seek
to adopt it because of the ``pastoral and doctrinal
sensitivities.''
	   The document, titled ``Always Our Children,'' was approved by
the Administrative Board of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops. It advised parents of gay children to put love and support
for their sons and daughters before church doctrine that condemns
homosexual activity.
	   The Vatican later asked for several changes in the letter.
	   Ratzinger, the guardian of Vatican orthodoxy, said it was good
that the U.S. bishops were ``experimenting'' with the issue at that
level, below the full authority of the bishops' conference.
	   Ratzinger stressed the importance of protecting those holding
minority views, declaring that the ``truth is not determined by a
majority'' vote.
	   The Vatican was angered by a statement by German bishops calling
for divorced and remarried Catholics to be allowed communion. A
statement by bishops in New Zealand that referred to the pope as
``first among equals'' reportedly drew Vatican ire.
	   The Vatican document grew out of a 1985 bishops' synod at the
Vatican, when prelates sought to clarify the exact authority of
their national conferences.
	   ``I find it heartening to reflect that, over the years, our own
U.S. Conference has been characterized by unanimous or widespread
agreement over a range of important issues,'' Pilla said in a
statement released in Washington.

Round-up: Allez, France! Haute Couture Alive and Moving Ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - ``Allez France!'' echoing the World Cup victory was
the word in haute couture shows this week, as there were many
triumphs for the French, especially Yves Saint Laurent and
Jean-Paul Gaultier.
	   There was glory for Paris as the center of fashion - with
foreigners like couture newcomer Brazilian Ocimar Versolato showing
winning fashions using slick, new silvery fabrics.
	   A few spectacular circus shows - notably by wild-minded English
designers - practically ignored real clothes for showbiz.
	   The atmosphere was big-chief pow-wow versus real clothes at
Givenchy's show by Alexander McQueen: a rain forest in a circus
atmosphere.
	   Same problem at Dior, where the other renegade English showman
John Galliano brought on a horde of feathered Indians - hardly
native Americans, so got-up were they in their wild blankets and
boots - plus historical characters in musketeer finery. One could
count about two really wearable outfits here.
	   Then there were fashion shows, concentrating on elegant clothes
for clients rather than cameras.
	   Jean-Paul Gaultier triumphed, becoming a true haute couturier,
after many years of being a funny bad boy of fashion. His show made
some reverential bows to Yves Saint Laurent, like his long version
of the superb dressy silk trench coat-dress, the cape shrugged to
reveal a great evening gown.
	   Or his blouson of cassis-shaded leather, adorned with rooster
feathers over a trumpet-shaped georgette khaki skirt.
	   Fabulous details included old beaded evening bags pulled apart
and used as patchwork for sophisticated, fur-edged outfits.
	   ``He is a true creator,'' said Pierre Berge, president of Saint
Laurent, who saw the show.
	   Gaultier beamed and joined in the standing ovation for the
draped dresses, the new suit proportions with easy, mild-shouldered
jackets, flared skirts to about knee level at Saint Laurent's show.
	   Much was in black and white, and made for real walking, not just
sexy runway strutting. He got the classical-modern themes just
right, and decorated the simpler dark clothes with touches of
crystal or rhinestone jewelry.
	   Even usually over-the-top luxury designer Christian Lacroix gave
a new feeling of elegant restraint to his clothes. They were
sobered up with many outfits in indigo and inky black.
	   And then there was Chanel, where Karl Lagerfeld took couture
forward into even more elegant simplicity, which some compared with
a yen for zen.
	   The cutaway jackets over fullish skirts had something of
Japanese designer experiments over the years. Here it truly looked
like refined haute couture, a zenith of perfection.
	   The old guard giving new meaning to sophisticated clothes
included Valentino and Ungaro, both of whom used the latest
techniques of light and silvered or gilded embroidery.
	   Younger designers, such as Dominique Sirop, also showed in this
couture context, as the program is now being enlarged by the
Chambre Syndicale, who control such matters.
	   His presentation was not daring or dazzling, but many of the
well-cut cashmere or tweed trouser suits with dressy silk blouse
and lining additions could be taken gracefully into evening. And
the asymmetrical hologrammed evening dresses would be finery for
any modern dinner party.
	   It is all expensive.
	   But do not give up on haute couture, which hardly anybody can
afford. It is generous with ideas, and shoppers can often find the
right silhouette, the right fabric sheen, to look pretty and
``haute,'' even in ready-to-wear.
	   For this pre-turn-of-the-century: silhouettes are elongated,
feminine, no more glitzy Barbie-dolls, or power suits. Sobriety is
the best choice still, over riotous color and zany costumes.
	   Skirts may be short, but the longer lengths shown all over are
full, trumpet-shaped, easy to walk in, whether with high heels, or
the marvelous new open-toed Chanel flat sandals. Slim to wide
trouser suits are excellent due to cuts and luxury fabrics.
	   Lightness is the clue to the fabrics, which may be buttery-soft
leather, or supple cashmere and tweeds. And for evening, anything
goes - with pearled, lame-shot fabrics and new taffeta synthetics
with spiderweb filigree silver and gold details looking good.
	   Beautiful ostrich or rooster feathers and furs like sable are
essential to the luxury couture looks. Fakes are not haute couture,
but are acceptable for animal-rights campaigners.

	   PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) _ The Chamber of Commerce has joined
a growing chorus opposed proposed price controls on many consumer
goods in this Indian Ocean island nation.
	   On Wednesday, it joined the Joint Economic Council, a
confederation of private sector organizations, in saying the
Consumer Protection Bill would discourage investment and hurt job
creation.
	   Mauritius was ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 1998
Africa Competitiveness Report. During the period from 1991-96 the
country had an average GDP growth rate of 5.2 percent.
	   Commerce Minister Sathiamoorty Sunnassee argued that the gradual
liberalization of prices had not benefitted consumers because of
monopolies in the country of 1.1 million.
	   Mauritius plans to introduce a value added tax in September, and
there are fears that some businessmen and shopkeepers will use the
occasion to raise prices.

Coworkers die of heart attacks almost simultaneously
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURNLEY, England (AP) _ Two colleagues died of heart attacks
within minutes of each other while working on a house in northwest
England _ one while he tried to revive the other with
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, police said.
	   George Taylor, 45, collapsed on the job, and his colleague and
friend, William Heaton, 51, suffered a fatal heart attack as he
tried to revive him, police said.
	   Heaton, a roofing subcontractor, came down a ladder from the
roof to find Taylor collapsed on the floor. He complained of
breathing problems as he tried to revive his friend, authorities
said.
	   Post-mortem examinations were being carried out on the two men
Thursday, but the police said nothing about their deaths was
suspicious. ``It was just a sad and tragic coincidence,'' said a
police spokesman, who was not identified.

Rios, looking for No. 1, and Becker to tangle at Mercedes Cup

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Marcelo Rios made it look easy, while
Boris Becker struggled and cursed, but both claimed victories
Thursday at the Mercedes Cup.
	   Now the two former world no. 1's will face each other in
Friday's quarterfinals at the dlrs 1.04 million event, with each
having something special at stake.
	   Rios, who would vault past Pete Sampras to the top spot on the
ATP computer if he reaches the final, proved too steady for
Germany's Hendrik Dreekman in a 6-3, 6-4 win.
	   Becker, still looking for that elusive first clay court title of
his long career, needed two hours, 8 minutes and several outbursts
of temper to oust Spain's Felix Mantilla, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   ``He was my toughest opponent so far,'' said Becker. ``But
tomorrow against Rios, I'm going to have to lift my game a notch.''
	   The 30-year-old German complained bitterly to the umpire about
being disturbed by Mantilla's loud grunts, which came long after
the Spaniard had hit the ball.
	   He also complained directly to the Spaniard with the dyed-blonde
hair.
	   ``We exchanged a couple of words out there _ but they came from
both sides,'' said Becker.
	   But Becker, despite struggling with his serve and temper, also
saved his best tennis against the world No. 14 for the crucial end
of both sets.
	   In the match's most spectacular exchange, Becker and Mantilla
traded drop shots and lightning volleys at the net before the
German emerged with a 5-1 lead in the first set tie break.
	   Becker needed a net roller to gain a 6-5 break in the second
set, but had put himself in position for the crucial point by
rifling several forehand winners.
	   ``I could have lost this match, but I was always at my best when
it counted,'' said Becker, whose impressive play lately comes
despite having cut back on tournaments as he eases into retirement.
	   With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104 F) courtside,
Rios jumped on the 23-year-old Dreekmann's mistakes and was never
really challenged.
	   Dreekmann lone chance to turn around the match against the
world's second-ranked player disappeared when he failed to gain a
break while trailing at 3-4 in the final set.
	   Becker beat Rios two weeks ago in the semifinals of the Swiss
Open, kindling his hopes of finally claiming a clay court title
before his career winds down.
	   But he was beaten by Spain's Alex Corretja in the final _ the
sixth time he has come up short in a final on clay.
	   Becker, a former world No. 1, has 49 career titles. He was a
semifinalist twice at the French Open.
	   His chance to finally win on clay has been helped by the way
upsets have thinned the tournament's seeds, with defending champion
Corretja and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov among the victims.
	   But on the other side of the draw from the two former world No.
1's is the French Open champion, Carlos Moya. The second seed is
scheduled to play later Thursday.

UNICEF chief warns cease-fire not enough for southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INCORPORATES Sudan-Famine and France-UNICEF_Sudan &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A three-month cease-fire between rebels
and Sudanese government troops in parts of southern Sudan is
insufficient to stay the rising death toll caused by war and
famine, the head of the U.N. Chidrens Fund said Thursday.
	   In Paris, another UNICEF official sharly criticized the
international community for not doing enough to stop the widening
famine in southern Sudan where hundreds of thousands face
starvation.
	   ``We believe the cease-fire does present an opportunity to save
lives,'' UNICEF chief Carol Bellamy said after Bahr el-Ghazal
province in southwestern Sudan where warring sides last week
declared the cease-fire last week to allow relief food to reach
those in need.
	   ``A cease-fire is important, but the time should be extended and
the geographical boundaries that are proposed for the cease-fire
should also be extended,'' Bellamy said. ``This should be seen as
the first step.''
	   Bellamy's comments came amid reports from the region Thursday
that the death toll had increased more than three-fold in the past
10 days.
	   Bellamy said she travelled to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum,
and the war-torn south to see the extent of the suffering and to
draw world attention _ and funding. Bellamy met with government and
rebel officials and representatives of donor countries.
	   Paris-based Claire Brisset, UNICEF director of information who
travelled with Bellamy, said on her return Thursday that the
international community ``has absolutely not realized the scope of
the disaster.''
	   She said nearly 2 million people need immediate aid _ 1.5
million in the south and about 350,000 encamped in a ``belt of
misery around Khartoum, where she saw ``the living dead'' who
arrived at the town after walking 1,000 kilometers (600 miles).
	   Brisset said UNICEF has received just over half of the dlrs 50
million it needs for its humanitarian operations in Sudan. Other
relief agencies have voiced similar complaints.
	   Doctors Without Borders, one of several non-governmental relief
organizations working with U.N. agencies in southern Sudan,
reported Thursday that 120 people are dying each day in the town of
Ajiep in Bahr el-Ghazal.
	   But a Sudanese government official put the death toll in Bahr
el-Ghazal at between 40 and 50 people a day.
	   Dassan Dahawi, state minister for social planning, accused
Sudanese rebels of seizing relief food. International aid workers
have said shipments have been burned by government-allied militias
in the mostly rebel-held Bahr el-ghazal.
	   ``The suffering I witnessed in these famine-stricken areas was
horrific,'' Bellamy said. ``Children who should be running and
playing have become mere skeletal figures, too weak to stand.''
	   Bellamy said she was aware of the problem of food being diverted
but said she did not believe any major looting was taking place.
	   Calling the situation in the region the worst in 10 years,
Bellamy said humanitarian agencies were committed to bringing
relief to southern Sudan, but she warned that the famine would last
far longer than three months. She also said the problem can only be
solved by ending the fighting.
	   At least 1.5 million people have died since the second round of
a civil war broke out between the Sudan People's Liberation Army
and government troops in 1983.
	   The SPLA seeks greater autonomy for the predominantly Christian
and animist south which has been controlled by the Arab, Islamized
north.
	   Bellamy urged both government and rebel forces to take
responsibility for irregular forces, mostly renegades from either
government or rebel troops, who have not signed onto the cease-fire
and have been fighting in other parts of southern Sudan.

US and Latin Americans may ask WTO to break banana deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.S. and Latin American banana producers said
Thursday they may ask the World Trade Organization to help break a
deadlock with the European Union over its banana import preferences
given to European colonies and ex-colonies.
	   On Thursday, the European Union told the WTO that changes it is
making to its policy will bring it into line with the world trade
body's rules.
	   But the United States and Latin Americans argue that, even with
the changes, the regime will still favor traditional EU banana
suppliers in Africa and the Caribbean.
	   They say they may request a WTO dispute settlement panel to be
reconvened to determine whether the changes to the EU's policy
allow it to comply.
	   A previous WTO dispute panel ruling judged the EU's policy to be
out of line after the United States, Honduras, Panama, Mexico and
Ecuador and Guatemala complained that European import rules
discriminate against them via a complex system of tariffs, quotas
and import licenses.
	   They claimed the EU regime was costing more efficient producers
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost trade.
	   ``We still consider the measures taken by the (EU) to be
primarily cosmetic,'' said a statement from the United States, and
others, read to a meeting of the WTO in Geneva.
	   A U.S. trade official said that, if the European Union doesn't
satisfy their demands by January 1, 1999 - the time limit set for
the EU by an arbitrator to bring the rules into line - they may
take retaliatory trade measures.
	   EU officials said they are prepared to defend the new regime.
	   ``If the United States and others want to attack that, they can
and we are willing and ready to defend our position,'' Roderick
Abbott, the EU's chief trade representative at the WTO, said.

Volcano expert: Etna could erupt but no idea when
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ Ash belching out of Mount Etna closed
down Catania's airport Thursday, as the volcano sent up plumes of
smoke 10 kilometers (six miles) high.
	   Some experts said that Mount Etna, which has been rumbling and
pumping out lava and smoke for months, might erupt but there is no
telling when.
	   ``It's difficult to establish when this will happen,''
vulcanologist Letterio Villari was quoted as saying by the Italian
news agency ANSA after he inspected the crater.
	   ``If I could do it, that would mean I could read a crystal
ball,'' Villari said.
	   But another expert, Salvatore Spampinato, from the Institute of
Vulcanology in Catania, said the emission of gas was part of Etna's
normal activity.
	   The latest violent activity began on Wednesday as two minor
earthquakes shook Mount Etna, which sent lava spilling down its
slopes.
	   By late Thursday afternoon, the discharge of lava was over,
Spampinato told The Associated Press.
	   Catania's airport was shut down late Wednesday night and kept
closed until Thursday afternoon, while workers cleared runways of a
centimeter (quarter-inch) high layer of ash, which made the tarmac
slick.
	   Ten flights were either canceled or delayed for as much as three
hours, or diverted to Sicily's other main airport, Palermo, airport
officials said.
	   In Catania, 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the vulcano, some
pedestrians used umbrellas to shield themselves from the raining
ash.
	   Fragments of stony or glassy lava, some as fat as 15 centimeters
(6 inches), were hurled into the air by Etna to heights of 2,000
meters (6,600-feet).
	   On June 14, the area around the crater was declared off-limits
to tourists after the volcano belched chunks of lava.

European ministers clinch landmark deal on marine pollution policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINTRA, Portugal (AP) _ European environment ministers reached
what they called a landmark deal Thursday on reducing marine
pollution in the northeast Atlantic, including new rules on
dismantling old oil rigs and curbing radioactive discharges.
	   The ministers from 12 European Union nations, Norway and Iceland
agreed that most decommissioned oil rigs must be dismantled on
shore.
	   At the insistence of Britain and Norway, where most of the 720
rigs are located, the ministers shied away from a total ban on
sinking rigs at sea.
	   The dismantling of 40 of the largest offshore installations _
those weighing more than 10,000 tons _ will depend on the
conclusions of case-by-case technical feasibility studies, the
ministers said after a two-day meeting here.
	   The rigs' stumps, or footings, may be allowed to stay on the sea
floor because it would be too hard to remove them.
	   Addressing another key issue at the conference, the ministers
also agreed to reduce discharges of radioactive waste to ``close to
zero'' by 2020. No specific target was set.
	   Nuclear companies had warned that adopting the so-called ``zero
option'' for radioactive discharges would put them out of business.
	   Officials declined to set a cost on the measures, the expense of
which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   The meeting in this town on Lisbon's outskirts was the first at
ministerial level for the Convention for the Protection of the
Marine Environment of the Northeast Atlantic.
	   The decisions are legally binding on the convention's members,
whose waters stretch from the Arctic Circle in the north to
Portugal on Europe's southwestern tip.
	   ``I doubted we'd clinch a deal. It was very difficult,''
Portuguese Environment Minister Elisa Ferreira said after all-night
negotiations.
	   British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott emphasized that jobs
and investment would be generated by dismantling disused rigs.
	   ``This deal is a very good example of how gain comes out of an
environmental objective,'' he told reporters.
	   Britain and France were at the center of the negotiations on
levels of radioactive waste.
	   More than 90 percent of all radioactive waste discharges into
the sea covered by the accord come from three nuclear reprocessing
plants, located at Sellafield and Dounreay in Britain and at La
Hague in France.
	   French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet said the agreement
represented ``a huge step forward'' in environmental affairs.
	   Norwegian Minister Guro Fjellanger said she was still worried by
discharges from Sellafield, which are amassing on the Scandinavian
coastline, but said the deal was ``an important first step.''
	   The accords were also welcomed by Greenpeace, which had observer
status at the meeting.
	   ``Today is a great victory for Greenpeace,'' the organization's
spokesman Remi Paramentier said. l

UEFA asks national bodies to state positions on breakaway league
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES final grafs with letter from Polish government. No

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ European soccer's governing body said
Thursday it has asked its member associations and national leagues
to officially state their positions on a breakaway Super League.
	   In a statement, UEFA stressed ``its readiness and capacity to
further develop the existing European club competitions.''
	   On Sunday, the owners of several of Europe's top soccer clubs
reportedly met in secret with a view to forming their own breakaway
Super League in the 2000-2001 season.
	   According to reports in Germany and England, the main movers
behind the idea were powerhouses AC and Inter Milan, Juventus, Real
Madrid, FC Barcelona, Paris St. Germain, Ajax Amsterdam, Manchester
United and Bayern Munich.
	   The idea of a Super League, which would effectively undermine
UEFA's own competitions, has been around for two decades.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``expressed its surprise that this
matter has remained unnoticed by the national associations and
leagues concerned.''
	   UEFA said it is willing to develop its competitions ``in
accordance with the wishes and needs of all components within the
structure of European football'' to satisfy both the grassroots and
the elite.
	   Aware of what damage it would do to the Champions Cup, UEFA has
already taken steps to try and stop a Super League taking shape.
	   Four seasons ago it changed the format to bring in a group
structure at the midpoint of the competition and changed the name
of the tournament to Champions League.
	   To make it more attractive to the big clubs, UEFA then altered
the rules so that runners up in the high profile leagues also would
take part. That opened up the prospect of the Champions Cup being
won by a team that wasn't a champion.
	   The latest move is to change the league format from six groups
of four to four groups of six to ensure even more matches and make
it even more of a league structure.
	   In a letter to the presidents of FIFA and UEFA published by
Poland's PAP news agency, Debski said the government is acting
according to Polish law.
	   In blocking an investigation, the soccer federation is
``opposing Polish law and shows a complete lack of willingness to
compromise,'' Debski wrote.
	   Poland will seek ``a solution through international
arbitration'' if a ban on Polish sides is imposed, he added.

Arab League chief blames Israel for slowdown in peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Arab countries would like to see
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements implemented, but Israel is
blocking the process, the chief of the Arab League said Thursday.
	   ``We hope that the Israeli leader (Benjamin Netanyahu) can
understand how dangerous a failure of the peace process could be,''
Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel Meguid said.
	   Abdel Meguid, on a two-day visit to Poland, called on Israel to
establish neighborly relations with Arab countries.
	   Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Polish Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek, the Arab League chief said his visit
here aims at maintaining friendly relations with Poland.
	   Geremek said Poland supported resuming the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks as soon as possible.
	   Abdel-Meguid later met with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.

FINA doping panel to decide on Smith tampered-sample case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Stands for story listed as Sports-Swimming-FINA-Doping &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, faces a
possible life ban when she appears at a hearing Friday on charges
of tampering with a urine sample.
	   Smith goes before a doping panel of FINA, swimming's world
governing body, to answer charges that she manipulated an
out-of-competition drug test by adulterating her sample with
alcohol.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, will represent her at the hearing
and confirmed that the swimmer, who has consistently denied taking
drugs to boost her performances, would also be present.
	   ``We'll be defending whatever charges we have to,'' Lennon said.
``At this stage we're not entirely sure what will be required of us
at the hearing. If required to, she will give evidence.''
	   In April FINA announced that Smith's A sample, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Analysis of her second sample, conducted at the same lab in the
presence of Lennon and a biochemist from Dublin hospital, showed
identical signs of alleged tampering as her first specimen, FINA
said.
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
alcohol, with the implication that any tampering would have been
intended to avoid the possible detection of drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids. The maximum penalty is a life ban.
	   Smith, who says she has been tested probably more often than any
other international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test
in Kilkenny County, Ireland, on January 10.
	   It was unclear how long Smith's hearing will last, or when FINA
will announce its verdict.
	   ``Michelle's very much looking forward to getting this behind
her,'' Lennon said. ``And hopefully this hearing will be the end of
it.''
	   Lennon had earlier threatened to apply to the Swiss-based Court
of Arbitration for an injunction, arguing that since FINA did not
report finding any banned drug in either sample, the charges should
be dropped.
	   If the FINA tribunal rules against Smith, Lennon said he would
appeal the case to a higher jurisdiction.
	   But Lennon said he didn't want to appear pessimistic by talking
about legal alternatives in the case of a finding against Smith.
	   ``We have not launched other legal proceedings at present
because we have been concentrating on the doping panel hearing,''
he said.
	   ``Michelle ... has been spending a lot of time working on the
submission for the hearing and concentrating on that. It has
affected her training.''
	   Smith has faced unproven allegations and rumors of doping ever
since she won three gold medals at the Atlanta Games.
	   She has maintained that her improved performances resulted from
major changes to her training routine developed by her coach and
husband, Erik de Bruin. A former Dutch discus thrower, he was
banned for four years after testing positive for high levels of
testosterone.
	   The FINA doping panel will also decide on sanctions to impose on
four Chinese swimmers who tested positive for banned substances at
the World Swimming Championships in January.
	   At the worlds in Perth, Australia three Chinese women _ Wang
Luna, Cai Huijue and Zhang Yi _ and male teammate Wang Wei tested
positive for triamterene, a banned diuretic which can be used to
mask the use of anabolic steroids.
	   The doping panel will also examine the case of British swimmer
Michael Fibbens, who tested positive for the banned stimulant
Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, after winning the 100
freestyle at the World Cup meet in Sheffield last March.
	   Fibbens, the national short-course record-holder in the 100
meter freestyle, could face a two-year ban and have all his
competition results of the past six months annulled.
	   In the final World Cup meet of the season in Paris last March
Fibbens finished third in the 50 freestyle.

Truck in Germany crashes into car and explodes, killing two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) _ A truck carrying cooling chemicals
crashed Thursday into a stopped car on the side of a highway and
exploded, killing a mother and child in the car, police said.
	   The truck driver and the child's father, who also was in the
car, were seriously injured in the accident near Bad Duerrenberg in
eastern Saxony-Anhalt state.
	   Police spokesman Siegfried Koch identified the victims in the
car as a Bosnian family who lived in Denmark, but said he had no
names or ages because identity papers were damaged in the accident.
The truck driver was not identified.
	   Most of the metal bottles containing the cooling chemicals
exploded during the crash, and traffic was held up because of the
danger of further explosions.
	   Police said it was not immediately clear why the truck crashed
into the car.

FIFA, UEFA warn Polish government, federation to solve dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES final grafs with letter from Polish government. No

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Polish sides could be barred from
international competitions unless the national soccer federation
and the government solve their current difficulties by Aug. 7, FIFA
and UEFA said Thursday.
	   The international soccer bodies sent a joint delegation to
Warsaw earlier this week to mediate between the federation and the
country's sports ministry.
	   In May, Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended 22 Polish Soccer
Federation administrators because they refused to submit to a probe
of mismanagement accusations.
	   Ministry spokesman Pawel Krzykowski has said authorities were
trying to free Polish soccer from ``an atmosphere of scandal, of
mismanagement, of unclear associations.''
	   Soccer officials argue the government had no right to suspend
the administrators.
	   During a three-day visit to Poland, UEFA and FIFA
representatives ``specified a plan of action taking into account
(the sides') basic interests and aiming to restore dialogue between
them,'' the bodies said in a joint statement.
	   No details were given of the plan's contents. However, UEFA and
FIFA said that, while the Polish Soccer Federation accepted it
without reservation, the sports minister ``set out some conditions
contrary to the statutory provisions of FIFA and UEFA.''
	   The Polish government argues that an investigation should take
place before the soccer officials are reinstated.
	   FIFA and UEFA were ``obliged to request'' that the suspensions
``and the consecutive decisions are lifted as soon as possible,''
by Aug. 7 at the latest.
	   Failure to do so could result in the Polish federation being
immediately and indefinitely suspended by both international
bodies, the joint statement said.
	   In a letter to the presidents of FIFA and UEFA published by
Poland's PAP news agency, Debski said the government is acting
according to Polish law.
	   In blocking an investigation, the soccer federation is
``opposing Polish law and shows a complete lack of willingness to
compromise,'' Debski wrote.
	   Poland will seek ``a solution through international
arbitration'' if a ban on Polish sides is imposed, he added.

New coach of Russian soccer team took Soviets to Olympic gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet soccer
team to a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics, was named Thursday as
head coach of the Russian Soccer Union, news agencies reported.
	   Byshovets, 51, replaces Boris Ignatiev, who resigned last month
in part because Russia failed to earn a place in the World Cup.
	   Byshovets' contract will run until after the 2002 World Cup.
	   He told reporters that he will continue to coach the Zenit team
of St. Petersburg, which is in second place in the Russian national
league, until the end of this season.
	   Byshovets was one of the Soviet Union's best soccer players in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. From 1963-73 he was a forward for
the Dinamo Kiev team.
	   He scored four goals in four matches at the 1970 World Cup, and
was named the tournament's fourth-best forward, along with soccer
great Pele.

United States cuts three to reach 12-man team for world
</HEADLINE>
championship &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The U.S. cut three players Thursday _ Earl Boykins,
Tim Breaux and Duke's two-time All-America Trajan Langdon _ to
reach its 12-man roster for world championship opening next week in
Athens.
	   USA Basketball announced the cuts as the team broke training
camp in Monte Carlo and arrived in Rome for its final tuneup
Saturday against the Italian national team.
	   The team is composed of: Wendell Alexis, Ashraf Amaya, Mateen
Cleeves, Bill Edwards, Kiwane Garris, Michael Hawkins, Gerard King,
Jimmy King, Brad Miller, Jimmy Oliver, Jason Sasser, David Wood.
	   USA Basketball had picked 12 NBA players _ the so-called Dream
Team _ for the world championship. But with a lockout looming July
1 and the NBA players threatening a boycott, USA Basketball
replaced them with a hodgepodge of college, CBA and professionals
playing in Europe.
	   The squad was cut to 16 for training camp in Monte Carlo. One of
the 16, Warren Kidd, a 6-10 forward who plays professionally in
Italy, was forced to withdraw with a pelvic injury.
	   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, whose club opens Wednesday against
Brazil, was to talk with reporters later Thursday about the makeup
of the team.
	   The Americans, who will still be among the favorites with clubs
like Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Russia, Australia, Argentina and host
Greece, have won their first two exhibition, beating France 93-63
and Spain 95-78.

As rains swell Yangtze river, floods also ravage north China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ A key industrial city in central China,
already waist-deep in water, braced Thursday for more of the
torrential rains that have brought the Yangtze River to dangerous
levels.
	   A flood crest from days of heavy rains upstream passed along the
Yangtze through Wuhan without overflowing embankments, which have
been reinforced with sandbags and kept under constant watch.
	   But officials were looking at the sky with trepidation, worried
the downpours forecast for Thursday night would flood more of the
city of 7 million inhabitants. Streets in low-lying areas were
under more than 1 meter (three feet) of water, forcing some
residents to use rowboats to reach their homes.
	   Tuesday brought Wuhan its heaviest rains on record, causing one
death, and stranding 600,000 people, the Communist Party flagship
People's Daily newspaper said. Little rain fell during the day
Thursday, allowing authorities to drain some flooded areas.
	   Soldiers built walls of sandbags along the waterfront downtown
and evacuated the area for several blocks inland.
	   Some areas of this city of 3 million people have been without
water and power for three days, causing refrigerated food to spoil
and forcing shops to close.
	   One restaurateur, sitting in the doorway of his darkened
business on a major street in the city's Wuchang district, said his
losses reached several thousand yuan (several hundred dollars).
	   ``I can do nothing,'' said the man, who didn't give his name.
``All my supplies rotted.''
	   More than 1,000 people have died from flooding in China from
seasonal rains that came earlier and heavier than usual. Six
provinces that lie along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, have been among the hardest-hit.
	   Dikes that are the only shield for millions of people along the
river are waterlogged by more than two weeks of constant rain and
could collapse, according to reports in state-run media.
	   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and residents have been
mobilized to man dikes and fill sandbags, newspapers reported.
	   Floods reportedly washed away a 3,000-meter (3,000-yard) section
of newly constructed dikes and opened a 600-meter (180-foot) crack
in an embankment in Hunan province, upstream from Wuhan.
	   Downstream, waters were reported about 1 meter above warning
levels in Nanjing city, where the river broadens before flowing
into the sea near Shanghai.
	   Heavy rains have also left 113 persons dead and 90,000 homeless
in northern China, the official China Daily reported.
	   Torrents that began in early July have destroyed 22,000 homes
and thousands of hectares (acres) of farmland and washed away
roads, power lines, and food supplies in Shaanxi province _
normally an arid swath of barely tillable hills, the China Daily
reported.

Yeltsin appoints former Politburo member to Cabinet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout markets closing down, quote,
background, detail. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin appointed a former
Politburo member and long-time Communist Party member to his
Cabinet on Thursday in an apparent move to improve his testy
relations with the hard-line parliament.
	   Yuri Maslyukov, 60, a former chairman of the Soviet planning
agency Gosplan, was named Minister for Industry and Trade, the
Kremlin press service said.
	   A gesture of this sort has been expected from the president for
weeks. Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, has blocked many
of Yeltsin's moves to reform the economy, demanding a greater say
in economic policy.
	   The Duma's reluctance to approve higher taxes and budget cuts
has aggravated relations with the Kremlin and dismayed
international lenders. The International Monetary Fund approved its
part of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout for Russia this week, but
reduced the first installment by dlrs 800 million to protest the
Duma's rejection of the austerity measures.
	   The IMF deposited most of the dlrs 4.8 billion installment into
the Russian Central Bank on Thursday, but the new funds failed to
cheer the stock market, which sank 6.9 percent.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets, in part because of
world trends like falling oil prices, but also because of the
country's chronic failure to cut the federal budget and collect
taxes.
	   The IMF has demanded improved tax collection, tightened social
spending and the closure of unprofitable state industries _ all
policies opposed by the parliament, which is dominated by
Communists and other hard-liners.
	   Lawmakers complain the IMF-influenced economic policies are
destroying the economy and have demanded what they call a
``government of national reconciliation'' in which Communists and
other Yeltsin opponents would serve in the Cabinet.
	   Maslyukov's appointment appeared to be a response to such
demands.
	   Maslyukov served as chairman of Gosplan under Mikhail Gorbachev,
and is currently a Communist member of the Duma and chairman of its
committee on economic policy. He is the first Communist to be named
to this Cabinet.
	   Maslyukov's new post is likely to carry relatively minor
responsibilities in part because most major industries have been
privatized.
	   The ministry was created from the remnants of the now defunct
Ministry of Foreign Trade. Its responsibilities have not been
spelled out, but may include the arms trade, the bureau of
standards, and industrial policy.
	   Maslyukov admitted that by accepting the post, he may be seen as
a traitor to the Communists' cause.
	   ``This was not an easy choice,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``But I think I may be useful.''
	   The Central Bank acknowledged Thursday that before the IMF
deposit, its hard-currency reserves had edged down to dlrs 13.6
billion this week from dlrs 13.7 billion on July 10.
	   The bank has spent large sums to defend the Russian ruble,
keeping it relatively steady at around 6.2 to the U.S. dollar. The
new IMF funds are expected to reassure currency markets that Russia
has adequate reserves to prevent a run on the ruble.

Government decides to sell state banks to private sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Majority stakes in two Romanian state
banks will be offered to private investors for the first time,
officials announced Thursday.
	   The sales were among conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund in exchange for further loans to the struggling
Romania, where attempts to institute a market economy have been
delayed by inefficiency and political bickering.
	   Bogdan Baltazar, director of the Romanian Bank for Development,
told reporters that City Bank of the United States, ABN Amro
Holding NV of the Netherlands and Deutsche Bank of Germany have
expressed an interest in his bank.
	   By the end of the year, the government will offer up to 51
percent to a foreign bank, and another 10 percent might be shared
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
World Bank, he said.
	   Baltazar said that RBD employees could also buy 10 percent of
the shares and the rest of the bank's assets would offered for sale
next year.
	   A 45-percent share of Banc Post, the other state bank, will
initially be offered for sale, said Elena Petculescu, that bank's
president.

Spanish TV company Sogecable and CNN announce joint project for
</HEADLINE>
24-hour news channel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The private Spanish television company
Sogecable and CNN on Thursday announced a joint project for a
24-hour news channel based in Madrid to begin broadcasting in
December 1998.
	   ``This agreement with Sogecable is a new and very important
dimension to the development strategy of CNN International,'' Phil
Kent of Turner Broadcasting System International was quoted as
saying in a statement distributed by the Spanish company in Madrid.
	   The ownership of the new channel to be called CNN+ will be
equally split between Sogecable and Turner Broadcasting System
International, the company responsible for CNN's international
commercial operations, the statement said.
	   CNN+ will be run and presented in Spanish by local journalists.
It will focus on national news but have access to CNN's worldwide
coverage, Sogecable said.
	   Sogecable is part owned by Grupo Prisa, Spain's largest media
group that also owns leading daily El Pais and the country's most
widely listened to radio station Cadena Ser. Sogecable owns 90
percent of Spain's major digital television company Canal Satelite
and cable TV company Canal Plus.

WTO panels set up on aircraft exports, dairy and footwear imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization is to intervene to
help decide a dispute between Canada and Brazil over civilian
aircraft exports.
	   The WTO is setting up two dispute settlement panels, one
requested by Canada and the other by Brazil, following complaints
by both countries that they are each contravening WTO rules with
their aircraft export policies.
	   Canada charged that Brazil is in the wrong by granting certain
export subsidies to foreign buyers of the Latin American country's
Embraer aircraft.
	   Brazil in turn complained that Canada is violating its WTO
obligations with certain subsidies given by the government of
Canada or its provinces that support its exports of civilian
aircraft.
	   Meanwhile, the WTO also set up panels at the European Union's
request to resolve disputes with Korea and Argentina over import
quotas.
	   The European Union complained to the WTO that a ``safeguard''
limit imposed by Korea on imports of certain dairy products
breaches WTO rules.
	   Korean trade officials told a WTO meeting in Geneva they
believed the measure complied.
	   An EU request for a panel to resolve a dispute with Argentina
was also granted. The EU complained that safeguard limits imposed
by the Argentinian government on shoe imports violate WTO rules.
	   Argentinian trade officials told the WTO they were sure the
measures were in line with their obligations.

Diplomatic team admits little progress in mission in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An international team back from
Yugoslavia reported Thursday a ``total lack of trust'' between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians and said it failed to persuade the
government to let a permanent diplomatic mission return to Kosovo.
	   A team of senior diplomats from the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, came back Wednesday
after a weeklong visit to Yugoslavia, which included meetings with
senior Yugoslav officials and separatist Albanian politicians.
	   The team hoped the visit would pave the way for a permanent OSCE
mission to be based in Kosovo and for a visit by former Spanish
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to help mediate the crisis on behalf
of the European Union.
	   But in its report, the team, which included American, Russian,
Austrian, German, Polish, Norwegian and Danish diplomats, said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stuck by his demand that
Yugoslavia's membership in the OSCE be restored before he would
accept a permanent mission or Gonzalez's mediation.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.
	   The team, led by the former German ambassador to Belgrade,
Hansjoerg Eiff, also reported finding a ``total lack of trust
between the two communities in Kosovo,'' meaning the Albanians, who
form 90 percent of the province's population, and the Serbs.
	   The team also said Albanian politicians and the Serb-dominated
government in Belgrade remain far apart ``as to how the conflict
could be resolved.'' Milosevic has offered to negotiate autonomy
for the province, which he withdrew in 1989.
	   But Milosevic -- as well as the Americans and Europeans --
opposes independence, which is the demand of both moderate Albanian
politicians and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The rebel group is
battling Serb security forces in the province.
	   On Thursday, the Vienna newspaper, The Standard, said Milosevic
was expected to announce shortly that he would be prepared to raise
Kosovo's legal status from a Serbian province to a full republic
within the Yugoslav federation.
	   That would give the province equal footing along with Serbia and
Montenegro, which together form all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   The newspaper quoted a Montenegrin Cabinet member, Predrag
Drecun, as saying Milosevic had advised the European Union of his
plan, which would be announced ``soon.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and Kosovo Albanians traded
accusations Thursday of summary executions, beatings and other
atrocities during recent fierce fighting for a central town.
	   New tragedy appeared to be developing in the aftermath of the
conflict in Orahovac, where Serb forces drove out separatist Kosovo
Albanian fighters in five days of fighting. Thousands of refugees
were flooding the nearby town of Malisevo, resulting in alarming
shortages of food, drinking water and other necessities, said local
Albanian media.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence from the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic cracked down
on Albanian militants in late February.
	   With fought-over areas inaccessible due to road blocks by both
sides, independent confirmation of conflicting claims by the two
ethic groups fighting for Kosovo are difficult to confirm. Such was
the case on Thursday for mutual accusations of atrocities in the
Orahovac fighting.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed,
including some dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units... The situation in Orahovac is
catastrophic,'' the group said.
	   Hundreds of Serbs also sought refuge in nearby villages during
fighting, which ended before dawn Wednesday. Some of them spoke of
abductions and beatings.
	   ``Armed Albanians came into the village, killed one villager and
loaded seven of us women and eight men aboard a truck,'' said
Darinka Misic, from a village near Orahovac. ``One man raised his
head for a while and got a blow from a rifle butt.''
	   She and 34 other Serbs were handed over to the International
Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday by the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Most had been captured six days earlier at the start of the
rebels' biggest attack in weeks. The battle around Orahovac ended
before dawn Wednesday when the KLA retreated.
	   According to Mrs. Misic, the captives were driven to another
village, Suva Reka, where the women were given bread and water by
their captors and the men ``taken away and beaten.''
	   ``We heard them scream,'' she said.
	   Desperate conditions in Malisevo were reported by the Albanian
language daily Koha Ditore, which said that 13,000 people had fled
Orahovac for the town, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army
about 16 kilometers (10 miles) to the northeast.
	   The newspaper said 75 people were crowded into a single house,
whose owner was down to two sacks of flour. Supplies of food,
medicine and clothing were rapidly dwindling.
	   According to the daily, a makeshift hospital has been set up in
Malisevo to care for the wounded. But medical supplies are scarce,
and there is no running water.
	   The village, which had a population of about 8,000, has been cut
off for weeks from normal commerce because of Serb roadblocks
between the community and Pristina, the Serb-ruled provincial
capital.
	   While having no specifics on Malisevo, the International
Committee of the Red Cross reported Thursday that almost 20,000
people _ Serbs and Albanians _ had fled the fighting in Orahovac.
The UNHCR _ the main U.N. refugee agency _ said local ethnic
Albanians named a refugee figure of about 12,000 for Malisevo and
also said flour, cooking oil and clothing were in extremely short
supply.
	   The ICRC said it delivered 5 tons of flour and over 1,000 food
parcels to Malisevo in the past few days.

NATO troops mistakenly arrest two men as war criminals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with two men to go home; suspects' father says
brothers left for Britain &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO peacekeeperes will
return two Bosnian Serb brothers arrested by mistake as war crimes
suspects, officials said Thursday.
	   The two men were believed to have been Predrag Banovic and his
twin brother Nenad, who have been accused of beating and torturing
Muslim inmates at the infamous Keraterm prison camp during the
summer of 1992.
	   They were arrested Wednesday in Prijedor, 175 kilometers (110
miles) northwest of Sarajevo, and flown to The Hague, Netherlands,
seat of the international war crimes court which has indicted the
Banovic brothers.
	   But as the two men arrived, the office of the prosecutor
announced the two were not the Banovic brothers.
	   ``These are two brothers, they are even twins. But they have
another family name and ... other Christian names,'' said the court
spokesman, Christian Chartier.
	   ``Regrettably, two innocent people were detained. SFOR will now
transport them to Prijedor,'' said NATO spokeswoman, Maj. Sheena
Thomson in Sarajevo.
	   The identities of the two brothers mistakenly arrested were not
released.
	   On Thursday, the father of the Banovic brothers said his sons
were outside the country.
	   ``They left eight months ago for England and the last time we
talked to them was two weeks ago, on the phone,'' Zdravko Banovic
told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday from Prijedor.
	   According to the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement which ended the
Bosnian war, local authorities are obliged to hand over war-crimes
suspects once the tribunal announces the indictments.
	   But the requirement has been largely ignored by all three ethnic
groups -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
	   U.N. officials say the Muslims have been the most cooperative.
Only four Muslims have been indicted and all are in custody.
	   Bosnian Croat authorities cooperated several month ago when 10
Bosnian Croat suspects surrendered to the court. A few Bosnian
Serbs have surrendered too.
	   But the principal suspects -- former Bosnian Serb President
Radovan Karadzic and his former military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic --
remain at large.
	   The refusal of the parties to live up to their pledges under
Dayton has promoted the NATO-led peacekeeping force to take action
itself, Thomson said.
	   ``The international community has made it repeatedly clear that
the government authorities should take responsibility to ensure
persons wanted for war crimes are brought before The Hague,'' she
said.
	   ``If we are going to be active, mistakes will happen from time
to time,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea in Brusells.

Tehran mayor gets five years, verdict victory for hard-liners

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court sentenced Tehran's reformist mayor
to five years in prison on Thursday in the latest round in the
struggle between Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami and his
hard-line political rivals.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was also banned from holding
public office for 20 years and sentenced to 60 lashes. But the
court said the flogging would be suspended because of his social
standing.
	   He was fined 1 billion rials (dlrs 330,000) and ordered to pay
another 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to the municipality.
	   Karbaschi _ who ran Khatami's election campaign last year _ has
been at the center of the tug-of-war between the competing factions
in Iran's Islamic government headed by Khatami and the country's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   The verdict against the popular mayor was a show of force by
Khamenei's hard-liners, who showed they wield considerable power
despite their crushing election defeat.
	   The ultra-conservatives dominate the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament. By law, the judiciary, the armed forces, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network, are answerable not
to the president, but to Khamenei.
	   But Karbaschi's lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz, predicted the
conviction would be overturned, saying he would appeal within the
20 days allowed.
	   ``I am 100 percent certain that the appeal will clear him,'' he
told reporters.
	   Karbaschi was accused of using public money to run Khatami's
election campaign. He has admitted to making mistakes, but denied
that he ever stole money from the government.
	   The trial has often seen emotional exchanges between Karabaschi
and Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei _ who under the law also acts
as prosecutor. But the mayor was not present at Thursday's session
and Ejaei took no part in the proceedings.
	   The session was largely bureaucratic. A court official read out
the charges against Karbaschi, then announced the verdicts as
hundreds of journalists crammed into the court at the Imam Khomeini
Judicial Complex.
	   Outside, police and firefighters were on alert in case the
verdict sparked riots like those that broke out in Tehran when the
mayor was arrested in April.
	   No violence erupted this time, but public interest remained high
judging from a report by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
that its switchboard was jammed by callers anxious to know about
the outcome.
	   Since Khatami's election, the ultra-conservatives have fought
back as he has tried to relax the strict Islamic rules governing
life in Iran, encourage a more liberal political atmosphere and end
nearly 20 years of hostility with the United States.
	   Besides initiating the Karbaschi trial, the hard-liners recently
impeached the interior minister, another Khatami ally. But in a bid
to avoid an open confrontation, they approved Wednesday another
Khatami nominee for the post.
	   Judge Ejaei's statement to reporters after the trial that
Karbaschi would remain free on bail until the appeal also seemed
designed to cool the atmosphere.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process, and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.
	   ``Everyone saw how flawed the system is, how wrong it is to have
prosecutor, investigator and judge all rolled into one,'' said
Ebrahim Yazdi, head of the opposition Freedom Movement.
	   Since Karbaschi took over as Tehran's mayor in 1989, he had
built a reputation as a no-nonsense administrator. He has built new
roads, sports facilities and parks in a city once known for its
pollution and traffic jams.
	   He made enemies among wealthy businessmen by raising taxes, but
the results have made him a hero to ordinary Iranians like Mohammed
Qaraat, a soft-drink seller who criticized Thursday's verdict.
	   ``If he was so bad then why was he allowed to remain in office
for nearly nine years,'' Qaraat said. ``He served the nation, and
this is his reward.''

Pakistan Embassy says Swiss handed over 766 pages in Bhutto case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss officials gave the Pakistan
government 766 pages of documents related to their money-laundering
indictment of the husband of former Pakistani Premier Benazir
Bhutto, Pakistani and Swiss officials said Thursday.
	   Geneva Judge Daniel Devaud indicted Asif Ali Zardari last week.
Devaud has said he is checking Ms. Bhutto's ability to invoke
diplomatic or parliamentary immunity before deciding whether to
indict her as well. Devaud's investigation has also covered Mrs.
Bhutto's mother, Nusrat Bhutto.
	   The documents, given to the embassy by federal police this week,
included a letter from Devaud, the Pakistan Embassy said in a
statement. The embassy is passing them to Pakistani courts handling
cases against Ms. Bhutto and her family.
	   The Pakistan government alleges that kickbacks from Pakistani
government contracts flowed to Ms. Bhutto and Zardari through
companies based in the British Virgin Islands.
	   Last month, Devaud indicted three Swiss citizens. Two were
executives of companies that did business with Pakistan; the other
was a lawyer who served as Bhutto's and Zardari's agent in
Switzerland.
	   Ms. Bhutto was ousted in November 1996 on charges of corruption
and misrule, which she claims are concocted by political opponents.
Zardari was widely blamed for her downfall.
	   Swiss authorities say they have found about 20 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 13.8 million) in accounts belonging to Ms. Bhutto and
her family. The accounts are frozen in seven Geneva banks.

Chechnya's president survives assassination attempt

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president escaped with minor
injuries from an assassination attempt Thursday that killed his top
bodyguard and destroyed several cars in his motorcade.
	   A car bomb exploded while President Aslan Maskhadov was
traveling through the streets of Grozny, escalating an already
tense situation in the rebel region.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maskhadov
blamed Russia's secret services or Chechen warlords who are vying
for power.
	   Suspicion also fell on Islamic militants who have been feuding
with Maskhadov's government in recent weeks.
	   At least two cars in the president's motorcade were completely
burned and the four-wheel-drive in which he was riding was badly
damaged. The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments and a
large crater was left in the road.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   Maskhadov suffered only a minor knee injury, but his top
bodyguard was killed and six others were wounded, the president
told a news conference shortly after the attack.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who appeared well.
``To my great regret, my best bodyguard was killed.''
	   In a televised address later Thursday, Maskhadov blamed Russian
secret services and their local allies for the attack. But he also
mentioned maverick Chechen leaders ``who are interested in taking
over the president's place,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Other potential suspects include Islamic fundamentalists, who
have recently become target of a government crackdown.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis, who want to
build a state based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of Wahhabis.
	   And, police were looking into possible connections with another
bomb explosion on a Chechen road, which killed one police officer
Monday night and injured four, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild an economy shattered by the
1994-96 war of independence from Russia.
	   ``A large number of field commanders refuse to go along with the
attempt to eliminate their power, their influence, and, in effect,
eliminate the lawlessness that has been gripping Chechnya over the
past two years,'' prominent lawmaker Vladimir Lysenko was quoted as
saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Maskhadov a telegram
expressing ``deep concern and outrage'' over the attack, Yeltsin's
press service said.

Lebanese minister retracts statement on slain Bahraini
</HEADLINE>

was an agent, not that Bahrain confirmed he was; EDITS in 5th graf

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's foreign minister on Thursday
retracted a statement that a man found shot dead in a mountain town
this week was a Bahraini intelligence agent.
	   ``Preliminary information had indicated that the slain Bahraini
(was an intelligence agent),'' a statement issued by Foreign
Minister Fares Bweiz's office said. But the Bahraini foreign
minister ``did not confirm this, pending more accurate information
on this subject,'' the terse statement added.
	   It did not elaborate.
	   On Wednesday, Bweiz had said that ``it became apparent'' from
conversations with Bahrain officials that the victim dead found
Monday was an intelligence agent. In remarks carried by Lebanon's
official National News Agency, he also said ``information in our
possession'' showed the man was an agent.
	   Lebanese newspaper reports identified the victim as Tawfik
Abdel-Nabi al-Baharna. Bahrain confirmed the name but denied that
he had any link with the country's security apparatus. However,
Bahrain also did not say what he was doing in Lebanon.
	   Al-Baharna's body was found in Beit Mery town with a gunshot
wound to his head and a pistol in his left hand to imply that he
committed suicide.
	   Local media reports said police investigators were acting on two
theories: the victim was either spying on exiled Bahraini
dissidents, or he ran into heavy losses at a casino and that
somehow was a motive behind his death, be it suicide or murder.
	   Al-Baharna was staying at a Beit Mery hotel.
	   The As-Safir reported Thursday that according to investigators
al-Baharna was a regular customer at the casino.

Germany says it mistakenly hired Stasi agent as president's
</HEADLINE>
interpreter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A security lapse led Germany's Foreign
Ministry to hire a former agent of East Germany's secret police to
translate for the German president, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Ministry spokesman Markus Ederer confirmed a report in the daily
Sueddeutsche Zeitung that the former Stasi agent translated for
President Roman Herzog during his trip this week to Denmark.
	   Ederer said there had been a lapse in the agency's security
checks, and that the freelance interpreter would not be hired
again. As a former Stasi agent, the man has loyalties ``that are
not those that we expect from our colleagues,'' Ederer said.
	   The newspaper said 44-year-old Olaf Schlaak once worked as an
interpreter for East German leader Erich Honecker and also worked
for the Stasi under the code name ``Eberhard.''

	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios made it look
easy, Boris Becker struggled and cursed, but both claimed victories
Thursday at the Mercedes Cup.
	   Now the two former world no. 1's will face each other in
Friday's quarterfinals at the dlrs 1.04 million event, with each
having something special at stake.
	   Rios, who would vault past Pete Sampras to the top spot on the
ATP computer if he reaches the final, proved too steady for
Germany's Hendrik Dreekman in a 6-3, 6-4 win.
	   Becker, still looking for that elusive first clay court title of
his long career, needed two hours, 8 minutes and several outbursts
of temper to oust Spain's Felix Mantilla, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   ``He was my toughest opponent so far,'' said Becker. ``But
tomorrow against Rios, I'm going to have to lift my game a notch.''
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya also breezed into the
quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win against Dominik Hrabty of the
Slovakia.
	   Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, seeded 13th, advanced with a 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 win over compatriot Fernando Meligini, while No. 5 Karol
Kucera of Slovakia downed Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson, 6-1, 6-3.
	   Becker complained bitterly to the umpire about being disturbed
by Mantilla's loud grunts, which came long after the Spaniard had
hit the ball.
	   He also complained directly to the Spaniard with the dyed-blonde
hair.
	   ``We exchanged a couple of words out there _ but they came from
both sides,'' said Becker.
	   But Becker, despite struggling with his serve and temper, saved
his best tennis against the world No. 14 for the last rallies of
both sets.
	   In the match's most spectacular exchange, Becker and Mantilla
traded drop shots and lightning volleys at the net before the
German emerged with a 5-1 lead in the first set tie break.
	   Becker needed a net roller to gain a 6-5 break in the second
set, but had put himself in position for the crucial point by
rifling several forehand winners.
	   ``I could have lost this match, but I was always at my best when
it counted,'' said Becker, whose impressive play lately comes
despite having cut back on tournaments as he eases into retirement.
	   With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104 F) courtside,
Rios jumped on the 23-year-old Dreekmann's mistakes and was never
really challenged.
	   Dreekmann lone chance to turn around the match against the
world's second-ranked player disappeared when he failed to gain a
break while trailing at 3-4 in the final set.
	   Becker beat Rios two weeks ago in the semifinals of the Swiss
Open, kindling his hopes of finally claiming a clay court title.
	   But he was beaten by Spain's Alex Corretja in the final _ the
sixth time he has come up one match short of a clay title.
	   Becker has claimed 49 career titles and won all the majors
except the French Open on clay. But he was a semifinalist twice at
Roland Garros.
	   Moya, the second seed, could not face either of the two former
world No. 1's before the final.

Gore tours Chernobyl, urges world to learn from the disaster

<TEXT>
	   CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al
Gore circled slowly over the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear reactor
Thursday, peering from the open door of a black military helicopter
at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident.
	   Gore inspected the hastily built concrete-and-steel shelter
covering the No. 4 reactor from the air, then landed to continue
his inspection of the so-called sarcophagus from the ground.
	   Chernobyl officials told Gore that the structure is
deteriorating, and could collapse and release radiation unless
urgently repaired.
	   Chernobyl ``looms like a menacing monument to mistakes of the
century now slipping away from us,'' Gore said later. He called it
``a hulking symbol of human decisions unworthy of our children.''
	   Gore is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Chernobyl,
which exploded in 1986 and spewed radiation over a large swath of
Europe.
	   He continued his visit in the nearby ghost town of Pripyat,
whose 55,000 people were evacuated after the accident.
	   He walked through a central square where weeds and moss grow
through the pavement, past abandoned buildings with gaping black
holes instead of windows. Rusting carousels and broken swings
greeted Gore at a former playground for Pripyat's children.
	   The vice president said little during his tour, apparently
deeply moved. But he broke his silence later, in a speech at Kiev's
Chernobyl museum.
	   ``I saw an amusement park that looked like a haunted playground,
with a large Ferris wheel rusted over. A merry-go-round turned
slowly in the wind... four-lane streets leading to nowhere. And I
wondered _ what has become of all the people who lived here? What
has become of the children?'' Gore said.
	   Gore, who has made environmental issues one of his political
priorities, said Chernobyl was not a lesson about the cruelty of
Communism, evil, or even the dangers of nuclear power.
	   ``What happened here in Chernobyl is capable of transforming not
only those who endured the tragedy itself but all of us _ if we
learn the lesson that we are all connected,'' he said.
	   He urged India and Pakistan to abandon their nuclear arms race.
	   ``We appeal to the wisdom of the Indian and Pakistani peoples
and their leaders,'' he said. ``Sit down together, negotiate, make
peace in the name of your children.''
	   Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to shore up
the weakening concrete seal over Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 and shut
down reactor No. 3, which is still operating.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has promised to close
Chernobyl by 2000, but says he needs about dlrs 1.2 billion to
compensate for lost energy capacity.
	   Kuchma said Thursday that he and Gore have decided to call a
conference of private donors to raise funds to strengthen the
sarcophagus. That job is expected to cost dlrs 750 million, of
which Ukraine has so far secured only dlrs 390 million from foreign
governments.
	   Gore and Kuchma, who co-chair a bilateral cooperation
commission, also agreed to set up a joint laboratory to study the
effects of radiation at Chernobyl.
	   The Chernobyl visit followed meetings Wednesday in which the two
leaders tackled Ukraine's deep economic troubles. The United States
has expressed displeasure with the pace of economic reform, and had
threatened to withhold part of its dlrs 225 million in aid for
1998. Ukraine is the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid.
	   Gore spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in Moscow late in
the day. He plans to meet with Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Friday, and urge Russian lawmakers to ratify the START
II nuclear arms reduction treaty.

Twenty tons of shellfish seized in Naples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Italian police on Thursday seized 20 tons
of oysters, mussels and clams which had been illegally cultivated
in the polluted waters of a port outside Naples.
	   The seafood was to be sold at a fish market in Naples for 170
million lire (around dlrs 95,000), police said.
	   Salads and pasta featuring clams and mussels are popular dishes
in restaurants and homes along Italy's coast, but shellfish which
absorb pollutants can cause serious illness when eaten.

Chilean striker arrives in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Chilean striker Marcelo Salas, who will lead Lazio
offense in the next Serie A campaign, arrived in Rome Thursday
almost unnoticed.
	   There were a few Lazio officials to welcome the Latin American
star at Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci airport as fans of the Roman team
were kept away by published reports that Salas would arrive over
the weekend.
	   ``I'm anxious to meet my new teammates and begin training at the
orders of coach (Sven Goran) Eriksson,'' Salas said before being
driven away in a luxury car through a side exit.
	   Salas, one of the top World Cup scorers in France, was expected
to join his Lazio teammates at the training camp of Vigo Di Fassa,
in the Dolomite mountains, Friday.
	   Meanwhile Lazio officials denied published reports that the
Italian club was late in paying Argentina's River Plate some
installments of Salas' transfer fee.
	   The next-to-last installment of dlrs 7 million will be delivered
as provided by the contract by the end of July, officials said.

Iraq fails to turn over document, UNSCOM complains to council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors found a document
detailing types of bombs and rockets that Iraq has said were used
to deliver chemical and biological agents but were prevented from
taking it, U.N. officials said Thursday.
	   The chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security
Council in a letter that Iraq's failure to turn over the document
contravened the inspectors' rights to examine and remove relevant
document, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   The incident was the first serious instance of Iraq's failure to
turn over information since a February agreement allowing
inspectors access to so-called presidential sites which Baghdad had
considered off-limits, said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N.
Special Commission, which carries out the inspections.

Sale of huge aluminum company called off for second time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Bidding was in US dollars &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The sale of a Venezuelan state-owned
aluminum company was cancelled Thursday for the second time when
the only bidder pulled out at the last minute.
	   A consortium that includes U.S.-based Kaiser Aluminum did not
immediately explain why it dropped out of the bidding for the
Venezuela Aluminum Company, which had a base price of dlrs 1.55
billion.
	   However, Alberto Poletto, Venezuela's privatization minister,
said one company in the consortium failed to come up with adequate
financing. The consortium informed Venezuelan officials of the
problem five minutes before the auction was scheduled to start.
	   The news sent the Caracas stock market dipping Thursday morning.
Venezuelan officials said they do not plan to try to sell the
company again in the near future.
	   The Venezuela Aluminum Company is one of the largest aluminum
companies in Latin America and accounts for four percent of world
production.
	   The other members of the consortium are Britain's Billiton PLC
and Venezuelan companies Sural and Alentuy.
	   The cancellation was the latest bad news for a country already
reeling from a 12-year low in oil prices. The government recently
slashed (dlrs) 1.6 billion from this year's budget, and is seeking
several billion dollars more in loans.
	   Oil accounts for about three-fourths of Venezuela's exports.
	   Like many Latin American countries, Venezuela has been selling
off major state-owned enterprises to raise funds, but has met with
resistance from labor groups who say the privatizations lead to
widespread layoffs.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government on Thursday drew up a
draft law that would allow those convicted on non-criminal offenses
to do community service instead of going to jail because of lack of
money to pay a fine.
	   The draft must still be passed by Parliament, but is almost
certain to win approval. Those opting for community service could
work a maximum three hours a day and eight hours on Saturdays in
hospitals, orphanages, schools and parks.
	   The law aims in part to reduce the strain on overcrowded and
underfunded jails and prisons.

Lukashenko attacks U.S. in diplomatic housing dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy denied on Thursday
statements by President Alexander Lukashenko that Washington
threatened to break diplomatic relations unless Marines could be
stationed at the American ambassador's residence.
	   Lukashenko's statements Thursday were the latest twist in a
dispute over a diplomatic compound in Minsk that the Belarusian
president claims as his property.
	   ``I am now receiving ultimatums: If I don't allow Marines to be
stationed around the (U.S.) ambassador's house in my residence, the
Americans will severe diplomatic relations,'' Lukashenko said.
	   ``In my residence, surrounded by a 4-meter (-yard) high fence,
the Americans are demanding to station their Marines.''
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said that while Marines guard the
embassy building in Minsk _ and all other American embassies around
the world _ there were no plans to post them at the ambassador's
residence in the Drozdy diplomatic compound.
	   ``Not a single statement by (State Department spokesman) James
Rubin included demands to involve U.S. Marines, or any other
military units, in the guarding of the Drozdy residence,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Lukashenko has a history of accusing foreign powers of plotting
against him. The allegations have largely been vague and not
accompanied by any evidence.
	   Lukashenko's government tried to evict the American and other
ambassadors from a diplomatic compound on the outskirts of Minsk,
saying urgent repairs are needed to the water and sewage systems.
	   The ambassadors say that under the Vienna Convention on
diplomatic relations, Belarus has no right to force them out for
any reason.
	   Lukashenko then claimed that the compound, located down the
street from his own home, was part of the presidential residence.
	   Ambassadors from several countries, including the United States,
were recalled for consultations to protest. The European Union and
nearly a dozen other countries have imposed travel restrictions on
Belarusian officials over the housing dispute.

	   U.N. inspectors must verify if Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Inspectors have given a high priority to finding documents about
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs because Baghdad has
denied the existence of any such documents.
	   The document ``points to the importance of documents, that they
do continue to exist, and the compelling need to do inspections
looking for documents,'' said Buchanan.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Netherlands, showing its win over the United
States was no fluke, and Australia moved into a tie atop Pool A at
the Baseball World Championships with lopsided victories Thursday.
	   The Dutch (2-0) got another strong pitching performance and
eight members of the starting lineup got at least one hit in a 12-1
rout of first-time entrant Russia (0-2).
	   At Palermo, Sicily, starter Jurrlaan Lobbezzoo struck out nine
batters in his 6 2-3 innings of work, allowing five hits and the
lone Russian run. He got plenty of offensive support as outfielder
Jeffrey Cranston drove in four runs, including a bases-clearing
double in the sixth inning, and third baseman Welfried Comenencia
had three hits and two RBIs.
	   The rout followed Wednesday's 3-1 win over the United States in
the opener for both countries.
	   Australia matched Netherlands' perfect record by beating
Nicaragua 9-2. The Central Americans fell to 1-1.
	   Paul Gonzales had three hits, including a run-scoring double and
a three-run homer, and first baseman Andrew Scott went 4-for-5 at
the plate for Australia.
	   Later Pool A games Thursday included the United States against
South Korea, and Canada against Taiwan. In Pool B, five-time
defending champion Cuba was to face South Africa. Other games were
Italy vs. Japan, Panama vs. Dominican Republic, and Spain vs.
China.
	   The top four teams from each group will advance to next week's
quarterfinals.

Probe finds no CIA link to Nicaraguan cocaine trafficking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE GEARAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A long-delayed report from the Justice
Department's independent watchdog found no evidence linking the
department or the CIA to the crack cocaine epidemic in the United
States.
	   The report released Thursday also found no link between the CIA
and three men at the center of the drug trade, as alleged in a
series of newspaper articles in 1996.
	   The San Jose Mercury News series concluded that a San Francisco
Bay area drug ring sold cocaine in Los Angeles and funneled profits
to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels for the better part of a decade. It
traced the drugs to dealers who were also leaders of a CIA-run
guerrilla army in Nicaragua during the 1980s.
	   ``After interviewing more than 200 people and reviewing more
than 40,000 pages of documents, we did not substantiate the main
allegations suggested by the San Jose Mercury News articles,''
Michael Bromwich, the Justice Department inspector general, said in
a statement Thursday.
	   The newspaper series reported that two Nicaraguan cocaine
dealers, Oscar Danilo Blandon and Norwin Meneses, were civilian
leaders of an anti-communist commando group formed and run by the
CIA during the 1980s. The newspaper articles traced the explosion
of crack cocaine abuse in the United States to a dealer named Ricky
Donnell Ross and said he was supplied through Blandon and Meneses.
	   The series also questioned the treatment of the three men by the
FBI and by federal drug, immigration and prosecutors' offices that
are all part of the Justice Department.
	   Bromwich's 15-month investigation turned up no evidence that the
three men got special treatment because of their alleged
associations with the CIA or the Contras, nor that any Justice
Department investigations were hampered or waved off.
	   Marilyn Ritchie, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, said Executive
Editor Jerry Ceppos was not available to comment on Bromwich's
report. In a letter to readers last year, Ceppos acknowledged that
the series had shortcomings.

Bristol calls in receivers: owner says it could be first of many
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ Once powerful Bristol rugby union club
called in receivers Thursday and faces closure unless new sponsors
come to its rescue before the new season starts in September.
	   The wages bill associated with the new professional era of rugby
union has virtually crippled Bristol, which was relegated to
division two after a disappointing last season.
	   Professional players face the prospect of not being paid this
month as receivers slash the wages bill by at least 400,000 pounds
(dlrs 664,000). Several key players are reportedly considering
transfers to division one clubs.
	   Bristol chairman Arthur Holmes said his club could be the first
of many to go to the wall.
	   ``I've got a nasty feeling that there will be a domino effect _
Bristol is the first major club to go and I think others will
follow,'' he said.
	   ``There's no money to be made in professional rugby and once
some of the owners realize that, they'll be gone like greased
lightning.''

Turkish Parliament allows deployment of soldiers in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - In an unanimous vote, Parliament on
Thursday authorized the government to send soldiers to Albania if
necessary if the situation heats up with Kosovo.
	   The authorization left it up to the Cabinet to decide ``the
needs, size, place and time'' of any kind of deployment.
	   The authorization will in the short term allow Turkey to send a
small group of soldiers to the southern Albanian town of Vlora to
protect a Turkish technical team working to repair a military
shipyard, port and army barracks, a foreign ministry official said
on condition of anonymity.
	   But the move would also allow the deployment of soldiers for
possible international peacekeeping missions in Albania.
	   Parliament rushed to authorize any deployment before it went
into summer recess.
	   Turkey has close relations with Albania and sees it as a natural
ally because of its predominantly Muslim population.
	   President Suleyman Demirel, who was in Albania last week,
pledged to support any kind of peace initiative to be undertaken
there regarding Kosovo, which borders on Albania.
	   Turkey is training some 600 Albanian soldiers there. Some 700
Turkish troops took part in an international peace force to ensure
the safe delivery of food and medicine during last year's anarchy
in Albania.

Spanish TV company Sogecable and CNN announce joint project for
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
24-hour news channel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The private Spanish television company
Sogecable and CNN on Thursday announced a joint project for a
24-hour news channel based in Madrid to begin broadcasting in
December 1998.
	   ``This agreement with Sogecable is a new and very important
dimension to the development strategy of CNN International,'' Phil
Kent of Turner Broadcasting System International was quoted as
saying in a statement distributed by the Spanish company in Madrid.
	   The ownership of the new channel to be called CNN Plus will be
equally split between Sogecable and Turner Broadcasting System
International, the company responsible for CNN's international
commercial operations, the statement said.
	   CNN Plus will be run and presented in Spanish by local
journalists. It will focus on national news but have access to
CNN's worldwide coverage, Sogecable said.
	   Sogecable is part owned by Grupo Prisa, Spain's largest media
group that also owns leading daily El Pais and the country's most
widely listened to radio station Cadena Ser. Sogecable owns 90
percent of Spain's major digital television company Canal Satelite
and cable TV company Canal Plus.

As aftershocks rattle coast, medics battle gangrene outbreak
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Amputation was the price of life
for some Thursday at a tent field hospital in Papua New Guinea,
where survivors of a series of deadly tidal waves were falling
victim to gangrene-infected wounds.
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the three
tidal waves Friday further added to the worries of residents of the
northwest coast. Small tremors _ called ``guria'' in the local
Pidgin language _ are common on the island and authorities said the
latest ones posed no danger of tidal surges like the ones that hit
last week, killing more than 1,200 people and leaving 6,000 missing
and feared dead.
	   Only about 2,500 to 3,500 of the 8,000 to 10,000 villagers of
this 18-mile (30-kilometer) stretch of coast have been found alive.
	   The tent hospital, where about 130 operations have been
performed since Monday, went into high gear again late Wednesday
after gangrene broke out among survivors being treated at the
hospital at Aitape, Slater said.
	   The two Australian field surgeons operated on 13 people,
amputating seven limbs, including the left leg of an 8-year-old
boy, who may yet lose his right leg as well. The group of survivors
had previously been treated at the town of Aitape, but the hospital
there has no surgeon and could not cope with the infections.
	   ``Some of those people would have died today if they hadn't been
brought here and operated on,'' said surgeon Maj. Paul Taylor, who
with his colleagues operated on the injured throughout the night.
	   Most injuries happened when the tsunami flung people against
trees or debris, fracturing bones and tearing open skin. Many
people died instantly; others died in the jungle before medical
help could reach them.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured now is infection.
Coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   In the disaster zone itself, the medical emergency has eased as
survivors have been moved to hospitals or to new villages erected
on higher ground.
	   Earlier fears disease that may break out around Sissano lagoon
caused by people drinking water contaminated by the thousands of
rotting corpses have not been borne out, said Squadron Leader Tony
Keeble, the medical officer in charge of air evacuations from the
stricken area.
	   ``The well was contaminated, but they are sensible people. They
know what is clean water and what is not,'' he said. ``Now, they
are pretty much left with the medical problems that they deal with
every day.''
	   In the remote jungle region, conditions such as malaria, skin
infections, diarrhea, parasitic worms and pneumonia are endemic, he
said.
	   Slater said the field hospital had treated many pneumonia cases
brought on by breathing seawater.
	   He said officials plan an inoculation program to be run by the
Papua New Guinea government, aid agencies and non-government
organizations. The program would use the the military resources
currently in the area to give shots for tetanus, tuberculosis and
other ailments.
	   A surgical team will also now be sent to Aitape hospital, said
Taylor.
	   The gruesome task of body recovery and disposal continued
Thursday. At least 30 bodies were found washed up on a beach in the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
west of the disaster zone, local police said, on condition of
anonymity.
	   The U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado said the aftershocks
reported by authorities and residents early Thursday apparently
were small. They were enough to rattle villagers and rescuers
alike, however.
	   ``I heard a sound like a C-130 and then felt this shudder
through the floor I was sitting on,'' said Lt. Brad Slater, an
Australian army officer at the emergency field hospital in Vanimo.

	   The document was being held by Iraq's monitoring directorate
pending a visit by Butler to Baghdad Aug. 2-5. It will be reviewed
then, with Butler Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   According to the letter, which Butler delivered late Wednesday
to the president of the council, U.N. inspectors came upon the
document during a July 18 inspection of the operations room of the
operations command of the Iraqi Air Force.
	   The room itself was declared especially sensitive by Iraq, and
only the chief inspector that day, Gabriele Kraatz-Wadsack, one
other inspector and a translator were allowed inside, the letter
said.

	   A safe inside the room contained a number of files, one of which

munitions were included. They were denoted as `special.' These
types have been declared by Iraq to have been used for chemical and
biological warfare agent delivery,'' the letter said.
	   Butler has told the council that more than 100,000 filled
special munitions _ bombs and rockets _ expended between 1981 and

Chinese general backs bold effort to shut down army business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior Chinese general on Thursday threw his
weight behind a bold drive to force China's army out of business,
telling his officers they have no choice but to go along.
	   The order for the military to shut down its vast commercial
empire was issued earlier this week by President Jiang Zemin as
part of a widening government campaign against smuggling.
	   One of the order's first victims appeared Thursday to be the
Hong Kong stock market, just one of the multitude of areas where
the People's Liberation Army has investments.
	   The military has bought heavily into Hong Kong firms linked to
China. The market index of these so-called ``red chips'' plunged
4.9 percent Thursday, partly on fears that the military would have
to dump its shares following Jiang's order.
	   Another index of ``H-shares'' issued by Chinese companies in
Hong Kong tumbled 7.7 percent.
	   The order to close down military commerce was a bold stroke for
Jiang, given his lack of a military background, the political clout
of the army and the breadth of its business interests _ ranging
from karaoke halls to cellular phone networks _ that have earned it
the nickname PLA Inc.
	   But Jiang won support Thursday from Gen. Fu Quanyou, the PLA's
chief of General Staff, who ordered ``every unit and every cadre''
to implement Jiang's decree ``without conditions.''
	   Speaking at a meeting of the PLA General Staff's Communist Party
committee, Fu also ordered the formation of a special force to
investigate smuggling in army ranks, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   ``No matter what unit, what level of official or what person is
involved _ they all have to be investigated to the full,'' Fu said.
``There must be absolutely no appeasement, no soft hands. The black
sheep must be resolutely eliminated.''
	   Calling the smuggling campaign an ``important political task,''
Fu also said the army must provide communication systems, motorized
transport and other equipment for use in the crackdown.
	   The way that the order to shut military businesses was linked to
the crackdown seemed to confirm suspicions that the PLA is mixed up
in smuggling _ a huge illegal business involving everything from
oil to luxury cars that is estimated to cost the government and
firms as much as 100 billion yuan (dlrs 12 billion) a year in lost
revenues.
	   The anti-smuggling campaign appeared to give Jiang and his
supporters in the PLA a convenient excuse to advance a drive to
modernize the army and make its 2.9 million members more
professional. It may also help Jiang overcome the resistance that
foiled similar attempts in the early 1990s to get the military out
of business.

Workers at nuclear research center hold protest over unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 3,500 employees of a top secret nuclear
research center held a three-hour strike Thursday to demand the
payment of back wages, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   More than 3,000 people took part in a rally in the town of
Sarov, where the Research Institute of Experimental Physics,
formerly known as Arzamas-16, is located.
	   The institute, about 400 kilometers (300 miles) northeast of
Moscow, is one of Russia's premier nuclear research sites, similar
to Los Alamos in the United States.
	   Workers have received no more than half their wages so far this
year and payments are one to four months late, Interfax said. Many
workers and pensioners across Russia experience similar delays.

Rescue workers comb villages for missing in wake of Slovak flood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two more dead in Czech Republic in penultimate
graf. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Rescue workers are combing villages
for up to 50 people missing after flash floods killed 36 earlier
this week in eastern Slovakia, said a local official Thursday.
	   Officials fear many of the missing died when a sudden downpour
flooded the Sabinov district of eastern Slovakia late Monday,
causing water levels in local streams to rise six meters in a
matter of hours, said Emil Alaxy, a district spokesman. The flood
wiped out area roads and bridges, trapping dozens of victims, at
least 50 of whom are still unaccounted for.
	   ``Its very likely that, in panic, many ran away to other
villages and they don't feel the need to register with the
authorities,'' said Alaxy.
	   The Czech daily Pravo quoted Slovak officials Thursday as saying
that water in the local streams had hit the highest levels in 500
years. It also said that authorities fear possible outbreaks of
epidemics in the region.
	   Worst hit was the village of Jarovnice, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) northeast of the capital Bratislava. Most of the victims
were Gypsies, also known as Roma, who lived in a settlement of
shacks that were completely washed away.
	   Hundreds of volunteers and soldiers continued cleanup efforts
Thrusday.
	   Heavy rains also flooded the neighboring Czech Republic
overnight Thursday, killing three people, including an elderly man,
Czech television said.
	   Two people missing were also reported missing and dozens of
others evacuated, said the CTK news agency.
	   It said the villages Dobruska and Opocno, 120 kilometers (75
miles) east of Prague, were hit the hardest.

Opposition local government officials boycott central government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The opposition declared on Thursday that
its local government officials will stop dealing with the central
government led by the Socialist Party to protest ``government
repression on the opposition.''
	   The decision was announced by former President Sali Berisha,
whose Democratic Party controls over 70 percent of the local
government. The boycott will completely cripple already hurting
public services, thereby increasing public discontent and possibly
driving people out into the streets.
	   Berisha's party is already boycotting parliament. Its members
stopped attending sessions early this month. They already stayed
away between last September and March.
	   The ruling Socialists, concerned about the deterioration of the
situation in the country's northern border with Yugoslavia, accused
Berisha of trying to ``destabilize the country''.
	   A parliamentary commission on defense called Thursday on all the
people _ particularly army officers and soldiers _ to be ``ready
and prepared for any unexpected situation.'' It declared that twice
as many recruits would be drafted this year than last, but no
figures were given.

Iran tested weapon that could reach Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials saying rocket blew up in flight,
uncertain if test was successful &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Iran tested a missile with a range of about
800 miles (1,300 kilometers), meaning it could hit Israel or Saudi
Arabia and U.S. forces in the region, U.S. officials said Thursday.
But they stopped short of calling the test a success, saying the
rocket blew up well into its flight.
	   ``It is a source of concern to us that they are pursuing a
program of this nature,'' presidential spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   U.S. intelligence agencies detected the test early Wednesday,
tracking the launch and path of the medium-range Shahab-3 missile,
officials said. ``We actively monitor their military capacity and
things like their missile technology,'' McCurry said. ``We
certainly detected the launch and certainly are well aware of (its)
characteristics.''
	   U.S. officials said the rocket blew up in the latter stages of
its flight. It is possible it was detonated on purpose after
Iranian controllers were satisfied with its performance, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the rocket
may also have blown up accidentally.
	   In either case, the rocket traveled far enough to convince U.S.
intelligence of its medium-range capability.
	   ``It traveled well down range before the flight ended,'' the
U.S. official said. ``I'm not saying 800 miles (1,300 kilometers)
but it was in a different area code.''
	   The Iranian missile test, though a negative development from the
U.S. and Israeli point of view, was not unexpected. CIA Director
George Tenet told lawmakers in January he was revising an earlier
estimate that Iran would gain medium-range missile capability
within a decade.
	   ``Iran's success in gaining technology and materials from
Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian
advances, means that it could have a medium-range missile much
sooner than I assessed last year,'' Tenet said. Privately,
intelligence officials told lawmakers and senior executive branch
officials that a test was expected this year. And U.S. spy
satellites in recent days picked up Iranian preparations for this
week's test.

	   Kraatz-Wadsack decided that rather than take the document, a
copy would be made. The senior Iraqi official present initially
agreed to a copy but then changed his mind, saying inspectors could
only make notes, the letter said.
	   Kraatz-Wadsack said this was unacceptable. The Iraqi official
seized the document and said the team couldn't view any more, the
letter said.
	   Butler spoke with Gen. Amer Rashid, minister of oil, and agreed
that the document would be held pending his visit next month, when
he and Aziz would review it.
	   The incident was the most serious to date since a Feb. 23
agreement brokered by secretary-General Kofi Annan and Saddam, to
allow weapons inspectors access into presidential sites.
	   Since then, inspections had been going relatively smoothly.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any formal action on
Butler's letter until after he briefs them on the Aug. 2-5 trip.
The council discussed the letter in informal consultations on
Thursday.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   The Australian, on permanent war crimes tribunal:
	   The world has waited more than 50 years for a permanent war
crimes tribunal. It will have to wait a few years longer, as the
agreement signed in Rome last week is far from complete. The
statutes signed by 120 nations must now be ratified by at least 60
signatories before the International Criminal Court can be
established, a process expected to take up to five years. Yet the
weekend agreement must be applauded as the partial realization of a
noble ambition. Human indignation demands that justice should be
meted out for the evils perpetrated under many guises.
	   The biggest blow is the failure of the United States to sign.
Some of its objections are justified, including the concern that
troops may be brought before the court on politically motivated
charges. Yet the demand of some U.S. negotiators of a ``100 percent
guarantee that no American would be tried under such as system''
suggests extraordinary arrogance, even though it may just be a
clumsy defense of U.S. sovereignty.
	   The best possible outcome would be that a war crimes tribunal is
unnecessary, and may have dreamed that it would be so by the new
millennium. Sadly, regimes continue to be willing and capable of
carrying out horrific offenses against their own people and others.
The new court must do more than simply act as an expensive salve to
international guilt at failing to act to prevent such crimes.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on U.S. President Bill Clinton's refusal to
sign International Criminal Court Treaty:
	   With the refusal to sign the International Criminal Court Treaty
after refusing to sign the Land Mine Treaty, the U.S. failed to
exercise its role as the moral leader of the world, the natural
complement to its political and economical leadership. ...
	   It's a unique interpretation of the role of a super-power: on
one hand the U.S. affirms its own rights, on the other it frees
itself of duties if they don't coincide with national interests.
	   This so-called ``theory of vital interests'' risks being a
boomerang for U.S. credibility and puts the U.S. on a collision
course with its historical and more natural allies.
	   The boomerang effect, particularly notable in the image it
created of the U.S., created an unprecedented diplomatic blunder at
the ICC conference. ...
	   A permanent court will become not only a factor of justice, but
a deterrent that would be supported, not boycotted by those who
feel like they are the world's police.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Cambodia's elections:
	   Campaigning candidates and party workers, mainly with the
opposition, have already met violence and intimidation in many
parts of the country. Recently, staff with the election control
commission were injured and some were killed while their polling
boxes were destroyed.
	   The tighter the competition is in the election campaign, the
more important it is to ensure the election is conducted freely and
fairly for political stability.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party controls bureaucracy, the
army and the police. Prime Minister Hun Sen should take stronger
measure to prevent the obstruction of campaigns and violation of
human rights.
	   Keeping itself at arm's length from the Western countries, the
Japanese government has resisted criticizing the CPP and has,
instead, asked Hun Sen to guarantee Prince Ranahriddh's safety.
	   The possibility of renewed violence in the closing days of
campaigning is worrying. The Japanese government should not relax
its diplomatic efforts until the election proceeds democratically
and a government comes on the scene with the full support of the
nation's voters.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on U.S.-Taiwan policy:
	   Despite American efforts to calm Taiwan, the renegade province
of China was shocked by the U.S. president's open pledge to uphold
the Three No's policy. Mr. Bill Clinton was referring to the policy
of saying ``No to Taiwan independence,'' ``No to two Chinas,'' and
``No to Taiwan membership in international organizations based on
statehood.'' ...
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the Taiwanese
anxiety an over-reaction. Yet, the Taiwanese were not alone in
feeling outraged. U.S. congressional leaders are trying to enact
new legislation that would balance the adverse impact on Taiwan of
Mr. Clinton's pledge.
	   The Taiwanese have good reason to worry. Over time, there has
been a discernible shift in U.S. policy towards Beijing. Changes
have occurred subtly but consistently. Though these changes do not
seek to abrogate any standing commitments to Taiwan, the underlying
spirit has been eroded.

South African President wants more trade cooperation with Mercosur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Nelson Mandela on Thursday urged
greater economic cooperation between South Africa and the four
nations in the South American trading bloc, Mercosur.
	   ``We have much to teach and offer each other,'' Mandela said in
an address at Argentina's National Congress. ``There should more
cooperation between countries in similar developmental stages.''
	   As part of his three-day visit to Argentina, Mandela will attend
a summit meeting of Mercosur, the four-nation South American Common
Market. The meeting of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay
will be held through Friday in Ushuaia, 1,945 miles (3,300
kilometers) south of Buenos Aires.
	   Mandela will be the first non-member president to address a
meeting of the Mercosur nations. He arrived here late Wednesday
with his new wife, Graca Machel, after a three-day visit to Brazil.

	   The Irish Times, Dublin, on murders of Quinn children:
	   Some nine days after the murders at Ballymoney (Northern
Ireland), it is still too early to say if the cruel deaths of the
Quinn children will come to mark some kind of turning point in the
troubled history of the North. But there is the perceptible sense
... that Ballymoney has already acted as some kind of catalyst for
change.
	   There appears to be a new determination among all people of
goodwill on this island that there can be no repetition of this
heinous deed. A great deal has changed. The supposed `settling-day'
at Drumcree has come and gone without the kind of mass violence
that was feared. The sinister forces who sought to foment what was,
in effect, a conspiracy against the community, appear isolated. The
crowds that once packed the fields around the church have melted
away.
	   The Church of Ireland has begun an impassioned debate about its
role at Drumcree. The Orange Order, meanwhile, is riven as never
before by division and bitterness. And those, like the Rev. William
Bingham, who speak of the need to recognize the civil and religious
liberties of all in Northern Ireland are clearly in the ascendant.
	   Several others have emerged with some credit. At Drumcree, the
British government and, not least, the (Royal Ulster Constabulary),
have demonstrated an admirable determination to hold the line and
to enforce the law. The contrast with events two years ago when the
police and government capitulated in the face of provocation, could
scarcely be more marked. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Scotsman, Edinburgh, on Iran and the West:
	   Restoring mutual dignity and respect to relations between Iran
and the West will be a slow and delicate process. There are
encouraging signs that it is well under way. ...
	   Trade concerns provide partial motivation for these gestures but
there is a more fundamental cause. The victory in May 1997 of the
reformist President Mohammad Khatami is the outward sign of
profound change in Iranian society. It is clear that many Iranians
are sick of the fundamentalist orthodoxy which has dictated their
lives for two decades. They crave a more tolerant interpretation of
Islam. Khatami offers hope and the West is right to support him
against the still powerful fundamentalists.

	   Liberation, Paris, on the Tour de France:
	   If the Tour de France is a trip through the country, isn't it
also a mirror of the country? A singular passion of the French, who
are prone to gush about it... Summer after summer, the Tour evokes
a timeless France, before TGVs and super-highways existed. A time
when the cyclists were cheered to every new stage in the race with
a rare minor push, trickery of little overall impact. The spectacle
was complete, the communion total. Isn't it symptomatic of our
times that bicycling, a sport so natural, so ecological and so
authentic is all the more damaged by revelations of doping? Doesn't
the Festina affair reflect a country that is Champion of the World
in taking drugs? Doesn't this reflect a culture where the cult of
performance and winning at all costs have been laid bare?

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Palestinians and Israelis:
	   Palestinians AND Israelis are fast approaching a fateful date.
By May 4, 1999 the final issues of the Oslo peace accord should be
worked out, as that is when the accords expire.
	   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has clearly stated that if
no progress is made by that date he will declare an independent
Palestinian state. Arafat is not only threatening, he's serious.
	   Hard-line Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will tolerate
living in a state of no-war no-peace for ever rather than see a
Palestinian entity emerge.
	   He threatened on many occasions to respond to a Palestinian
declaration of independence by unilaterally annexing parts of the
West Bank or reoccupying the autonomous areas.
	   The U.S. appears to have finally realized the risks inherent in
the continued stalemate in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations a
stalemate caused primarily by Netanyahu's delaying tactics.
	   The road is clear, immediate redeployment from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank coupled with negotiations over a third redeployment
and a parallel start of final status talks. This is what the
Palestinians, Jordan, Egypt the U.S. and the EU have been urging
Netanyahu to do. Will he?
	    &UR; ___
	   Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on International Criminal
Court
	   A great small step.
	   The institution set up in Rome will deliver no visible results
for a long time. It will be years before it meets and opens legal
proceedings, and the extension of its jurisdiction across the globe
is not foreseeable.
	   Even so, the apparently pragmatic conclusion that the court
isn't much use is itself unrealistic...
	   The conviction that impunity for crimes against humanity is not
only morally unacceptable, but also has a disastrous effect on the
development of democracy, has now found a place in political
calculations outside Europe.
	   At the conference, countries such as South Africa, Argentina and
Jordan played active roles. Burundi and other developing nations
are participating.
	   The court has found a place in all parts of the world _ so the
first condition for it to be useful has been fulfilled.
	   The second aspect is that European nations resisted U.S.
pressure at least enough to prevent the court becoming a dud.
	   It has a basic independence and relevant jurisdiction.
	   This firmness is not just an act of defiance against the latest
arrogant display of U.S. supremacy.

Earnings fall 8 percent, plans to cut work force by 1,500
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPLEWOOD, Minnesota (AP) _ Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Co. is eliminating 1,500 jobs, or about 2 percent of its work
force, by the end of the year.
	   The company, also known as 3M, disclosed the plans Thursday in
reporting that its second-quarter earnings fell nearly 8 percent in
part because of the Asian financial woes and the strong dollar.
	   Eighty to 90 percent of the job cuts from its worldwide work
force of about 75,000 will be made through attrition, a company
spokesman said.
	   The cuts are aimed at improving productivity.
	   3M earned dlrs 386 million, or 94 cents per common share on a
diluted basis, in the April-June period compared with dlrs 418
million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.
	   Sales were dlrs 3.77 billion, down 1.2 percent from dlrs 3.8
billion a year earlier.
	   Last month, company officials said earnings would be as much as
10 percent lower in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed by First
Call Corp. were looking for earnings per share of about 92 cents.
	   In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 3M shares were
down dlrs 1.18 /34 a share at dlrs 79.25 after rising earlier in
the session.
	   The Maplewood-based maker of Scotch brand tape and Post-it Notes
said it expects higher second-half earnings, with full-year 1998
per-share earnings similar to last year, excluding the 1997 gain on
the sale of the company's outdoor advertising business.
	   ``We're assuming that the economic troubles in the Asia Pacific
area will persist, that the growth of the U.S. economy will
continue to moderate, and that the U.S. dollar will remain
strong,'' said L.D. DeSimone, chairnman and chief executive.
	   Changes in currency exchange rates reduced earnings for the
quarter by 12 cents a share and sales by 5 percent.
	   The company also had softness in its U.S. businesses that serve
the electronics, transportation safety and industrial tape markets,
DeSimone said.
	   For the first six months, 3M earned dlrs 786 million, or dlrs
1.92 per share, compared with dlrs 828 million, or dlrs 1.96 per
share, last year. Sales were down about 1 percent to dlrs 7.47
billion from dlrs 7.53 billion a year ago.

Mexico's Telmex eyes expansion in Brazil, Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Communications giant Telefonos de Mexico SA
says it is considering plans to launch cellular operations in
Brazil and expand in Central America.
	   Telmex's chief financial officer, Alfredo Cerezo, said Wednesday
the company is considering a joint bid with SBC Communications Inc.
for cellular businesses of Brazil's state-owned Telecomunicacoes
Brasileiros SA, known as Telebras. SBC is a major Telmex
shareholder.
	   Cerezo told analysts during a conference call the 12 pieces of
Telebras will be privatized July 29 for a minimum of about dlrs 12
billion.
	   Telmex continues to eye Central America, Cerezo said. The
Guatemalan government in December rejected Telmex's dlrs 529
million offer for a 95 percent stake in Empresa Guatemalteca de
Telecomunicaciones, or Guatel.
	   Telmex has also bid for a state-run cellular company in El
Salvador, Intel.
	   Telmex also wants to launch U.S. operations in a joint venture
with Sprint Corp. but plans have been delayed by regulatory
hurdles.
	   AT and T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. have objected to the
U.S. Federal Communications Commission, arguing rules in Mexico are
stacked in Telmex's favor.
	   The U.S. ``will represent an interesting source of revenue'' for
Telmex, although not in the first two years of operation, Cerezo
said. He declined to offer more specific projections.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Chile's Marcelo Rios made it look
easy, Boris Becker struggled and cursed, but both claimed victories
Thursday at the Mercedes Cup.
	   Now the two former world no. 1's will face each other in
Friday's quarterfinals at the dlrs 1.04 million event, with each
having something special at stake.
	   Rios, who would vault past Pete Sampras to the top spot on the
ATP computer if he reaches the final, proved too steady for
Germany's Hendrik Dreekman in a 6-3, 6-4 win.
	   Becker, still looking for that elusive first clay court title of
his long career, needed two hours, 8 minutes and several outbursts
of temper to oust Spain's Felix Mantilla, 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   ``He was my toughest opponent so far,'' said Becker. ``But
tomorrow against Rios, I'm going to have to lift my game a notch.''
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya also breezed into the
quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-2 win against Dominik Hrabty of the
Slovakia.
	   Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten, seeded 13th, advanced with a 7-6
(7-5), 6-4 win over compatriot Fernando Meligini, while No. 5 Karol
Kucera of Slovakia downed Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson, 6-1, 6-3.
	   Becker complained bitterly to the umpire about being disturbed
by Mantilla's loud grunts, which came long after the Spaniard had
hit the ball.
	   He also complained directly to the Spaniard with the dyed-blonde
hair.
	   ``We exchanged a couple of words out there _ but they came from
both sides,'' said Becker.
	   But Becker, despite struggling with his serve and temper, saved
his best tennis against the world No. 14 for the last rallies of
both sets.
	   In the match's most spectacular exchange, Becker and Mantilla
traded drop shots and lightning volleys at the net before the
German emerged with a 5-1 lead in the first set tie break.
	   Becker needed a net roller to gain a 6-5 break in the second
set, but had put himself in position for the crucial point by
rifling several forehand winners.
	   ``I could have lost this match, but I was always at my best when
it counted,'' said Becker, whose impressive play lately comes
despite having cut back on tournaments as he eases into retirement.
	   With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees C (104 F) courtside,
Rios jumped on the 23-year-old Dreekmann's mistakes and was never
really challenged.
	   Dreekmann's lone chance to turn around the match against the
world's second-ranked player disappeared when he failed to gain a
break while trailing at 3-4 in the final set.
	   Becker beat Rios two weeks ago in the semifinals of the Swiss
Open, kindling his hopes of finally claiming a clay court title.
	   But he was beaten by Spain's Alex Corretja in the final _ the
sixth time he has come up one match short of a clay title.
	   Becker has claimed 49 career titles and won all the majors
except the French Open on clay. But he was a semifinalist twice at
Roland Garros.
	   Moya, the second seed, could not face either of the two former
world No. 1's before the final.

German police arrest suspect linked to Dutch child-porn ring

<TEXT>
	   KOBLENZ, Germany (AP) _ Police in western Germany arrested a man
Thursday that they suspect of providing images of his son to the
child pornography ring uncovered last week in the Netherlands.
	   Police spokesman Werner Gehmann in Koblenz said the man was
arrested after witnesses recognized the son in Internet images that
were broadcast in a German TV report on the Dutch pornography ring.
	   Gehmann said the man was arrested in Neuwied, near Koblenz, but
declined to provide any other details, including the age of the
son.
	   The Netherlands is investigating a ring believed to have
sexually abused children as young as 12 months and spread the
images on the Internet.
	   Dutch police said last week that they had gathered computer
material last month from an apartment in the seaside town of
Zandvoort that contained images of the sexual abuse.

Iraq fails to turn over document, UNSCOM complains to council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs, REORGANIZES slightly. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors found a document
detailing types of bombs and rockets that Iraq has said were used
to deliver chemical and biological agents but were prevented from
taking it, U.N. officials said Thursday.
	   The chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security
Council in a letter that Iraq's failure to turn over the document
contravened the inspectors' rights to examine and remove relevant
documents, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   The incident was the first serious instance of Iraqi
noncompliance since a February agreement allowing inspectors access
to so-called presidential sites which Baghdad had considered
off-limits, said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special
Commission, which carries out the inspections.
	   U.N. inspectors must verify if Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf war.
	   The document was being held by Iraq's monitoring directorate
pending a visit by Butler to Baghdad Aug. 2-5. It will be reviewed
then, with Butler Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   According to the letter, which Butler delivered late Wednesday
to the president of the council, U.N. inspectors came upon the
document during a July 18 inspection of a room of the operations
command of the Iraqi Air Force.
	   The room itself was declared especially sensitive by Iraq, and
only the chief inspector that day, Gabriele Kraatz-Wadsack, one
other inspector and a translator were allowed inside, the letter
said.
	   A safe inside the room contained a number of files, one of which
contained a listing of munitions expended by the Iraqi Air Force,
the letter said.
	   ``On examination it became evident that, together with the
conventional munitions detailed, four particular types of other
munitions were included. They were denoted as `special.' These
types have been declared by Iraq to have been used for chemical and
biological warfare agent delivery,'' the letter said.
	   Butler has told the council that more than 100,000 filled
special munitions _ bombs and rockets _ expended between 1981 and
1988 remain unaccounted for. ``No documents or information on the
consumption of such munitions has been provided by Iraq,'' the
letter states.
	   The timeframe coincides with the Iran-Iraq war.
	   Kraatz-Wadsack decided that rather than take the document, a
copy would be made. The senior Iraqi official present initially
agreed to a copy but then changed his mind, saying inspectors could
only make notes, the letter said.
	   Kraatz-Wadsack said this was unacceptable. The Iraqi official
seized the document and said the team couldn't view any more, the
letter said.
	   Butler spoke with Gen. Amer Rashid, minister of oil, and agreed
that the document would be held pending his visit next month, when
he and Aziz would review it.
	   The incident was the most serious to date since a Feb. 23
agreement brokered by secretary-General Kofi Annan and Saddam, to
allow weapons inspectors access into presidential sites.
	   Since then, inspections had been going relatively smoothly.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any formal action on
Butler's letter until after he briefs them on the Aug. 2-5 trip.
The council discussed the letter in informal consultations
Thursday.
	   Baghdad says it has destroyed all its banned weapons but U.N.
inspectors want to verify the extent of the weapons programs
through documents and other evidence.

Appleby's wife dies in auto accident

	   LONDON (AP) _ Renay Appleby, the wife of Australia's U.S. tour
player Stuart Appleby, died after an auto accident outside London's
Waterloo Station on Thursday as the couple prepared to travel to
Paris on the Eurostar train.
	   A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said the 25-year-old woman was
crushed between two cars as she unloaded luggage from a
double-parked car at about 7.15am local time.
	   She was taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance but was later
pronounced dead.
	   The Scotland Yard spokeswoman said Renay Appleby became trapped
between the cars when another car reversed toward her as she moved
toward the kerb.
	   Hampton Traffic Police were still investigating the accident
late Thursday.
	   The couple was bound for Paris for a week's holiday between
Appleby's appearances in the British Open and the Scandanavian
Masters next week.
	   The couple had been married for two years and lived in Orlando,
Florida.

Tehran mayor gets five years, verdict victory for hard-liners

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court sentenced Tehran's reformist mayor
to five years in prison on Thursday in a victory for the hard-line
political rivals battling Iran's moderate president.
	   The mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, was also banned from holding
public office for 20 years and sentenced to 60 lashes for alleged
corruption. But the court said the flogging would be suspended
because of his social standing.
	   He was fined 1 billion rials (dlrs 330,000) and ordered to pay
another 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to the municipality.
	   Karbaschi _ who ran President Mohammad Khatami's successful
election campaign last year _ has been at the center of the
tug-of-war between the competing factions in Iran's Islamic
government, led by Khatami and the country's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   The verdict against the popular mayor was a show of force by
Khamenei's hard-liners, who showed they wield considerable power
despite their crushing election defeat.
	   The ultraconservatives dominate the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament. By law, the judiciary, the armed forces, the
intelligence services and the broadcast network, are answerable not
to the president, but to Khamenei.
	   Karbaschi's lawyer, Bahman Keshavarz, predicted the conviction
would be overturned, saying he would appeal within the 20 days
allowed.
	   ``I am 100 percent certain that the appeal will clear him,'' he
told reporters.
	   Karbaschi was accused of using public money to run Khatami's
election campaign. He has admitted to making mistakes but denied
that he ever stole money from the government.
	   The trial has often seen emotional exchanges between Karabaschi
and Judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei _ who under the law also acts
as prosecutor. But the mayor was not present at Thursday's session
and Ejaei took no part in the proceedings.
	   Outside the Imam Khomeini Judicial Complex, police and
firefighters were on alert in case the verdict sparked riots like
those that broke out in Tehran when the mayor was arrested in
April.
	   There was no violence this time, but public interest was high.
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that its
switchboard was jammed by callers anxious to know about the
outcome.
	   Since Khatami's election, the ultraconservatives have fought
back as he has tried to relax the strict Islamic rules governing
life in Iran, encourage a more liberal political atmosphere and end
nearly 20 years of hostility with the United States.
	   Besides initiating the Karbaschi trial, the hard-liners recently
impeached the interior minister, another Khatami ally. But in a bid
to avoid an open confrontation, they approved Wednesday another
Khatami nominee for the post.
	   The judge's statement that Karbaschi would remain free on bond
until the appeal also seemed designed to cool the atmosphere.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process, and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.
	   ``Everyone saw how flawed the system is, how wrong it is to have
prosecutor, investigator and judge all rolled into one,'' said
Ebrahim Yazdi, head of the opposition Freedom Movement.
	   Since Karbaschi took over as Tehran's mayor in 1989, he had
built a reputation as a no-nonsense administrator. He has built new
roads, sports facilities and parks in a city once known for its
pollution and traffic jams.
	   He made enemies among wealthy businessmen by raising taxes, but
the results have made him a hero to ordinary Iranians like Mohammed
Qaraat, a soft-drink seller who criticized Thursday's verdict.
	   ``If he was so bad then why was he allowed to remain in office
for nearly nine years?'' Qaraat asked. ``He served the nation, and
this is his reward.''

Rose flounders as Westwood shoots course record 63
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HILVERSUM, Netherlands (AP) _ Lee Westwood's two eagles and six
birdies in the first round of the Dutch Open Golf tournament gave
him a course record-equalling 8-under-par 63 Thursday.
	   But at the other end of the leader board English teenage prodigy
Justin Rose's first round as a professional on the European Tour
turned sour as he shot a 6-over-par 77.
	   Rose, 17, ended joint fourth in the British Open last Sunday
playing as an amateur and turned pro Wednesday to win a friendly
pro-am tournament here.
	   But, tied for 139th place here with a few golfers still out on
the course, he has almost no chance of celebrating his first pro
tourney by making Friday's second-round cut.
	   The top 65 players progress to the weekend's third and fourth
rounds, with level par or 1-under likely to be the cutoff mark.
	   Englishman Westwood holds a two-shot lead over Norwegian Per
Haugsrud, German Sven Struever and Englishman Jonathan Lomas, who
all shot 6-under-par 65s.
	   Struever was the unexpected winner of this 800,000 pound (dlrs
1,320,000) European PGA tourney last year.
	   Two of the favorites, American Phil Mickelson and Nick Price of
Zimbabwe, negotiated the undulating, heavily wooded Hilversumsche
course in 68 strokes to stay well in contention tied for 12th.
	   But 1996 champion Mark McNulty was one of the players who fell
victim to heavy afternoon showers, shooting a 78 including two
double bogeys in a back-nine 40.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Tim Floyd joined the Chicago Bulls Thursday, but
not as head coach _ not yet anyway.
	   He will become director of basketball operations, with the head
coaching job left open until an NBA labor dispute is resolved and
the future of former coach Phil Jackson and superstar Michael
Jordan become clear.
	   ``We are leaving open for Phil, Michael and Scottie (Pippen) to
return and defend their championship, while at the same time
providing a plan to move forward if they chose not to do so,''
Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said at a news conference.
	   A return by Jackson seems to be a long shot at best. At the
beginning of last season, Jackson had said: ``It would take wild
horses to drag me back'' for another season.
	   Telephone calls to Jackson's agent Todd Musburger were not
immediately returned.
	   Jackson declined, 4th graf pvs

Cronje hits 113 not out in South Africa 302-8
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Hansie Cronje crowned his 50th test
appearance with a majestic 113 not out to give South Africa the
first day's honors in the fourth cricket test at Trent Bridge
Thursday.
	   Cronje, only the second South African to appear in 50 tests,
propped the innings after three top order wickets had fallen for
just 68 runs.
	   South Africa's day was briefly soured by medium paceman Angus
Fraser, who grabbed 2-4 in seven balls with the second new ball as
the visitors slid from 292 for five to 302 for seven before
badlight stopped play.
	   Fraser, who removed Daryll Cullinan in his first over after
lunch, claimed the wickets of Jonty Rhodes (24), Shaun Pollock (50)
and Mark Boucher (4) after tea to finish with 4-42 in 19.2 overs.
	   But the day belonged to Cronje and South Africa after England
skipper Alec Stewart took a gamble by sending the Proteas in on an
evenly grassed Trent Bridge pitch.
	   The gamble seemed to pay off immediately as Darren Gough
dismissed both openers _ Gehardus Liebenberg and Gary Kirsten _ in
successive overs.
	   When Cullinan was out in the second over after lunch, it
appeared the England bowlers had vindicated their skipper's
decision to bowl first.
	   But England's joy was short lived as Jacques Kallis (47), Rhodes
and then Pollock rallied around Cronje's innings to setup the first
innings total.
	   The Cronje-Pollock stand was vital. They came together with half
the side dismissed for 196 and carried the side to 292 before
Fraser struck.
	   The sixth wicket pair added 96 runs in just 92 minutes as
Pollock raced to his 50 off 71 balls.
	   Pollock was dismissed with the second new ball soon after he
reached his 50, gloving a catch to wicketkeeper Stewart off a ball
that bounced disconcertingly.
	   The pair came together after Rhodes was given out leg before
wicket by English umpire Mervin Kitchen off Fraser.
	   The delivery hit Rhodes above the knee roll and appeared to
drift down leg side.
	   Cronje, easily one of the best players of spin bowling, made a
mockery of leg spinner Ian Salisbury, hitting him out of the attack
after just nine overs.
	   Salisbury, who replaced Robert Croft in the England line-up in a
bid to spark a change in the team's fortunes, was hit out of the
attack _ conceding 57 runs in nine overs _ inclusive of nine
boundaries and a six.
	   Cronje is the seventh South African captain to hit a century
against England _ his sixth century becoming the first by a South
African captain against England in 11 tests.
	   It was a chancy innings by Cronje, dropped on 44 by Mark Butcher
off debutant Andrew Flintoff _ who in his previous over had
dismissed Kallis.
	   In an overcast morning, Gough (2-71), had Liebenberg (13) caught
behind and then forced veteran left hander Kirsten to play on for
seven runs.

French Prime Minister urges Britain to join the single European
</HEADLINE>
currency

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ France's Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
called Thursday for Britain to join the single European currency,
and praised the country's Labor government for a more positive
approach to European integration than its predecessor.
	   ``I am delighted with this new approach,'' Jospin said in a
speech inaugurating Labor's Foreign Policy Center. ``I am sure it
will be followed in coming years, particularly in respect to your
country joining the common currency. For my part I hope that Great
Britain will play its full role in Europe.''
	   Although Britain has opted out of the euro currency, which will
come into circulation on Jan 1, 2000 for non-cash transactions in
the 11 European Union nations that initially will use it, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has said that he wants Britain to join soon
after if the conditions are right.
	   In a speech which echoed many of Blair's concerns, Jospin called
for the EU to become more democratic, with an enhanced role for
national parliaments, the European Parliament, trade unions and
business.
	   Europe must no longer be considered ``the province of
specialists, but rather the expression of a community of
citizens,'' Jospin said.
	   Jospin praised Blair's Labor government for signing the European
Union's Social Chapter of workers' rights, which was a manifesto
promise for the Labor government before it won national elections
in Britain in May 1997.
	   Labor's Conservative predecessors opted out of the Social
Chapter legislation in 1991, seeing it as a killer of British jobs
and economic opportunities. To date, only two laws have been
introduced Europe-wide through the Social Chapter, although the EU
is pushing for another five pieces of legislation to be added this
year.
	   Jospin said that his government had accepted a modified version
of the free market, ``but we have not forgotten that an economy
loses its `raison d'etre' when it stops serving mankind and
benefits only the few,'' the French prime minister said. ``We say
`yes` to market economy, but no to market society,'' said Jospin,
adding, ``I remain a socialist.''
	   Jospin also spoke about the close relations between Britain and
France. The two nations had fought many wars, but had also shared
ideas, institutions, techniques and works of art, he said, and each
now regarded the other as ``the favorite foreigner.''

</HEADLINE>
Libya &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia hopes a possible agreement to try to Libyan
suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 will end the
``abnormal situation'' in which Libya finds itself, a news agency
said Thursday.
	   United Nations sanctions were imposed on Libya in 1992 after it
refused to hand over two intelligence agents for trial in either
Scotland or the United States. They are accused of planting a bomb
aboard the flight, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing
270 people.
	   The United States and Britain are now considering a
third-country trial for the two Libyans, and their lawyer says they
are ready to hand themselves over for trial in the Netherlands.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin said he
hoped this ``positive trend'' would end Libya's ``abnormal
situation ... that has existed for the last few years,'' Interfax
said.
	   The sanctions are ``aggravating the situation in the Middle East
region, which is oversaturated with problems as it is,'' he said.

Former world champion boxer convicted of reckless driving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia (AP) _ Pernell Whitaker, a former world
boxing champion in four weight classes, has been convicted of
reckless driving and sentenced to jail time on the first of three
driving-related charges.
	   Whitaker was found guilty Wednesday on the reckless driving
charge and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 88 days suspended.
Judge William C. Bunch also suspended Whitaker's license and
ordered him to pay a dlrs 500 fine.
	   A lawyer for Whitaker said the boxer plans to appeal. He was
released on dlrs 500 bond.
	   Whitaker, of Virginia Beach, currently is suspended from boxing
for testing positive for cocaine. He has been undisputed
lightweight champion and has held pieces of the junior
welterweight, welterweight and junior middleweight titles.
	   In court, a Virginia Beach police officer testified that
Whitaker was clocked going 64 mph in a 35 mph zone on May 16.
Whitaker pleaded innocent and testified he thought the speed limit
was 45.
	   Bunch found Whitaker guilty after reviewing his driving record,
which includes failure to obey a traffic signal in 1996 and three
speeding tickets in 1997.
	   Whitaker is also scheduled to be tried Aug. 26 on a December
reckless driving charge, and then again Oct. 21 on a June 4 charge
of driving under the influence. A source at the time of the DUI
arrest said Whitaker's blood-alcohol level tested at .13, well
above the legal limit of .08.
	   Whitaker's boxing suspension is scheduled to end Sept. 11.

acquire the Admiral Gorshkov, which was built in 1982 for Russia's
northern fleet, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The sale is part of new agreements between Russia and India to
shift their military relationship from outright purchases to joint
development of military hardware.
	   The Soviet Union was India's closest ally during the Cold War,
supplying most of its military equipment.
	   India's ambassador to Moscow said Russia and India will sign a
new defense cooperation agreement, running to 2010, in December.
	   The agreement will be signed when President Boris Yeltsin visits
India, Ambassador Ranendra Sen said, according to Interfax.

Volkswagen to suspend production to reduce inventory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With lots filled with unsold cars, the
Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen on Thursday announced it would
suspend production for two days at the end of July to try to reduce
inventory.
	   ``The situation is critical,'' said Fernando Tadeu Perez
Volkswagen's public relations director. ``We haves 16,000 unsold
cars, four times higher than the normal level.''
	   The two-day halt is expected to reduce inventory by about 4,000
vehicles.
	   ``And if the market does not show any signs of improving,
production will have to stopped again in August,'' Perez said.
	   Brazil's auto industry, which includes Ford, Fiat and General
Motors, has a stock of more than 100,000 unsold cars, according to
National Federation of Auto Distributors.
	   Earlier this month, Ford Motor Company suspended production for
seven working days in an effort to adjust production to demand.
Fiat stopped its operations for 10 days.
	   The auto industry's sales dropped sharply last year when Brazil
introduced a series of austerity measures to counter the effects of
the Asian crisis.
	   A steep increase in excise taxes on industrial production was
followed by an equally sharp rise in annual interest rates, which
nearly doubled to 43.5 percent.
	   In a country where about seven of every 10 cars are purchased on
credit, the auto industry was hit especially hard.
	   Domestic auto sales during the first six months of the year
plummeted 23 percent compared to the same period in 1997, while
output decreased 15 percent, according to the National Association
of Vehicle Manufacturers.
	   This week, Sergio Reze, president of the auto distributors'
federation met with officials at the Finance Ministry to lobby for
a reduction in the excise tax industrial production as a way to
``reactivate the market.''
	   ``They said they would study a reduction but didn't promise
anything,'' Reze said.
	   The Estado news agency Thursday quoted unidentified sources as
saying the government had agreed to an excise tax reduction and
that the measure would be announced as soon as studies were
completed.
	   The federal tax bureau would neither deny or confirm the report.
	   Reze said a more radical way to reduce stock was to ``shut down
all factories for 30 days.''
	   Earlier this month, he said automakers ``flooded the market''
with vehicles in an attempt to recover the heavy investments made
over the past few years.
	   ``Their expectations, however, were frustrated by wary consumers
worried that the economy will suffer some kind of setback,'' Reze
added.

Both sides charge atrocities in Kosovo conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbs and Kosovo Albanians accused
each other Thursday of summary executions, beatings and other
atrocities during the fierce fighting for a central town.
	   New tragedy appeared to be developing in the aftermath of the
conflict in Orahovac, where Serb forces drove out separatist Kosovo
Albanian fighters in five days of fighting. Thousands of refugees
were flooding the nearby town of Malisevo, resulting in alarming
shortages of food, drinking water and other necessities, local
Albanian media said.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians, who want independence from the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic started a
crackdown on Albanian militants in late February.
	   With areas of conflict inaccessible due to road blocks erected
by both sides, it's difficult to assess the truth of conflicting
reports by the two ethic groups fighting for Kosovo. Such was the
case on Thursday for mutual accusations of atrocities in the
Orahovac fighting.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed,
including some dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
called Wednesday for an international investigation.
	   ``Eyewitnesses talk of huge massacres conducted by the army, the
police and paramilitary units,'' the group said. ``The situation in
Orahovac is catastrophic.''
	   Hundreds of Serbs sought refuge in nearby villages during
fighting, which ended before dawn Wednesday. Some of them spoke of
abductions and beatings.
	   ``Armed Albanians came into the village, killed one villager and
loaded seven of us women and eight men aboard a truck,'' said
Darinka Misic, from a village near Orahovac. ``One man raised his
head for a while and got a blow from a rifle butt.''
	   She and 34 other Serbs were handed over to the International Red
Cross on Wednesday by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Most had been captured six days earlier at the start of the
rebels' biggest attack in weeks. The battle around Orahovac ended
before dawn Wednesday when the KLA retreated.
	   According to Mrs. Misic, the captives were driven to another
village, Suva Reka, where the women were given bread and water by
their captors and the men ``taken away and beaten.''
	   ``We heard them scream,'' she said.
	   Desperate conditions in Malisevo were reported by the Albanian
language daily Koha Ditore, which said that 13,000 people had fled
Orahovac for the town, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army
about 16 kilometers (10 miles) to the northeast.
	   The newspaper said 75 people were crowded into a single house,
whose owner was down to two sacks of flour. Supplies of food,
medicine and clothing were rapidly dwindling.
	   According to the daily, a makeshift hospital has been set up in
Malisevo to care for the wounded. But medical supplies are scarce,
and there is no running water.
	   The village, which had a population of about 8,000, has been cut
off for weeks from normal commerce because of Serb roadblocks
between the community and Pristina, the Serb-ruled provincial
capital.
	   While having no specifics on Malisevo, the International Red
Cross reported Thursday that almost 20,000 people _ Serbs and
Albanians _ had fled the fighting in Orahovac. The U.N. refugee
agency said local ethnic Albanians named a refugee figure of about
12,000 for Malisevo and also said flour, cooking oil and clothing
were in extremely short supply.
	   The Red Cross said it delivered 5 tons of flour and more than
1,000 food parcels to Malisevo in the past few days.

Family friend to be questioned in Italian kidnapping case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAGLIARI, Sardinia (AP) _ Police investigating the kidnapping of
an Italian woman are seeking to question a family friend, an
industrialist who is suspected of keeping some of the ransom money
for himself, Italian news reports said Thursday.
	   Nicola Grauso, a Sardinian industrialist who reportedly acted as
a middleman, told RAI state TV he welcomed the questioning as an
opportunity to clear his name.
	   According to news reports, investigators were looking into the
possibility Grauso told Silvia Melis' family that bandits had
demanded an extra billion lire (dlrs 550,000), and then kept the
money.
	   Silvia Melis was abducted in February 1997 while her 4-year-old
son slept in her car. She was released unharmed nine months later
after payment of an undisclosed amount of money.
	   ``I realize investigators are frustrated because they have yet
to find the bandits who abducted her,'' Grauso told the Italian
news agency ANSA.
	   A lawyer representing the Melis family and a prosecutor will
also be questioned, news reports said.
	   After Melis was freed, her family expressed immense gratitude to
Grauso for helping resolve the case.
	   Kidnappings by professional gangs have long plagued Sardinia. At
least 500 cases have been reported in the past six years. Often
victims are held for many months, and several are missing since
1993.

Brazilian star unwilling to stay with Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian soccer star Edmundo wants to
leave Italian club Fiorentina and is ready to resort to FIFA for
breaking his contract, the player's agent said Thursday.
	   Pedrinho Vincecote, who traveled to Italy this week to discuss
the Edmundo case with Fiorentina officials, said the Brazilian
forward wants to rejoin his former club, Vasco Da Gama, following a
disappointing experience in the Serie A last season.
	   ``I hope the Florentine club agrees on Edmundo's transfer. He
does not want to return to Italy,'' Vincecote told the ANSA news
agency.
	   Fiorentina's president Vittorio Cecchi Gori, who recently
opposed transfer attempts by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta,
said he wanted to enforce the three-year contract signed by Edmundo
last year.
	   ``I hope Fiorentina changes its attitude and releases Edmundo.
Otherwise we are ready to resort to FIFA,'' the agent said.

Chechnya's president survives assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second bodyguard dying, report president was not
riding in his usual car, four hostages released in Chechnya &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president escaped with minor
injuries from an assassination attempt Thursday that killed two
bodyguards and destroyed several cars in his motorcade.
	   A car bomb exploded while President Aslan Maskhadov was
traveling through the streets of Grozny, escalating an already
tense situation in the rebel region.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maskhadov
blamed Russia's secret services or Chechen warlords who are vying
for power.
	   Suspicion also fell on Islamic militants who have been feuding
with Maskhadov's government in recent weeks.
	   At least two cars in the president's motorcade were completely
burned and the four-wheel-drive in which he was riding was badly
damaged. The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments and a
large crater was left in the road.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   Maskhadov suffered only a minor knee injury, but his top
bodyguard was killed and several others were wounded, the president
told a news conference shortly after the attack. ORT television
reported that Maskhadov was not riding in his usual car.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who appeared well.
``To my great regret, my best bodyguard was killed.''
	   Another bodyguard died later in a hospital, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   In a televised address later Thursday, Maskhadov blamed Russian
secret services and their local allies for the attack. But he also
mentioned maverick Chechen leaders ``who are interested in taking
over the president's place,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Other potential suspects include Islamic fundamentalists, who
have recently become target of a government crackdown.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis, who want to
build a state based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of Wahhabis.
	   And, police were looking into possible connections with another
bomb explosion on a Chechen road, which killed one police officer
Monday night and injured four, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Maskhadov a telegram
expressing ``deep concern and outrage'' over the attack, Yeltsin's
press service said.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild an economy shattered by the
1994-96 war of independence from Russia.
	   ``A large number of field commanders refuse to go along with the
attempt to eliminate their power, their influence, and, in effect,
eliminate the lawlessness that has been gripping Chechnya over the
past two years,'' prominent lawmaker Vladimir Lysenko was quoted as
saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Chechnya and surrounding regions have been plagued by
kidnappings, mostly by armed groups seeking ransoms. On Thursday,
four hostages were released, including a construction engineer who
had been held for more than a year, ITAR-Tass said, citing Russia's
Interior Ministry.

Scouts' sailboat capsizes: four reported dead, one missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strong wind, chances of survival of rescuer slim
in cold water. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rescue teams searched the Brittany coast Thursday
for a lone survivor after a sailboat full of French boy scouts
capsized, leaving at least four scouts dead, French radio reported.
	   A sailor on a pleasure boat who came to the boys' rescue was
still missing Thursday after the scouts' boat overturned with seven
aboard off the wind-blown coast overnight.
	   Witnesses said the Paris-area teenagers lacked adult
supervision, LCI television reported. Winds gusted at up to 60
kilometers (about 40 miles) an hour and a warning had been posted.
	   Rescuers who found three of the scouts alive searched for their
would-be rescuer, who went missing from his sailboat after he tried
to help the boys, France Info radio reported.
	   The missing boater's chances of survival in the 11 degree
Celsius water (52 degrees Fahrenheit) were slim.
	   Two helicopters and several boats aided in the search off
Perros-Guirec, on the northwestern end of Brittany, rescue
officials said.
	   A Brittany prosecutor opened an investigation Thursday into who
was responsible for the accident. The boys were aged 12-16 years
old.
	   ``We know that there was no adult on that boat,'' prosecutor
Philippe Astruc told reporters. ``Those minors, some of whom were
16 years old, did they have the qualifications? ... That's what I'm
trying to determine.''
	   France's main scouting organization expressed its condolences,
but said the group to which the scouts belonged was not officially
affiliated with their association.
	   French media reports said the group was a breakaway organization
close to the Roman Catholic church.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's fringes have long been rough, ragged
regions, but recently they appear to be fraying faster than usual.
	   A series of clashes and killings in recent days has underscored
the fact that the former Soviet Union remains troubled by deep,
volatile conflicts.
	   Some politicians, including likely presidential candidate
Alexander Lebed, have warned that unrest in Chechnya or other
regions could flare into open warfare and spread into other areas.
	   ``Some people think: Let the Chechens fight it out and
everything will be fine,'' Lebed said this week, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``It would not be fine. Everybody would
fight.''
	   Others see the upsurge as part of a regular cycle of violence in
these regions, where ethnic groups and historical grievances have
long been on a slow boil.
	   Here are some of the regions that are experiencing increased
violence.
 &UR; CHECHNYA
	   Chechnya's president narrowly escaped a car bomb attack Thursday
that gutted his car and killed two bodyguards.
	   The attack comes amid growing tensions between the government's
secular leaders and Islamic fundamentalists, who would like to rule
the southern Russian republic according to Islamic law.
	   Internecine conflicts have contributed to the republic's
lawlessness since the end of its war of secession against Russia
two years ago. Since then, Chechnya has largely governed itself
even though no country recognizes it as independent.
 &UR; DAGESTAN
	   Dagestan borders Chechnya and has been troubled by spillover
violence as well as its own conflicts.
	   On Wednesday, unidentified attackers fired grenades at the
offices of the mayor of Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala. Mayor Said
Amirov was not hurt in what he said was the seventh attempt on his
life, one of which left him partly paralyzed.
	   In May, gunmen loyal to the leader of a local Muslim ethnic
group, the Laks, stormed a government building, starting gunbattles
that killed two police officers. Wahhabis in Dagestan have also had
standoffs with police who have tried to disarm them.
 &UR; GEORGIA
	   Georgia's northern region of Abkhazia has been fighting a war of
succession since 1992. Although Russian peacekeepers have been
deployed in the region since 1994, clashes between separatists and
pro-Georgian forces are frequent.
	   Nine Russian peacekeepers were injured Wednesday when their
truck struck a radio-activated mine. Five Russian soldiers were
killed July 11 in a similar incident.
	   Georgia has accused Russian peacekeepers of being too
sympathetic to the separatists, and has suggested they may not
renew their mandate when it comes up for renewal at the end of the
month. Peace talks are stalled.
 &UR; TAJIKISTAN
	   Tajikistan's government and mostly Muslim opponents ended their
five-year civil war with a peace deal last year, but clashes
continue.
	   Four members of a U.N. observer mission were ambushed, shot and
killed on Monday. The president blamed forces trying to undermine
the peace agreement.
	   Various warlords continue to battle among themselves, and 15
people were killed in such a fight earlier this month. Clashes also
continue between government troops and remnants of the rebel
forces, and one battle in late April left at least 45 dead.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An aide to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic called a top U.S. envoy an accomplice to
``murderers'' on Thursday, amid American warnings of force as a
last resort to stop the Kosovo violence.
	   The unusually harsh criticism was directed against U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard by Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist
party. It appeared provoked by Gelbard's recent meeting with
Milosevic's political rivals.
	   ``Robert Gelbard, an accomplice of women and children murderers
in Kosovo and of criminals who kidnap civilians, supports terrorism
and terrorist gangs,'' Dacic told reporters in Belgrade, capital of
both Yugoslavia and Serbia, its largest remaining republic. ``It is
only logical that he also gathers the (political) scum ...
everybody who is against Serbia.''
	   Gelbard has been meeting with Serbian and Yugoslav politicians,
the opposition and ethnic Albanian leaders in attempts to find a
negotiated end to escalating violence pitting authorities against
Albanian guerrillas seeking to wrest Kosovo away from Serbia.
	   The European Union announced Thursday it would send a mission to
Pristina and Belgrade next week to seek a peaceful end to the
conflict.
	   In Washington, Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for
policy, told lawmakers that the U.S. administration also would like
a diplomatic solution to but has not ``ruled out'' unilateral
military force or participating in a NATO plan for action.
	   ``We are prepared to act alone if necessary,'' he said.
	   In neighboring Macedonia, NATO's secretary general said the
military organization continues planning ``a wide range of
options.''
	   ``Our obligation is to be prepared if necessary,'' said
Secretary General Javier Solana.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians who want independence.
	   With fought-over areas inaccessible due to road blocks by both
sides, independent confirmation of conflicting claims by the two
ethic groups fighting for Kosovo are difficult to confirm. Such was
the case on Thursday for mutual accusations of atrocities in
fighting for Orahovac, a central town taken by Serb forces
Wednesday after five days of fighting.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, reported 52 Albanian civilians were killed,
including some dragged from their homes and shot.
	   The ethnic Albanian Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
cited unnamed eyewitnesses talking of ``huge massacres conducted by
the army, the police and paramilitary units.''
	   Hundreds of Serbs also sought refuge in nearby villages during
fighting, which ended before dawn Wednesday. Some of them spoke of
abductions and beatings.
	   ``Armed Albanians came into the village, killed one villager and
loaded seven of us women and eight men aboard a truck,'' said
Darinka Misic, from a village near Orahovac. ``One man raised his
head for a while and got a blow from a rifle butt.''
	   She and 34 other Serbs were handed over to the International
Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday by the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   According to Mrs. Misic, the captives were driven to another
village, Suva Reka, where the women were given bread and water by
their captors and the men ``taken away and beaten.''
	   ``We heard them scream,'' she said.
	   Desperate conditions in Malisevo were reported by the Albanian
language daily Koha Ditore, which said that 13,000 people had fled
Orahovac for the town, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army
about 16 kilometers (10 miles) to the northeast.
	   The newspaper said 75 people were crowded into a single house,
whose owner was down to two sacks of flour. Supplies of food,
medicine and clothing were rapidly dwindling.
	   According to the daily, a makeshift hospital has been set up in
Malisevo to care for the wounded. But medical supplies are scarce,
and there is no running water.
	   The village, which had a population of about 8,000, has been cut
off for weeks from normal commerce because of Serb roadblocks
between the community and Pristina, the Serb-ruled provincial
capital.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross reported Thursday
that almost 20,000 people _ Serbs and Albanians _ had fled the
fighting in Orahovac. The UNHCR _ the main U.N. refugee agency _
said local ethnic Albanians named a refugee figure of about 12,000
for Malisevo.
	   The ICRC said it delivered 5 tons of flour and over 1,000 food
parcels to Malisevo in the past few days.

Opposition group says `yes' to Nigerian transition plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's largest pro-democracy group
cautiously agreed Thursday to cooperate with a plan by the
country's military ruler to hand over power to a civilian
government by May next year.
	   National Democratic Coalition chairman Abraham Adesanya
dismissed calls to boycott Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar's democratic
transition program announced four days earlier.
	   The coalition plans to participate in elections expected early
next year either on its own, or as part of a larger party.
	   ``NADECO is not going to boycott any elections,'' Adesanya said.
	   Abubakar said Monday he would bring democracy to Nigeria and
allow the free formation of opposition political parties. Elections
are to be held in the first three months of 1999.
	   NADECO draws its support from predominantly Christian and
ethnic-Yoruba southwestern Nigeria where opposition to military
rule is strongest.
	   The coalition is believed to be considering looking for partners
to form a larger bloc to give it a better chance of winning the
planned poll. NADECO has little support in predominantly-Muslim
northern Nigeria, where the country's military rulers hail from.
	   Some of the grouping's strongest backers are former followers of
the late Moshood Abiola, the presumed 1993 elections winner whose
sudden heart attack death behind bars earlier this month sparked
several days of rioting.
	   Abiola had been imprisoned in 1994 by Abubakar's dictatorial
predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, who died of heart failure in early
June, five years after taking power in a bloodless coup.
	   In the wake of the announced democratic transition, politicians
from across the country have been gathering since Wednesday to
discuss the formation of new parties.
	   Some other reforms announced by Abubakar included the disbanding
of the five government-sanctioned parties and cancellation of the
results of elections conducted during the Abacha years.
	   Abacha's five-year dictatorship was marked by an abysmal human
rights record, corruption and neglect.

Archaeologists say they've found 5,000-year-old temple in Iraq

<TEXT>
	   AL-NAMEL, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi archaeologists have discovered a
circular 5,000-year-old temple that appears to have been used by
Mesopotamians of a little-known culture, the head of the excavation
team said Thursday.
	   Burhan Shakir, an archaeologist with Iraq's Antiquities
Department, said the building, which is 600 square meters (720
square yards), was discovered in March.
	   ``We are certain this was a temple, but we still do not know
what gods were worshipped here and what kind of cult was
practiced,'' Shakir said.
	   The temple stands on a promontory overlooking the Tigris River,
320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Baghdad. It consists of five
circular aisles separated by mudbrick walls 2-meters (yards) thick.
The corridors rise about 6 meters (7 yards) above the surrounding
plain and then merge into a spiral staircase which leads to a
second floor.
	   That floor has been bulldozed by modern farmers building houses.
About 90 percent of the archaeological site is occupied by the
village of al-Namel.
	   ``The whole building was vaulted, but unfortunately
encroachments by farmers have left us no roofs,'' said Hazem
al-Najafi, a member of the team and an expert on Mesopotamian
architecture.
	   The entrance, one-meter (yard) wide, is still vaulted and leads
to alleys containing scores of niches in which the inhabitants
placed their idols.
	   Apart from the entrance, there are no openings or windows in the
building. The walls have scorch marks about every two meters
(yards). Al-Najafi said these came from torches used to light the
corridors.
	   The excavators have found no artifacts - no statues, pottery or
clay tablets - in the temple.
	   A nearby cemetery yielded 50 graves and artifacts including
cooking bowls, cups, pots, goblets, jugs, storage jars and
containers made of fine pottery glazed with colored geometrical
designs.
	   ``For the first time in more than 100 years of Mesopotamian
excavation, we find traces of two distinctive and culturally remote
civilizations appearing together in a grave,'' Shakir added.
	   The ancient inhabitants buried their dead with plain ceramic
items of the Sumerian civilization of southern Iraq as well as with
elegant vases decorated with flowers and animals that hail from a
little-known culture in northern Iraq.
	   The Sumerian pottery stems from the early dynastic period of
about 2,750 B.C. and the northern ceramics date to more than 3,000
B.C.
	   Sumerian civilization began to develop in southern Iraq in the
4th millennium B.C.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
rejected a request Thursday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
meet, and suspended further negotiations between the sides until
Israel accepted an American peace proposal, his aides said.
	   Israel insisted that only slight disagreements remained between
the two sides regarding an American proposal for an Israeli troop
withdrawal and that an agreement was within reach.
	   However, Arafat's aide Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated
Press that the negotiators ``have reached a deadlock.''
	   Thursday, Netanyahu sent his coalition chairman, Meir Shetreet,
to Arafat's office in Gaza with a request for a summit between the
two leaders to hammer out remaining differences.
	   ``My meeting was intended to give another chance to the peace
process and save the peace process. I put some new creative ideas
(on the table),'' Shetreet told the AP.
	   ``All matters should be discussed by Arafat and Netanyahu. I was
urging Arafat to hold such a meeting as fast as possible. We are at
a moment of truth and the prime minister is determined to reach
agreement,'' Shetreet said. The two leaders last met in October.
	   But Ahmed Tibi a senior aide to Arafat said no summit would take
place unless Israel was willing to accept the proposal in order to
move ahead in the Mideast peace process.
	   ``A meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu could take place after
the two parties reach an agreement on the American initiative, but
until now the Israelis are rejecting the initiative,'' Tibi said.
	   Both sides have appealed to the United States for help, but have
been rebuffed by the Clinton administration which says Israel and
the Palestinians should try harder to reach agreement on a West
Bank troop pullback without U.S. mediation.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for a gradual Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, to coincide with
greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan, but Netanyahu has
balked at the scope of the pullback and has demanded better
Palestinian security guarantees.
	   The Palestinians have said that in three direct negotiating
sessions arranged by the United States this week, Israel did not
raise any new ideas and that there was no point in resuming the
talks. The talks were widely seen as a last chance for Israel and
the Palestinians to reach agreement on a troop pullback.
	   Since then, Netanyahu has sent two envoys to speak with Arafat
and a third, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani planned to
meet Arafat Friday. Shetreet said he delivered new proposals in his
talks with Arafat Thursday and Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath said the message would studied over the weekend.
	   Despite the Palestinians' position, Netanyahu was optimistic
Thursday. ``We'll complete the negotiations, we'll have a success.
If the Palestinians have good will ... then it's a matter of very
little time before we can complete an interim agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said.
	   In another attempt to bring the United States back into the
picture, Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky told Israel TV he
spoke with U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
	   Sharansky did not detail the conversation but Israel radio
reported that Sharansky asked for U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the region for another shuttle mission, but Berger
rejected the idea.

AC Milan vice-president denies transfer reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The transfer of Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert is
unlikely either to Manchester United or Arsenal on the basis of a
21 billion lire (dlrs 12 million) bid, AC Milan's vice-president
Adriano Galliani said Thursday.
	   Galliani said the Milan club may agree on Kluivert's move to a
non-Italian club only on a higher transfer fee.
	   ``With bids at dlrs 12 million, Kluivert is not going to leave
AC Milan,'' Galliani said commenting on published reports that
Manchester United was bidding for the young Dutch forward.
	   Milan rejected bids for Kluivert made by Premiere League
champion Arsenal earlier this week.
	   ``If the situation does not change Kluivert will stay with us,''
Galliani added.
	   The player and the Italian club had apparently agreed to part
after the 22-year-old star turned a disappointment on his first
season in the Italian Serie A.
	   However Kluivert's impressive performances with the Netherlands
in the World Cup have prompted second thoughts on the Italian side.

Flash flood hits Polish resort, killing seven

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Flood waters from heavy storms swept
through a resort area in southwestern Poland, killing at least
seven people, officials said Thursday.
	   The overnight flash floods damaged more that 100 houses in the
small towns of Duszniki Zdroj, Szczytna and Polanica Zdroj near the
border with the Czech Republic, said Piotr Michalski, spokesman for
Walbrzych province.
	   Two men were reported drowned in Duszniki after the water level
in the Dusznica Bystrzycka river jumped 1.5 meters (60 inches),
overflowed its banks and flooded the town, police spokeswoman
Halina Wieczor said. Police found two other victims in Szczytna,
some 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Warsaw, the
spokeswoman said.
	   By Thursday evening, three additional bodies had been found in
the area, Walbrzych Provincial Police commander Michal Howorski
said.
	   About 90 residents were evacuated overnight, Michalski said.
Waters receded quickly, but helicopters continued to bring people
out Thursday, he said.
	   The wave was not very high, reaching about one meter (one yard)
above the ground floor of the houses. But it came through fast and
with great force, causing a lot of damage, Michalski said.
	   A road to the border crossing with the Czech Republic at Kudowa
Zdroj was temporarily closed by the flooding and police set a
detour for cars heading for the crossing.
	   The road was reopened late Thursday, the police commander said.
	   Floods in southern and western Poland last summer killed 55
people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.

Brazilian star unwilling to stay with Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Brazilian soccer star Edmundo wants to
leave Italian club Fiorentina and is ready to appeal to FIFA to
break his contract, the player's agent said Thursday.
	   Pedrinho Vincecote, who traveled to Italy this week to discuss
the Edmundo case with Fiorentina officials, said the Brazilian
forward wants to rejoin his former club, Vasco Da Gama, following a
disappointing experience in the Serie A last season.
	   ``I hope the Florentine club agrees on Edmundo's transfer. He
does not want to return to Italy,'' Vincecote told the ANSA news
agency.
	   Fiorentina's president Vittorio Cecchi Gori, who recently
opposed transfer attempts by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta,
said he wanted to enforce the three-year contract signed by Edmundo
last year.
	   ``I hope Fiorentina changes its attitude and releases Edmundo.
Otherwise we are ready to resort to FIFA,'' the agent said.

AC Milan vice-president denies transfer reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The transfer of Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert is
unlikely either to Manchester United or Arsenal on the basis of a
21 billion lire (dlrs 12 million) bid, AC Milan's vice-president
Adriano Galliani said Thursday.
	   Galliani said the Milan club may agree on Kluivert's move to a
non-Italian club only on a higher transfer fee.
	   ``With bids at dlrs 12 million, Kluivert is not going to leave
AC Milan,'' Galliani said commenting on published reports that
Manchester United was bidding for the young Dutch forward.
	   Milan rejected bids for Kluivert made by Premiere League
champion Arsenal earlier this week.
	   ``If the situation does not change Kluivert will stay with us,''
Galliani added.
	   The player and the Italian club had apparently agreed to part
after the 22-year-old star turned a disappointment on his first
season in the Italian Serie A.
	   However Kluivert's impressive performances with the Netherlands
in the World Cup have prompted second thoughts on the Italian side.

Chechnya's president survives assassination attempt

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president escaped with minor
injuries from an assassination attempt Thursday that killed two
bodyguards and destroyed several cars in his motorcade.
	   A car bomb exploded while President Aslan Maskhadov was
traveling through the streets of Grozny, escalating an already
tense situation in the rebel region.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maskhadov
blamed Russia's security services or Chechen warlords who are vying
for power.
	   Suspicion also fell on Islamic militants who have been feuding
with Maskhadov's government in recent weeks.
	   At least two cars in the president's motorcade were completely
burned and the four-wheel-drive in which he was riding was badly
damaged. The car used in the blast was reduced to fragments and a
large crater was left in the road.
	   Cartridge shells littered the street where the blast occurred _
apparently the result of shootings that took place in the aftermath
of the explosion.
	   Maskhadov suffered only a minor knee injury, but his top
bodyguard was killed and several others were wounded, the president
told a news conference shortly after the attack. ORT television
reported that Maskhadov was not riding in his usual car.
	   ``It is the fourth attempt on my life, and the first since I was
elected president'' last year, said Maskhadov, who appeared well.
``To my great regret, my best bodyguard was killed.''
	   Another bodyguard died later in a hospital, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   In a televised address later Thursday, Maskhadov blamed Russian
secret services and their local allies for the attack. But he also
mentioned maverick Chechen leaders ``who are interested in taking
over the president's place,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service denied involvement, ITAR-Tass
said, quoting spokesman Boris Neuchev.
	   Other potential suspects include Islamic fundamentalists, who
have recently become target of a government crackdown.
	   Chechens have traditionally practiced a moderate form of Islam,
but the region also includes fundamentalist Wahhabis, who want to
build a state based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
	   Last week, Maskhadov disbanded two military units controlled by
the Wahhabis after they clashed with other government troops.
Government patrols have been monitoring key roads in Grozny in
search of Wahhabis.
	   And, police were looking into possible connections with another
bomb explosion on a Chechen road, which killed one police officer
Monday night and injured four, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Maskhadov a telegram
expressing ``deep concern and outrage'' over the attack, Yeltsin's
press service said.
	   Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet military, won a
landslide election victory last year, but has been unable to end
the territory's lawlessness or rebuild an economy shattered by the
1994-96 war of independence from Russia.
	   ``A large number of field commanders refuse to go along with the
attempt to eliminate their power, their influence, and, in effect,
eliminate the lawlessness that has been gripping Chechnya over the
past two years,'' prominent lawmaker Vladimir Lysenko was quoted as
saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running its
own affairs since Russian troops withdrew at the end of 1996, but
Moscow insists that the territory remains part of Russia.
	   Chechnya and surrounding regions have been plagued by
kidnappings, mostly by armed groups seeking ransoms. On Thursday,
four hostages were released, including a construction engineer who
had been held for more than a year, ITAR-Tass said, citing Russia's
Interior Ministry.

De Klerk denies he lied about human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Former President F.W. de
Klerk, who negotiated the transfer of power in the last days of
apartheid, on Thursday denied lying about his knowledge of covert
police actions.
	   The denial followed allegations to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission this week by former high ranking officials that De Klerk
knew of human rights abuses ordered by government officials.
	   In a statement on Thursday, De Klerk said he never denied
knowing of covert actions in testimony to the comission last year,
but rather had denied he had been involved in ordering them.
	   De Klerk had insisted last year that he was unaware that
officials of the white-minority government authorized abuses
against anti-apartheid activists. He has also claimed the attacks
were the work of rogue operatives or of policemen who misunderstood
the government's policies.
	   Those denials provoked incredulity and tears from commission
chairman, Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu. De Klerk's National Party
demanded an apology from the panel under threat of a lawsuit for
implying De Klerk had lied.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will allow De Klerk to
appear and clear up the contradiction if he wants to, an amnesty
committee official said on Thursday.
	   ``I think it is fair to give him an opportunity to react to what
has been said,'' Martin Coetzee, executive secretary of the amnesty
committee, told The Associated Press. He did not think the panel
would subpoena the former president.
	   On Wednesday, former Law and Order minister Adriaan Vlok said he
informed De Klerk about bombings and other illegal police acts
before 1994's first all race elections that ended white minority
rule.
	   Vlok, who served in De Klerk's cabinet and that of his
predecessor, President P.W. Botha, appeared in Pretoria before the
amnesty committee, where he is testifying about his role in the
bombing of a church headquarters and other buildings in the late
1980s .
	   A statement from De Klerk's office said: ``What he denied was
his involvement in the decision to blow up the building.''
	   Tutu and his panel have been pursuing the question of ultimate
responsibility for bombings and murders since the panel opened in
1996.

the accident, which took place near the Georgian military highway.
It said there were eight people in the armored personnel carrier.

Study: Post-op radiation therapy for lung cancer may do more harm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed for release until 2301 GMT; time set by source &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The common practice of exposing lung cancer
patients to radiation therapy after surgery may do more harm than
good and should not be used routinely, according to a study
published Friday.
	   Many lung cancer patients undergo radiation therapy after
surgery to treat any remaining cancer cells. But the results of
previous studies examining the effectiveness of the treatment have
been contradictory or inconclusive.
	   In the largest study of its kind, an international team of
researchers combined information gathered over the past 30 years in
nine studies involving a total of 2,128 lung cancer patients
worldwide.
	   Patients who had been treated with radiation therapy after
surgery were 21 percent more likely to die than those who only had
surgery, according to the study published in this week's issue of
The Lancet, a British medical journal. Researchers are unsure why
radiation therapy caused more deaths earlier.
	   About 900,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with lung cancer
every year, according to the World Health Organization.
	   Dr. Gordon McVie, director general at the Cancer Research
Campaign in London and a lung cancer specialist who was not part of
the study, said the research was authoritative and important.
	   ``It should be compulsory reading for chief executives of
hospitals. In many parts, this is routine treatment. It has been
assumed that it was a good idea,'' he said. ``I was unsurprised
that radiotherapy didn't prolong survival, but what I'm really
concerned about is that it could actually do harm. There is a very
clear message here.''
	   The patients in the study had non-small-cell lung cancer, which
accounts for 80 percent of all lung cancer cases. A total of 1,056
had surgery and radiotherapy while 1,072 had surgery alone.
	   The detrimental effect was worst in patients in the early stages
of the disease, the study said.
	   In those with more advanced but still operable lung cancer, the
study said radiation therapy did not seem to cause harm although it
also did not appear to help.
	   ``The 21 percent relative increase in the risk of death
associated with radiotherapy, equivalent to an overall reduction in
survival from 55 percent (for surgery alone) to 48 percent (for
surgery and radiotherapy) at two years, represents a substantial
hazard to these patients,'' said Lesley Stewart of the Medical
Research Council, which led the study.
	   Researchers concluded that radiation therapy should not be given
routinely to patients in the early stage of non-small-cell lung
cancer and that its role in the treatment of more advanced stages
of the disease ``is not clear and may warrant further research.''
	   ``There was some hint that it might prevent recurring tumors,
but that was heavily outweighed by the ill effects _ the increased
deaths,'' Stewart said.
	   In an independent commentary, also published in The Lancet, Dr.
Alistair Munro of Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, Scotland, said
post-operative radiotherapy doses are too high and that there are
``valuable lessons to be learned'' from the Cambridge study.

Canadian authorities fine two Asian firms in lysine scheme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada's Competition Bureau said Thursday it has
fined two Asian companies for conspiring in worldwide price-fixing
and market-sharing that made them millions of dollars.
	   The product at stake was lysine, an additive used in hog and
poultry feeds.
	   The convictions were a followup to a dlrs 16-million (dlrs 11
million U.S.) fine imposed in May on Archer Daniels Midland Co., a
U.S. corporation that pleaded guilty to participating in the
scheme. The fine was the largest ever imposed under Canada's
Competition Act.
	   Convicted this week under the same act were Ajinomoto Co. Inc.
of Japan and Sewon America Inc., a subsidiary of Sewon Co. Ltd. of
Korea. The companies were fined dlrs 3.5 million (dlrs 2.4 million
U.S.) and dlrs 70,000 (dlrs 48,000 U.S.) respectively.
	   ADM conspired with seven companies between 1992 and 1995 to fix
lysine prices and divide the market among them, according to a
statement of facts agreed to by the Competition Bureau and ADM in
May.
	   ADM and the other companies agreed to set the prices each
company would ask for lysine. They also agreed to limit the amount
sold.
	   Lysine is an important ingredient in feed, so the price-fixing
had an effect on food prices, particularly for chicken and pork,
the bureau said.
	   The bureau began its investigation after the case was broken by
U.S. anti-trust authorities.

Cyprus &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus and Greece criticized the United
States Thursday for describing the Turkish occupation of Cyprus as
part of a ``conflict,'' claiming the phrase was weaker than U.N.
resolutions denouncing the military action.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry earlier this week described
the situation on the island, as ``a conflict.''
	   ``Unacceptable,'' retorted Dimitris Reppas, the Greek
government's spokesman in Athens.
	   ``The Cyprus problem is one of the invasion and occupation of a
large part of the island by the Turkish army,'' he said.
	   ``This is accepted by the international community and this is
the basis on which the United Nations has taken decisions and has
set the political framework for finding a solution to the
problem,'' he added.
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said ``McCurry
is confused in considering that in 1974 there was just a conflict
and not an invasion.''
	   He said that recent U.S. statements ``are creating problems for
us because they many times appear contradictory, lack objectivity
and are removed from the reality of events.''
	   UN resolutions do not use the word ``invasion'' but refer to
``unilateral military action'' taken by Turkey.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey.
	   U.S. envoy Thomas Miller quickly tried to defuse the row.
	   ``Let us focus on the big picture and not on whether someone
used (the words) conflict or invasion,'' he said after his arrival
Thursday. ``It does not get you anywhere.''
	   Miller's visit was part of Washington's push to reduce growing
Greek-Turkish tensions.
	   The United States is anxious to restart UN-sponsored peace talks
that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in the fall.
	   Turkey has warned that it will prevent the deployment and Greece
has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if Turkey attacks.

Lawmaker calls for genetic testing in search for missing Yemenite

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel should fund genetic testing in order to
clear up years of suspicion that hundreds of Yemenite children were
illegally taken from their immigrant parents in the early 1950's
and put up for adoption, a lawmaker said Thursday.
	   Meir Shetreet, who chairs parliament's science committee, said
he wants to ``try to build up a genetic bank of all the Yemenite
immigrants who believe their children may have been kidnapped in
the past.''
	   Yemenite immigrants have charged that hundreds of their children
were kidnapped upon arriving in a mass immigration the late 1940s
and early 1950s and given to European-descended families, many
survivors of the Holocaust.
	   Hundreds of children went missing once the immigrants had
arrived to tent camps where they were first housed. Officials said
many babies arrived sickly from the desert journey and died.
	   Most immigrants whose children disappeared, initially believed
the authorities, until the 1960s when some began to receive draft
notices for children who had been declared dead.
	   Last August, investigators opened four graves of Yemenite babies
and found them to be empty. The discovery was seen by some as
supporting the kidnapping claims, but several experts argued that
bones may have shifted in the earth.
	   Last year, a woman who was adopted in Israel but grew up in
California, underwent DNA tests because she believed she was stolen
from her Yemenite immigrant mother as a baby in 1949.
	   The initial tests indicated a genetic match with an elderly
Yemenite woman who was told her infant daughter died. The case
boosted claims that there had been a systematic kidnapping of
babies. But a second, more precise test failed to confirm that the
two women were related.
	   Shetreet said testing of some 1,000 family members would cost
about dlrs 1 million with the money coming from government funding
and charitable donations.

Al Qods committee to meet July 29-30 in Casablanca, Morocco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Senior Arab officials plan to meet in
Morocco July 29-30 to discuss Israel's development plans in
Jerusalem, the Moroccan foreign minister said Thursday.
	   King Hassan II will preside over the meeting of the Al Qods
Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Al Qods is
the Arabic name for Jerusalem, which both the Palestinians and
Israelis claim as their capital.
	   Moroccan Foreign Minister Abdellatif Fillali said Israel's
decision June 21 to extend Jerusalem's boundaries to include
several towns and expand some municipal services from Jerusalem to
West Bank settlements had created a ``dangerous situation.''
	   King Hassan, who has played a role as a mediator in the Middle
East, is head of the Al Qods committee.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will attend the meeting which
is to take place in Casablanca along with the foreign ministers of
the member nations of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.

Scouts' sailboat capsizes: four reported dead, one missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on survival possibility &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rescue teams searched the Brittany coast Thursday
for a lone survivor after a sailboat full of French boy scouts
capsized, leaving four scouts dead, French radio reported.
	   A sailor on a pleasure boat who came to the boys' rescue was
still missing Thursday after the scouts' boat overturned with seven
aboard off the wind-blown coast overnight.
	   Witnesses said the Paris-area teenagers lacked adult
supervision, LCI television reported. Winds gusted at up to 60
kilometers (about 40 miles) an hour and a warning had been posted.
	   Rescuers who found three of the scouts alive searched for their
would-be rescuer, who went missing from his sailboat after he tried
to help the boys, France Info radio reported.
	   The missing boater's chances of survival in the 11 degree
Celsius water (52 degrees Fahrenheit) were slim as rescuers said a
person could only survive 12 hours in such cold water.
	   Two helicopters and several boats aided in the search off
Perros-Guirec, on the northwestern end of Brittany, rescue
officials said.
	   A Brittany prosecutor opened an investigation Thursday into who
was responsible for the accident. The boys were aged 12-16 years
old.
	   ``We know that there was no adult on that boat,'' prosecutor
Philippe Astruc told reporters. ``Those minors, some of whom were
16 years old, did they have the qualifications? ... That's what I'm
trying to determine.''
	   France's main scouting organization expressed its condolences,
but said the group to which the scouts belonged was not officially
affiliated with their association.
	   French media reports said the group was a breakaway organization
close to the Roman Catholic church.

U.S. names final 12 for world championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS throughout; ADDS Tomjanovich quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It's not the Dream Team, but for the 12 players who
will represent the United States in the world championship _ a
dream is just what it is.
	   The NBA lockout prompted USA Basketball to replace the all-stars
_ led by Gary Patton and Grant Hill _ with a hodgepodge of college,
CBA and professionals playing in Europe.
	   ``Players from every cut of basketball life,'' said Houston
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who will coach the Americans when
play begins Wednesday in Athens.
	   They've been together only three weeks and among the 12 who
survived the final cut Thursday were Big Ten player of the year
Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State, and Jimmy King, who played for
Michigan teams that reached two NCAA championship games.
	   ``For us to be successful, the defense has to be our
foundation,'' Tomjanovich said after the team arrived Thursday in
the Italian capital from it Monte Carlo training camp.
	   ``We're also not very big, so we'll have to do a lot of good
work to get bodies in good positions on the boards.''
	   ``This is a group I'm growing closer and closer to. It's a dream
for them,'' Tomjanovich added. ``And I know they're feeling honored
to have the opportunity.''
	   The 12-member roster also includes Brad Miller, who graduated
from Purdue this year; Wendell Alexis, a 1986 Syracuse graduate who
plays for Alba Berlin in Germany; Ashraf Amaya (Southern Illinois
1993) who plays for the CBA's Idaho Stampede; Bill Edwards (Wright
State 1993), who plays for Virtus Rome; Kiwane Garris (Illinois
1997), who plays for Grand Rapids of the CBA; and Michael Hawkins,
a 1995 Xavier grad who plays for Olympiakos, Greece.
	   Also selected were Gerard King, a 1996 Nicholls State grad who
plays in Siena, Italy; Jimmy Oliver (Purdue 1991) who plays for
Ciudad De Huelva, Spain; Jason Sasser (Texas Tech 1996), who plays
for the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce and for Caja San Fernando,
Spain; and David Wood, (Nevada Reno 1987), who plays for the CBA's
Rockford Lightning and for Unicaja Malaga, Spain.
	   The Americans, who face the Italian national team Saturday in
their final tuneup, beat France 93-63 and Spain 95-78 in their
first two exhibitions.
	   Without the Dream Team, the world championship will be wide open
with half of the 16 teams standing a chance to win it.
	   Only one NBA player is listed on the rosters _ Chris Anstey of
the Dallas Mavericks with Australia. Teams can change their rosters
24 hours before the first games Wednesday, though few are expected.
	   Officials of FIBA, the world governing body of basketball, said
Thursday that neither Yugoslavia nor Lithuania, two traditional
powers, would be fielding NBA players.
	   In addition to the lack of size, when the Americans open against
Brazil they may also be short on experience, particularly at the
international level.
	   ``There are situations where experience can win out,''
Tomjanovich said. ``But there are also situations where athletic
ability and pressure and movement can win out. That's going to be
our theme in a lot of games.''

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
rejected a request Thursday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
meet, and suspended further negotiations between the sides until
Israel accepted a U.S. peace proposal, his aides said.
	   Arafat's aide Nabil Abourdeneh told The Associated Press that
the negotiators ``have reached a deadlock.''
	   Israel insisted that only slight disagreements remained between
the two sides regarding an American proposal for an Israeli troop
withdrawal and that an agreement was within reach.
	   Netanyahu sent his coalition chairman, Meir Shetreet, to
Arafat's office in Gaza with a request for a summit between the two
leaders to hammer out remaining differences.
	   ``My meeting was intended to give another chance to the peace
process and save the peace process. I put some new creative ideas
(on the table),'' Shetreet told the AP.
	   ``All matters should be discussed by Arafat and Netanyahu. I was
urging Arafat to hold such a meeting as fast as possible. We are at
a moment of truth and the prime minister is determined to reach
agreement,'' Shetreet said. The two leaders last met in October.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said Shetreet's
message would be studied over the weekend.
	   Both sides have appealed to the United States for help, but have
been rebuffed by the Clinton administration which says Israel and
the Palestinians should try harder to reach agreement on a West
Bank troop pullback without U.S. mediation.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for a gradual Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, to coincide with
greater Palestinian efforts to crack down on Islamic militants.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. plan, but Netanyahu has
balked at the scope of the pullback and has demanded better
Palestinian security guarantees.
	   Arafat's senior aide Ahmed Tibi said no summit would take place
unless Israel was willing to accept the proposal in order to move
ahead in the Mideast peace process.
	   ``A meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu could take place after
the two parties reach an agreement on the American initiative, but
until now the Israelis are rejecting the initiative,'' Tibi said.
	   Another Netanyahu envoy, Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani planned to meet Arafat Friday.
	   Despite the Palestinians' position, Netanyahu was optimistic
Thursday. ``We'll complete the negotiations, we'll have a success.
If the Palestinians have good will ... then it's a matter of very
little time before we can complete an interim agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said.

Muzz Patrick dead at 83
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIVERSIDE, Connecticut (AP) _ Muzz Patrick, a former player,
coach and general manager for the New York Rangers born into a
family steeped in hockey tradition, died Thursday. He was 83.
	   Patrick, who was born in Victoria, British Columbia, died of a
heart attack at his home, his son Dick said.
	   Muzz Patrick was the son of Hall of Famer Lester Patrick, who
along with his brother Frank was one of hockey's greatest builders
and innovators. Muzz's brother Lynn also played and coached in the
National Hockey League, as did his nephews Craig and Glenn.
	   Patrick's grandfather Joseph helped build the first artificial
ice rinks in Canada, at Vancouver and Victoria.
	   Born Murray Patrick, his nickname came from his curly black hair
when a boyhood friend called him ``Fuzzy Muzzy.''
	   As a player, Patrick was a rough and tumble defenseman. He
played 166 games over four seasons with New York, winning a Stanley
Cup in 1940, the Rangers' last championship until 1994. He scored
only five goals.
	   He gained renown for a one-punch victory over Boston defenseman
Eddie Shore at Madison Square Garden in 1939.
	   Patrick's hockey career was interrupted in 1941 when he served
in the army. After the war, he returned to the Rangers for one more
season, 1945-46, before turning to coaching and managing minor
league teams in Seattle and Victoria.
	   He followed his father and brother as coach of the Rangers on
Jan. 6, 1954, succeeding Hall of Famer Frank Boucher. At the end of
that season, Phil Watson became the coach and Patrick moved up to
become GM from 1955-64. He swung several memorable trades,
including acquiring Doug Harvey from Montreal to become
player-coach in 1961 and later swapping Gump Worsley to Montreal
for Jacques Plante in a trade of all-star goalies.
	   Harvey left after one season and Patrick returned to coach at
the start of the 1962 season before hiring Red Sullivan to take
over on Dec. 28, 1962. Patrick's record as Rangers coach was
46-66-27.
	   He worked a variety of executive positions at the Garden before
retiring in 1973.

Indians trade Plunk to Milwaukee for Jones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians traded Eric Plunk to the
Milwaukee Brewers for Doug Jones on Thursday in a swap of veteran
relievers that could signal the start of a big week of baseball
trades.
	   With talk about Randy Johnson and Roberto Alomar cooled for now,
the Indians addressed their most pressing problem _ the bullpen _
with the July 31 trade deadline approaching.
	   Plunk, 34, has struggled the past two seasons after seven years
as one of baseball's premier right-handed setup men. He was 3-1
with a 4.83 ERA, allowing six homers in 41 innings.
	   Jose Mesa has been ineffective, and Paul Shuey has been injured
and unreliable. Only left-hander Paul Assenmacher and closer Mike
Jackson have pitched well for Cleveland, which was expected to have
one of the best and deepest bullpens in the majors.
	   Jones, 41, also has posted a poor year with Milwaukee after
saving 36 games with a 2.02 ERA for the Brewers in 1997. He is 3-4
with a 5.17 ERA and 12 saves in 46 games.

Brazilian aircraft manufacturers says its exports comply with WTO
</HEADLINE>
rules
 &UR; With Trade-Aircraft &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Latin America's largest aircraft
manufacturer on Thursday rejected charges by its closest competitor
_ Bombardier Inc of Canada _ that it was getting what amounted to
illegal subsidies from an export program that helps it sell planes
around the world.
	   Responding to the charges, Paulo Cesar Silva, finance director
of Brazil's Embraer said the export promotion program, known as
Proex, helps local exporters ``compete in equal conditions in
foreign markets,'' by compensating them for Brazil's high interest
rates.
	   He made his remarks at a news conference shortly after the World
Trade Organization said in Geneva that it would intervene in a
Canada-Brazil dispute over civilian aircraft exports.
	   The WTO is setting up two dispute settlement panels, one
requested by Canada and the other by Brazil, following complaints
by both countries that they are each contravening WTO rules with
their aircraft export policies.
	   Canada charged that Brazil is unfairly granting export subsidies
to foreign buyers of Embraer aircraft.
	   Brazil in turn complained that Canada is violating its WTO
obligations with subsidies that benefit Bombardier.
	   The panel requests to the WTO were filed simultaneously by the
Brazilian and Canadian governments after bilateral talks for a
peaceful settlement broke down.
	   Embraer competes with Bombardier in the regional civilian jet
market, where each company has around half of the market, Curado
said.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien had met early in the year in Sao Paulo to
pledge their commitment to a compromise.
	   Curado said Bombardier began to question Proex when Embraer sold
its first big order of the 50-seat regional jet, the ERJ-145, to
Continental Airlines' subsidiary Continental Express in 1996.
	   Embraer has sold 182 ERJ-145s and has options for 245 more. The
biggest orders are from Continental and American Airlines' American
Eagle.
	   For its new 35-seat ERJ-135, Embraer has received 73 firm orders
and 122 options.
	   ``Bombardier had a monopoly and now it has 50 percent and we
have 50 percent ,'' said Curado, adding that the Canadian company's
attitude was ``almost childish.''
	   The aircraft dispute began shaping up in December of last year
when Canada canceled an dlrs 90 million order for Embraer's Tucano
military planes for a NATO training program.
	   Bombardier, the prime contractor for the NATO program, instead
signed a contract with the U.S.- based Raytheon Aircraft for 24
T-6A-1 training planes.

Canadian restaurant chain pressured to drop Alaskan salmon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Under pressure from
disgruntled British Columbia fishermen, a major Canadian restaurant
chain has agreed to take Alaskan coho salmon off its menu.
	   The regional fishermen's union had been urging the Keg
Restaurants chain to drop Alaskan coho as a show of solidarity.
	   After U.S.-Canada talks on reducing the Pacific salmon catch
collapsed earlier this year, Canada imposed unilateral restrictions
on British Columbia fishermen that effectively ban them from
catching any coho.
	   Alaska, meanwhile, has played down the possibility that coho are
endangered. Many of the coho caught annually by Alaskan fisherman
are, according to Canada, bound for British Columbia waters.
	   British Columbia fishermen were upset when they learned the Keg
chain was going to a large quantity of Alaskan coho this summer.
	   Fishermen's union president John Radosevic raised the issue with
Keg president David Aisenstat, who agreed Wednesday not to use the
Alaskan salmon.
	   There are 80 Keg restaurants in all, Until Wednesday, many were
offering coho salmon with pineapple cilantro salsa.

Study: Post-op radiation therapy for lung cancer may do more harm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to change slug to conform to 1700 GMT World Digest &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed for release until 2301 GMT; time set by source &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The common practice of exposing lung cancer
patients to radiation therapy after surgery may do more harm than
good and should not be used routinely, according to a study
published Friday.
	   Many lung cancer patients undergo radiation therapy after
surgery to treat any remaining cancer cells. But the results of
previous studies examining the effectiveness of the treatment have
been contradictory or inconclusive.
	   In the largest study of its kind, an international team of
researchers combined information gathered over the past 30 years in
nine studies involving a total of 2,128 lung cancer patients
worldwide.
	   Patients who had been treated with radiation therapy after
surgery were 21 percent more likely to die than those who only had
surgery, according to the study published in this week's issue of
The Lancet, a British medical journal. Researchers are unsure why
radiation therapy caused more deaths earlier.
	   About 900,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with lung cancer
every year, according to the World Health Organization.
	   Dr. Gordon McVie, director general at the Cancer Research
Campaign in London and a lung cancer specialist who was not part of
the study, said the research was authoritative and important.
	   ``It should be compulsory reading for chief executives of
hospitals. In many parts, this is routine treatment. It has been
assumed that it was a good idea,'' he said. ``I was unsurprised
that radiotherapy didn't prolong survival, but what I'm really
concerned about is that it could actually do harm. There is a very
clear message here.''
	   The patients in the study had non-small-cell lung cancer, which
accounts for 80 percent of all lung cancer cases. A total of 1,056
had surgery and radiotherapy while 1,072 had surgery alone.
	   The detrimental effect was worst in patients in the early stages
of the disease, the study said.
	   In those with more advanced but still operable lung cancer, the
study said radiation therapy did not seem to cause harm although it
also did not appear to help.
	   ``The 21 percent relative increase in the risk of death
associated with radiotherapy, equivalent to an overall reduction in
survival from 55 percent (for surgery alone) to 48 percent (for
surgery and radiotherapy) at two years, represents a substantial
hazard to these patients,'' said Lesley Stewart of the Medical
Research Council, which led the study.
	   Researchers concluded that radiation therapy should not be given
routinely to patients in the early stage of non-small-cell lung
cancer and that its role in the treatment of more advanced stages
of the disease ``is not clear and may warrant further research.''
	   ``There was some hint that it might prevent recurring tumors,
but that was heavily outweighed by the ill effects _ the increased
deaths,'' Stewart said.
	   In an independent commentary, also published in The Lancet, Dr.
Alistair Munro of Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, Scotland, said
post-operative radiotherapy doses are too high and that there are
``valuable lessons to be learned'' from the Cambridge study.

Cairo airport shuts runway after airplane damages strip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Cairo airport shut one of its two runways
late Thursday after an EgyptAir jet smacked into the strip, carving
a 20-meter (66-foot) gash into it.
	   None of the 202 passengers on the Airbus 300 was injured, an
airport official said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. The flight originated in Doha, Qatar.
	   Airport officials said in a report that the gash was cut when
the captain tilted the jet at such a steep angle while landing that
the back part of the aircraft scraped against the runway.
	   The dragging also damaged a 10-meter-long (33-feet-long) section
of the jet.
	   Flights were directed to the second runway and officials said
they expected delays until the strip is repaired.

France and Germany turn in ratification for land mine ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N.
officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning
anti-personnel land mines.
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet and the deputy German
representative, Gerhard Walter Henze, turned in the so-called
instruments of ratification, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa
Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be
ratified by 40 countries to take effect. So far 25 countries have
ratified it.
	   ``Nevertheless, the goal remains to ban anti-personnel mines at
a global level,'' the German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel said in
a statement. ``I therefore call once more on those states who have
not yet acceded to the convention to do so as soon as possible.''
	   In a related matter, Malaysia became the 150th country to sign
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Eckhard said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors found a document
detailing types of bombs and rockets that Iraq has said were used
to deliver chemical and biological agents but were prevented from
taking it, U.N. officials said Thursday.
	   The incident was the first serious instance of Iraqi
noncooperation since a February agreement allowing U.N. inspectors
access to so-called presidential sites and could undermine Iraq's
bid to have nearly 8-year-old U.N. sanctions lifted soon.
	   The chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, outlined the July
18 incident in a letter delivered to the Security Council
president, Sergey Lavrov of Russia on Wednesday and obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   The document was sealed and was being held by Iraq's monitoring
directorate pending a visit by Butler to Baghdad Aug. 2-5. It will
be reviewed then, by Butler and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.

Floyd joins Bulls as coach in waiting; door open for Jackson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jackson agent saying he won't return. &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Tim Floyd joined the Chicago Bulls on Thursday as
their coach in waiting while the team left open the possibility of
a return by Phil Jackson.
	   Jackson's agent, however, immediately squelched that idea,
saying: ``He's not coming back.''
	   Floyd, the former Iowa State coach, will be director of
basketball operations until the end of the National Basketball
Association lockout, Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf said. Then,
Jackson will have one last chance to come back as coach for a run
at a seventh championship.
	   ``Should Phil not return, Tim will succeed him as head coach,''
Reinsdorf said. If Jackson does come back, Floyd will remain as
director of basketball operations.''
	   But Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, told WGN-TV that ``although
it's kind of them to say `Come back, Phil, your chair is available,
it's not going to happen.''
	   And that's not likely to make Michael Jordan happy.
	   Jordan said last week that he would not play for a young college
coach like Floyd, a 44-year-old with no NBA coaching experience.
Jordan also said he wanted no part of a rebuilding process and
stated once again he would only play for Jackson.
	   Floyd said he would have no problem if Jackson changed his mind.
	   ``I would step completely away if that's what Phil wanted. I
would not take this job if I thought in any way it would push
Michael Jordan out,'' he said.
	   ``This is all about Michael's wishes.''
	   Floyd also said:
	   ``If Phil doesn't return, I hope Michael will come back and play
for me. I really do. I would love the opportunity to coach Michael
Jordan.''
	   Jordan won't make an official announcement about his future
until the NBA lockout ends, and Floyd's hiring won't change that,
said David Falk, Jordan's agent.
	   ``Michael needs to take his time to see how all of the pieces
fall into place,'' Falk said Wednesday. ``We only have one piece of
the picture. It may be that piece is of sufficient weight to
outweigh everything else. Only time will tell.
	   ``I think he needs to step back from all the events of the
season and all the political events surrounding the team and decide
what he wants to do. He's earned the right after what he's brought
to the team and the city and the game of basketball to do whatever
brings him joy and satisfaction,'' Falk said.
	   As director of basketball operations Floyd will be responsible
for a variety of tasks, Reinsdorf said, including those handled by
the head coach during the summer.
	   As coach, Floyd said he would want to retain veteran assistant
Tex Winter, the creator of the Bulls' vaunted triangle offense, and
assistants Frank Hamblen and Bill Cartwright.
	   ``I know this much, there's not a whole lot broken around here.
And I don't think that there's a whole lot that I'm going to need
to try to have to fix,'' Floyd said.
	   Floyd said he hadn't spoken with Jordan and is not allowed to
talk formally to him during the lockout. But, if he could, he would
promise the five-time MVP he wouldn't change the Bulls' style of
offense.
	   ``I know what he means to this city and fans worldwide,'' Floyd
said.

Canadian National to sell Quebec line to Pennsylvania firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Canadian National Railway Co. has reached a deal
to sell its 98-mile (158-kilometers) rail line in Quebec's Eastern
Townships to a Pennsylvania rail operator.
	   The CN track, also known as the Sherbrooke subdivision, runs
between Sainte-Rosalie, Quebec, and the U.S. border. The line
carries about 22,000 carloads of freight and 12,000 containers a
year, mainly for shippers in the chemical and pulp and paper
industries.
	   No purchase price was disclosed Thursday.
	   Emons Transportation Group, based in York, Pennsylvania, already
operates the continuation of the Sherbrooke line in the United
States between Island Pond, Vermont and Portland, Maine.
	   Emons acquired the line from CN in 1989 and renamed it the St.
Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad Co.
	   Both major Canadian railways, CN and CP Rail, have been shedding
jobs and selling off unwanted tracks for years in a bid to become
more competitive and boost profits.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Latin America's largest aircraft
manufacturer on Thursday rejected charges by its closest competitor
_ Bombardier Inc of Canada _ that it was getting what amounted to
illegal subsidies from an export program that helps it sell planes
around the world.
	   Responding to the charges, Paulo Cesar Silva, finance director
of Brazil's Embraer said the export promotion program, known as
Proex, helps local exporters ``compete in equal conditions in
foreign markets,'' by compensating them for Brazil's high interest
rates.
	   He made his remarks at a news conference shortly after the World
Trade Organization said in Geneva that it would intervene in a
Canada-Brazil dispute over civilian aircraft exports.
	   The WTO is setting up two dispute settlement panels, one
requested by Canada and the other by Brazil, following complaints
by both countries that they are each contravening WTO rules with
their aircraft export policies.
	   Canada charged that Brazil is unfairly granting export subsidies
to foreign buyers of Embraer aircraft.
	   Brazil in turn complained that Canada is violating its WTO
obligations with subsidies that benefit Bombardier.
	   The panel requests to the WTO were filed simultaneously by the
Brazilian and Canadian governments after bilateral talks for a
peaceful settlement broke down.
	   Embraer competes with Bombardier in the regional civilian jet
market, where each company has around half of the market, the
company's vice president, Frederico Curado said.

De Klerk denies he lied about human rights abuses

 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Former President F.W. de
Klerk, who negotiated the transfer of power in the last days of
apartheid, on Thursday denied lying about his knowledge of covert
police actions.
	   The denial followed allegations to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission this week by former high ranking officials that De Klerk
knew of human rights abuses ordered by government officials.
	   In a statement on Thursday, De Klerk said he never denied
knowing of covert actions in testimony to the comission last year,
but rather had denied he had been involved in ordering them.
	   De Klerk had insisted last year that he was unaware that
officials of the white-minority government authorized abuses
against anti-apartheid activists. He has also claimed the attacks
were the work of rogue operatives or of policemen who misunderstood
the government's policies.
	   Those denials provoked incredulity and tears from commission
chairman, Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu. De Klerk's National Party
demanded an apology from the panel under threat of a lawsuit for
implying De Klerk had lied.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will allow De Klerk to
appear and clear up the contradiction if he wants to, an amnesty
committee official said on Thursday.
	   ``I think it is fair to give him an opportunity to react to what
has been said,'' Martin Coetzee, executive secretary of the amnesty
committee, told The Associated Press. He did not think the panel
would subpoena the former president.
	   Coetzee's remarks contradicted an earlier claim by Alex Boraine,
the deputy chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation commission,
that De Klerk would be subponaed. As chairman of the committee
taking evidence, the decision to subponae De Klerk would be
Coetzee's.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Good pitching beats poor hitting every time.
	   Kyung Hun-Ho and Kim Byung Hyun scattered six hits and combined
for 14 strikeouts as South Korea beat the punchless United States
3-1 Thursday at the World Baseball Championships.
	   The win pushed South Korea (2-0) into a tie atop Pool A with the
Netherlands and Australia, which both routed overmatched opponents
in earlier games at Palermo, Sicily.
	   The U.S. team (0-2) dropped to last place in Pool A and faces an
uphill battle to reach the quarterfinals.
	   The South Korean hurlers were dominant, allowing only one
extra-base hit _ a double in the seventh inning by LSU's Brad
Cresse, who came around to score the Americans' run on a single by
Texas Tech catcher Joshua Bard.
	   Kyung was pulled after allowing the run in the seventh with none
out. Kim came on to end the rally and pick up the save with three
innings of no-hit pitching.
	   The one bright spot for the United States was another strong
performance from its starter as Houston's Shane Nance went the
distance, striking out 12. But South Korea scored twice in the
second without the benefit of a hit, stringing together an error, a
walk, a groundout and a sacrifice fly.
	   The Netherlands, which beat the United States 3-1 Wednesday, got
another strong pitching performance and eight members of the
starting lineup got at least one hit in a 12-1 rout of first-time
entrant Russia (0-2).
	   Jurrlaan Lobbezzoo struck out nine batters in 6 2-3 innings of
work, allowing five hits and the Russian run. He got plenty of
support as outfielder Jeffrey Cranston drove in four runs,
including a bases-clearing double in the sixth inning, and third
baseman Welfried Comenencia had three hits and two RBIs.
	   Australia beat Nicaragua 9-2. Paul Gonzales had three hits,
including a run-scoring double and a three-run homer, and first
baseman Andrew Scott went 4-for-5. Nicaragua fell to 1-1.
	   In the other Pool A game Thursday, Canada (1-1) edged winless
Taiwan 5-4 at Messina, Sicily.
	   In Pool B, five-time defending champion Cuba cruised to a 14-1
victory over South Africa. The Cubans' 15-hit onslaught included
Oscar Machado's grand slam in the fourth inning and Orestes
Kindelan's solo shot in the third. Later Pool B games were Italy
vs. Japan, Panama vs. Dominican Republic, and Spain vs. China.
	   The top four teams from each group will advance to next week's
quarterfinals.

Priest's arrest in Bishop's killing surprises Guatemala
</HEADLINE>

order.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
bishop who crusaded for human rights denied any involvement
Thursday and a judge slapped a gag order on the surprising new
development.
	   Rev. Mario Orantes Najera, who reported the discovery of Bishop
Juan Gerardi's bludgeoned body in April, told reporters that
allegations of his involvement were ``absurd'' before he entered
the court with eight heavily armed officers wearing bullet proof
vests.
	   His arrest came after weeks of speculation that Gerardi had been
killed by members of the right-wing death squads or military units
accused of widespread killings in a church human rights report
Gerardi issued.
	   The death was a jolt, and led Guatemalans to believe that their
long civil war was not yet over.
	   Pope John Paul II called the killing ``a violent act that
threatens peace.'' London-based Amnesty International said the
killing ``confirms a fact: Guatemala, at present, continues in the
past.''
	   After questioning Orantes behind closed doors, investigating
judge Isaias Figueroa Medina imposed a 10-day gag order on comments
about the case by all involved.
	   The judge said the arrest was based on evidence produced by
prosecutors, who are independent both of her own office and of the
police.
	   Also arrested was a church cook, Margarita Lopez. Another man
held in the case, Carlos Enrique Vielman, 24, has said he is
innocent and has not been formally charged.
	   Callers to radio talk shows were angered by Orantes' arrest on
Wednesday, when he was hauled to jail in handcuffs.
	   ``I am very pained by the way the father was arrested,''
complained one woman, a number of devout Catholics who called in
Thursday morning. ``He shouldn't be treated like a high risk
criminal.''
	   Gerardi's report had found the army and civilian self-defense
patrols it organized were to blame for about 80 percent of the
150,000 deaths and 50,000 disappearances in Guatemala's 36-year
civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   Two days after it was published, Gerardi was found battered to
death in the garage outside his residence at the San Sebastian
church. Returning home from his regular Sunday dinner with his
sister and her family, Gerardi's skull was crushed with a cement
block as he stepped out of his sedan.
	   Carlos Aldana, coordinator of a church pastoral program, urged
``calm and serenity at this moment.''

Senator says Tyson issue a key to state control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ A request by Mike Tyson to be licensed in New
Jersey will be a test of whether U.S. states have the ability to
regulate boxing, or whether a federal czar is needed, a Nevada
senator said Thursday.
	   ``The spirit of the law is that each state should observe the
actions of others,'' Sen. Richard Bryan said Thursday. ``The
failure to do so would fuel the argument that the states cannot do
it and we should take over on the federal level. It would provide a
powerful argument that the federal government needs to intervene
and take over the regulatory process.''
	   The issue arose last week when Tyson applied to the New Jersey
Athletic Control Board for a boxing license. A hearing on the
application is set for July 29.
	   Tyson's license was revoked by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission July 9, 1997 after he bit the ears of heavyweight
champion Evander Holyfield during a fight at the MGM Grand. Tyson
was eligible to apply for a license with the Nevada commission on
July 9, but has not done so.
	   Instead, he opted to seek licensing in New Jersey. Adviser
Shelly Finkel said he went to New Jersey because he did not feel
Tyson would be re-licensed in Nevada.
	   Nevada commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem expressed anger
earlier this week that Tyson bypassed Nevada, saying he expected
New Jersey ``to honor our suspension.''
	   Bryan said he expressed similar feelings when he talked Thursday
with Larry Hazzard, commissioner of the New Jersey Athletic Control
Board.
	   Hazzard appeared at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee
conducted by Bryan and Sen. John McCain.
	   A Bryan-McCain boxing bill passed last year focused on medical
issues and was designed to protect the health and safety of boxers.
Included was a provision calling on states to recognize license
suspensions in other states.
	   Bryan said he asked Hazzard if the spirit of the law was to be
supportive of other state athletic commissions and Hazzard agreed.
	   ``We're investing state athletic commissions with the ability to
deal with the problems of boxing,'' Bryan said. ``Certainly the
expectation is that one athletic commission will follow the
disciplinary action of another.
	   ``I didn't ask him specifically about licensing Mike Tyson
before Nevada had an opportunity to consider the issue, but it was
clear that's what I meant.
	   ``I think it undermines the regulatory process of boxing if one
state undermines another,'' Bryan said in a telephone interview
from his Washington, D.C. office.
	   The senator said some critics believe the states are incapable
of regulating boxing and a ``national czar is needed.''
	   ``I've held out the hope that the states can handle this on
their own,'' Bryan said.
	   New Jersey's actions on Tyson may be the key to who controls the
sport in the future.
	   ``If New Jersey should license Tyson, it would certainly raise
the question of how effective the states are,'' Bryan said. ``If a
fighter can be disciplined in one state, then move to another state
... it would render the disciplinary action of one state relatively
ineffective.''
	   Thursday's hearing was on a bill titled the Muhammad Ali Boxing
Reform Act. It would protect boxers from certain anti-competitive
and unethical business practices. Bryan said the bill is aimed at
stemming the ``never-ending battle'' among managers, promoters and
sanctioning bodies ``to control the destiny of professional
boxers.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece and Cyprus on Thursday slammed the
United States for describing the Turkish presence in northern
Cyprus as resulting from a ``conflict,'' claiming the phrase was
weaker than U.N. resolutions denouncing a ``unilateral military
action'' by the Turks.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas took offense with comments
made Wednesday by White House spokesman Mike McCurry on Cyprus, in
which he said events in 1974 were ``a conflict, and I think it's
been well characterized.''
	   Calling that ``unacceptable,'' Reppas said ``the Cyprus problem
is one of the invasion and occupation of a large part of the island
by the Turkish army.''
	   Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said such
statements ``are creating problems for us because they many times
appear contradictory, lack objectivity and are removed from the
reality of events.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
the northern part of the island following a Greek-backed coup. The
breakaway Turkish-Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by
Turkey. Turkey keeps about 35,000 troops in the north.
	   U.S. envoy Thomas Miller quickly tried to defuse the row.
	   ``Let us focus on the big picture and not on whether someone
used (the words) conflict or invasion,'' he said after his arrival
in Cyprus Thursday. ``It does not get you anywhere.''
	   Almost 100 UN resolutions against Turkey refer to a ``unilateral
military action undertaken against the Republic of Cyprus'' but do
not use the word ``invasion.''
	   Miller's visit was part of Washington's push to reduce growing
Greek-Turkish tensions.
	   The United States is anxious to restart UN-sponsored peace talks
that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in the fall.
	   Turkey has warned that it will prevent the deployment and Greece
has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if Turkey attacks.

President says U.S. obsessed with punishing him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Two days after the Clinton
Administration vowed to keep him off U.S. soil forever, Colombian
President Ernesto Samper fired back Thursday, saying the
prohibition ``has become an obsession.''
	   Samper's comments in a radio interview were in apparent response
to State Department spokesman James Rubin, who said on Tuesday that
Samper ``will never get into the United States.''
	   The United States revoked Samper's tourist visa in 1996,
convinced he knowingly took campaign contributions from drug
traffickers.
	   He has since entered the country on a diplomatic visa to appear
at United Nations headquarters in New York.
	   Rubin explained that Samper's visa denial was ``a finding of
permanent ineligibility.''
	   ``They are curious statements by the State Department which has
never recognized Colombia's success in the fight against drug
trafficking,'' said Samper, who completes a four-year term August
7.
	   Samper was absolved of wrongdoing in the drug money scandal by
Colombia's legislature. However, 110 congressmen who voted to clear
him now face possible criminal charges by the Supreme Court for
ignoring the evidence against Samper.

Remains of Jamaican slave to return to Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The remains of an African male who was
brought to Jamaica as a slave and who died more than 250 years ago
will be returned to the West African nation of Ghana.
	   Ghanaian cultural ministry officials arrived in Jamaica Thursday
to repatriate the remains of the unidentified man, one of four
slaves buried in the 1730s near the north coast town of St. Ann's
Bay.
	   The remains have been kept at a museum since they were
discovered during the excavation of a slave village in the late
1980s.
	   About 90 percent of Jamaicans are descended from slaves brought
by Spanish and English settlers. The Caribbean nation celebrates
the 1834 abolition of slavery on Aug. 1.
	   Ghana will hold a similar celebration this year, said Louise
Douglas, a spokeswoman for the Jamaica National Heritage Trust.

Archaeologists say they've found 5,000-year-old temple in Iraq

<TEXT>
	   AL-NAMEL, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi archaeologists have discovered a
circular 5,000-year-old temple that appears to have been used by
Mesopotamians of a little-known culture, the head of the excavation
team said Thursday.
	   Burhan Shakir, an archaeologist with Iraq's Antiquities
Department, said the building, which is 600 square meters (720
square yards), was discovered in March.
	   ``We are certain this was a temple, but we still do not know
what gods were worshipped here and what kind of cult was
practiced,'' Shakir said.
	   The temple stands on a promontory overlooking the Tigris River,
320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Baghdad. It consists of five
circular aisles separated by mudbrick walls 2-meters (yards) thick.
The corridors rise about 6 meters (7 yards) above the surrounding
plain and then merge into a spiral staircase which leads to a
second floor.
	   That floor has been bulldozed by modern farmers building houses.
About 90 percent of the archaeological site is occupied by the
village of al-Namel.
	   ``The whole building was vaulted, but unfortunately
encroachments by farmers have left us no roofs,'' said Hazem
al-Najafi, a member of the team and an expert on Mesopotamian
architecture.
	   The entrance, one-meter (yard) wide, is still vaulted and leads
to alleys containing scores of niches in which the inhabitants
placed their idols.
	   Apart from the entrance, there are no openings or windows in the
building. The walls have scorch marks about every two meters
(yards). Al-Najafi said these came from torches used to light the
corridors.
	   The excavators have found no artifacts - no statues, pottery or
clay tablets - in the temple.
	   A nearby cemetery yielded 50 graves and artifacts including
cooking bowls, cups, pots, goblets, jugs, storage jars and
containers made of fine pottery glazed with colored geometrical
designs.
	   ``For the first time in more than 100 years of Mesopotamian
excavation, we find traces of two distinctive and culturally remote
civilizations appearing together in a grave,'' Shakir added.
	   The ancient inhabitants buried their dead with plain ceramic
items of the Sumerian civilization of southern Iraq as well as with
elegant vases decorated with flowers and animals that hail from a
little-known culture in northern Iraq.
	   The Sumerian pottery stems from the early dynastic period of
about 2,750 B.C. and the northern ceramics date to more than 3,000
B.C.
	   Sumerian civilization began to develop in southern Iraq in the
4th millennium B.C.

UN panel recommends new regulatory body to check financial markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. panel on Thursday recommended the
creation of a new regulatory body to check financial markets and
prevent another crisis such as the one that has wracked Asia for
the past year.
	   The World Financial Organization would be similar to the World
Trade Organization but would concern itself with financial flows
rather than trade, said Nurul Islam, chairman of the Committee for
Development Planning.
	   The panel is comprised of independent experts who advise the
Economic and Social Council, which coordinates the economic and
social work of the United Nations. Islam briefed reporters on the
panel's recommendation before bringing it before ECOSOC.
	   ``The creation of a global financial market has not seen a
parallel development in global regulatory practices or
international safety nets,'' the report said.
	   ``Specifically, an institution is needed to provide overall
guidance in the development and monitoring of international
standards and codes of conduct for financial management and capital
flows.''
	   The World Financial Organization could review, establish and
monitor international principals for accounting and payments, and
supervision over banking, securities, insurance and financial
conglomerates. Such oversight is currently handled by ad hoc public
and private groups with limited membership, the report said.
	   In addition to the new organization, existing financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank had to provide better warning mechanisms to prevent another
Asian disaster, the report said.
	   ``The east- and southeast-Asian financial crises have increased
awareness of the need to promote a more effective management of
international money and finance so as to prevent the recurrence of
similar crises,'' the report said.

South Korea beats U.S. 3-1; Cuba, Netherlands, Australia roll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Good pitching beats poor hitting every time.
	   Kyung Hun-Ho and Kim Byung Hyun scattered six hits and combined
for 14 strikeouts as South Korea beat the punchless United States
3-1 Thursday at the World Baseball Championships.
	   The win pushed South Korea (2-0) into a tie atop Pool A with the
Netherlands and Australia, which both routed overmatched opponents
in earlier games at Palermo, Sicily.
	   The U.S. team (0-2) dropped to last place in Pool A and faces an
uphill battle to reach the quarterfinals.
	   The South Korean hurlers were dominant, allowing only one
extra-base hit _ a double in the seventh inning by LSU's Brad
Cresse, who came around to score the Americans' run on a single by
Texas Tech catcher Joshua Bard.
	   Kyung was pulled after allowing the run with none out. Kim came
on to end the rally and pick up the save with three innings of
no-hit pitching for South Korea, which lost to Cuba in the 1994
title game.
	   The one bright spot for the United States was another strong
performance from its starter as Houston's Shane Nance went the
distance, striking out 12. But South Korea scored twice in the
second without the benefit of a hit, stringing together an error, a
walk, a groundout and a sacrifice fly.
	   The Netherlands, which beat the United States 3-1 Wednesday, got
another strong pitching performance and eight members of the
starting lineup got at least one hit in a 12-1 rout of first-time
entrant Russia (0-2).
	   Jurrlaan Lobbezzoo struck out nine batters in 6 2-3 innings of
work, allowing five hits and the Russian run. He got plenty of
support as outfielder Jeffrey Cranston drove in four runs,
including a bases-clearing double in the sixth inning, and third
baseman Welfried Comenencia had three hits and two RBIs.
	   Australia beat Nicaragua 9-2. Paul Gonzales had three hits,
including a run-scoring double and a three-run homer, and first
baseman Andrew Scott went 4-for-5. Nicaragua fell to 1-1.
	   In the other Pool A game Thursday, Canada (1-1) edged winless
Taiwan 5-4 at Messina, Sicily.
	   In Pool B, five-time defending champion Cuba cruised to a 14-1
victory over South Africa at Vicenza. The Cubans' 15-hit onslaught
included Oscar Machado's grand slam in the fourth inning and
Orestes Kindelan's solo shot in the third.
	   In other Pool B action, Japan beat Italy 10-3 at Parma, the
Dominican Republic defeated Panama 9-3 at Rimini, and China beat
Spain 9-2 at Florence.
	   Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Japan share the group lead with
2-0 records.
	   The top four teams from each group advance to next week's
quarterfinals.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan decried the
forces undermining ``civil society'' in a speech to foreign
ministry officials in Mexico _ a country plagued by corrupt police
and drug traders,
	   Annan, on the final day of a five-nation tour of Latin America,
made no specific criticism of Mexico, saying that no country is
immune from ``the diseases spawned by uncivil society.''
	   ``They are terrorists, criminals, drug dealers, traffickers in
people and others who undo the good works of civil society,'' Annan
said. ``They take advantage of the open borders, free markets and
technological advances that bring so many benefits to the world's
people.''
	   Mexico has recently suffered corruption at the highest levels of
its justice system, including the 1997 arrest of a general heading
the country's fight against drug trafficking.
	   The brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
jailed in connection with a political assassination and is fighting
accusations that millions held in his Swiss bank accounts were
illegally gained.
	   Annan, who met President Ernesto Zedillo and Mexico City Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas on Wednesday, lauded Mexico's promotion of the
U.N. General Assembly's special session on drug trafficking last
month.
	   ``Corruption is a particularly insidious menace, beyond its role
in the drug trade,'' Annan said. ``We already know how it
undermines the rule of law, restricts investment and swallows
resources needed for development.''
	   Annan called for greater attention to the trafficking in people
and expressed hope that more countries will sign the 1990
Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families, as
Mexico and another 10 nations have done.
	   Outside the ministry building, hundreds of protesters waved
signs denouncing government actions in Chiapas, where talks are
stalled between officials and leftist rebels demanding greater
democracy and Indian rights.
	   Some independent organizations have suggested the United Nations
mediate an end to the 4 1/2-year-old conflict. Annan said
repeatedly during his visit that the United Nations does not
involve itself in internal conflicts without a government
invitation, which Mexico has not extended.
	   Answering a question from reporters after his speech, Annan said
Mexico believes it has the capability of ending the conflict
peacefully on its own, a position he said was understandable, not
``arrogant.''
	   He urged the Zapatista rebels to resume peace talks, which broke
off in 1996.

Chinese teen fights on, awaits parents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thursday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY McSHANE &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was a simple vault she had done dozens of
times before, but one she likely will never do again.
	   On Thursday, 17-year-old Chinese gymnast Sang Lan remained in a
Long Island hospital bed, unable to move her legs, learning about
the severity of her condition from doctors who required
interpreters to deliver their somber news.
	   ``She has begun to realize the seriousness of her injuries,''
the chief doctor in the case said.
	   Sang's parents remained half a world away, trying to get the
appropriate visas to see their injured child _ a trip that was
likely their first outside China, officials said. And an
experimental treatment of Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault
champion, was expected to start once a frustrating language barrier
was cleared.
	   ``We showed Sang Lan her X-rays and explained in more detail the
extent of what has happened to her,'' said Dr. Brock Schnebel, the
Goodwill Games' chief medical officer.
	   Sang, injured in a botched landing during a Tuesday warm-up for
the games, was still in critical but stable condition at the Nassau
County Medical Center. She was expected to receive treatment with a
new synthetic protein designed to combat nerve damage later
Thursday.
	   But before that could start, hospital officials needed consent
forms signed by a representative of China's delegation. The
complicated forms were painstakingly read by interpreters to
members of the Chinese delegation during the course of the day.
	   ``Because of liability concerns, everything must be explained,
and nobody speaks English,'' hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg
said. ``We want to make sure they understand everything.''
	   Sang's parents were due in Saturday night, hours after planned
fusion surgery to stabilize their daughter's spine. The family
lives in the fairly remote town of Ningbo, in Shanghai.
	   Sang's father, a government housing worker, and her mother, a
leather-factory employee, speak a different Chinese dialect and
will need different translators to communicate with doctors,
Lotenberg said. Hospital officials were already arranging that.
	   The hospital staff, moved by the gymnast's courage, signed an
enormous get-well card and put a stuffed white teddy bear in her
room. China's ambassador to the United Nations, Qin Huasun, was
among those who had sent flowers to the injured teen.
	   The hospital's phones and fax machine were flooded with messages
from people around the United States offering their prayers and
encouragement for the gymnast, Lotenberg said.
	   Sang was injured during a routine practice vault when she missed
her landing and struck the mat with her head. The resulting
fracture and dislocation of two neck vertebrae left her with no
movement in her legs.
	   Her prognosis hadn't changed from Wednesday, when doctors said
it was unlikely that she would ever walk again.
	   ``Clinically, she is not any different,'' Schnebel said. ``Her
condition remains the same, with no movement in her lower
extremities. She has begun to realize the seriousness of her
injuries, but is still demonstrating the same courage as she did
when she first arrived (at the hospital) on Monday.''
	   Once the gymnast's neck is stabilized, she would be able to
return home in about a week, officials said.

Woman charged over mortar attack outside police station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A 41-year-old woman was charged
Thursday night after a failed mortar bomb attack on a police
station.
	   The woman, whom police would not name until she appears in
court, is scheduled to come before a judge Friday accused of
conspiring to cause an explosion.
	   A youth who was arrested at the same time as the woman has been
released without charge, a police spokesman said.
	   The explosion Tuesday afternoon in the parking lot of a police
station in Newry, 35 miles south of Belfast _ apparently caused by
a mortar shell _ caused no injuries.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but mortars were a weapon
used by the Irish Republican Army, so suspicion has fallen on
dissidents who oppose Northern Ireland's peace process.

Congo leader makes surprise appearance in Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; CP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Congo's president made a surprise visit to Havana
on Thursday, turning up unexpectedly at a photo opportunity with
Fidel Castro.
	   The visit of Laurent Kabila, who took power in Zaire in May 1997
and renamed it Congo, had not been announced in Cuba.
	   The government called photographers to the Cuban president's
offices without telling them the subject, and when they entered he
was sitting with Kabila.
	   Kabila wore a blue traditional African robe and Castro wore an
olive-drab military uniform.
	   The two smiled but said nothing until the photographers left.
The government gave no explanation of Kabila's presence, except to
say that it was a working trip.
	   The appearance came three days before Cuba's Revolution Day
celebration, an annual event commemorating the anniversary of an
attack early in the Cuban revolution. It was not known whether
Kabila planned to attend.
	   Kabila staged an eight-month rebellion in what then was Zaire
and overthrew longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   He has since come under criticism from the United Nations for
not allowing international inspectors to visit sites of alleged
massacres during his rebellion.
	   During his years of opposition to Mobutu, Kabila drew some
support from the eastern bloc and espoused Marxist theory. In
recent years, he has said he favors free markets.

Paraguay grappling with growing number of local bank closings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ A growing number of Paraguayan banks
are closing, threatening a financial crisis for this small South
American country.
	   Over the last two weeks, Paraguay's Central Bank has shut down
three local banks and three financial houses, bringing a total of
39 shut down since 1995.
	   ``The people live in a climate of uncertainty,'' said Edgar
Luizamon, Paraguay's top banking official. ``They are taking their
money out of businesses in large quantities.''
	   The burgeoning financial crisis has prompted long lines of
customers withdrawing their money.
	   Officials blame rampant mismanagement, and some politicians and
local media say political uncertainty also plays a role.
	   ``Political instability since last April with respect to Lino
Cesar Oviedo has damaged the financial markets, generating strong
speculation,'' commented Ultima Hora, an evening paper.
	   Oviedo, once the governing Colorado Party's presidential
candidate, was jailed in December. He was sentenced several months
later, complicating the lead up to the elections won in May by Raul
Cubas, originally Oviedo's vice-presidential candidate.
	   One economic commentator and former politician said local
branches of foreign banks could help.
	   ``They have more capital, banking experience, and don't depend
on a small number of clients,'' said Luis Campos.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The national human rights
commissioner, Leo Valladares, criticized Canada Thursday for
deporting a former Honduran soldier who had testified about
military killings.
	   Canada this week deported Fausto Reyes Caballero, a former
member of the military-run police force who admitted helping a
notorious army battalion which killed leftists.
	   Valladares accused Canada of violating international law by
repatriating a person who had been granted political asylum and who
risks being killed upon returning to Honduras.
	   A spokesman at the Canadian Embassy, Kent Francis, said Canada
never granted refugee status to Reyes Caballero.
	   Reyes Caballero came to Canada in 1988 and was ordered deported
in 1993. An appeal had blocked deportation until now.
	   Reyes Caballero testified before the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights in 1989, admitting he had belonged to Battalion 3-16
and describing some of its actions. His testimony helped lead to
the court's order for Honduras to pay indemnities to relatives of
those slain between 1979 and 1981.
	   ___
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Eight farm workers and
two state policemen were killed Thursday when a truck collided with
an ambulance on a road in southern Chiapas state near the
Guatemalan border, police said.
	   Ten more people were injured in the crash near the village of
Lazaro Cardenas, about 60 miles southeast of San Cristobal.
	   The truck was carrying more than 30 farmworkers to collect
federal farm subsidy money. The two dead policemen were among three
officers riding in the ambulance.
	   Truck driver Jose Lopez Gomez told a public prosecutor that the
ambulance had strayed out of its lane and into oncoming traffic.
	   ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Election officials on Thursday turned down
a request by losing candidate Alvaro Noboa for a recount of the
votes in Ecuador's presidential runoff.
	   Noboa, a populist banana tycoon, lost to Quito Mayor Jamil
Mahuad 51 percent to 49 percent in the July 12 vote, according to
Ecuador's Supreme Electoral Council.
	   But Noboa insisted the vote was riddled with irregularities and
called on his supporters to continue protesting the alleged fraud.
	   Noboa's supporters occupied a church in the coastal city of
Guayaquil, Noboa's home town, for 48 hours earlier this week
demanding a vote recount.
	   Mahuad will replace interim President Fabian Alarcon on Aug. 10,
ending 18 months of transitional government.
	   ___
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ President Alberto Fujimori's daughter, Keiko
Sofia, has added her voice to the growing call for a referendum to
decide if her father can run for a third consecutive term in
office.
	   Keiko Sofia, the eldest of Fujimori's four children with former
wife Susan Higuchi, said her father had not yet decided whether or
not he plans to run.
	   Opposition politicians last week presented a list with 1.4
million signatures of Peruvians asking for a referendum on
Fujimori's re-election. Election officials are evaluating the
validity of the referendum request.
	   Peru's 1993 Constitution prohibits a president from running for
a third consecutive term in office, but the Fujimori-controlled
Congress passed a controversial law circumventing the
constitutional ban on his candidacy.
	   A recent poll showed that 71 percent of Lima residents supported
the referendum call and two thirds said they would vote against
Fujimori's presidential bid in such a referendum.
	   The poll by the private company Apoyo surveyed 510 residents of
the capital Lima on July 17, 18, with a margin for error of 4
percent.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Five police officers, accused of
participating in the beating and shooting of motorists in scenes
captured on amateur video, pleaded not guilty before a special
military tribunal Thursday.
	   The video, which first aired on TV Globo in March 1997, shocked
the nation by showing ten officers nonchalantly extorting and
torturing drivers at a roadblock set-up in a slum on the outskirts
of this city.
	   At one point during the video, an officer fired at a car killing
mechanic Mario Jose Josinho.
	   The five men are being tried before a special panel of four
military and one civilian judge and are charged with abuse of
authority and infliction of bodily harm. The crimes are punishable
by between three months and two years in prison.
	   A verdict is expected early Friday.
	   Three more officers _ including Otavio Lourenco Gambra,
nicknamed Rambo, who allegedly fired the shot which killed Josinho
_ had their trials rescheduled for Tuesday after their lawyers
failed to appear. Two more have yet to be indicted.
	   Some of the officers will also face murder and attempted murder
charges in a civilian court in September.

Packers, Chiefs, sign Japanese players for Tokyo game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ The Green Bay Packers and Kansas
City Chiefs didn't have to wait until their trip to Tokyo to get a
flavor for the Orient.
	   Four Japanese players became the first from their country to
take part in National Football League training camps on Thursday.
Two worked out with the Packers and two with the Chiefs.
	   The four played in NFL Europe and will be on the teams when the
Packers and Chiefs play in the ninth American Bowl at the Tokyo
Dome on Aug. 1.
	   ``It's nice to have them, it's kind of fun,'' Packers coach Mike
Holmgren said. ``At the meeting last night, I didn't want their
first experience with an American football player to be Ross Verba,
so I said, `Ross, don't let them see you, I don't want you to scare
them.' ''
	   Of course, one look at sumo-sized Gilbert Brown, and linebacker
Masafumi Kawaguchi of the Amsterdam Admirals and fullback Tamon
Nakamura of the Rhein Fire probably felt right at home in Green
Bay.
	   Tight end Nachi Abe and wide receiver Masato Itai, both from the
Scottish Claymores, practiced with the Chiefs at the University of
Wisconsin-River Falls.
	   Kawaguchi and Nakamura will also get to play special teams,
Holmgren said.
	   ``I just try to do my best, you know? I don't want to be
embarrassed in front of my people,'' said Kawaguchi, 25, who played
high school football in Los Angeles.
	   Not that any of the four would be recognized on the streets _ of
America or Japan.
	   ``There's soccer, baseball's a lot bigger'' than football back
home, Kawaguchi said. ``They don't understand the rules. It's kind
of complicated compared to soccer, baseball, so it might take a
little time to get popular.''
	   The NFL might not be big in Japan yet, but some players are huge
already.
	   ``Reggie White, Brett Favre, maybe Joe Montana,'' Kawaguchi
said. ``I know he is retired, but he's still big over there.''
	   ``Deion Sanders,'' added Nakamura.
	   The 1996 American Bowl in Tokyo featured the first Japanese
players to take part in an NFL game. Linebacker Takuro Abe and
Shigemasa Ito played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and defensive
lineman Takahrio Ikenoue played for the San Diego Chargers.
	   Those players practiced with their respective NFL teams in Tokyo
for a day before playing in the game.
	   This time, they actually get to spend some time practicing the
plays.
	   ``I was just excited to see those famous players,'' said
Kawaguchi, adding they were ``a lot bigger, a lot faster,'' than
those in Europe.
	   Several Packers offered tips to the Japanese during practice,
but some were seeking advice themselves.
	   White asked Kawaguchi if he could show him around Tokyo.
	   And what can the Packers expect to see in Japan?
	   ``Traffic jams,'' Nakamura said with a laugh and Kawaguchi
interpreting.
	   Despite the extra exhibition game and 15-hour flights, Holmgren
said he was eager for the first overseas trip in the club's 80-year
history.
	   ``It's a long trip, but I've asked for an overseas trip. I think
it's a valuable thing,'' he said. ``Forget about the football for a
second. It's a good thing for the players to experience other
places, other people, other customs. That's all part of learning
and growing up.
	   ``We'll go over there and play the football game, come back and
I'm going to give them some time off. My experience is you have a
little jet lag, then we'll just continue on in training camp.''
	   The four Japanese players will stay behind.
	   ``I just want to have a chance to show what I can do,''
Kawaguchi said.
	   But he has no illusions about opening some eyes and catching on
in the NFL for real.
	   ``It's still just a dream,'' he said. ``I wish I could set it as
a goal, but I can't. It's just a dream right now.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on TV ratings, beach volleyball mararthon,

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Johnson and Jackie Joyner-Kersee are
matching Greg Maddux and Chipper Jones when it comes to TV ratings.
	   Ratings for prime-time telcasts of the first four nights of the
Goodwill Games averaged 1.7 on WTBS, matching the average for
baseball's Atlanta Braves' telecasts on the cable superstation.
	   The rating translates to almost 1.3 million cable TV homes
across America and covers the main Goodwill telecasts.
	   Greg Hughes, vice president of public relations for Turner
Sports, said the Goodwill ratings also were in the same range as
audience numbers for TBS' NBA telecasts.
	   ``Everyone internally (at Turner Broadcasting) has been
pleased,'' Hughes said.
	   He said the ratings were up 42 percent from the average of
1.2-700,000 homes for the last Goodwill Games in 1994.
	   Non-sports programing on TBS generally draws higher ratings. The
July 15 telecast of ``Thunder,'' for example, drew a 3.0 rating and
an audience of 2.97 million homes, compared with the Goodwill
rating one week later of 1.7-1.3 million.
	   Hughes said TBS also was very happy with ratings for the
late-night rerun of the prime-time package, which hit a peak of
1.1-809,000 for Wednesday night's show that included
Joyner-Kersee's victory in the heptathlon and Johnson's anchor leg
on a world-record 1,600-meter relay.
	   ``That's an indication of the West Coast audience and people
attracted by good stories,'' Hughes said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NO SHORTCUTS HERE: &LR;  In a city that saw a 9-hour baseball
doubleheader this week, Argentina and Norway played another sports
marathon Thursday.
	   It took Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez 1 hour, 19 minutes and
135 serves to beat defending champions Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn
Maaseide 16-14 in Goodwill Games beach volleyball.
	   It was the longest match of the tournament.
	   The Argentines won the last three points and finished the match
just before a thunderstorm broke a weeklong heat wave and cleared
the manmade courts at a converted ice-skating rink in Central Park.
	   ``Usually, we serve well and block well. Today, we didn't do any
of those things,'' Maaseide said. ``How long did the game last? One
hour and 15 minutes? You don't have to focus on your side out, you
have to score points.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; OLD-TIMERS DAY: &LR;  Beach volleyball's grand old man came up
hurting Thursday.
	   Sinjin Smith, at 41 almost twice as old as some of his
opponents, injured his left calf late in the match with U.S.
teammate Ricci Luyties against Canada's John Child and Mark Heese.
	   After a 5-minute injury timeout, Smith returned to action but
Child and Heese won six of the last seven points for a 15-5
victory.
	   ``On a jump, I landed on my left leg. Something gave way and it
worried me,'' said Smith, who has won almost $1.3 million in career
prize money. ``At that point, my calf tightened up and I wasn't too
confident. I'll play (Friday) regardless, but it's not the best way
to enter a match.''
	   Smith and Luyties must beat the No. 1 U.S. team of Karch Kiraly
and Adam Johnson in Friday's final round-robin match to have any
chance of advancing to the semifinals.

Cuban leader calls report that he was hospitalized a lie

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Thursday he
was in good health and ridiculed a newspaper report indicating he
was hospitalized last year with a brain disease.
	   ``This is a lie from head to toe, absolutely false, crude and
stupid,'' the Notimex news agency quoted Castro as saying. He spoke
to a group of foreign reporters late Wednesday and early Thursday.
	   El Nuevo Herald newspaper of Miami reported Sunday that a woman
it identified as a former surgeon at a Havana hospital said Castro
was hospitalized from Oct. 22-28 for treatment of hypertensive
encephalopathy, a brain disease.
	   Castro was quoted as saying he had never heard of the disease or
the woman cited in the report, Elizabeth Trujillo.
	   ``The woman who says she is a surgeon is not even a doctor and
has never worked in any hospital,'' Castro was quoted as saying.
``Someone fooled El Nuevo Herald, and it fooled millions of
people.''
	   The story already had been questioned by U.S. officials in
Washington, as well as by reports noting that Castro had met with
the Vatican's top spokesman at the time he was allegedly
hospitalized.
	   Roberto Fabricio, El Nuevo Herald's managing editor, said the
newspaper would ``stand by our stories on the Castro illness 100
percent.''
	   ``Fidel Castro did not shed any light as to what is his health,
where he was on the dates in question or present any doctors at
CIMEQ hospital (Center for Medical and Surgical Research) to verify
his account.''
	   Fabricio said El Nuevo Herald's reporter, Pablo Alfonso,
reviewed Trujillo's medical diplomas. Fabricio said Trujillo's
employment at the exclusive hospital in Havana had been confirmed
by two other doctors as well.
	   ``It's a total contradiction of Castro,'' Fabricio said.
	   El Nuevo Herald is a Spanish-language daily newspaper owned by
The Miami Herald.
	   Notimex said Castro summoned reporters to the highly unusual
meeting, which followed the close of a Cuban National Assembly
session, in part to denounce the newspaper's report.
	   Notimex said Castro gave the reporters a three-page preliminary
report from an official investigation into the allegations that he
was hospitalized.
	   According to that report, Trujillo left nursing school before
graduating and worked as a secretary at a research center before
leaving Cuba for Colombia with her husband in 1995.
	   Castro said he had ``never even had an X-ray'' at the hospital
where he was reported to have undergone the treatment, Notimex
said.

As aftershocks rattle coast, medics battle gangrene outbreak

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Life was purchased at the cost
of limb Thursday for some patients at a tent field hospital in
Papua New Guinea, where survivors of a series of tidal waves
underwent amputation to treat gangrene-infected wounds.
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the three
tidal waves Friday further added to the worries of residents of the
northwest coast.
	   Small tremors _ called ``guria'' in the local Pidgin language _
are common on the island and authorities said the latest ones posed
no danger of tidal surges like the ones that hit last week, killing
more than 1,300 people and leaving 6,000 missing and feared dead.
	   Only about 2,500 to 3,500 of the 8,000 to 10,000 villagers of
this 18-mile (30-kilometer) stretch of coast have been found alive.
	   On Friday, emergency coordinator Col. Tokam Kanene announced
that the effort to retrieve bodies from the mangrove swamps around
Sissano lagoon will be halted.
	   The task had become impossible as the bodies are falling apart
in the tropical heat, and the thick jungle swamps are impenetrable.
Survivors will be evacuated from the area.
	   The tent hospital, where about 130 operations have been
performed since Monday, went into high gear again late Wednesday
after gangrene broke out among survivors.
	   Two Australian field surgeons operated on 13 people, amputating
seven limbs, including the left leg of an 8-year-old boy, who may
yet lose his right leg as well. The group of survivors had
previously been treated at the town of Aitape, but the hospital
there has no surgeon and could not cope with the infections.
	   ``Some of those people would have died today if they hadn't been
brought here and operated on,'' said surgeon Maj. Paul Taylor, who
with his colleagues operated on the injured throughout the night.
	   A surgical team will now be sent to Aitape hospital, said
Taylor.
	   Most injuries happened when the tsunami flung people against
trees or debris, fracturing bones and tearing open skin. Many
people died instantly; others died in the jungle before medical
help could reach them.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured now is infection.
Coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   In the disaster zone itself, the medical emergency has eased as
survivors have been moved to hospitals or to new villages erected
on higher ground.
	   In the remote jungle region, conditions such as malaria, skin
infections, diarrhea, parasitic worms and pneumonia are endemic, he
said.
	   Lt. Brad Slater, an Australian army officer at the emergency
field hospital in Vanimo, said the field hospital had treated many
pneumonia cases brought on by breathing seawater.
	   He said officials plan an inoculation program to be run by the
Papua New Guinea government, aid agencies and non-government
organizations.
	   The gruesome task of body recovery and disposal continued
Thursday. At least 30 bodies were found washed up on a beach in the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
west of the disaster zone, local police said, on condition of
anonymity.
	   The U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado said the aftershocks
reported by authorities and residents early Thursday apparently
were small. They were enough to rattle villagers and rescuers
alike.
	   ``I heard a sound like a C-130 and then felt this shudder
through the floor I was sitting on,'' said Slater.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Congo's president made a surprise visit to Havana
on Thursday, turning up unexpectedly at a photo opportunity with an
old friend _ Fidel Castro.
	   The visit of Laurent Kabila, who took power in Zaire in May 1997
and renamed it Congo, had not been announced in Cuba.
	   The government called photographers to the Cuban president's
offices without telling them the subject, and when they entered he
was sitting with Kabila, who wore a blue traditional African robe.
Castro wore an olive-drab military uniform.
	   The two smiled but said nothing until the photographers left.
The government gave no explanation of Kabila's presence, except to
say that it was a working trip.
	   The appearance came three days before Cuba's Revolution Day
celebration, an annual event commemorating the anniversary of an
attack early in the Cuban revolution. It was not known whether
Kabila planned to attend.
	   Cuba sent 1,000 troops headed by one of Castro's top commanders,
Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, to assist a rebel force led by Kabila in
1965 in what was then called Zaire. The effort failed.
	   Kabila tried again in 1996, staging an eight-month rebellion and
overthrowing longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   He has since come under criticism from the United Nations for
not allowing international inspectors to visit sites of alleged
massacres during his rebellion.
	   During his years of opposition to Mobutu, Kabila drew some
support from the eastern bloc and espoused Marxist theory. In
recent years, he has said he favors free markets.

Study: Postoperative radiation therapy for lung cancer may do more

 &UR; Eds: EDITS throughout to ADD comments by independent U.S. doctors;
CLARIFY in first two grafs that radiation therapy after surgery
more selective. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The practice of exposing lung cancer patients to
radiation therapy after surgery to remove tumors may do more harm
than good and should not be used routinely, according to a study
published Friday.
	   Many lung cancer patients undergo radiation therapy after
surgery to treat any remaining cancer cells, although some doctors
have become more selective about which patients receive radiation
therapy. The results of previous studies examining the
effectiveness of the treatment have been contradictory or
inconclusive.
	   In the largest study of its kind, an international team of
researchers combined information gathered over the past 30 years in
nine studies involving a total of 2,128 lung cancer patients
worldwide.
	   Patients who had been treated with radiation therapy after
surgery were 21 percent more likely to die than those who only had
surgery, according to the study published in this week's issue of
The Lancet, a British medical journal. Researchers are unsure why
radiation therapy caused more deaths earlier.
	   About 900,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with lung cancer
every year, according to the World Health Organization.
	   Dr. Gordon McVie, director general at the Cancer Research
Campaign in London and a lung cancer specialist who was not part of
the study, said the research was authoritative and important.
	   ``It should be compulsory reading for chief executives of
hospitals. In many parts, this is routine treatment. It has been
assumed that it was a good idea,'' he said. ``I was unsurprised
that radiotherapy didn't prolong survival, but what I'm really
concerned about is that it could actually do harm. There is a very
clear message here.''
	   The patients in the study had non-small-cell lung cancer, which
accounts for 80 percent of all lung cancer cases. A total of 1,056
had surgery and radiotherapy while 1,072 had surgery alone.
	   The detrimental effect was worst in patients in the early stages
of the disease, the study said.
	   In those with more advanced but still operable lung cancer, the
study said radiation therapy did not seem to cause harm although it
also did not appear to help.
	   ``The 21 percent relative increase in the risk of death
associated with radiotherapy, equivalent to an overall reduction in
survival from 55 percent (for surgery alone) to 48 percent (for
surgery and radiotherapy) at two years, represents a substantial
hazard to these patients,'' said Lesley Stewart of the Cambridge,
England-based Medical Research Council, which led the study.
	   Researchers concluded that radiation therapy should not be given
routinely to patients in the early stage of non-small-cell lung
cancer and that its role in the treatment of more advanced stages
of the disease ``is not clear and may warrant further research.''
	   ``There was some hint that it might prevent recurring tumors,
but that was heavily outweighed by the ill effects _ the increased
deaths,'' Stewart said.
	   Although he had not read the study on Thursday, Dr. J. Frank
Wilson, a professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee and a member of the board of chancellors for
the Reston, Virginia-based American College of Radiology, said
radiation treatment has become more precise in the past 30 years,
with fewer patients receiving surgery for lung cancer.
	   ``We're talking about obsolete methodology,'' he said, referring
to older studies.
	   The study also isn't entirely new to oncologists. In cases where
there is no indication that the cancer has spread to the lymph
nodes in the lung and chest, cancer specialists have known for
years that radiation would be detrimental, said Dr. William Sause,
a radiation oncologist at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City.
	   ``If radiation is to be applied postoperatively, it needs to be
done in very selected cases, such as if the surgeon leaves some
tumor behind,'' Sause said.
	   In an independent commentary, also published in The Lancet, Dr.
Alistair Munro of Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, Scotland, said
postoperative radiotherapy doses are too high and that there are
``valuable lessons to be learned'' from the Cambridge study.

Cardinals rout Giants; Cubs edge Expos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Kent Bottenfield allowed one run and three
hits in seven innings and drove in a run for the first time since
1993 as the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the San Francisco Giants
8-1 Thursday.
	   Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 43 homers, went 0-for-2
with three walks, an RBI and two runs scored. He was hitless in six
at-bats as the Cardinals swept the two-game series in San
Francisco.
	   Bottenfield (3-5), who had not won since June 18, walked five
and struck out three. His run-scoring groundout in the fifth was
his first RBI since he had three in 1993 for the Colorado Rockies.
	   Danny Darwin (6-8) lost his fifth straight decision, allowing
three runs on seven hits and three walks in 5 1-3 innings. The
Giants have lost 11 of 13 games since the All-Star break.
 &UR; Cubs 2, Expos 1
	   In Chicago, Mark Clark and Rod Beck combined on a six-hitter and
the Cubs won their fifth straight game, beating the Montreal Expos.
	   The Expos lost their seventh straight game. The Cubs are 6-0
against Montreal this season at Wrigley Field.
	   Clark (6-9) allowed four hits in eight strong innings. Beck
pitched the ninth for his 29th save. Jeremy Powell (0-1) lost in
his major league debut. He gave up two runs and three hits in six
innings.
 &UR; Mets 6, Brewers 5
	   In Milwaukee, Mike Piazza singled for his third hit and scored
on pinch-hitter Matt Franco's single in the ninth inning as the New
York Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers for their fourth straight win.
	   Piazza singled off Mike Myers (2-2) with one out in the ninth.
After Bernard Gilkey was hit by a pitch, Chad Fox relieved and gave
up Franco's single down the third-base line.
	   Greg McMichael (2-3) got the win and John Franco got three outs
for his 20th save.
 &UR; Rockies 6, Reds 4, 1st game
	   In Denver, rookie Todd Helton homered and Larry Walker had his
seventh three-hit game of the season as the Colorado Rockies beat
the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of a day-night doubleheader.
	   The Reds lost their sixth in a row following a 10-game winning
streak.
	   Pedro Astacio (8-10) extended Colorado's scoreless innings
streak to a team-record 16 innings before surrendering a three-run
homer to Paul Konerko in the eighth.
	   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his fourth save.
	   Mike Remlinger (6-11) gave up two runs on 10 hits in 4 1-3
innings.
 &UR; Padres 3, Diamondbacks 0
	   In San Diego, the Padres increased their National League West
lead to a team-record 13 games, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks
behind eight sharp innings by Joey Hamilton.
	   Hamilton (9-9) gave up four hits, struck out 10 and walked none.
He won four straight decisions despite recent rumors that he was on
the trading block.
	   The Padres won for the 10th time in 12 games to extend their
lead over San Francisco, which lost 8-1 to St. Louis. Before this
season, the Padres' previous biggest lead was 12 on the final two
days of the 1984 season.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 32nd save, striking out
two.

UN marks six months of staffer's hostage-taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
called Thursday for the release of U.N. staffer Vincent Cochetel,
who was kidnapped six months ago in southern Russia.
	   ``It is an outrage that Vincent Cochetel is still held
hostage,'' Sadako Ogata said in a release. ``I appeal to the
kidnappers to release him immediately.''
	   Cochetel, 37, who headed UNHCR's regional office in North
Ossetia, near Chechnya, was seized by three masked gunmen in his
apartment in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29, six
months ago next Wednesday.
	   The UNHCR has maintained daily contact with Russian and Ossetian
authorities in an effort to secure his release.
	   The abduction was one of a series of incidents which illustrate
the growing dangers of humanitarian work, the UNHCR said. This
month alone, seven U.N. workers were killed in Afghanistan, Georgia
and Tajikistan.
	   ``This is not a political or diplomatic issue. All of us are
possible future victims,'' said the UNHCR's Alejandro Henning, who
organized a protest in Geneva in April as a sign of solidarity with
Cochetel.

Nicklaus hobbles to 3-over-par 74 in first round of U.S. Senior

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Golden Bear was slowed to a hobble by a
sore left hip in the first round of the U.S. Senior Open.
	   Jack Nicklaus, beginning his quest for a third Senior Open
championship on Thursday, limped noticeably while carding a
3-over-par 74, and then said he had no plans to play in any more
tournaments this year.
	   ``It hurt a little bit today,'' Nicklaus said of his arthritic
left hip. ``I had a little bit of a problem with it. It generally
doesn't bother my swing, but it did today.
	   ``It comes and goes a little bit. It'll be better tomorrow, I
hope. I never know from day to day what's going to happen.''
	   When did the pain start?
	   ``Thirty-five years ago in San Francisco,'' he said with a
smile. ``Today, probably about 8 or 9. That hip has been a problem
for 35 years. My hardest part was just playing well.
	   ``I purposely am going to have it be my last event of the year
so I can figure out what to do.''
	   Later, Nicklaus backed off that statement a little bit, saying,
``I don't have any other tournaments scheduled right now. I'm not
going to play again until I can do what I need to do with the leg.
I'll figure out what I need to do (next week).''
	   Hip replacement surgery seems likely in the near future for
arguably the greatest golfer of all time.
	   Nicklaus, who opted not to play in the British Open last week,
snapping his streak of competing in 146 straight PGA Tour majors,
was three shots off the pace midway through the opening round at
the Riviera Country Club.
	   Jay Sigel, who played in the same threesome with Nicklaus,
carded an even-par 71 over the 6,906-yard (6,284-meter) course, as
did Hugh Baiocchi and Bob Murphy.
	   All seemed pleased with their rounds.
	   ``Par will be a wonderful score at the end of the week,'' Murphy
said after a round that included an eagle-3 on the first hole, a
double bogey-6 on the third hole, four bogeys and four birdies.
	   Sigel had three birdies and three bogeys and Baiocchi had five
birdies and five bogeys.
	   One shot off the pace and in the clubhouse were John Grace,
Billy King, Tom Shaw, Ed Dougherty, Isao Aoki and Brian Barnes. And
several more came in at 73.
	   Senior Tour earnings leader Hale Irwin shot a 77, his worst
round of the year.
	   Gil Morgan and Larry Nelson, who along with Irwin were
considered pre-tournament favorites, were among the late starters
along with Raymond Floyd, Dave Stockton and Arnold Palmer.
	   Irwin and Morgan have each won four tournaments this year and
Nelson two. Morgan is trying to become the second player to win
three senior majors in one year, joining Nicklaus, who accomplished
the feat in 1991.
	   Nicklaus, 58, attempting to become the oldest winner of the
Senior Open, was 1-over through 14 holes, but carded a double
bogey-6 on 15, a birdie-4 at 17, and a bogey-5 on 18.
	   On the par-3 16th, he backed off a shot after beginning his
backswing, then grimaced in pain after hitting his shot into a
bunker. He then hit a wonderful shot out of the trap for a tap-in
to save par.
	   ``Jack looks uncomfortable, even walking,'' Sigel said. ``It is
painful to watch him. He played very, very well. In many cases, he
played better than I did. He's a champion, to say the least.''
	   Nicklaus didn't agree with Sigel's assessment of his game.
	   ``I played what I thought was a fairly poor round,'' he said.
``I only hit eight greens today. If you only hit eight greens,
you're not going to play very well.''

Manuel Mejia Vallejo, award-winning author, dies at 75
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Manuel Mejia Vallejo, the award-winning
Colombian novelist noted for his realistic depictions of urban and
rural life, died Thursday at age 75.
	   Along with Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Alvaro Mutis, he was among
the most important writers in a country with one of Latin America's
strongest literary traditions.
	   Mejia Vallejo died at his country estate outside Medellin after
suffering two recent strokes, a statement from his family said.
	   Much of his work dealt with the social upheavals that occurred
in and around his native Medellin. An outspoken leftist, he was
forced into exile in Venezuela and Central America during a 1950s
dictatorship.
	   Mejia Vallejo wrote his first novel, ``It Was Us,'' at age 22.
In 1962, he won Spain's Nadal Prize for his novel ``The Marked
Day.'' He won Venezuela's Romulo Gallegos prize in 1989 for ``The
House of the Two Palms.''
	   ``Air of Tango'' is narrated by a young marijuana-smoking
homosexual living in a slum. It depicts the world of tango on the
streets of Medellin, where the Argentine music genre has always
been popular.
	   ``In order to write this novel, I needed to know the effects of
marijuana on the human organism,'' Mejia Vallejo said during his
last radio interview, which was rebroadcast Thursday.
	   Novels such as ``The Merchants'' and ``At the Foot of the City''
spoke of the misery and alienation of city life. ``Summer
Afternoon'' is a woman*s monologue depicting the infinite tedium of
life in a small town.
	   There was no word on survivors or funeral plans.

Pregnant Brazilian appeals for right to abort deformed baby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A four-month pregnant woman has
gone to court for the right to abort her baby because part of its
cranium is missing, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Doctors said the baby of the unnamed 27-year-old teacher has no
chance of survival, the O Globo newspaper reported.
	   The woman's case will be ruled on by a tribunal in Belo
Horizonte, 210 miles (340 kms) north of Rio, after a lower court
refused to grant her the right to have an abortion.
	   In Brazil, abortion is illegal unless except in cases of rape or
when the mother's life is in danger.
	   The teacher and her boyfriend, a 23 year old mechanic, declined
to comment.
	   Their lawyer, Daniel Ribeiro Pettersen, told O Globo he was
confident of success because four women with deformed fetuses had
won appeals at the same tribunal.

Court rulings clash on hanging cases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Two judges are clashing over
whether prison conditions on Trinidad and Tobago's death row are
bad enough to exempt two convicted murderers from hanging.
	   Days after High Court Judge Peter Jamadar ruled that one man
should be spared because prison conditions were inhumane, another
judge, Wendell Kangalloo, ruled in a separate death row case
Thursday that conditions were acceptable.
	   Both cases are expected to be appealed.
	   ``My finding is that while the conditions on death row can and
should be improved upon, I do not find that, having regard to the
security and other financial constraints, they fall below the
standards of decency,'' Kangalloo said, upholding an execution
warrant for murder convict Naif Hilaire. He set the execution for
July 27.
	   The judge said Britain's Privy Council, the supreme court for
many former British colonies, had not decided whether prison
conditions could be used as an argument in death penalty appeals.
	   ``I myself have a difficulty in holding that sub-standard prison
conditions can be taken into account in the circumstances of this
case,'' Kangalloo said.
	   On Tuesday, Jamadar ruled that murderer Darrin Thomas had been
jailed without sufficient light, handcuffed during exercise breaks
and given inadequate food. Jamadar ordered that Thomas be spared
execution and serve a life term in prison.
	   Trinidad and Tobago has led recent resistance in the Caribbean
to pressure by Britain and human rights groups to eliminate the
death penalty.
	   Caribbean countries argue executions help deter violent crime
caused by drug traffic through the region.
	   Citing delays in appeals cases, Trinidad announced in April it
would drop out of an Organization of American States accord
allowing death row inmates to appeal to an international tribunal.

Priest's arrest in Bishop's killing surprises Guatemala

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A priest arrested in the murder of a
bishop who crusaded for human rights denied any involvement
Thursday and a judge slapped a gag order on the surprising new
development.
	   Rev. Mario Orantes Najera, who reported the discovery of Bishop
Juan Gerardi's bludgeoned body in April, told reporters that
allegations of his involvement were ``absurd'' before he entered
the court with eight heavily armed officers wearing bullet proof
vests.
	   Orantes left the judge's office after more than five hours of
hearings saying ``I hope the truth will come out.'' Judge Isaias
Figueroa Medina is expected to rule by Friday on whether to hold
Orantes for trial or release him.
	   His arrest came after weeks of speculation that Gerardi had been
killed by members of the right-wing death squads or military units
accused of widespread killings in a church human rights report
Gerardi issued.
	   The death was a jolt, and led Guatemalans to believe that their
long civil war was not yet over.
	   Pope John Paul II called the killing ``a violent act that
threatens peace.'' London-based Amnesty International said the
killing ``confirms a fact: Guatemala, at present, continues in the
past.''
	   After questioning Orantes behind closed doors, Figueroa Medina
imposed a 10-day gag order on comments about the case by all
involved.

	   VERSAILLES, France (AP) _ Gerard Depardieu, whose blood-alcohol
content was five times the legal limit when he crashed his
motorcycle last May, was given a three-month suspended sentence and
fined dlrs 1,600 for drunken driving.
	   The star of ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' and ``Green Card'' suffered
leg and facial injuries in the accident in nearby Clairefontaine
and was unable to work for a month.
	   The court on Thursday also suspended Depardieu's driver's
license for 15 months.
	   Depardieu told the court that he had been drinking heavily the
night before the crash after clinching a contract to distribute
three French films in the United States.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SAVANNAH, Georgia. (AP) _ John Travolta danced like an angel to
please a crowd that had gathered to watch the shooting of a scene
for his latest movie, ``The General's Daughter.''
	   Travolta was in Madison Square on Wednesday when a bystander
yelled: ``Do the Michael dance!''
	   The actor accommodated with a brief reprise of his shuffle in
``Michael,'' a film in which he played an earthy angel.
	   In ``The General's Daughter,'' Travolta actor plays an Army
investigator hunting down murderers.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ A judge's decision that Martin Luther King Jr.'s
``I Have a Dream'' speech belongs to the public could be a hard
financial blow for his widow and children.
	   King's most famous speech, delivered on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial, probably generates more income than any of his other
copyrighted material, said Clayborne Carson, a leading King scholar
and the director of Stanford University's repository of King's
papers.
	   Judge William O'Kelley ruled Wednesday in favor of CBS News,
which the King estate had sued for copyright infringement. O'Kelley
noted that King did not copyright his speech before distributing
advance copies to reporters.
	   In the speech _ delivered on Aug. 28, 1963, before 200,000
people in Washington _ King speaks of his dream that his children
would be judged on their character, not the color of their skin.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A no-show in court two weeks ago, Stone
Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland has been arrested on a felony
warrant.
	   Weiland, 30, posted dlrs 250,000 bail and was released
Wednesday, the day after his arrest. He is due in court on Aug. 12,
police Officer Don Cox said.
	   An arrest warrant was issued July 9 after Weiland failed to
appear in court. He also missed a court date a month earlier,
apparently because he was undergoing drug detoxification near Los
Angeles, said his lawyer, Michael Nasitir.
	   Weiland was charged in February with felony possession of heroin
and misdemeanor possession of a hypodermic needle stemming from a
September 1997 arrest. He faces up to three years in state prison
if convicted.
	   Weiland also has a July 31 hearing on drug charges in New York.
	   The Stone Temple Pilots won a Grammy in 1994 in the hard rock
performance with vocal category for the song ``Plush.'' Other hits
include ``Interstate Love Song'' and ``Big Empty.''

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials plunged nearly 200 points
Thursday, extending a week-long slide from record highs, as a
sudden spurt of disappointing profit news continued. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell nearly 196 points to about 8,933, trading
below 9,000 for the first time since July 1. The Dow has been mired
in a losing streak since Friday's record close at 9,337.97 after
profit warnings by Merck, Hewlett-Packard and DuPont. Boeing joined
that list Thursday, falling the equivalent of 25 Dow points, after
the aircraft manufacturer failed to satisfy Wall Street's deflated
expectations for the second-quarter and predicted a gloomy year.
The Standard and Poor's 500 fell 24.32 to 1,139.76, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 34.53 to 1,935.22.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin appointed a former Politburo member
to his Cabinet on Thursday in an apparent move to improve his
relations with the hard-line parliament, which has blocked many of
the president's economic reforms. Yuri Maslyukov, 60, a former
chairman of the Soviet planning agency Gosplan, was named Minister
for Industry and Trade. A gesture of this sort has been expected
from the president for weeks. The Duma's reluctance to approve
higher taxes and budget cuts has aggravated relations with the
Kremlin and dismayed international lenders. The International
Monetary Fund approved its part of a dlrs 17.1 billion bailout for
Russia this week, but reduced the first installment by dlrs 800
million to protest the Duma's rejection of the austerity measures.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ SBC Communications has received clearance from
the European Commission and other antitrust authorities to buy baby
Bell rival Ameritech Corp., the companies announced Thursday. The
approval comes just over two months after San Antonio-based SBC
announced it would buy Chicago-based Ameritech in a dlrs 60 billion
stock swap deal that would create a company with 57 million phone
lines, or nearly one-third of the U.S. total. The deal required
European regulatory approval because Ameritech has the largest
stake of U.S. telecommunications companies in Europe, with
interests in Belgacom of Belgium, TeleDanmark of Denmark and Matav
of Hungary. SBC also has investments in France, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. (US-PHONE MERGER-EUROPE)
	   NEW YORK _ Reuters Holdings PLC is buying the mutual fund
division of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a pioneering provider
of data on the dlrs 7 trillion mutual fund industry. Reuters,
already the world's largest provider of financial information,
announced Thursday it is paying an undisclosed amount of cash to
add Lipper's well-known data and brand name. Privately held Lipper
Analytical provides performance data on 39,000 mutual funds to news
outlets and investment companies. Demand for such information is
booming as growth in 401(k) retirement plans and other mutual funds
have helped fuel the bull market on Wall Street. London-based
Reuters will lend its deeper pockets and international presence to
Lipper Analytical, which faces growing competition.
(US-REUTERS-LIPPER)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors
Service Inc. put Tokyo's top-grade rating under review Thursday,
threatening to raise public and private borrowing costs. The
announcement, a signal that Moody's might lower its appraisal of
Japan's ability to repay its debts, came as the ruling party
prepared to choose its nominee for prime minister and sent tremors
through Tokyo financial markets. The dollar surged above 142 yen
for the first time since July 13 before easing to 141.68 yen in
late Tokyo trading Thursday. Japanese bond prices initially
plummeted after the report was released, but rebounded in late
trading. Tokyo stocks declined. A lowering of the rating could
hamper Japan's efforts to pull out of its slump. (JAPAN-MOODY's)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ AT and T Corp. on Thursday released a mixed
batch of financial results that underscored its reasons for trying
so hard to buy Tele-Communications Inc. for dlrs 31.7 billion. AT
and T reported a 20 percent profit gain in the second quarter,
slightly beating Wall Street forecasts. But revenues grew by only 1
percent _ dragged down by a 3.7 percent drop in the company's sales
of long-distance phone calls to consumers, as rivals such as MCI
and Sprint relentlessly try to lure away the 70 million AT and T
residential phone customers. AT and T chairman Michael Armstrong is
driving to expand into services with more room for growth, such as
local telephone service. AT and T plans to invest billions of
dollars to convert TCI's cable TV lines into a two-way network
carrying entertainment, high-speed Internet and telephone services
into millions of U.S. homes. Also Thursday, AT and T's dlrs 11.3
billion takeover of local phone provider Teleport Communications
Corp won federal regulatory approval. (US-EARNS-AT and T)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's president escaped with minor
injuries from an assassination attempt Thursday that killed two
bodyguards and destroyed several cars in his motorcade. A car bomb
exploded while President Aslan Maskhadov was traveling through the
streets of Grozny, escalating an already tense situation in the
rebel region. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but
Maskhadov blamed Russia's security services or Chechen warlords who
are vying for power. Suspicion also fell on Islamic militants who
have been feuding with Maskhadov's government in recent weeks.
(RUSSIA-CHECHNYA'S PRESIDENT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Iran's test of a medium-range missile will not
derail U.S. efforts to ease tensions with the country, even though
the missile could pose a threat to Israel, Turkey and U.S. forces
in the Middle East, officials said Thursday. Defense and
intelligence officials said they are unsure whether the Iranian
test was successful, noting that the rocket exploded or was
detonated about 100 seconds into the flight. These officials
estimated Iran will need more time and more tests to deploy the
weapon, which has a range estimated at 800 miles (1,200
kilometers). Nevertheless, news of the test detected by U.S.
intelligence satellites late Tuesday Washington time, was greeted
as yet another sign of the spread of weapons in a region already
grappling with recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
(US-IRAN-MISSILE TEST)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
rejected a request Thursday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
meet, and suspended further negotiations between the sides until
Israel accepted a U.S. peace proposal, his aides said. Israel
insisted that only slight disagreements remained between the two
sides regarding an American proposal for an Israeli troop
withdrawal and that an agreement was within reach. Both sides have
appealed to the United States for help, but have been rebuffed by
the United States which says Israel and the Palestinians should try
harder to reach agreement on a West Bank troop pullback without
U.S. mediation. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Life was purchased at the cost
of limb Thursday for some patients at a tent field hospital in
Papua New Guinea, where survivors of a series of tidal waves
underwent amputation to treat gangrene-infected wounds. New
aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the three tidal
waves Friday further added to the worries of residents of the
northwest coast. Small tremors are common on the island and
authorities said the latest ones posed no danger of tidal surges
like the ones that hit last week, killing more than 1,300 people
and leaving 6,000 missing and feared dead. (PAPUA NEW
GUINEA-TSUNAMI)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The European Union plans a peace
mission to Kosovo next week, but the United States is warning that
outside force to stop the killing remains an option, although it,
too, supports a peaceful solution. The European Union announcement
of a mission to seek a peaceful end to the conflict came Thursday,
the same day Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy,
said the U.S. administration has not ``ruled out'' unilateral
military force or participating in a NATO plan for action. In
neighboring Macedonia, NATO's secretary general said the military
organization continues planning ``a wide range of options.''

EU launches Kosovo mission, US warns force is still an option

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The European Union plans a peace
mission to Kosovo next week, but the United States is warning that
outside force to stop the killing remains an option _ although it
also prefers a negotiated end to the violence.
	   The EU announcement came Thursday, the same day Walter Slocombe,
undersecretary of defense for policy, said the U.S. administration
has not ``ruled out'' unilateral military force or participating in
a NATO plan for action.
	   ``We are prepared to act alone if necessary, ``he said.
	   In neighboring Macedonia, NATO's secretary general said the
military organization continues planning ``a wide range of
options.''
	   ``Our obligation is to be prepared if necessary,'' said
Secretary General Javier Solana.
	   There was little violence in the Serbian province on Thursday,
but an aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic targeted a top
U.S. envoy with a war of words.
	   The unusually harsh criticism was directed against U.S. envoy
Robert Gelbard by Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist
party. It appeared provoked by Gelbard's recent meeting with
Milosevic's political rivals.
	   ``Robert Gelbard, an accomplice of women and children murderers
in Kosovo and of criminals who kidnap civilians, supports terrorism
and terrorist gangs,'' Dacic told reporters in Belgrade, capital of
both Yugoslavia and Serbia, its largest remaining republic.
	   ``It is only logical that he also gathers the (political) scum
... everybody who is against Serbia.''
	   Gelbard has been meeting with Serbian and Yugoslav politicians,
the opposition and ethnic Albanian leaders in attempts to find a
negotiated end to escalating violence pitting authorities against
Albanian guerrillas seeking to wrest Kosovo away from Serbia.
	   New tragedy appeared to be developing in the aftermath of the
conflict in Orahovac, where Serb forces drove out separatist Kosovo
Albanian fighters in five days of fighting.
	   Thousands of refugees were flooding the nearby town of Malisevo,
resulting in alarming shortages of food, drinking water and other
necessities, local Albanian media said.
	   Kosovo, a southern province in Serb-led Yugoslavia, has a
population of 2 million people _ 90 percent of them ethnic
Albanians, who want independence from the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic started a
crackdown on Albanian militants in late February.
	   Serbs and Kosovo Albanians accused each other Thursday of
summary executions, beatings and other atrocities during the recent
fierce fighting for Orahovac, a strategic central town.
	   With areas of conflict inaccessible due to road blocks erected
by both sides, it's difficult to assess the truth of conflicting
reports by the two ethic groups fighting for Kosovo.

Tour begins second half with Ullrich in yellow and drug questions

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TARASCON-SUR-ARIEGE, France (AP) _ The Tour de France starts its
second half of this year's race much the way it began - with Jan
Ullrich in the leader's yellow jersey and police questioning about
a team whose car was found with drugs in it.
	   Ullrich has a 71-second lead over American Bobby Julich heading
into Friday's 12th stage, a 222-kilometer (137-mile) leg from
Tarascon-sur-Ariege to Cap d'Agde. The Tour is slowly making its
way across southern France before hitting the Alps on Monday.
	   The German has the yellow jersey on again. He began the race
July 11 as the defending champion but lost it for a week before
gaining it back after Saturday's time trial and the first mountain
stage on Tuesday.
	   Back in Ireland, also, the Festina drug scandal started to
unravel with a team masseur being held in France for having
performance-enhancing drugs in his car.
	   Since there three Festina officials, including its director and
team doctor were charged and are awaiting a court hearing Friday
after the Festina riders were thrown out of the Tour.
	   On Thursday's rest day for the Tour, when the Festina riders
were placed in police detention to answer questions in Lyon,
officials from the Dutch TVM team were having their day with
police.
	   Police in Pamiers ordered TVM's sporting director, doctor and
chief mechanic to answer questions about their role in the possible
use of illegal doping substances, according to judicial sources.
	   TVM came under the spotlight earlier this week when it emerged
that the substance EPO had been found in the car of one of its
officials in March.
	   The TVM team practiced normally on Thursday preparing for
Friday's stage and Tour officials are also trying to get back to
racing.
	   Julich, from Glenwood Springs, Colorado, is challenging Ullrich
entering the final 10 stages.
	   The 26-year-old Julich rides for the French Cofidis team and
came in 17th in his first Tour participation.
	   ``Since last year I knew I could have a good result this year,''
Julich said. ``When I started this year's Tour I hoped to be in the
top 10.''
	   ``After the first week, I though `OK. Maybe the top 15'. Now I
see myself in Paris in the top three,'' he said.
	   What caused him to change his mind was a series of performances
that kept him close to Ullrich.
	   Last Saturday Ullrich won the first time trial but Julich was
third, a minute 18 seconds behind.
	   Julich stayed with Ullrich in the two stages in the Pyrenees. He
was fourth Tuesday and third Wednesday with Ullrich coming in
eighth both times. Ullrich relaxed a little, giving up seven
seconds to Julich to allow the American to creep within 71 seconds
of the overall lead.
	   Bernard Quilfen, director of the Cofidis team, is confident that
his team can help Julich.
	   ``The riders are ready to protect and defend the second place of
Bobby,'' Quilfen said. ``He showed he is a good rider after his
fourth place in the Disneyland time trial last year. Now he is a
year older and has really matured this year.''
	   There are three stages before three days in the Alps could
decide things.
	   Julich knows it will be tough to overcome the advantage that
Ullrich has. Ullrich won the Tour last year but more than nine
minutes.
	   ``Ullrich is very, very strong. He has a lot of experience and I
respect him a lot,'' said Julich. ``But I hope there will be a big
battle in the Alps.''
	   The three days in the Alps will have 12 climbs with two of the
climbs on Monday being rated ``out of category'' on a scale of
steepness, length and difficulty.
	   If there is a narrow gap between the riders coming out of the
mountains, it may come down to the 52-kilometer (32-mile) time
trial to Le Creusot on Saturday, Aug. 1, the day before the Tour
finishes in Paris.

<TEXT>
	   NEW PALTZ, New York (AP) _ Chin smashed, head spinning, the
battered champion slumped against the ropes and gazed into the
crowd _ directly into the eyes of John Wayne.
	   Thirty-nine years later, he still cringes at the memory.
	   ``This famous American hero had come to watch me fight, and I
was losing the title to another country,'' Floyd Patterson says.
``It was the most embarrassing moment of my life.''
	   KO'd in the third round by Ingemar Johansson of Sweden,
Patterson drove home in disgrace. For the next few months he
brooded in seclusion, avoiding friends, trainers, even members of
his family.
	   ``You have to understand what it is like to be champion of the
world and then not to be champion,'' he says.
	   But what hurt most of all was that nagging inner doubt that
always seems to strike when he is down, the feeling that somehow _
despite all the titles, the trophies, the money and the glory _ the
great Floyd Patterson hasn't quite measured up.
	   He felt it as a child when he scratched X's across a photograph
of himself, telling his mother, ``I don't like that boy.''
	   He felt it after he was bludgeoned senseless by Sonny Liston in
126 seconds on Sept. 25, 1962. Patterson slunk out of the stadium
in a false beard and mustache.
	   And he felt it again on April 1, when he was forced to resign as
chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, which regulates
boxing in the state. Grilled for hours by lawyers for ultimate
fighting _ the no-holds-barred sport that is banned in New York _
the ex-champ fumbled miserably. He couldn't remember beating Archie
Moore to become the youngest heavyweight champion of the world in
1956. He couldn't remember his aide's name.
	   Patterson protested that he hadn't slept much the night before
and that his memory is never good when he is tired. But the
headlines were unforgiving: On The Ropes, Dazed and Confused. Their
message was clear. The charismatic ``gentleman'' of boxing,
appointed by Gov. George Pataki in 1995 to put a fresh face on the
sport, to rebuild New York as boxing's Mecca, was too punch-drunk
to handle the dlrs 76,421 job.
	   Patterson refuses to discuss it, but his face crumples when the
subject is raised. Friends say what hurts the most is the feeling
that he let the governor down.
	   He hasn't appeared at a fight since.
	   But he cannot stay away from the sport that made him king, that
rescued him from the poorest streets of Brooklyn and offered him
the world.
	   ``If it wasn't for boxing,'' Patterson says, ``I would probably
be behind bars or dead.''
	   This is his argument to those who say boxing is for brutes and
gangsters. This is his argument to those who say the sport should
be banned. This is his argument as he gazes around his living room,
a virtual shrine to his past, the walls draped with pictures of
fighters and presidents and stars. Muhammad Ali. Joe Louis. Joe
Frazier. Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan. Frank Sinatra. John Wayne.
	   Patterson has punched or shaken hands with them all. He has
counted many as friends.
	   At 63, Patterson lives up to his reputation as a gentleman both
in and out of the ring. His polite friendliness and pompadour
hairstyle give him a slightly old-fashioned charm. He opens doors
for women with a stiff little bow _ and says they have no place in
the ring. The man who once wondered what he was doing in the Hall
of Fame (``Isn't that for guys like Joe Louis?'') still seems
genuinely touched when asked for an autograph.
	   In person, Patterson appears smaller than he did in the ring,
but he still has those massive forearms and his fighting weight of
185 pounds. He looks fit enough for a title fight.
	   ``When I get up in the morning and I run and I work out in the
gym it puts me on a physical high that is so good I don't need any
other drug,'' Patterson says. ``This is what boxing did for me, and
for hundreds of kids that I've trained. It steered them off alcohol
and drugs and put them on a path of physical fitness for the rest
of their lives.''
	   The speech is Patterson's mantra: He's been giving it for years.
In one afternoon, he repeats it four times.
	   The champion repeats himself a lot these days.
	   But boxing has given him far more than pride in his body. It
made him a rich man. Patterson won dlrs 13 million for 20 years of
professional fighting that included 64 fights, among them 40
knockout victories.
	   And boxing has given him this comfortable old farmhouse on 17
acres, about 75 miles north of New York City, where he lives with
his wife, Janet. The fighter raised his two youngest children here,
daughters from his second marriage.
	   It's a beautiful place, wooded and quiet, just outside the town
of New Paltz at the base of Mohonk Mountain. Patterson fell in love
with the area as a teenager when he was dumped into a reform school
a few miles away. It was the first time the young truant had seen
mountains and woods and deer. It was the first time he didn't steal
to eat.

NEW PALTZ, New York: to eat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Actually, his first big purse went to buy a house in Mount
Vernon, New York for his parents and most of his 10 siblings. He
was 21 at the time, a sensitive kid with furious fists, who relied
on his manager and mentor, Constantine ``Cus'' D'Amato, to do most
of his talking.
	   It was under D'Amato that Patterson perfected his unorthodox
``peekaboo'' style, blocking punches by holding both gloves tight
to his face, peeping at his opponent, bobbing and weaving all the
time.
	   Patterson throws combination punches at his imaginary opponent,
scampering across his living room floor with some of the speed _ if
not the stamina _ of the old days. Between grunts, he tells the
story of D'Amato's Gramercy Park gym, how he tagged along with his
older brothers when he was about 14, how he wanted to cry the first
time he was hit, how three years later the crybaby was a champion.
	   Golden Gloves in 1951. Olympic gold in 1952. First professional
fight the same year.
	   By the time he reached Chicago Stadium on Nov. 30, 1956,
Patterson was unstoppable. He sprang at Archie Moore with a
fifth-round left hook and became heavyweight champion of the world.
He was 21.
	   Patterson made dlrs 114,257 for the fight, more money than he
had ever dreamed. His first child was born the same day. There were
parties and parades and speeches. Congratulations poured in from
around the world.
	   All the new father could think about was how sorry he felt for
Moore.
	   The fighter's killer instinct. The victor's remorse. Patterson's
struggle to reconcile the two has led some critics to question if
``the gentle gladiator'' was too soft for blood sport. Too
vulnerable.
	   Patterson shrugs off compliments, much as he shrugged off the
critics all these years, those who wrote that he was just a
glorified middleweight, those who said he had a glass chin.
	   ``Floyd Patterson was unique in that he achieved something
Mother Nature never intended him to achieve,'' says boxing
historian Hank Kaplan. ``He didn't belong fighting those monsters,
and he wouldn't have lasted in today's fight. But he had an awful
lot of courage and an awful lot of determination.''
	   True, Patterson lacked the dazzle of Ali, the brute force of
Liston, the athletic beauty of middleweight Sugar Ray Robinson, his
personal favorite. But he had a heart that other boxers admired, a
doggedness and intensity that won over the critics.
	   ``They said I was the fighter who got knocked down the most,''
he says, ``but I also got up the most.''
	   Proud as he is of his record, Patterson says he is just as proud
of how far he has come outside the ring. Today, the fighter _ whose
1962 autobiography is titled ``Victory Over Myself'' _ can laugh
about the disguises he once hid in his locker room. Today he is
more curious than embarrassed by the emotions he felt winning and
losing.
	   ``The only thing I know is that victory means your opponent
lost, defeat means you lost,'' he says. ``Either way, someone has
got to leave the ring feeling bad. I always thought I would be
happy if it could just be a draw.''

Iraq fails to turn over document, weapons inspectors charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By telling the Security Council about an
incident in which Iraq failed to turn over a sensitive document to
U.N. weapons inspectors, the chief inspector was trying to ensure
that Iraq will fulfill a pledge to let him view it in person,
diplomats say.
	   Richard Butler said in a letter to the council that U.N.
inspectors were prevented from taking a document detailing bombs
and rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   The July 18 incident was the first serious instance of Iraqi
noncooperation since February, when Iraq agreed to allow inspectors
searching for evidence of banned weapons to visit eight
presidential palaces.
	   It could undermine Baghdad's bid to persuade the United Nations
to lift crippling economic sanctions imposed eight years ago after
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Persian
Gulf War.
	   The incident occurred when U.N. inspectors came upon the
document during a July 18 inspection of the operations command of
the Iraqi air force, the letter says.
	   The document contained a list munitions used by the Iraqi air
force, including types of munitions that Iraq has admitted were
used to deliver chemical and biological warfare agents, the letter
said.
	   Iraq is known to have used chemical agents against Iran during
their war in the 1980s.
	   The senior Iraqi official present during the inspection
initially agreed to make a copy of the document but then changed
his mind, saying inspectors could only take notes from it, the
letter said.
	   When an inspector protested, the official seized the document.
	   The sealed document is being held by Iraq pending Butler's visit
to Baghdad Aug. 2-5 when he and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
will review it, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Butler's letter was seen as a way of backing his trip and
pressuring the Iraqis to let him view the document.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any formal action on
Butler's letter until after his trip. The council discussed the
letter in informal consultations Thursday and council president
Sergey Lavrov of Russia took it up later in a private meeting with
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon.
	   Iraq downplayed the significance of the incident, citing the
agreement to let Butler review the document as proof that the
situation was resolved. Referring to the contents of the document,
Iraq's deputy ambassador, Saeed Hasan, noted that the Security
Council has affirmed Iraq's right to preserve its national
sovereignty.
	   Butler's letter was being reviewed in Baghdad, he said, adding
``there is no problem from our point of view.''
	   U.N. inspectors must verify that Baghdad has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift the sanctions.
	   Baghdad claims it has destroyed its banned weapons and has given
U.N. inspectors all the documents and evidence it has concerning
the programs.
	   But U.N. officials regard the discovery of the document as proof
that Iraq is withholding vital data, said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman
for the U.N. Special Commission, which carries out the inspections.
	   The letter came days before the Security Council was to begin
reviewing the latest report on Iraq's nuclear capabilities.

UN panel recommends new regulatory body to check financial markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A U.N. panel on Thursday recommended the
creation of a new regulatory body to check financial markets and
prevent another crisis such as the one that has wracked Asia for
the past year.
	   The World Financial Organization would be similar to the World
Trade Organization but would concern itself with financial flows
rather than trade, said Nurul Islam, chairman of the Committee for
Development Planning.
	   The panel is comprised of independent experts who advise the
Economic and Social Council, which coordinates the economic and
social work of the United Nations. Islam briefed reporters on the
panel's recommendation before bringing it before ECOSOC.
	   ``The creation of a global financial market has not seen a
parallel development in global regulatory practices or
international safety nets,'' the report said.
	   ``Specifically, an institution is needed to provide overall
guidance in the development and monitoring of international
standards and codes of conduct for financial management and capital
flows.''
	   The World Financial Organization could review, establish and
monitor international principals for accounting and payments, and
supervision over banking, securities, insurance and financial
conglomerates. Such oversight is currently handled by ad hoc public
and private groups with limited membership, the report said.
	   In addition to the new organization, existing financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank had to provide better warning mechanisms to prevent another
Asian disaster, the report said.
	   ``The east- and southeast-Asian financial crises have increased
awareness of the need to promote a more effective management of
international money and finance so as to prevent the recurrence of
similar crises,'' the report said.
	   During the ECOSOC meeting, representatives of Austria and the
United States questioned the need for a new organization, saying
the existing ones should be strengthened instead.

Glover sees liberation as a child and adult as goodwill ambassador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As a child of the American civil rights
movement, actor Danny Glover saw the struggle for liberation close
up.
	   Glover got another chance to see that struggle _ and its fruits
_ this month during visits to Namibia and South Africa as the U.N.
Development Program's first goodwill ambassador.
	   ``These are two countries that are dealing with inequities that
have accumulated over 300 years,'' Glover said in an interview
Thursday. ``When I see them now ... I feel it remarkable.''
	   As a goodwill ambassador, Glover, the star of the ``Lethal
Weapon'' movie franchise, is helping spread the message that people
can organize themselves to improve their lives. He visited UNDP
projects that extended loans for people to build kiosks, buy sewing
machines and materials to make baskets.
	   ``What I'm trying to do as goodwill ambassador, is not only have
people try to understand what these people are doing and telling
their stories ... but also have people have some sort of tolerance
and understanding and compassion for what has happened in the past,
and what the past is.''
	   Glover, who starred in the 1987 HBO movie ``Mandela,'' also got
a chance to visit with the South African president, who celebrated
80th birthday during Glover's visit.
	   Glover is no stranger to socially minded projects. He was
involved in raising money for Namibia's independence and helped
fight apartheid in South Africa. In the San Francisco of the 1960s,
he planned student strikes and set up housing programs. He was
arrested during a protest while a leader of the Black Student Union
in college.

	   CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Vice President Al
Gore, touring the the ruins of Chernobyl's nuclear reactor, said
the world's worst nuclear accident ``looms like a menacing monument
to mistakes of the century now slipping away from us,''
	   Gore first circled over the disaster site Thursday in a military
helicopter, then landed to inspect a hastily built
concrete-and-steel shelter covering the No. 4 reactor. Chernobyl
officials told Gore that the structure is deteriorating, and could
collapse and release radiation unless urgently repaired.
	   Gore also called Chernobyl ``a hulking symbol of human decisions
unworthy of our children.''
	   He is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Chernobyl,
which exploded in 1986 and spewed radiation over a large swath of
Europe. He spent two days in Ukraine before arriving in Moscow late
in the day. He was to meet Friday with Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and urge Russian lawmakers to ratify the START II
nuclear arms reduction treaty.
	   After visiting Chernobyl, Gore toured the nearby ghost town of
Pripyat, whose 55,000 people were evacuated after the accident.
	   He walked through a central square where weeds and moss grow
through the pavement, past abandoned buildings with gaping black
holes instead of windows. Rusting carousels and broken swings
greeted Gore at a former playground for Pripyat's children.
	   Ukrainian officials say they need more Western help to shore up
the weakening concrete seal over Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 and shut
down reactor No. 3, which is still operating.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has promised to close
Chernobyl by 2000, but says he needs about dlrs 1.2 billion to
compensate for lost energy capacity.
	   Kuchma said Thursday that he and Gore have decided to call a
conference of private donors to raise funds to strengthen the No. 4
reactor's sarcophagus. So far, Ukraine has secured only dlrs 390
million from foreign governments to pay for what is expected to be
a dlrs 750 million job.

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Bingo in Las Vegas?
	   Yes, players flock to the 32 licensed bingo parlors in Nevada _
just as they fill halls across the country _ wearing lucky hats,
carrying lucky charms, hoping to beat the odds.
	   ``It's like my second home down here,'' says Martha Cowley, 71,
who plays regularly at Binion's Horseshoe Hotel and Casino.
	   Binion's bingo parlor seats 500 and provides 10 one-hour
sessions a day with an hour's break after each. The casino averages
between 2,500 and 3,000 players a day.
	   ``If we can break even, we are happy,'' says Harvey Puller,
manager of the bingo parlor at Binion's. ``The reason that the
casinos have bingo is to bring people into the property so that
they can experience other things we have to offer.''
	   In fact, for the 12 months ending in February, Nevada's casino
bingo operations posted a loss of dlrs 466,000.
	   The minimum price per player at Binion's is dlrs 4 for the
session, which includes 12 games. Coffee, soda and cocktails are on
the house.
	   Bingo, as we know it today, is a form of lottery descended from
Lo Giuoco del Lotto d'Italia, the Italian National Lottery, which
was organized in 1530. The modern version of bingo was introduced
to America in 1930 by New York toy and game manufacturer Edwin S.
Lowe. Since then, the number of players has steadily increased.
	   In some families, three generations now play bingo, says Don
Carrier, editor of the Bingo Bugle Newspaper, which has a
circulation of more than 1.1 million.
	   Bingo parlors count about 1.7 billion visits per year in the
United States, according to the Bugle Newspaper Group. That
compares to 1.4 billion movie tickets sold, as reported by the
Motion Picture Association of America.
	   Bingo is played in every state except Hawaii, Tennessee and
Utah. Charity games in many states limit the amount of money that
can be won.
	   Why do so many people play?
	   Some say they want to support a good cause at charity bingo.
Others are looking for excitement and the challenge the games
provide. Some simply want to meet people.
	   Making money is, of course, another reason for playing.
	   Denise Souza, seated at a Binion's table with bingo cards spread
as wide as she could reach, says she plays almost every day, and in
the last few months she has had winning days of dlrs 500, dlrs
1,000 and, once, dlrs 4,000.
	   Thirty percent of the players are men, and that number is
growing, Carrier says, because there is more money available to be
won.
	   Ken Arnold, 51, who usually plays at an Indian reservation near
his Florida home, won a bingo game called ``The Letter X'' during a
visit to Las Vegas. The winner gets to climb into a glass box, the
``money machine,'' for 45 seconds, grab swirling cash and stuff as
much as possible through a slot. His take: dlrs 250.
	   But ask most bingo players why they play, and the reason is
same: ``To have a good time.''

Dream threesome the focus in first round of Giant Eagle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) _ There isn't much doubt where the biggest
crowds and biggest cheers will be during Friday's first round of
the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic.
	   The tour's dream threesome of Annika Sorenstam, Se Ri Pak and
Karrie Webb will be in the same group in what promises to be an
18-hole shootout at Avalon Lakes Golf Course.
	   ``Karrie is a long hitter and so is Se Ri,'' Sorenstam said
Thursday. ``I enjoy playing with good players. There will be some
good golf out there.''
	   Sorenstam is the tour's leading money-winner, having won three
times this season, including last week's runaway eight-shot victory
in the JAL Big Apple Classic. Pak, a 20-year-old Korean rookie, has
captured two major championships and has rewritten the LPGA record
book. Webb has taken a back seat to her playing partners, but has
won twice and stands fifth on the earnings list.
	   Sorenstam was asked if she considered the first-round grouping
with Pak to be a showdown.
	   ``I'm really happy for Se Ri for the things she has achieved,''
she said. ``To win two majors in your rookie year is amazing. But I
don't look at one player to challenge. It's a long season and it
takes me a couple months to see what other people are doing as
well.''
	   Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez said Thursday that fans and media
should give Pak room and not put too much pressure on her.
	   ``Se Ri is getting so much attention. I've tried to boost her a
little and tell her to take time for herself,'' Lopez said. ``She
has a lot of pressure to be the next superstar and she can be if
you let her.''
	   Lopez said several players went out for dinner recently and had
the evening ruined when Pak was besieged by photographers.
	   ``I didn't have the media stalking me,'' said Lopez, who set the
standard for rookie fireworks when she won nine tournaments in
1978. ``I know how she feels. I thought she would take a lot of
that attention away from me, but now that we've become friends,
people want to talk to me about her.''
	   Pak said she enjoys the attention.
	   ``Maybe if I didn't play well, they wouldn't need to interview
me,'' she said. ``Many people want my autograph, but it is fun.''
	   The soft-spoken Pak has finished in the top 10 in only three
events this year in the United States, but won all three, including
a 20-hole playoff victory over Jenny Chuasiriporn in the U.S.
Women's Open.
	   Two weeks ago in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic, Pak shot a
second-round 61 for the lowest score in LPGA history, then followed
with a 63 for the best back-to-back scores. Her 72-hole total of
261 was the lowest ever on the tour and gave her a nine-shot
victory.
	   Sorenstam is just as hot, having won three of the last seven
tour events. She has finished in the top 10 in 11 of the 13
official tournaments she has played.
	   ``I've got great momentum and when you've got a lot of
confidence, you want to ride the wave as long as you can,'' she
said. ``I know I can hit the shots and the last few weeks, I've
made a lot of putts.''
	   Tammie Green of Somerset, Ohio, beat Laura Davies with an eagle
on the fifth playoff hole in last year's Giant Eagle tournament.
	   ``I was able to defend my turf, so to speak,'' said Green, who
also won the tournament in 1994. ``I'm just really comfortable on
Ohio golf courses.''
	   Green said she has an added advantage this year. She's expecting
her first child in December.
	   ``Your center of gravity is lower and you don't move around as
much over putts,'' she said.
	   The field of 144 pros includes the top three and 33 of the top
50 on the money list. Besides Green and Lopez (1993), other past
champions in the field include Hall of Famer Betsy King (1992), Deb
Richard (1991) and Michelle McGann (1995 and 1996).

	   BELLEVUE, Washington (AP) _ Underwater massage. Mud masks.
Herbal steam baths.
	   In Russia, these are common treatments for a range of maladies.
In the United States, they're considered luxuries.
	   Alexander Ravikovich knows both sides.
	   The 40-year-old physician from the former Soviet Union operates
the European Health Center _ a Russian-style spa _ from a
strip-mall office in the affluent east Seattle suburb of Bellevue.
	   His clients include Russian emigres, wealthy, elderly
suburbanites and people recovering from injuries. Some just want to
relax. Others come with health problems.
	   ``He's a wonderful chap and he certainly knows his work,'' says
Audrey House, 92, of nearby Medina and a neighbor of Microsoft
billionaire Bill Gates. House, who uses a wheelchair, has been
going to Ravikovich for several months for massage and other
treatment.
	   ``My goal is to make people enjoy their life, to make them
healthy and live a quality life,'' says the bearded, wiry
Ravikovich, an engaging man who speaks fluent English.
	   In Russia, Ravikovich specialized in natural medicine. He
treated patients who couldn't tolerate conventional chemical-based
medication. He helped others, many of them elderly, with massage
therapy after surgery.
	   A native of the Ural mountain region, Ravikovich arrived in the
United States in 1988 _ three years before the collapse of the
Soviet Union. He had dlrs 140 and two suitcases filled with medical
books and underwear.
	   After a few months in a ``very, very low-quality hotel'' in New
York City, Ravikovich made his way to Seattle.
	   He spoke no English and his Russian training didn't qualify him
to practice medicine in this country. But he had worked several
years as a consultant to a hospital in Latvia, and he had used
massage therapy extensively with patients recovering from
accidents.
	   So he went to massage school and worked at several Seattle-area
beauty salons until he had saved enough to start his own business
in a Bellevue hotel. He later opened his European Health Center.
	   There's one room for massage and mud wraps, another with a
whirlpool tub for underwater massage and mineral baths, and a steam
room fitted with a tiny aromatic-oil injector and dispenser. The
small waiting room features a cardboard replica of St. Basil's
Cathedral, a Moscow landmark with vividly colored onion domes.
	   In Russia, Ravikovich says, people would go to sanitariums for
extended stays to relax, recuperate and rejuvenate. Russian coal
miners and factory workers would cleanse their lungs in herbal
steam rooms, inhaling a cocktail of therapeutic herbs tossed onto
fire-heated rocks, massaging each other with tree branches.
	   Here his steam bath is a private, sanitized shower stall,
without the hot rocks. A special dispenser injects the steam with
extracts of such bracing herbs as chamomile, eucalyptus and
Siberian fir.
	   Early on, most of Ravikovich's American patients were from high
society, seeking facials and other elective coddling.
	   But he felt he wasn't making use of his medical training.
	   ``You cannot fix a car which is running very well and tell
everyone you're a great mechanic,'' Ravikovich says. ``You can take
the bad car, a broken one, and fix it.
	   ``So that's why I moved to people who need some medical
attention. I started to work with them and got good results.''
	   From referrals, newspaper ads and word-of-mouth in the region's
burgeoning Russian emigre community, he slowly built his business.
	   He charges from dlrs 30 for a half-hour herbal bath to dlrs 95
for a two-hour ``deluxe mud therapy'' using mud from the Dead Sea.
	   In Russia, he saw about 30 patients weekly as a hospital
consultant. His government salary was about dlrs 70 a month, and he
often bartered his services for rare treats like cognac and
sausage.
	   Today, he sees about the same number of patients and grosses
dlrs 7,000 to dlrs 8,000 a month.
	   Svetlana Tuilina, a native of Siberia, heard about ``Alex'' from
her Russian friends. She came for treatment of chronic back pain
following an injury in a car accident last year.
	   Tuilina, 40, undergoes what Ravikovich calls ``wet traction''
therapy. Using a combination of straps, Velcro pads and weights,
Ravikovich stretches her lower back muscles under a stream of hot
water to ease pressure on the spinal cord.
	   ``I like it. It's very good. It's good for my health,'' Tuilina
says.
	   House has had difficulty walking since a fall about five years
ago and has used a wheelchair for two years. While she says medical
doctors have been little help, she has regained strength in her
legs since Ravilovich has begun wrapping and massaging them.
	   The ``wonderful man,'' as she calls him, massages her legs after
wrapping them in plastic wrap and cloth.
	   ``He says I'm going to walk. ... I feel he'll take the kinks out
of me,'' she says.
	   Her caretaker, Pat Carlson, says the swelling in House's legs
has subsided, she's more agile and her disposition has improved..
	   ``Whether it's her mind or half and half, I don't know,''
Carlson says. ``But it's definitely healing her. If he can please
her, he can please anyone.''

Nelson withdraws from U.S. Senior Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Larry Nelson, considered one of the favorites
in the U.S. Senior Open, withdrew midway through Thursday's opening
round due to soreness in his right arm and the right side of his
neck.
	   Nelson, who has won two senior tour tournaments this year and
finished second in four others, pulled out after his tee shot on
the ninth hole.
	   ``I won't play until I get the strength back in my right arm,''
said Nelson, 50, who was 6-over-par through eight holes. ``I
couldn't hit a 6-iron 140 yards (127 meters) on the sixth hole.
	   ``It's been bothering me on and off for the last couple of
years. I was fine yesterday, it felt perfectly fine. It started
this morning, I could hardly get out of the bathtub. I didn't have
any strength in my right arm.''
	   Nelson had three second-place finishes in his last five
tournaments including the Ameritech Senior Open last weekend. He
entered the Senior Open ranked third on the senior tour earnings
list with dlrs 1,087,753, behind only Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan.
	   ``It's disappointing,'' Nelson said. ``I've been looking forward
to this tournament for two years, ever since I learned it would be
here (at the Riviera Country Club) and knowing I'd be over 50.
	   ``Even if I had been 75 percent, I would have played.''
	   Nelson, who said he was about at 40 percent efficiency, added,
``You can't play this course with one arm. Heck, guys with two arms
aren't beating par. Maybe 10-over will win this tournament.''
	   Nelson, playing in his first Senior Open, predicted Wednesday
that nobody would shoot better than even-par 284 in the 72-hole
tournament over the 6,906-yard (6,284-meter), par-71 Riviera
course.
	   The Senior Open is the fourth and final major on the senior
tour. In the previous three, Nelson tied for 44th in The Tradition,
was second in the PGA Seniors' Championship and tied for 24th in
the Ford Senior Players Championship.

Infected leg forces late change to South African lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Flanker Johan Erasmus was forced
to withdraw Friday from the South African team for Saturday's Tri
Nations rugby union test against New Zealand at Athletic Park.
	   South African coach Nick Mallett said Erasmus suffered a slight
cut while training in Wellington on Wednesday and the wound became
infected.
	   Erasmus skipped Thursday's training session and was finding it
difficult to stretch his infected left leg Friday. Mallett decided
to slot 30-year-old loose forward Andrew Aitken into the team to
avoid a major disruption to the side.
	   Aitkin's place on the bench has been filled by newcomer
Selbourne Boome, a 23-year-old from Western Province.
	   England's Ed Morrison will referee the match.
	   The teams:
	   NEW ZEALAND: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Mark Mayerhofler,
Jonah Lomu, Walter Little, Carlos Spencer, Justin Marshall, Taine
Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Michael
Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd; Reserves: Joeli Vidiri,
Scott McLeod, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u, Isitolo Maka, Royce
Willis, Carl Hoeft, Mark Hammett (one to be omitted).
	   SOUTH AFRICA: Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre Snyman,
Pieter Rossouw, Pieter Muller, Henry Honiball, Joost van der
Westhuizen, Gary Teichmann (captain), Andre Venter, Mark Andrews,
Krynauw Otto, Andrew Aitken, Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie
Kempson; Reserves: Chester Williams, Franco Smith, Werner
Swanepoel, Selbourne Boome, Bobby Skinstad, Ollie le Roux, Naka
Drotske. (djp)

Tribesmen demanding fair share pose mounting threat to Yemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SAN101
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Across a lawless crescent that hugs the
capital, a desert expanse that has spurned authority for centuries,
Yemen's government faces a mounting insurgency by tribesmen upset
at their share of the oil that has made the Arabian Peninsula rich.
	   In the past month, tribes in northern Yemen have tried to
assassinate ministers, attacked soldiers, harassed fuel convoys and
blown up an oil pipeline in a traditional rivalry made more deadly
by their acquisition of grenades, rockets and even artillery.
	   For Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, the
violence poses the biggest threat since a civil war in 1994 almost
tore it apart. The conflict threatens to make more unstable a Red
Sea region already beset by strife in Eritrea and Sudan.
	   The government faces a difficult choice: A bigger crackdown
could unleash even more unrest among the historically unruly
tribes; Negotiations could reinforce the tribes' predilection for
violence to have their demands met.
	   The struggle may simmer as long as the tribes feel neglected in
a region home to much of Yemen's oil.
	   ``If the government had the will, it could settle the problems
in an hour,'' said Sheik Jabr al-Toaiman, a tribal leader and
member of parliament. ``The tribes receive promises and the
government doesn't keep them. The frustration makes the problems
worse.''
	   Powerful and fiercely independent tribes have long been the bane
of Yemen's rulers. For centuries, they were a law unto themselves,
controlling territory that could stretch hundreds of square
kilometers (miles).
	   As late as 1948, sheiks from the north sacked the capital,
San`a. Some of the same tribes lined up against the government now
used money from Saudi Arabia to fight a civil war in the 1960s.
Their forces remain formidable. One northern sheik, Nasr Bin Ali
al-Hiyal, said he had 15,000 fighters that answer to him.
	   Almost without exception, the tribes have maintained that the
government deprived them of money it invested in cities, like the
capital. With the discovery of oil in their territory in the 1980s,
those complaints became more vociferous.
	   Some felt they had the right to the oil. Others demanded money
for the use of their lands: to build pipelines and roads to carry
the fuel and for permission to dig wells on their territory.
	   The government has insisted that it is sharing the oil money
equitably and complains that the region's rampant lawlessness
hampers its development efforts. Officials acknowledge some
corruption, but say the tribes simply want too much too fast.
	   But in Yemen, where weapons outnumber people three to one,
grievances and guns make for a combustible mix.
	   ``The problem is not going to go away,'' said Abdulaziz
al-Saqqaf, publisher of the Yemen Times. ``The tribesmen want a
piece of the national pie and they feel they are entitled to it.''
	   The crisis erupted June 19 when the government removed subsidies
from wheat and flour and hiked fuel prices by about 40 percent in
line with demands by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Hundreds protested in Yemen's main cities, and the unrest soon
spread into the mountains and deserts of northern Yemen, in
particular Ma'rib and Jawf provinces, where the tribes possess
everything from rifles to artillery. In much of that region, only
the government's tanks and aircraft give it an edge.
	   Since June, more than 100 soldiers and tribesmen have reportedly
died and hundreds more were wounded in clashes. In a two-day battle
that ended Wednesday in Jawf, more than 10 soldiers and tribesmen
were killed and 25 were wounded, al-Thawri newspaper said.
	   Tribesmen have attacked the pipeline carrying oil from Ma'rib to
the Red Sea port of Hodeida nine times, most recently on Tuesday,
blowing holes in it and then lighting the fuel on fire with a
tracer round or a blow torch. Fuel convoys were targeted, too.
	   In the boldest attack, tribesmen ambushed an eight-car convoy
Tuesday carrying the interior minister. The governor of Jawf was
wounded in the shoulder and six guards were injured.
	   The government insists the trouble is orchestrated by Saudi
Arabia _ a charge made Monday by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who
called the insurgent tribesmen ``cancerous tumors.''
	   Three leaders of the Jahm tribe, which was blamed for several of
the pipeline explosions, were detained in San`a Tuesday in an
attempt to force an end to the attacks, Yemeni officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   More bargaining, many say, may be the only way for a cease-fire.
	   ``By contacts and by dialogue, everything can be taken care
of,'' said Sheik Jabr, the parliament member. ``Force won't end the
problems, and violence will only give birth to more violence.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS (AP) _ President Ernesto Zedillo
toured the southern state of Chiapas Thursday in a bid to convince
impoverished Indians there that his administration is sensitive to
their demands.
	   In his tour _ Zedillo's sixth visit to Chiapas since the Dec. 22
massacre of 45 Indian villagers by a pro-government paramilitary
group _ he eased off his earlier attacks against leftist rebels.
	   Instead, Zedillo linked arms with women artisans and was
inundated by requests for government help for crafts projects that
provide much of the Indian's cash income.
	   ``We will continue to work with the projects that you all head
up,'' Zedillo told a group of about 300 weavers, embroiderers and
jewelry makers, some of the state's estimated 350,000 artisans.
	   Zedillo handed out checks for development money to 15 artisan
groups at the meeting here, the last of three stops on his tour of
the state.
	   Zedillo, accompanied by Social Development Secretary Esteban
Moctezuma _ considered a prime candidate for the ruling party's
2000 presidential nomination _ repeated earlier calls for the
Zapatista rebels to resume peace talks with the government.
	   ``The government ... wants and proposes dialogue now ... a
direct dialogue without conditions, without evasions, and without
pretexts,'' he said during an earlier stop at a remote town near
the Guatemalan border.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994,
demanding greater Indian rights and democracy. Peace talks in the
conflict have been stalled for the last two years.
	   Last week, rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos said the guerrillas
have lost faith in the government's goodwill and see no reason to
resume the negotiations.

Chang continues Washington success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Not even a rainstorm could cool Michael Chang
on Thursday in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   The top-seeded Chang cruised to his 14th straight victory at the
FitzGerald Tennis Center with a 6-4, 6-1 third-round victory over
Martin Damm of the Czech Republic.
	   A two-time defending champion at Legg Mason, Chang also won two
singles matches here last September in a Davis Cup semifinal
against Australia.
	   Chang led Damm 5-4 in the first set when their match was delayed
for more than an hour by rain. Chang broke Damm's service after the
delay to win the first set and then cruised to victory in the
second set.
	   Also advancing to Friday's quarterfinals were third-seed Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa, fifth-seed Filip DeWulf of Belgium and
14th-seed Scott Draper of Australia.
	   Draper beat fourth-seed Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-4. The
left-hander from Brisbane had bounced Byron's brother, Wayne, out
of the tournament in the second round.
	   Ferreira took care of his second straight crowd-pleaser. On
Tuesday Ferreira stopped the comeback of Jimmy Arias and on
Wednesday he ended the run of qualifier David Caldwell, who grew up
in Richmond, Va.
	   Caldwell couldn't handle Ferreira's serve, which clocked 123 mph
(197 kmph). Caldwell, 0-5 on the tour before his two victories this
week, fell 7-5, 6-3.
	   ``Mentally I was tired on important points. I wasn't thinking
clearly,'' said Caldwell who was 2-for-9 on break-point
opportunities.
	   Andre Agassi and Jim Courier were scheduled to play third-round
matches later Thursday night.

Dollar weakens, Tokyo stocks lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Friday ahead of an afternoon election to choose a new leader for
Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. Tokyo stock prices
edged lower.
	   The dollar bought 140.86 yen in early trading, down 0.82 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   Japanese news media said Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was
widely tipped to be the successful candidate in the party vote, in
which three candidates are vying. The LDP leader is virtually
assured of becoming prime minister as the party controls
Parliament's powerful lower house.
	   Traders said the currency market had already factored in a
victory by Obuchi, adding that a win by the veteran politician
would be a positive factor for the yen as he is believed to have
the most support among key LDP leaders.
	   All three candidates, including Obuchi, have said they will
carry out reforms necessary to jump start the country's sagging
economy.
	   Besides Obuchi, Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are running for the post
being vacated by Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned after the party
suffered a stunning setback in upper house parliamentary elections
June 12.
	   The yen recovered much of the ground it lost Thursday, when
Moody's Investors Service placed Japan's sovereign debt rating on
review for possible downgrade.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened lower following a sharp
overnight drop on Wall Street, in which the Dow Jones industrial
average shed 195.93 points, or 2.15 percent, closing at 8,932.98 on
Thursday.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 23.67 points, or 0.15
percent, to 16,164.34 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.01 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,247.86.
The TOPIX had closed down 7.98 points, or 0.63 percent, the day
before.
	   Blue chips such as electronics giants Sony and NEC, banking
issues and major real estate stocks were among early losers. But
trading remained light ahead of the LDP presidential election.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.335 percent, unchanged from Thursday's
finish. Its price also remained unchanged at 110.86 yen.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Rasul Khadem, here to wrestle in the Goodwill
Games, studied the front page of the newspaper, particularly the
lead story about Iran testing a medium-range missile.
	   Khadem, a political-science student at Tehran University, was
asked what he thought about that matter.
	   ``What you see in the news is not always fact,'' he said through
interpreter Hamid Kermanshah. ``After a while, you will find out
the facts.''
	   For now, the facts are these: Iran's wrestlers are ready for
their Goodwill Games competition, which begins Saturday with
matches against Russia and the United States. The political
implications are obvious.
	   Khadem, however, said his country's image was all wrong.
	   ``If you study Iran the last 20 years, we have shown no
animosity,'' he said. ``We have never invaded other countries. We
were invaded. If you treat and accept us as independents, we never
have animosity for other countries.
	   ``I am here to do the best for my country and create new
friendship.''
	   This is the latest in a recent string of sports meetings between
Iran and the United States, which have not had diplomatic relations
for 20 years and still deal through the political, cultural and
religious fallout of the Islamic revolution.
	   Last month, Iran's soccer team defeated the United States 2-1 in
the World Cup, a victory that filled Tehran's streets with joyful
demonstrations and brought the team a hero's welcome when it
returned.
	   Khadem, a gold medalist in the 198-pound class at the 1996
Olympics, and other members of the Iranian delegation visited
Kermanshah's oriental rug gallery for a reception Thursday before
beginning their competition.
	   They traveled by bus from their midtown hotel, looking out the
windows at the sights of Manhattan, which can be daunting for any
first-time visitor. American wrestler John Giura, a New Yorker who
went along for the ride, said he spoke to one of the Iranians.
	   ``I asked him how he liked New York,'' Giura said. ``He said
it's like Tehran but more dangerous. I told him it's not as
dangerous as it used to be.''
	   Giura was a member of the U.S. team that visited Iran in
February for Takhti Cup competition. It was the first visit by an
American team to the country in 20 years and officials said they
were greeted warmly by the people. He said he did not think about
the issues that have separated the two governements.
	   ``When you are on a trip to compete, you focus on that,'' he
said. ``You're there to wrestle. I was not really concerned about
the other stuff.''
	   Giura said he took advantage of the trip to visit the bazaar in
Tehran.
	   ``I bought some pistachios but I ate them before I left the
country,'' he said. ``The only thing I brought back were a few
craft boxes and myself.''
	   He recalled being briefed by American officials, told not to
shake hands with women, advised to be polite and abide by local
customs.
	   There was one disquieting note, though.
	   ``There was a billboard on a building across from our hotel,''
he said. ``It had the American flag with bombs falling inside the
stripes.''
	   Khadem was asked about that.
	   ``That flag was not hostility,'' he said. ``That flag was left
over from Vietnam. The United States never bombed Iran.''
	   This is a return visit for the Iranian wrestlers, but one that
almost did not happen. When they traveled to America in April for
the World Cup competition in Stillwater, Oklahoma, the wrestlers
were detained in Chicago for fingerprinting and photos, routine for
non-diplomatic visitors from their country.
	   They were angered by the procedure and did not want it repeated
here. Officials of the Goodwill Games and the two governments
worked out the details and the trip went on.
	   ``This is important because it means opening good relations with
the people of the United States,'' said Kermanshah, an Iranian who
has lived in America since 1976. ``Maybe it will open a dialogue
between the governments.''

	   BELLEVUE, Washington (AP) _ Underwater massage. Mud masks.
Herbal steam baths.
	   In Russia, these are common treatments for a range of maladies.
In the United States, they're considered luxuries.
	   Alexander Ravikovich knows both sides.
	   The 40-year-old physician from the former Soviet Union operates
the European Health Center _ a Russian-style spa _ from a
strip-mall office in the affluent east Seattle suburb of Bellevue.
	   His clients include Russian emigres, wealthy, elderly
suburbanites and people recovering from injuries. Some just want to
relax. Others come with health problems.
	   ``He's a wonderful chap and he certainly knows his work,'' says
Audrey House, 92, of nearby Medina and a neighbor of Microsoft
billionaire Bill Gates. House, who uses a wheelchair, has been
going to Ravikovich for several months for massage and other
treatment.
	   ``My goal is to make people enjoy their life, to make them
healthy and live a quality life,'' says the bearded, wiry
Ravikovich, an engaging man who speaks fluent English.
	   In Russia, Ravikovich specialized in natural medicine. He
treated patients who couldn't tolerate conventional chemical-based
medication. He helped others, many of them elderly, with massage
therapy after surgery.
	   A native of the Ural mountain region, Ravikovich arrived in the
United States in 1988 _ three years before the collapse of the
Soviet Union. He had dlrs 140 and two suitcases filled with medical
books and underwear.
	   After a few months in a ``very, very low-quality hotel'' in New
York City, Ravikovich made his way to Seattle.
	   He spoke no English and his Russian training didn't qualify him
to practice medicine in this country. But he had worked several
years as a consultant to a hospital in Latvia, and he had used
massage therapy extensively with patients recovering from
accidents.
	   So he went to massage school and worked at several Seattle-area
beauty salons until he had saved enough to start his own business
in a Bellevue hotel. He later opened his European Health Center.
	   There's one room for massage and mud wraps, another with a
whirlpool tub for underwater massage and mineral baths, and a steam
room fitted with a tiny aromatic-oil injector and dispenser. The
small waiting room features a cardboard replica of St. Basil's
Cathedral, a Moscow landmark with vividly colored onion domes.
	   In Russia, Ravikovich says, people would go to sanitariums for
extended stays to relax, recuperate and rejuvenate. Russian coal
miners and factory workers would cleanse their lungs in herbal
steam rooms, inhaling a cocktail of therapeutic herbs tossed onto
fire-heated rocks, massaging each other with tree branches.
	   Here his steam bath is a private, sanitized shower stall,
without the hot rocks. A special dispenser injects the steam with
extracts of such bracing herbs as chamomile, eucalyptus and
Siberian fir.
	   Early on, most of Ravikovich's American patients were from high
society, seeking facials and other elective coddling.
	   But he felt he wasn't making use of his medical training.
	   ``You cannot fix a car which is running very well and tell
everyone you're a great mechanic,'' Ravikovich says. ``You can take
the bad car, a broken one, and fix it.
	   ``So that's why I moved to people who need some medical
attention. I started to work with them and got good results.''
	   From referrals, newspaper ads and word-of-mouth in the region's
burgeoning Russian emigre community, he slowly built his business.
	   He charges from dlrs 30 for a half-hour herbal bath to dlrs 95
for a two-hour ``deluxe mud therapy'' using mud from the Dead Sea.
	   In Russia, he saw about 30 patients weekly as a hospital
consultant. His government salary was about dlrs 70 a month, and he
often bartered his services for rare treats like cognac and
sausage.
	   Today, he sees about the same number of patients and grosses
dlrs 7,000 to dlrs 8,000 a month.
	   Svetlana Tuilina, a native of Siberia, heard about ``Alex'' from
her Russian friends. She came for treatment of chronic back pain
following an injury in a car accident last year.
	   Tuilina, 40, undergoes what Ravikovich calls ``wet traction''
therapy. Using a combination of straps, Velcro pads and weights,
Ravikovich stretches her lower back muscles under a stream of hot
water to ease pressure on the spinal cord.
	   ``I like it. It's very good. It's good for my health,'' Tuilina
says.
	   House has had difficulty walking since a fall about five years
ago and has used a wheelchair for two years. While she says medical
doctors have been little help, she has regained strength in her
legs since Ravilovich has begun wrapping and massaging them.
	   The ``wonderful man,'' as she calls him, massages her legs after
wrapping them in plastic wrap and cloth.
	   ``He says I'm going to walk. ... I feel he'll take the kinks out
of me,'' she says.
	   Her caretaker, Pat Carlson, says the swelling in House's legs
has subsided, she's more agile and her disposition has improved..
	   ``Whether it's her mind or half and half, I don't know,''
Carlson says. ``But it's definitely healing her. If he can please
her, he can please anyone.''

Accurate death count may never be known in tsunami disaster

	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Relief workers sealed off the
most devastated areas of Papua New Guinea on Friday, allowing
hundreds and perhaps thousands of unrecovered bodies _ victims of a
series of tidal waves a week ago _ to decompose.
	   The official death count stands at more than 1,300, but 6,000
people are missing and feared dead, while 2,500 to 3,500 survivors
have been accounted for.
	   But thwarted by impenetrable mangrove swamps, authorities
decided to abandon the attempt to retrieve bodies and will seal off
the area around Sissano lagoon. The decision means the true death
toll from the July 17 tsunami disaster may never be known.
	   Lt.-Col. Rod West, commander of the Australian army relief
efforts, said the worst-affected areas would be turned into
permanent graveyards.
	   ``Some of these bodies are very much deteriorated,'' he said.
``The plan is to seal the areas and let nature takes its course _
the natural flushing of the lagoon and the crocodiles and sharks.''
	   New aftershocks from the undersea quake that set off the three
tidal waves Friday further added to the worries of residents of the
northwest coast. Seismologists warned Friday that there is a 50
percent chance of more tremor activity.
	   The seas off Papua New Guinea's north coast are usually calm,
but boats Friday reported swells of up to 4 meters (14 feet).
	   Small tremors _ called ``guria'' in the local Pidgin language _
are common on the island and authorities said the latest ones posed
no danger of tidal surges like those that hit last week.
	   Andrew Kumbakor, a Papua New Guinean legislator, said the area
around the Sissano lagoon would be declared a ``contaminated,
restricted area'' because of the threat of disease from decomposing
bodies.
	   ``The government will have to go with that decision and just
abandon the area completely and allow the bodies to decay, allow
the bodies to just rot off,'' said Kumbakor.
	   ``I would think that the government should never allow the
people to ever come back. Only for special occasions like
fishing.''
	   Surgical teams in a tent hospital continued the task Friday of
trying to save the battered survivors, many of them affected by
gangrene. Nearly 200 operations had been performed since Monday.
	   Most injuries happened when the tsunami flung people against
trees or debris, fracturing bones and tearing open skin. Many
people died instantly; others died in the jungle before medical
help could reach them.
	   Doctors say the biggest danger to the injured now is infection.
Coral sand ground into open wounds contains bacteria that thrive in
the tropical climate.
	   Lt. Brad Slater, an Australian army officer at the emergency
field hospital in Vanimo, said the facility had also treated many
pneumonia cases brought on by breathing seawater.
	   At least 30 bodies were found Thursday washed up on a beach in
the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, about 25 miles (40
kilometers) west of the disaster zone, local police said, on
condition of anonymity.
	   Those victims were believed to have been sucked out to sea by
the back surge from the waves and dragged along the coast.
	   West said one of the top priorities in the next several days
would be to reunite families separated in the confusion following
the disaster.
	   ``At the moment we have families spread between Aitape, Vanimo
and Wewak,'' said West. ``We're going to try to get those people
back together again.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Backed by Japan's ruling party powerbrokers,
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi held a commanding lead ahead of
Friday's vote for party president in the race to succeed the
resigning prime minister and take the helm of the country's
troubled economy.
	   A survey of Liberal Democratic Party members released by the
Yomiuri newspaper Friday showed Obuchi, 61, with about 200 of the
208 votes needed to win a majority on a first ballot, well ahead of
rivals former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, and
Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, 56.
	   Analysts, however, said the race _ to be determined in a secret
ballot _ was still up for grabs. If no candidate wins a majority of
the 414 voting LDP members in the first ballot, the two top
vote-getters will hold an immediate run-off.
	   The winner of Friday's vote is virtually certain to win the
election for prime minister in Parliament, expected sometime next
week, because the LDP has a comfortable majority in the powerful
lower house. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced last week
he would resign.
	   A win for Obuchi _ seen as an LDP stalwart but not a brilliant
innovator _ would mark a triumph of the party's long-time
leadership over younger rebels who have called for more dynamic
leadership and discontented voters looking for a zealous reformer.
	   The three candidates fleshed out their ideas for restoring
Japan's recession-bound economy to health Thursday in nationally
televised speeches. Obuchi protrayed himself as the only choice
with the know-how and political backing to get the job done.
	   Obuchi reiterated pledges for an income tax cut worth 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 42.6 billion) and 10 trillion yen (dlrs 70.9 billion) in
new spending to kickstart economic growth and spur lagging
consumption.
	   Kajiyama, the favorite of the markets for his backing of
extensive economic reform, said his administration would aim for 3
percent annual growth _ a turnaround for an economy that shrank for
the first time in two decades in the fiscal year that ended in
March.
	   The outspoken Koizumi _ a maverick backed by younger dissident
lawmakers _ vowed to implement drastic reforms of the political
system, including cutting by almost half the number of Parliament
members and government bureaucrats.
	   The three are battling to take over from Hashimoto, who
announced last week he was quitting after the LDP was trounced in
July 12 elections for the upper house of Parliament. His successor
will finish out his term as party president, which ends September
1999.
	   The winner will also take over a nation in turmoil _ both
financial and political.
	   Japan's most glaring problems are economic. Unemployment is at a
record high of 4.1 percent. Bankruptcies are mounting at their
fastest rate since the end of World War II. Japanese banks' are
saddled with 84 trillion yen (dlrs 604 billion) in bad loans. U.S.
credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service announced Thursday
it will review its rating for Japan's government debt.
	   The sour economy and general fatigue with the way the LDP is
running the country were widely seen as the major factors in the
party's disastrous showing in the upper house elections.
	   The campaign has been dominated by the economy _ and fear among
ruling party lawmakers that they had better change their image in a
hurry. Younger lawmakers forced the party to hold a more open race
for president instead of choosing a successor behind closed doors.
	   The candidates fell over each other to take the banner of reform
and openly appealed to voters in a string of news conferences,
speeches and a TV debate last weekend. Still, a poll by a major
newspaper Thursday showed public support for the party at an
all-time low.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Anthony Ronaldson hit two 3-pointers during a
14-0 run at the start of the second half, lifting Australia to an
86-74 victory over Puerto Rico in the Goodwill Games basketball
semifinals Thursday night.
	   The Australians advanced to the gold-medal game against either a
team of U.S. college stars or Lithuania. Puerto Rico will play for
the bronze medal.
	   Shane Heal, who played one season for the Minnesota
Timberwolves, led Australia with 21 points, and Ronaldson had 20.
Andrew Gaze, who led Seton Hall to the NCAA championship game in
1989, scored 15 points and Chris Antsey of the Dallas Mavericks had
14.
	   Australia led 44-41 at halftime before starting the second half
with its 14-0 burst that gave it a 58-41 advantage. Puerto Rico,
which trailed the United States by 19 in a preliminary game before
rallying to win by eight, closed within seven with 10 minutes left,
but got no closer.
	   Australia shot just 41.5 percent from the field, but outscored
Puerto Rico 22-4 at the free-throw line.
	   Jose Ortiz, formerly of the Utah Stars, led Puerto Rico with 23
points.
	   Diving began, with world champion Irina Lashko of Russia winning
the 1-meter springboard over China's Guo Jingjing. The Chinese pair
of Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei won the men's synchronized platform
gold, posting the day's only perfect scores.
	   Beach volleyball's grand old man, 41-year-old Sinjin Smith,
injured his left calf as he and U.S. teammate Ricci Luyties lost
15-5 to Canada's John Child and Mark Heese. Smith returned to the
match after a 5-minute timeout and said he would play Friday
against the top U.S. team, Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson, which
lost to Brazil's Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira 15-3. Brazil
scored the first three points and then ran off seven in a row for a
10-1 lead.
	   In other matches on the Central Park sand, Martin Conde and
Esteban Martinez of Argentina took 1 hour, 19 minutes and 135
serves to defeat defending champions Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn
Maaseide of Norway 16-14, and Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of
Australia beat Martin and Paul Laciga of Switzerland 15-13.

American F-16 fighter overshoots runway in northern Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. F-16 jet fighter overshot the runway at an
airport in northwestern Japan Friday morning and caught fire,
Japanese officials said. The American pilot was ejected from the
plane, and it was not immediately known if he was injured.
	   Koji Mori, spokesman of the local Japanese Air Self-Defense
Force base, said airport fire fighters quickly extinguished the
flames. He said it was not immediately certain whether the accident
happened during landing or take-off.
	   The accident occurred around 9:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) at the Misawa
airport, which is jointly used by the U.S. Air Force, the Air
Self-Defense Force and Japan Air Sytstems, a Japanese commercial
airline.
	   The airport is located 560 kilometers (350 miles) northeast of
Tokyo.

Japan's trade surplus soars in first 10 days of July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Accelerating a trend of rising exports and
declining imports, Japan's trade surplus with the world soared 274
percent in the first 10 days of July, the government said Friday.
	   The nation's merchandise trade surplus _ a tally of goods
exported minus goods imported _ rose to 420.38 billion yen (dlrs
2.98 billion) from July 1 to July 10 compared with the same period
last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Exports during the period increased 15.7 percent, while imports
fell 7.7 percent, the ministry said. The surplus is measured as
goods pass customs but before adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   In the latest full month for which figures are available, the
trade surplus jumped 27 percent in June for the 15th straight month
of increase, rising to to 1.22 trillion yen (dlrs 8.68 billion)
from last year.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.

IBM shelves dlrs 1 billion Philippine wafer plant project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - American computer giant IBM Corp.
has temporarily dropped plans to build a joint-venture, dlrs
1-billion wafer fabrication plant in the Philippines, its local
partner has announced.
	   Lawrence Qua, president of Philippine electronics concern
Ionics Circuits Inc., said Thursday a glut of computer wafers
worldwide has forced the project to be put on hold.
	   A wafer fabrication plan is considered the backbone of the
semiconductor industry because it produces the basic material for
the production of microchips. 
	   Qua said the oversupply was the result of a slowdown in sales
of computers, especially in Asia which has been hit by a currency
crisis, he said.
	   ``We'll have to wait until the market is right for us to build
a wafer plant here and (see) if government is ready to live up to
its commitment on the project,'' he added.
	   Ionics and IBM were expecting to get Philippine government
incentives to make the project viable. But the government, running
a budget deficit, isn't keen on giving tax incentives at the
moment.

Wood and Horgan take early lead in rain-delayed Charity Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIMMY GOLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUTTON, Massachusetts (AP) _ Willie Wood and P.H. Horgan III
were each 7-under-par when darkness suspended play of Thursday's
rain-delayed first round of the final CVS Charity Classic.
	   Mike Springer was the leader in the clubhouse after one round,
shooting a 6-under 65 on the par-71 Pleasant Valley Country Club
course. Steve Flesch was minus-5, and eight golfers were at
minus-4.
	   Sixty players in the field of 158 did not finish because of a
3-hour, 42-minute delay for rain, wind and lightning. But those who
started late had the advantage of playing most of their round with
soft greens and light wind.
	   Horgan played just one hole before the break, then came out and
birdied his first three holes after that to reach 3-under after
four. He also birdied Nos. 10, 11 and 13 before dropping a 15-foot
putt at the horn to tie Wood at minus-7.
	   Wood had played just two holes, parring both, before the severe
weather came. He finished his first 10 holes at 2-under, then
birdied four consecutive holes, adding a birdie at No. 7 to drop to
minus-7. He has one hole to play.
	   Dave Stockton Jr., Guy Boros, D.A. Weibring, Mike Donald, and
brothers Lee and Larry Rinker were 4-under.
	   The 1998 tournament is the final edition of the event that
started in '65 but has struggled to find a spot on the PGA schedule
that would attract the tour's top names. This year, for example,
the tournament follows the British Open, and most top players are
staying away.
	   Next year, the LPGA will hold a tournament at Pleasant Valley,
resuming a tradition that began in 1962 but was interrupted in
'74.

U.N. promises more development aid for Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The United Nations promised an
additional dlrs 6 million in aid to Southeast Asia on Friday to
help alleviate poverty, create jobs and fight environmental
pollution during the next three years.
	   A letter of intent was signed between the U.N. Development
Program and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations just before
the opening of the annual ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting.
	   The U.N. Development Program has been giving aid to ASEAN since
the group's formation in 1967.
	   The latest assistance is to be used ``for promoting the ASEAN
countries' economic recovery and tackling the social problems
arising from the economic situation in the region,'' said the
letter of intent signed by Rodolfo C. Severino Jr., the ASEAN
secretary-general.
	   The group _ which consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam _ also
committed itself to using the money to combat pollution, especially
cross-border haze caused by forest fires in the region.

Chinese teen fights on, awaits parents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with treatment under way &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY McSHANE &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was a simple vault she had done dozens of
times before, but one she likely will never do again.
	   On Thursday, 17-year-old Chinese gymnast Sang Lan remained in a
Long Island hospital bed, unable to move her legs, learning about
the severity of her condition from doctors who required
interpreters to deliver their somber news.
	   ``She has begun to realize the seriousness of her injuries,''
the chief doctor in the case said.
	   Sang's parents remained half a world away, trying to get the
appropriate visas to see their injured child _ a trip that was
likely their first outside China, officials said. And an
experimental treatment of Sang, the 1997 Chinese national vault
champion, could begin Thursday night only after a frustrating
language barrier was cleared.
	   ``We showed Sang Lan her X-rays and explained in more detail the
extent of what has happened to her,'' said Dr. Brock Schnebel, the
Goodwill Games' chief medical officer.
	   Sang, injured in a botched landing during a Tuesday warm-up for
the games, was still in critical but stable condition at the Nassau
County Medical Center. She began receiving treatment with a new
synthetic protein designed to combat nerve damage Thursday night.
	   The experimental nerve re-generating drug GM-1, also known as
Sygen, is administered through an intravenous drip and will
continue daily for 57 days, Nassau County Executive Thomas S.
Gulotta said in a statement.
	   But before that could start, hospital officials needed consent
forms signed by a representative of China's delegation. The
complicated forms were painstakingly read by interpreters to
members of the Chinese delegation during the course of the day.
	   ``Because of liability concerns, everything must be explained,
and nobody speaks English,'' hospital spokeswoman Shelley Lotenberg
said. ``We want to make sure they understand everything.''
	   Sang's parents were due in Saturday night, hours after planned
fusion surgery to stabilize their daughter's spine. The family
lives in the fairly remote town of Ningbo, in Shanghai.
	   Sang's father, a government housing worker, and her mother, a
leather-factory employee, speak a different Chinese dialect and
will need different translators to communicate with doctors,
Lotenberg said. Hospital officials were already arranging that.
	   The hospital staff, moved by the gymnast's courage, signed an
enormous get-well card and put a stuffed white teddy bear in her
room. China's ambassador to the United Nations, Qin Huasun, was
among those who had sent flowers to the injured teen.
	   The hospital's phones and fax machine were flooded with messages
from people around the United States offering their prayers and
encouragement for the gymnast, Lotenberg said.
	   Sang was injured during a routine practice vault when she missed
her landing and struck the mat with her head. The resulting
fracture and dislocation of two neck vertebrae left her with no
movement in her legs.
	   Her prognosis hadn't changed from Wednesday, when doctors said
it was unlikely that she would ever walk again.
	   ``Clinically, she is not any different,'' Schnebel said. ``Her
condition remains the same, with no movement in her lower
extremities. She has begun to realize the seriousness of her
injuries, but is still demonstrating the same courage as she did
when she first arrived (at the hospital) on Monday.''
	   Once the gymnast's neck is stabilized, she would be able to
return home in about a week, officials said.

Dollar retreats, Tokyo stocks fall in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei's morning close, midday dollar and bond
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar retreated against the yen Friday
morning ahead of an afternoon election to choose a new leader for
Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. Tokyo stock prices fell
in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 141.03 yen in late morning trading, down 0.65
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 141.38 yen overnight.
	   Japanese news media said Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was
widely tipped to be the successful candidate in the party vote, in
which three candidates are vying. The LDP leader is virtually
assured of becoming prime minister as the party controls
Parliament's powerful lower house.
	   Traders said the currency market had already factored in a
victory by Obuchi, adding that a win by the veteran politician
would be a positive factor for the yen as he is believed to have
the most support among key LDP leaders.
	   All three candidates, including Obuchi, have said they will
carry out reforms necessary to jump start the country's sagging
economy.
	   Besides Obuchi, Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama are running for the post
being vacated by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned
after his party suffered a stunning setback in upper house
parliamentary elections June 12.
	   The yen recovered much of the ground it lost Thursday, when
Moody's Investors Service placed Japan's sovereign debt rating on
review for possible downgrade.
	   Meanwhile, stocks moved lower following an overnight sharp drop
on Wall Street and continued worries about the move by Moody's.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 81.32 points, or 0.50
percent, to 16,106.69 points at the end of the morning session. On
Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 105.05 points, or 0.64 percent.
	   Traders said, however, that buying from domestic pension funds
minimized the losses.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.26 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,246.61.
The TOPIX had closed down 7.98 points, or 0.63 percent, the day
before.
	   Traders said many investors retreated to the sidelines to await
the outcome of the LDP's presidential election.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.355 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.335 percent,
driving its price down to 110.71 yen from 110.86 yen.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 49-year-old woman enraged by her

	   The couple in the northern town of Batu Gajah quarreled on

	   The 57-year-old man was admitted to hospital with burns all over

Thai Democrats restrict bathroom breaks to ensure lawmakers vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Frustrated with lawmakers skipping
parliament sessions, the ruling Democrat party said it will begin
treating coalition members like school children by restricting
bathroom and lunch breaks.
	   The chairman of the party's parliamentary coordinating committee
said that each lawmaker would not be allowed to go the bathroom for
more than five minutes at a time, and members of parliament would
have to take turns going for meals, according to Friday's The
Nation newspaper.
	   Democrats who repeatedly miss meetings will be reported to party
leaders so that they can be reprimanded personally, Charoen
Kanthawong, the chairman, was quoted as saying.
	   As a last resort, the party would not endorse chronic offenders
during the next election.
	   The measures were instituted because during a recent debate, the
opposition disrupted a vote by calling for a check on whether or
not there was a quorum, and there wasn't, the report said.

Nicklaus hobbles to 3-over-par 74 in first round of U.S. Senior
</HEADLINE>
Open &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with completion of final round &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Golden Bear was slowed to a hobble by a
sore left hip in the first round of the U.S. Senior Open.
	   Jack Nicklaus, trying to win the Senior Open for the third time,
limped noticeably while carding a 74 on Thursday, then said he had
no plans to play in any more tournaments this year.
	   Meanwhile, only one of Nicklaus' peers _ Raymond Floyd _ managed
to break par over the rugged Riviera Country Club course, shooting
a 1-under 70 thanks to consecutive birdies at the 15th, 16th and
17th holes.
	   Nicklaus admitted his arthritic left hip ``hurt a little bit
today.''
	   ``I had a problem with it,'' he said. ``It generally doesn't
bother my swing, but it did today. It'll be better tomorrow, I
hope. I never know from day to day what's going to happen.''
	   When did the pain start?
	   ``Thirty-five years ago in San Francisco,'' he said with a
smile. ``Today, probably about 8 or 9. That hip has been a problem
for 35 years. My hardest part was just playing well.
	   ``I purposely am going to have it be my last event of the year
so I can figure out what to do.''
	   Later, Nicklaus backed off that statement a little bit, saying,
``I don't have any other tournaments scheduled right now. I'm not
going to play again until I can do what I need to do with the leg.
I'll figure out what I need to do (next week).''
	   Hip replacement surgery seems likely in the near future for
arguably the greatest golfer of all time.
	   Nicklaus, who opted not to play in the British Open last week,
snapping his streak of competing in 146 straight PGA Tour majors,
was four shots off the pace entering Friday's second round on the
6,906-yard (6,312-meter), par-71 Riviera course.
	   Floyd, in search of his first Senior Open victory, pointed to
patience and the mental side of the game as key factors in the fast
finish that gave him a one-shot lead over Jay Sigel, Bruce
Summerhays, Hugh Baiocchi, Bob Murphy and club pro Roy Vucinich.
	   ``I hit some good shots that weren't rewarded,'' said the
55-year-old Floyd, whose last tournament victory was the Ford
Senior Players Championship in 1996. ``I kept plugging along. I
really played well coming in.''
	   Floyd, who ranks 16th on the senior tour earnings list at dlrs
471,692, said he was prepared for this tournament.
	   ``I'd like to win the U.S. Senior Open. I think it is the most
important championship on the senior tour,'' he said. ``When you
get to a major, if you can't get keyed up for that, then probably
you should be doing something else.''
	   Two shots off the pace at 72 were Gibby Gilbert, John Grace,
Billy King, Tom Shaw, Ed Dougherty, Isao Aoki, Brian Barnes and
amateur Joel Hirsch.
	   Among those in a large group at 73 were Gil Morgan, Dave
Stockton, Jose Maria Canizares and Vicente Fernandez. Morgan is
trying to become the second player to win three senior majors in
one year. Nicklaus accomplished the feat in 1991.
	   Senior tour earnings leader Hale Irwin shot a 77, his worst
round of the year.
	   Larry Nelson, considered one of the pre-tournament favorites
along with Irwin and Gil Morgan, withdrew after his tee shot on the
ninth hole due to soreness in his right arm and the right side of
his neck. He was 6-over through eight holes.
	   Nicklaus, 58, attempting to become the oldest winner of the
Senior Open, was 1-over through 14 holes, but carded a double
bogey-6 on 15, a birdie-4 at 17, and a bogey-5 on 18.
	   On the par-3 16th, he backed off a shot after beginning his
backswing, then grimaced in pain after hitting his shot into a
bunker. He then hit a wonderful shot out of the trap for a tap-in
to save par.

Japan finance chief puzzled by Moody's credit review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said
Friday he ``can't understand'' why U.S. credit rating agency
Moody's Investors Service placed Japan's government debt under a
rating review.
	   Moody's announcement on Thursday, a blow to Japan's struggling
economy, signalled doubts about Japan's ability to repay its debts.
A downgrade would raise borrowing rates for the country's
government and companies.
	   Matsunaga said Japan has plenty of money to pay its debts.
	   ``Japan's foreign exchange reserves have, if anything, increased
recently, and the amount of our foreign asset holdings is huge,''
Matsunaga said at a regular news conference.
	   He said he told a reporter on Thursday
	   ``I can't understand why it (Moody's) is reviewing,'' he said.
	   Matsunaga also downplayed the impact of Moody's action on the
dollar-yen market Thursday, saying ``the yen fell, but then rose
again. It wasn't much of a move.''
	   Moody's said Thursday it had placed on review for a possible
downgrade the triple-A sovereign ratings of Japan's foreign
currency-denominated debt and yen-denominated debt.
	   The U.S. dollar surged over one yen to its intraday high of
142.05 yen following Moody's announcement, before falling back on
profit-taking.
	   The rating agency said the review was prompted by deep
structural problems in the Japanese economy and lack of any
government consensus on how to bring the country's finances back to
health.
	   A lowering of the rating could hamper Japan's efforts to pull
out of its slump. For example, such a move could raise the cost for
Japan of issuing bonds, something it has done more of lately as it
tries to spend its way out of recession.

North Korea returns remains of U.S. soldiers

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Friday returned three
sets of skeletal remains believed to be those of U.S. soldiers
killed in the Korean War.
	   Three gray metal coffins were handed across the border in a
simple but solemn ceremony at this hamlet inside the demilitarized
zone separating the two Koreas.
	   Each coffin was received by a six-member U.N. honor guard,
draped in a light blue U.N. flag and saluted by dozens of U.S. and
South Korean military officers.
	   The remains will be flown to the U.S. Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for forensic tests and
identification.
	   It was the second repatriation of U.S. remains since May, when
two sets were returned. All of the remains have been excavated by
joint American-North Korean teams.
	   Since 1990, 218 sets of remains have been returned but less than
a dozen have been positively identified.
	   It is the third year that Pentagon teams have conducted joint
recovery operations with the North Koreans. In 1996 and 1997, the
remains of seven servicemen were recovered. One has been identified
and returned to his family for burial.
	   North Korea has agreed to allow five U.S. excavation operations
in its territory this year, for which Washington has agreed to pay
dlrs 600,000 to cover basic expenses.
	   The last of the five operations this year is scheduled to
conclude in October.
	   More than 8,000 U.S. servicemen are listed as unaccounted for
from the Korean War. Pentagon officials estimate that the remains
of 3,000-4,000 might be recoverable.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea. The U.S. and 15
other Western countries formed a U.N. command to fight on South
Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   South Korea and North Korea remain technically in a state of
war, because the Korean conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Not even a rainstorm could cool Michael Chang
in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.
	   The top-seeded Chang cruised to his 14th straight victory
Thursday at the FitzGerald Tennis Center with a 6-4, 6-1
third-round victory over Martin Damm of the Czech Republic.
	   A two-time Legg Mason defending champion, Chang also won two
singles matches here last September in a Davis Cup semifinal
against Australia.
	   ``D.C's been a good place for me. I feel comfortable with the
courts, the setting and the crowd support,'' Chang said.
	   Chang was serving for the first set at 5-3 when a flash of
lightening caught the players attention. Damm broke Chang as play
continued to the sound of not-so-distant thunder.
	   ``It took my mind off the situation a little bit. You hear
thunder and you start looking up to the sky. Nobody wants to get
hurt,'' Chang said.
	   During the changeover at 5-4 the storm hit and play was delayed
for almost 90 minutes. Chang broke Damm's service after the delay
to win the first set and then cruised to victory in the second set.
	   Playing in much cooler conditions after the storm, unseeded
Sebastian Lareau of Canada, sixth-seed Vincent Spadea and
seventh-seed Jim Courier advanced with third-round victories.
	   Courier took care of Davis Cup teammate Justin Gimelstob 6-3,
6-4 and will face Chang in a quarterfinal Friday.
	   Advancing earlier Thursday were third-seed Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa, fifth-seed Filip DeWulf of Belgium and 14th-seed
Scott Draper of Australia.
	   Draper beat fourth-seed Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-2, 6-4. The
left-hander from Brisbane had bounced Byron's brother, Wayne, out
of the tournament in the second round.
	   Ferreira took care of his second straight crowd-pleaser. On
Tuesday Ferreira stopped the comeback of Jimmy Arias and on
Wednesday he ended the run of qualifier David Caldwell, who grew up
in Richmond, Virginia.
	   Caldwell couldn't handle Ferreira's serve, which clocked 123
mph. Caldwell, 0-5 on the tour before his two victories this week,
fell 7-5, 6-3.
	   Second-seed Andre Agassi played a third-round match later
Thursday night.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A team of college kids put the United States
into the Goodwill Games basektball gold-medal game. Wally
Szczerbiak of Miami-Ohio led a balanced U.S. offense with 20 points
in an 89-76 victory over Lithuania.
	   The United States will play for the title Friday against
Australia, which beat Puerto Rico 86-74. Anthony Ronaldson hit two
3-pointers during a 14-0 run at the start of the second half to
blow the game open.

 &UR; Beach Volleyball &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Argentina beat Norway in a beach-volleyball
marathon. It took Martin Conde and Esteban Martinez 1 hour, 19
minutes and 135 serves to defeat defending champions Jan Kvalheim
and Bjorn Maaseide 16-14 Thursday. The Argentines won the last
three points.
	   The No. 2 U.S. team of Sinjin Smith and Ricci Luyties lost for
the second straight day, 15-5 to Canada's John Child and Mark
Heese. The 41-year-old Smith needed a 5-minute injury timeout after
hurting his left calf on a jump late in the match. He completed
play and is expected to compete in the final round-round Friday
against the top U.S. team, Karch Kiraly and Adam Johnson, which
lost to Brazil's Guilherme Marques and Para Ferreira 15-3.
	   Julien Prosser and Leo Zahner of Australia beat Martin and Paul
Laciga of Switzerland 15-13. The Swiss brothers rallied from 10-6
after referee Ronnie Kaase ordered a replay of a point on which
Paul Laciga injured his foot.

The Russian diver, silver medalist on the 3-meter (-yard)
spingboard at the 1996 Olympics, edged China's Guo Jingjing by 7.32
points. Third was another Chinese diver, Zhang Jing. Erica Sorgi

up with no medal at all. Judges twice changed scores after
reviewing routines and dropped Wells from a tie for second to
fourth, behind Xu Huang of China, Ivan Ivankov of Belarus and
Aleksei Bondarenko of Russia.
	   Ivankov then won the high bar, holding off Russia's Alexei
Nemov. It was the fourth medal for Ivankov, including the

China forecasts more flooding as some Yangtze towns submerged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ As waters receded in a central China
industrial hub, Beijing ordered local governments along the Yangtze
river Friday to prepare for more flooding.
	   Top disaster relief officials warned that another flood crest _
the third this month _ was heading for the middle reaches of the
Yangtze, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   More than a month of often heavy downpours have left embankments
along the Yangtze and its lakes and tributaries weakened and
waterlogged. Water levels in the area are near or above their
historical highs, Xinhua said.
	   The system of dikes and embankments reinforced in recent days by
sandbags is the last protective shield for tens of millions of
people and some of China's richest farmland.
	   Rain-swollen rivers have already breached dikes and overwhelmed
banks in Hunan province. State-run television showed towns
submerged with only the roofs or buildings higher than two stories
poking through murky brown river water.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji telephoned Hunan Governor Yang Zhengwu
Thursday night to express concern and ordered the military and
police ``to spare no effort to safeguard the people's life and
properties,'' Xinhua reported.
	   More than 1,000 people have died throughout China in flooding
this year from rains that started earlier and fell harder than
usual. Six provinces along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, are among the hardest hit.
	   The National General Headquarters for Flood Prevention and
Drought Control told governments on the Yangtze _ from western
Sichuan province to coastal Shanghai _ to reinforce major dikes and
keep watch round-the-clock, Xinhua said.
	   Wuhan's 7 million residents got some relief Friday as blue skies
replaced some of the heaviest rains on record. Receding waters left
mud and debris on streets and sidewalks.
	   As of Thursday, parts of the city were still under waist-deep
water. Relief workers used rowboats to visit stranded residents in
low-lying areas of Wuhan's Hanyang district.
	   Wuhan suffered its heaviest rainfall on record Tuesday, which
killed one person and stranded 600,000, state media reported. Parts
of the city were without water and power for three days.
	   ``I'm thinking about moving out of here,'' said a cabdriver
named Yang whose neighborhood near the Yangtze floods every year
when the river swells with heavy summer rains.

Rwanda's Army says it killed top rebel commander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GICIYE, Rwanda (AP) _ In a blow to an insurgency in Rwanda, the
army said it killed the top commander of a rebel group.
	   The bloody body of Lt. Col. Leonard Nkundiye was placed on
public display in Giciye, 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of
Kigali, after he was shot to death early Thursday.
	   Army troops battled Nkundiye's group in the hills bordering
Congo, where rebels easily cross in and out of Rwanda, said Lt.
Col. Musuhyo Kamanzi, the army commander.
	   Nkundiye's death is a serious blow to the 2-year rebel
insurgency, Kamanzi said
	   ``He's a big fish,'' Kamanzi said. ``Getting him was a big
achievement.''
	   At least fifty rebels were killed in the battle, he said. Others
in the group scattered and were being pursued.
	   Little is known about the rebel organization.
	   Former Hutu soldiers and militia responsible for a 1994 genocide
of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
have trickled back into the country in the last two years.
	   Since then, thousands of people _ Hutus and Tutsis _ have died
in rebel attacks on schools, bars, buses and homes.
