<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is often said what does not obliterate you, will
make you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   So Paul Westphal is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it looked like a time to stick a fork in the
Sonics. But Westphal opted for a paring knife of sorts. The Sonics
coach carved out of the starting lineup despondent power forward
Vin Baker, along with shooting guard Brent Barry and small forward
Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal boldly inserted little-used Cuban forward Lazaro
Borrell and spare guard Shammond Williams. He also promoted backup
forward Rashard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call the changes an act of desperation. More
appropriately, they moves amounted to a calculated gamble that
effectively earned the Sonics a Lucky 7 _ as in the seventh seed of
the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, never in recent history has a team guaranteed a playoff
berth overhauled three-fifths of its starting lineup with five
regular-season games left.
</P>
<P>
   Now begs the question: Will the adjustments hold up in the
life-and-death arena that is the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The timing of it all initially hurt some like rubbing alcohol on
an open wound. But no one is openly upset. No one is struggling.
The only evidence in four legitimate games is that Westphal's
re-vamped lineup has value.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Sonics appear more hearty by the moves, but
their metamorphose from a stagnant team to one that is dangerously
unpredictable could create a respectable edge against the Utah Jazz
in a first-round playoff series, which begins Saturday in the Delta
Center.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what the Sonics are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a different look than we've had, and it gives a
lot of different players to have a good game,'' Westphal said. ``We
can see who is having a good game and make adjustments from
strength with guys that are experienced coming in off the bench. We
can play a lot of different styles, and I think we're a harder team
to prepare for. We certainly have a lot more quickness, and
quickness is hard to counteract.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has been noncommittal on whether he plans to revert to
the team's original starting five. It is possible that Baker, who
has played with confidence in three of the past four games, could
re-join the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lineup the Sonics field likely won't be known until
they step onto the floor for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, difficult to argue with results.
</P>
<P>
   Before Westphal stirred the pot for an April 12 home game
against Minnesota, the Sonics had lost nine of their previous 11
games. Included in that stretch was a five-game losing streak at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the team's downfall seem to coincide with Baker's
struggles. Barry lost his rhythm along the way, too. However, Baker
had grabbed 10 or more rebounds in just one game from Jan. 26 to
March 29. The Sonics went 12-15 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   As the team fell further under a lethargic trance, losing
streaks became normal for the once-surprising Sonics. While making
the playoffs was never in doubt, they found themselves trying to
climb out of the eighth seed, and a quick exit scenario against the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record was 3-2 with the lineup changes, a mark
skewed by a season-finale loss to the L.A. Clippers on Wednesday
when the regulars played sparingly. Aside from a 117-103 loss at
Dallas, the newlook Sonics have been fresh, energetic, quick and
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup we had wasn't really working so change was
forthcoming,'' center Horace Grant said. ``(Westphal) didn't have
to explain anything to us. He's the coach. But those young guys are
giving us a spark. We're winning so why not keep rolling with it? I
wouldn't change a thing. We have a chance to run the ball up and
down the court more than we have all season.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, is how the Sonics expect to beat an aging and
less athletic Jazz team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well with this lineup,'' said Baker, who is still
hoping to reclaim his starting spot. ``Those guys give us a lot of
great energy, and obviously with me coming off the bench, it will
be a different look for (Utah). ...Those guys are learning fast and
enthusiastic on the floor. Myself, Ruben and Brent have been
starters all season, but the changes gives us a chance to get in
with the flow of the game. That's an advantage for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages for the Sonics with Lewis, Williams, Borrell,
Grant and Gary Payton starting are three-fold.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, at 6-foot-1, is lightning quick and able to handle the
ball. That allows Payton to operate without the responsibility of
creating shots for others. Payton can instead run off screens and
attack the basket. And whenever Payton draws double teams, Williams
is adept enough to sink open jump shots or take his man off the
dribble and get shot attempts in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup modifications has induced Payton to play the last
week with renewed energy, although the all-star guard seemed
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's been effective,'' Payton said. ``I just
know we're winning basketball games. We started a new lineup, OK.
You think about who has been coming in to play more of the minutes.
It's been Vin Baker and (Patterson and Barry) playing the most
minutes. It doesn't make a difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use Lewis centers mostly on his skill level at
6-foot-10. The 20-year-old can handle the ball and create a
mismatch in the post against most small forwards guarding him.
Lewis' shooting range extends to the three-point arc, and he has
the ability to blow past defenders and explode to the basket for a
dunk or layup in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can outquick them and try to get off to a fast start. Youth
is going to be one thing. But we know we're going to have to rely
on experience because Utah is an experienced team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' leaping ability and enthusiasm makes him a chore for
anyone to contain on the boards. He works hard to grab offensive
and defensive rebounds. The coaching staff is captivated by the
versatility and confidence Lewis displays from game to game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing addition by subtraction was Borrell.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics originally signed the 6-foot-8 forward with an intent
to use him next season. Conventional wisdom suggested that Borrell
needed this season learn English, adjust to the NBA game and life
without his family following his defection.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Sonics learned from Day One in training camp was
that Borrell appeared undaunted about those life changes. He
performed consistently well in practices, using his instincts and
natural feel for the game to establish himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is a crafty defender who does not get burn easily. Although
Borrell is not a serious outside shooting threat, he can score in
the post and take a defender off the dribble. Borrell's most
impressive attribute is his heart. He plays with confidence all the
time and does not appear awe-struck by the NBA arenas and superstar
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference to him. He was living in a
shack a year ago. Now he's farting through silk,'' Westphal said of
Borrell, who defected from Cuba last season then joined the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Still wondering where Borrell came from and how can the Sonics
afford to rely on him?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on Borrell is that he is a seasoned basketball
player. His experience ranges from playing for Cuba in the Olympic
Qualifying tournament last summer to two stints in the Argentina
Basketball League where he averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds
against international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Sonics keep a plus/minus chart of every player. It is
an evaluation that tells coaches how the score fluctuates when that
player is on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five games Lazaro's plus/minus is better than anyone
we have,'' Westphal said. ``I like that. (The new lineup) gives us
a little bit of unpredictability.''
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of playing essentially two rookies (Borrell and
Williams) and Lewis (a second-year player) is that they have no
playoff experience. How they might react is part of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you can't predict these guys,'' assistant coach Nate
McMillan said. ``But these guys do an excellent job of moving
without the ball. They do an excellent job of defending and
covering for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bold move, but everybody was supportive. We needed a
change. Us being unpredictable is something (Utah) has to be
concerned about. Who do you put your center on? Who do you put
(Karl) Malone on? Are they going to all of a sudden become a
trapping team? Are they going to try and run? They don't kn ow what
we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in itself, brings out another positive aspect of the
lineup shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Sonics' young players not respond well, the team can
quickly go to Baker, Patterson or Barry for an early save. In
effect, Westphal, whose rotations have been capricious until now,
has manufactured a sturdy bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of the season, if you don't have a bench, you
don't win. It's just as simple as that,'' said McMillan, who once
was a Sonic starter before Payton's arrival. ``Your starters are
starters, but your bench players are just as important. Both of
those groups are equal. Whoever plays well in the first half
between those 8 to 10 players will finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some new young talent. We've got new life and no one
knows what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the playoffs, even if it appears the Sonics are
well done.

   HAIPHONG, Vietnam _ Just outside this port city on Vietnam's
northeastern coast lies the Nomura-Haiphong Industrial Zone, a
377-acre swath of land as green and table-flat as the rice paddies
next to it. Where the smokestacks and assembly lines of giant
factories were supposed to rise, there are only windswept fields,
stretching unbroken to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura, the Japanese bank, has fought a losing battle to lure
foreign companies since it opened the zone in 1997. Only two set up
shop here last year, an auto-parts maker and a chemical plant, both
Japanese. Ho Dinh Tien, the zone's good-natured executive director,
who keeps watch from a dozy office at the front gate, said Nomura
no longer even sets goals for the number of new occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when foreign companies came to Vietnam,''
Tien said as he gazed wistfully out the window. ``Now is not that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In its grandeur and folly, Nomura's field of dreams epitomizes
what has gone wrong with the Vietnamese economy since it first
opened to the outside world in 1988. Built to catch the flood of
foreign investors into Vietnam, the zone _ and many others like it
in northern Vietnam _ has been strangled by government red tape,
balky customs officials, and overly aggressive tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 700 miles south, on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, the
former Saigon, one finds an entirely different world. There, in
Dong Nai province, factories have sprung up like tumbleweeds along
the dusty north-south highway. Nike, Fujitsu, and dozens of other
foreign companies are churning out athletic shoes, circuit boards,
and cigarettes. Despite ramshackle facilities and an almost comical
lack of central planning, Dong Nai has become the fastest-growing
region in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these two competing forces in Vietnam: one focused on
production and the other on extraction,'' said Thomas J. Vallely,
the director of the Indochina program at the Harvard Institute for
International Development. ``The question is, which is going to
prevail?''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Vallely and other experts believed that Vietnam's
enterprising south would drag the more cautious, politically
encrusted north into the global economy. But 25 years after the war
that unified Vietnam, the north and south remain divided
economically. And the gap is widening: Dong Nai's exports grew by
22 percent in the first half of 1999, while Haiphong's declined by
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the south's success, some experts say it is the
old-style Communists in Hanoi, not the capitalists in Ho Chi Minh
City, who have the upper hand in the battle for Vietnam's future.
Hanoi has balked at signing a trade agreement with the United
States. And despite years of promises, it has done little to clear
the bureaucratic underbrush that makes Vietnam a deeply frustrating
place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, although Vietnam has become more competitive in
absolute terms, it is less competitive relative to its Asian
neighbors than it was a few years ago,'' said Wolfgang
Bertelsmeier, the chief of mission of the International Finance
Corp., a division of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign direct investment, which used to pour into Vietnam at a
rate of more than $4 billion a year, trickled to $1.4 billion in
1999 and is likely to fall further this year. Those numbers
overstate the actual dollars flowing into Vietnam, since the
government approves many more projects than are built. Experts
figure that the country drew no more $600 million in hard dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the decline is due to the Asian crisis, which forced big
spenders like Japan and South Korea to pull in their horns. But
much of it can be laid to Vietnam's stifling bureaucracy. Companies
like Oracle have folded their tents, while others, like Procter &AMP;
Gamble, have fallen into bitter disputes with their Vietnamese
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling foreign investment has sapped Vietnam's exports and
hobbled its growth. After barreling along at 9.5 percent in 1995
and 8.8 percent in 1997, Vietnam's economic output fell to 5.8
percent in 1998 and 4.8 percent last year. Economists say it will
be lucky to match that this year.
</P>
<P>
   While neighbors like the Philippines have developed thriving
electronics industries, Vietnam is struggling to hold on to its
handful of technology investors. Even those companies that are
welcomed by the Vietnamese, like Fujitsu, must wait years to get
their projects approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came here, we had many problems negotiating with
Hanoi,'' said Shuzo Kawashima, the president of the Fujitsu factory
in Dong Nai, which employs 2,728 workers. ``They kept changing
their minds. Now we deal only with the local government, which is
much easier.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kawashima showed a visitor around his factory, which has
Vietnam's first ``clean room'' for assembling advanced computer
circuits. At the rear of the plant is a loading dock, where customs
officials from Dong Nai inspect and stamp boxes of Fujitsu circuit
boards before they leave the factory. The boards are then exported
to Japan, Thailand and the Philippines, where they are installed in
laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike companies in the north, officials at Fujitsu said they
rarely have trouble with customs officials. They said the
provincial authorities were also helpful in the day-to-day issues
of running a factory, like providing reliable electricity and
adequate waste-water treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has also gravitated to southern Vietnam. All five of its
contract factories are within a two-hour drive of Ho Chi Minh City,
even though workers' salaries there are the highest in the country.
Nike's contractors employ more than 45,000 workers, making it the
leading source of private employment in Vietnam. Many of these
people have migrated to Dong Nai from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen The Nga, a 27-year-old woman from Quang Binh province in
north-central Vietnam, used to sell fish and vegetables in her
village. Three years ago, she came to work in a Nike factory, where
she glues together the rubber soles of running shoes. The work is
grueling and the Korean bosses are strict. But life is better than
in Quang Binh, where Nga said her village was ruined by recent
floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a farmer in Vietnam, having a stable job and a basic wage
is enough,'' Nga said, as she played with her baby after a 10-hour
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Nike said the Vietnamese government regularly
encourages the company to shift manufacturing to the north. Among
other things, such a move would stem the tide of migration to Ho
Chi Minh City, which has become dangerously overcrowded in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Helzer, Nike's director of government affairs in
Vietnam, said, ``To build a factory up north would present problems
that would be difficult to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate, saying that he did not want to offend
the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials are well aware of the north's poor
reputation among foreign investors. They explain it as a vestige of
Vietnam's history, in which the south was exposed to the capitalism
of the United States while the north languished in the orbit of the
Soviet Union. Over time, they insist, northern officials will shed
old habits and learn to be more flexible and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The south is absolutely more dynamic and creative than the
north, but only in the short term,'' said Nguyen Chon Trung, vice
chairman of Ho Chi Minh City's industrial zone authority. ``The
government will develop policies to strike a better balance between
north and south.''
</P>
<P>
   Tien of Nomura said some of the strongest resistance to change
comes not from the central government but from local authorities.
He said Vietnam's prime minister and Communist Party secretary had
traveled to Haiphong to urge the city government to be more helpful
to foreigners. This prodding came even after Haiphong donated the
land, and put its name on, the industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dong Nai was able to be more liberal because it was a rural
area and the government didn't pay much attention to it,'' Tien
said. ``But Haiphong was always regarded as one of the country's
industrial centers, so it was more tightly regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographic disparities in growth are not necessarily harmful. In
China, for example, the free-wheeling southern coastal provinces
provided the kindling for the country's broader growth. In Vietnam,
however, the imbalance could eventually damage the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government steers more foreign aid money and tax
dollars to northern provinces. It also spends more on public-works
projects, as anyone flying from Ho Chi Minh City's somewhat
decrepit airport to Hanoi's soon-to-be-expand- ed &UR;  &LR; one can attest.
</P>
<P>
   While prosperous, Dong Nai lacks decent housing, roads and
public transportation. At 4 p.m., when the whistles at its
factories blow, the streets are choked with motorcycles and
bicycles. The migrant workers sleep four or five to a room in grim,
hastily constructed cement blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese government could wreck Dong Nai by not
providing adequate infrastructure around those factories,'' said
Brian Quinn, the country coordinator of the Harvard Institute for
International Development. ``This is a case of starving the south
to feed the north.''

   (REMOVES ``and insufficiently tended'' from lede; ADDS not to 11th

 By FRANK BRUNI with ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPLE, Texas _ For Gov. George Bush, the unthinkable bloodshed
of a year ago was a lesson in neglected values, so his act of
remembrance on Thursday was a visit to an elementary school with a
special program for promoting those traits.
</P>
<P>
   For Vice President Gore, the killings were as compelling an
example as possible of the prevalence and deadliness of firearms,
and Thursday's anniversary was a time to call, once again, in a
voice laced with urgency, for tougher gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months after the fact, the massacre at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., cast its shadow over the presidential
race. And the different ways in which the presumptive Republican
and Democratic nominees responded presented a tidy, stark contrast
in their beliefs about the roots of, and remedies for, random
violence in America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plugged character education in public schools. Gore pushed
the licensing of handgun owners. And each candidate took swipes at
his rival, jockeying for advantage on an issue that many political
analysts believe will be more important in the 2000 elections than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass laws all we want,'' Bush told educators at the
Cater Elementary School in Temple, Texas, about an hour's drive
north of Austin. ``The problem is that government can't make people
love one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What government can do, in my judgment,'' Bush said, ``is
facilitate decent, honorable folks who understand that we need to
teach our children right from wrong. We need to teach our children
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking to students at Fort Lee High School in New
Jersey, said that government can _ and should _ make it more
difficult for guns to end up in the hands of destructive people,
and that the spate of school shootings over the last two years
demanded such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that all of these events, including Columbine,
have in common is that they involve guns in the hands of people
that shouldn't have them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the lessons of Columbine is that we have to
stand up to the NRA and the gun industry,'' Gore added, referring
to the National Rifle Association. Bush, he said, ``has done what
the NRA has wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine has intensified a debate over school violence and gun
control. Many Democrats feel their advocacy of gun control reflects
the mood of the country and will be rewarded at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are betting that it will not, and while Bush
has indicated a greater receptiveness toward gun control over the
last month, he has not wrapped his arms around the issue the way he
has with other areas of policy traditionally dominated by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He said on Thursday that there were some sensible new
restrictions on firearms that he supported. But his emphasis was
elsewhere, as he visited a first-grade classroom in which students
participated in a character education program. It entailed making
lists of statements and reading stories that illustrated a chosen
value of the month. April's was sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his own take on the word, Bush told the 20 students
that sincerity was a matter of meaning what you say. ``I'm sincere
when I say I'm glad to be here in your class,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed more than tripling, to $25 million from $8
million, the federal money dedicated annually to the promotion of
character education in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is not his sole suggestion for making school safer. He has
promoted legislation to immunize teachers who take disciplinary
action against unruly or dangerous students from lawsuits and has
pledged that, as president, he would require perpetually dangerous
schools to make arrangements for students who wanted to transfer to
safer learning environments.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding guns, Bush said that one of the biggest problems was
the lax enforcement of regulations, a condemnation of the Clinton
administration that was none too implicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the next administration to do something a
little differently and enforce laws that are on the books,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore countered that Bush was misportraying the statistics and
that laws had been vigorously enforced.
</P>
<P>
   He also shined a harsh spotlight on Bush's record on gun control
in Texas, where Bush signed a 1995 law that permitted Texans who
were properly licensed to carry concealed weapons. Bush also
supported subsequent legislation that, to some degree, removed a
barrier preventing people from carrying concealed weapons into
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overturned the 125-year-old ban on concealed weapons in
Texas and than went back for another law to make sure that people
could take them into churches and synagogues,'' Gore said. ``I
think that's pretty out of touch with what most people want.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said character education and attention to cultural and
moral factors in youth violence were worthy, but were not enough,
and mentioned an array of new restrictions on firearms that he
supports.

   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday defended his
decision to issue new emergency restrictions limiting access to the
City Hall steps, saying they were modeled on those governing the
steps of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensitivity of City Hall is roughly equal to the
sensitivity of the United States Congress,'' the mayor said. Under
the emergency order, anyone wanting to hold a news conference or
protest on the City Hall steps or in City Hall Park must obtain a
police permit, applying at least two days in advance for large
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel,
also announced that City Hall Plaza, now used as a staging area for
official events and for parking for the mayor and the City Council
at the foot of the City Hall steps, would be opened to pedestrians
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   He said electronic scanning devices, similar to those used for
airport security, would be installed at the two main entrances to
the plaza and used to check pedestrians for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor issued the rules on the City Hall steps two weeks
after a federal court threw out his previous guidelines after
determining that they violated the First Amendment right of
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The old rules gave the police far-reaching authority to decide
what groups or individuals would be granted access.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules were put in place on a day when a rally against
police brutality made its way across the Brooklyn Bridge to City
Hall, where it was contained behind police barricades on a sidewalk
outside City Hall Park.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Connolly, an assistant corporation counsel, said the
timing of the new restrictions was unrelated to protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing had to do with Judge Baer's decision, which last
week left us without any rules at all and meant that any group
could have descended on City Hall,'' he said, referring to Judge
Harold Baer Jr. of U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   First released on Tuesday night, the restrictions were explained
in detail late Thursday. Hess said groups of up to 300 people could
be granted permits to assemble on City Hall steps and the broad
plaza at its base, and groups of more than 300 would be consigned
to City Hall Park, but only with a separate permit from the city's
Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous rules, groups using the City Hall steps and
plaza were limited to 50 people, and those using City Hall park
were limited to 150. Police approval was required for all groups.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, and Peter Vallone, the Council speaker, said the
new rules still denied the public general access.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he would ``wait to see how the rules are put into
practice,'' but was prepared to file suit if they intruded on free
speech in ways similar to the rules thrown out by Judge Baer.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the U.S. Capital Police, Lt. Dan
Nickels, said the new City Hall restrictions were ``very much in
line'' with rules governing access to the steps of the Capital
Rotunda since the 1970s.

FROM CHILDHOOD TV FAN TO MASTER OF MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the day in 1950 when the first bulky television
set was installed in her childhood home, Geraldine Laybourne, 3
years old, fantasized that she was part of the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, a former radio soap opera actress and producer,
greeted the addition to the living room with the welcoming yelp,
``Hello TV!'' And the television, tuned to some bygone program,
answered with, ``Hello out there in TV land!''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. Young Geraldine got all dressed up when it was
time for Hopalong Cassidy because she assumed the cowboy could see
her. She begged her mother to let her climb inside the back of the
set and join the fun. Her mother, in turn, turned off programs in
the middle and encouraged the girl to make up the end. ``I've been
trying to do interactive TV since I was born,'' Laybourne said.
</P>
<P>
   These are stories that have been told and retold by Laybourne,
52, one of the most prominent female executives in television. She
made her mark as president of Nickelodeon, took a brief turn as
head of cable networks for Disney/ABC and finally launched Oxygen
Media, a high-risk venture that combines original cable programming
and Web sites for today's cheeky, irreverent woman.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Laybourne includes lessons from her father, a
stockbroker, who decided that his middle daughter had a head for
business. He took her to the office each Saturday and tested her
instincts by describing a company and asking her investment advice.
He didn't always listen, she said, but if he had, he would have
died a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was adrift when she graduated from Vassar College in
1969. She dabbled in architecture but found her calling through the
man she would marry, Kit Laybourne, five years her senior, who was
teaching media studies at a Philadelphia high school. She followed
him into teaching and then into independent television production,
where one of their first clients was Nickelodeon, the nascent
children's cable network that she would later turn into a
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Laybournes are working together again in Oxygen's duplex
loft above the Chelsea market. She is in the executive office,
huddled with groups of men in suits, negotiating contracts with
cable operators. He is in the animation studio, directing a crew of
20-somethings with pierced noses and spiky hair, who are creating
cartoons for women as rowdy as Nickelodeon's Ren and Stimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Laybourne has no envy of his wife's fame. ``He gets his
juice from other things,'' she said. ``He's 100 percent creative.''
He is also a natural teacher, of their own two grown children (one
a comedian working on a television pilot called ``Running With
Scissors,'' produced by Marcy Carsey, an Oxygen partner, and the
other a teacher of English and dance) and of the more than 500
young Oxygen employees.
</P>
<P>
   Laybourne is buoyed by spending his time as an animator _ and
the Pied Piper for his over-caffeinated team. ``They want to
ignite, burn, work for 12 hours, drink for another five and then
see who gets here first in the morning with the worst hangover,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife has the more conventional task of selling cable
operators on her venture, when the field is crowded and the newest
entrants are expected to pay for subscribers rather than be paid
for their programming, a business model Laybourne rejects. She has
yet to crack the New York market, or most of Los Angeles, though
she has contracts for 27 million viewers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But she is confident that New York is within reach, a
development considered more likely as a result of the proposed
merger between Time Warner and America Online, one of Oxygen's
investors. ``You have to earn everything,'' she said, disputing
that her relationship with AOL means a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen began with the Laybournes' picking the brains of the
Internet generation, who knew more than they did about convergence.
First, they hired five friends of their children, put them in a
room and asked them to surf the Web, evaluate what was out there
for women and look for unmet needs.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to create interactive programs and Web sites.
Everyone's ideas were welcome, pitched to a committee of elders
that included Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach, the creators
of ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Roseanne,'' and Oprah Winfrey, an
Oxygen partner, with two shows of her own.
</P>
<P>
   This ``green light process,'' as Laybourne called it, produced
``We Sweat,'' a sports program; WomensHands, an e-commerce site for
artisans; and ``Be Fearless,'' currently in production, about
political advocacy. All the programming is created jointly for
television and the Web. ``Trackers,'' for instance, a
late-afternoon package of shows for adolescents, is the handiwork
of a former producer from Viacom and another from Teen People
On-Line.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hallmarks of Laybourne's management style is that she
considers mistakes opportunities. On her office door at Nickelodeon
there was a sign that said, ``If It Ain't Broke, Fix It Anyway,''
hardly the conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   At Oxygen, that impulse makes sense because viewers and Web
surfers weigh in instantaneously on message boards, with praise and
blame, which that can alter programming overnight. ``That to me is
what's so exciting about this,'' Laybourne said. ``You have to fix
it every day.''

`THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES' MAKING A POLITICAL CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it a bit of political theater or merely some
inspired casting, but Donna Hanover's latest acting job might raise
some eyebrows at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning May 30, Hanover, the wife of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
will take over a lead role in ``The Vagina Monologues,'' the
off-Broadway hit that features a dozen or so monologues on topics
like orgasm and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, a spokeswoman for Hanover, confirmed the
casting, which had been rumored in theatrical circles for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was asked by the producers, and she said she'd like to do
it,'' Danielides said. ``Donna makes her own professional
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, who has appeared in several films and is the host of
the program ``In Food Today'' on the Television Food Network, will
perform for two weeks, sharing the play's monologues with two other
women.
</P>
<P>
   While her decision to do the play was a professional one,
pundits may wonder if there is a political subtext in Hanover's
choice of material.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``The Vagina Monologues,'' after all, is Eve
Ensler, a personal friend and political supporter of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Giuliani's opponent in the race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A playwright long concerned with women's issues, Ensler was an
honorary member of Clinton's exploratory committee for her campaign
and visited the White House last year for a personal meeting with
the first lady. Clinton, meanwhile, is writing a foreword to
Ensler's new play, ``Necessary Targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielides had no comment on Ensler's connection to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the mayor's office for comment was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which began at a small theater in
SoHo in 1996, reopened at the Westside Theater in October with
Ensler performing all the monologues. Since February, however,
those duties have been shared by rotating trios of performers,
including Broadway actresses like Audra McDonald and the singer
Alanis Morisette.

ALFRED R. WENTWORTH, 80, BANK EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Nev., N.J.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred R. Wentworth, who as a Chase Manhattan executive in 1972
opened the first office of an American bank in the Soviet Union in
more than 50 years, died on April 13 in Sarasota, Fla. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth joined the international department of the Chase
National Bank in 1946. The bank merged with the Bank of Manhattan
in 1955 to form Chase Manhattan, and Wentworth became a senior vice
president in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was chosen to open the company's branch in Moscow in 1972.
During his tenure from 1972 to 1975, the United States became the
Soviet Union's main Western trading partner. In 1974, Chase
Manhattan and the State Bank of the Soviet Union agreed to exchange
business information, something that would help Soviet trade with
the West.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Wentworth became president and chief executive of Chase
Manhattan Canada. He retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Reno, Wentworth graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1943, and served in the Army
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy, of Sarasota; and two sons,
Alfred R. Jr., of Jackson, N.J., and Robert, of Gainesville, Fla.

MIDDLE-AGED FATHER LINKED BY DNA TO AT LEAST 12 SLAYINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEWIS KAMB and SAM SKOLNIK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE _ As the man suspected of killing as many as 18 women
sat in a downtown prison cell, investigators fielded calls from
other detectives who are trying to solve similar slayings across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from as far away as Alabama, New York and even
Germany are wondering whether Robert Lee Yates Jr. _ described by
authorites as a ``family man,'' could be the same person who killed
women.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, detectives dug deeper into an investigation they now
say could take two or more years and millions of dollars to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a busy, but good day,'' Spokane COunty Sheriff Mark Sherk
said Thursday. ``Detectives are relieved we've finally made an
arrest, but the immensity of the task ahead of them is starting to
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives fielded dozens of calls with tips from people who
knew Yates or others passing along information they believed could
be helpful, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratories here and across the state and nation buzzed as
criminologists analyzed crime scene and other evidence generated
since Yates' arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators seized another vehicle _ a van located in Idaho _
they say is one of nine automobiles Yates owned or had been known
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And detectives here and in Western Washington worked with
federal agents to piece together a timeline of Yates' whereabouts
over the past decade trying to place him in areas when and where
bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty confident once we get a timeline, it will all
correspond,''terk said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say DNA evidence links Yates to the deaths of at
least 12 of 18 victims _ women mostly caught in at-risk lives of
drugs and prostitution Evidence may also tie him to all of the
cases, they say.
</P>
<P>
   All of the women were shot. Investigators said Thursday they
have not recovered a firearm in the case, though Sherk said a bomb
sniffing dog that ATF agents from Miami led through Yates' home on
Tuesday hit at least ``six alerts'' _ areas where guns or bullets
may have been kept in the house at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from Yates links him directly to genetic material
the killer left where eight bodies were dumped _ though
investigators would not say what that crime scene material is. Four
other victims investigators say positively link to Yates were also
linked through DNA and other evidence. But again, they would not
disclose how.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, relatives of all 18 victims had been contacted by
investigators. Detectives have not released the names of the 12
directly linked to their suspect, who has yet to be charged in 11
of those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, 47, was charged Wednesday with the first-degree murder of
16-year-old Jennifer Johnson, a wayward youth from Spanaway who
sold sex on Spokane streets up until her disappearance in August
1997. Her decomposing remains were found later that month dumped in
off a roadside in rural Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to link Johnson's death this week to
Yates, an Army vet and father of five who worked at a Mead aluminum
smelter, through blood and other evidence found in a car he once
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic evidence, a button identical to one missing from a
jacket found on Johnson's corpse, and other evidence obtained from
a 1977 white Corvette Yates owned between 1994 and 1998 tied him to
her killing, leading investigators here to arrest him in north
Spokane early Tuesday while Yates drove to work.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from him shortly after his arrest has since
identified Yates as the serial killer of at least 12 women _ and
possibly up to 18 _ across Washington, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the guy we were looking for,'' Sterk said. ``He's
finally behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates sat Thursday in a 8 by 9 foot prison cell in the Public
Safety Building in lieu of $1.5 million cash bail. Prison guards
surveyed him under a suicide-type watch _ checking him every 15
minutes _ though investigators say he has not threatened to harm
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He remains isolated from the general prison population, said
Jail Commander Sheriff's Capt. Dick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Though the murder charge against him has been formally read at a
preliminary hearing, prosecutors have yet to formally file the
charges. They have until Friday morning to do that. After an
arrest, prosecuting attorneys have 72 hours by law to file such
charges or they must release their suspect, court officials said
Thursday. An arraignment will be scheduled once those files are
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Though court officials said Yates has applied for a court
appointed attorney, they would not disclose whether one has yet
been assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   While detectives worked locally to tie him to all 18 murders in
the state, calls began flowing in from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since authorities began investigating the murders, the serial
killer here has been looked at as a person of interest in several
other slayings, including one in Germany, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army helicopter pilot and reservist now in custody moved
with his family across the county over the years. Yates has lived
in New York, Alabama and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Now authorities in some of those areas are looking into whether
Yates alleged killing spree may have started long before he moved
to Washington state
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joseph Goss of the Watertown, N.Y., Police Department says
his detectives are now actively investigating whether that small
city's one unsolved homicide is tied to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hosmer Smith was shot and killed at 4 a.m. august first
1990 on a street just behing Watertown police headquarters. Smith,
an unemployed 20-year-old, was estranged from her husband at the
time. Goss said the husband had a strong alibi and quickly ruled
out as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was not involved in drugs and prostitution, according to
the police file, Goss said. but it's possible that the perpetrator
might have thought that, walking alone on a downtown street at 4
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goss says that Watertown police have called spokane
detectives to inquire about a possible connection to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few fundamental questions outstanding however. it is
unclear whether Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, just outside
Watertown, at the time. Yates first was stationed at Ft. Drum in
late 1990 or early 1991 according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a case we would like to compare notes on,'' said Goss,
``Is there a link? it's to early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a much firmer connection between Yates and
Connie LaFontaine the Tacoma woman found dead on Oct. 13, 1998.
Police have connected LaFontaine, a prostitute, to the serial
murders from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, retired from the army and moved to spokane in 1996. Soon
after, he joined the Washington Army National Guard for the last
three years, one weekend a month, he flew to Ft. Lewis 12 miles
outside of Tacoma to teach helicopter flying lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Dave Hall of the pierce co. sheriff's
department, La Fontaine and Yates seem to be solidly linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say that from what we know so far, it looks very
promising,'' hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yates' arrest, Pierce County sheriff investigators have
been coordinating with Spokane police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Pierce County detectives are concentration on where
Yates might have stayed in the county; what kind of car he may have
been driving at the time; and where he may have flown in her
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about the connections between Yates and Melinda
Mercer, a Tacoma area woman found dead in december 1997. She was
also thought to be the serial killer's victim.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mathis, a spokesman for the Spokane police Department which
is handling the investigation, could not be reached for comment.
Police investigating another the third western Washington woman
connected to the Spokane serial murderer are not yet ready to make
the tie to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Barnes, whose body was discovered in 1995, has hereto
for haas only been listed as a possible victim of the murder. She
was from Port Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsap county sheriff's office chief of detectives Mike Davis
says his office has been communicating with counterparts in Spokane
regularly 'to try to establish a firmer connection between the
Barnes homicide and they're serial murderer.'
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is not as optimistic as his pierce county counterpart
regarding a connection to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's still premature to advise that we've
reached the conclusion that she is indeed a victim of the
particular man they've arrested over there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, an investigator revealed Thursday they got an
unlikely break in the Corvette that helped bring Yates to custody.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Jones, the woman who bought the Corvette from Yates in
1998, is the sister of a woman who works in the Spokane city-county
joint property room. Everything from confiscated pot pipes to
recovered stolen articles is kept there, Detective Cal Walker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After she bought the car, Jones stored it in her sister's garage
for months, leaving crucial evidence that helped link Yates to
Johnson's murder undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no type of cleaning to contaminate the evidence,''
said Walker, who added that the blood, carpet fibers and button
found in the car broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to arrest Yates for Johsnon's murder
largely on that evidence alone. They then were able to draw the
blood that his linked him to 11 other victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Corvette basically has been put to bed,'' Walker said of
the importance of it to the case. ``It probably won't come out
again til court.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators showed media members five other cars they have
confinscated since Yates arrest. Among them, two blue Hondas, two
Ford vans and a Ford pick up that still has a vehicle registration
sticker to Ft. Drum, Ny York from 1993 on its bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also allowed media passed police barricades to
view Yates' South Hill split-level home that hs been shrouded by
tarps since his arrest for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three tripods sat in the home's front and side yards, holding up
sophisticated equipment provided by the Washington State Patrol
that will create a three-dimension map of the scene. A white flag
could be seen in a wood pile next to at least two sheds visible in
the home's yard marking a place of interest to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The house was typical of the split levels that line East 49th
Avenue. Well kept and landscaped, it had flowers shrubbery, a
blossoming cherry tree and evergreens surrounding it. A basketball
hoop hung on the side of a garage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred McMorrow, an author and a retired editor and
Long Island section columnist for The New York Times, died Thursday
in a nursing home in Walhalla, S.C. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeanne Baker McMorrow, said he had recently had a
stroke after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, McMorrow, a humorist, poet and jazz pianist as
well as a journeyman journalist, worked on copy desks at every
surviving New York daily newspaper, often as chief or deputy chief
of the desk.
</P>
<P>
   His most successful book, ``Midolescence: The Dangerous Years''
(Strawberry Hill, 1974) was a wry look at the problems of the
second adolescence sometimes called middle age. He also wrote
``Jimmy: the Candidacy of Carter'' (Strawberry Hill, 1976),
published at the end of that presidential campaign.

SAMUEL MERRICK, 86, OLYMPIC YACHTING TEAM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Ore., Wis., Vt.)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel V. Merrick, a Washington lawyer who in 1984 directed the
United States to its best showing in Olympic yachting, died Monday
at his home in Medford, N.J. He was 86 and had competed in
one-design sailboat races since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, after working 35 years in labor and congressional
relations, Merrick retired and became the unsalaried director of
the U.S. Olympic yachting committee. In 1980, he added the title of
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His main job was to prepare a U.S. Olympic team. His efforts for
the 1980 Olympics in Moscow ended when President Jimmy Carter
pressured the U.S. Olympic Committee to boycott those Olympics
because of the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics attracted 300 sailors from 62
nations. Merrick helped develop a U.S. team that he thought could
win medals in six of the seven boat classes. His sailors did
better, winning medals (three gold and four silver) in every class.
His efforts brought him the most prestigious award in American
sailing, the Nathaniel G. Herreshoff Trophy. Merrick then retired,
saying, ``It's time to go home and plant some tulips.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Harley, now the Olympic director of the U.S. Sailing
Association, the sport's national governing body, had been
Merrick's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran the committee the way it should be run,'' Harley
recalled Thursday. ``If tough was good, Sam was good. We had meager
funds in those days. The first year's budget was in the $250,000
range, and you try to spread that among a lot of sailors trying to
win medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Vaughn Merrick was born March 24, 1914, in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., and raised in nearby Villanova. He earned a bachelor's degree
in engineering in 1937 and a law degree in 1940, both from the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   His governmental positions included special assistant to the
general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (1950-55),
staff member of the Senate committee on labor and public welfare
(1958-61), assistant to the special counsel of the mayor of Boston
(1962-67) and director of congressional relations for the U.S.
Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities (1971-72).
</P>
<P>
   He was married in 1947 to Eleanor Perry of Dover, Mass. He is
survived by his wife; three sons, John of Portland, Ore.; Gregory
of Mineral Point, Wis., and Tad of Brandon, Vt.; and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington in the winter and Bay Head, N.J., in the summer,
he raced in such one-design boat classes as Soling, Thistle and E
Scows. The Soling is a 26-foot keelboat that first competed in the
Olympics in 1972. Merrick, a Soling favorite in the U.S. Olympic
Trials that year, finished seventh. Buddy Melges of Zenda, Wis.,
won the Soling trials and the Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Melges received an up-close look at Merrick's
competitiveness. He told The Washington Post: ``Merrick invited me
to race with him one day. He hopped around his Soling like a man
half his age. He sailed every Sunday through the winter, he said,
and grew enraged whenever archrival Stuart Walker slipped by for a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Merrick was 71 and Walker 62.

SERGEI ZALYGIN, 86, WHO FOUGHT SOVIET CENSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Sergei Zalygin, a writer and the chief editor of the
literary journal Novy Mir who in the late 1980s published
long-banned works by Boris Pasternak, Joseph Brodsky and Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn, died on Wednesday at a hospital here. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin edited Novy Mir from 1986 to 1988, at the height of
President Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign to open the way to free
expression and debate. It was under Zalygin's leadership that the
monthly journal, a closely watched barometer of literary freedom in
Soviet Russia, first published poetry by Brodsky, then in exile,
and ``Doctor Zhivago,'' by Pasternak.
</P>
<P>
   After a long battle with Communist Party censors, Zalygin, the
first nonmember of the party to edit Novy Mir, succeeded in laying
the groundwork for the publication, in 1990, of ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's epic on Stalin's labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   As Izvestia wrote Thursday, the publication of ``Gulag,'' a book
that 10 years earlier could have cost a Soviet reader a prison
term, meant that Soviet censorship had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin, born in 1913 in a village in the southern Urals, near
Ufa, came to literature as a second career. His first was as a
hydrologist and agricultural specialist, two professions that gave
him the ammunition to lead a crusade in the early '80s against one
of the most harebrained of Soviet megaprojects, the plan to reverse
the flow of Siberian rivers and send the water south, to the
Central Asian deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin and his allies, who included nationalists and
environmentalists, won that battle, an early victory in Gorbachev's
campaign to shake loose the rigid central planning system and stop
its environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin's first book was published in 1936. In 1968, he won a
state prize for ``Solyanay Pad,'' a novel with a negative portrait
of a fanatic communist leader in a village in Siberia. Another
novel, ``On the Irtysh,'' was about dekulakization, a euphemism for
Stalin's campaign to collectivize Russian agriculture and
exterminate kulaks, as rich independent peasants were called.
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin was not a dissident. He was a member of the Secretariat
of the Soviet Writers Union. But in a eulogy televised on Wednesday
night, Solzhenitsyn called him a very brave, very courageous
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see this especially in the case of that stupid,
absurd and idiotic project to turn around Russia's northern and
Siberian rivers,'' Solzhenitsyn said. ``He was one of those main
participants in this movement. The great part of its success was
thanks to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalygin resigned from Novy Mir at the peak of his influence.
According to friends, he was already ill, but he was also intent on
devoting himself to his own writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote until the last weeks of his life,'' Solzhenitsyn
said. ``His hand almost could not hold a pen. His prose of the last
years had a deep philosophical character. Of course, his death was
not unexpected. He had already said goodbye, and I did not argue
with him. ''

ERNST KNOBIL, 73, WHO HELPED TO TREAT INFERTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mass., Pa., Wis., Maine, N.C.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Ernst Knobil, a physiologist whose studies of the hormonal
system led to a better understanding of the female reproductive
function and improved treatment of infertility, died on April 13 in
Houston at the Texas Medical Center. He was 73 and lived in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said an official of the
University of Texas Health Science Center, where Knobil was a
professor of physiology.
</P>
<P>
   From 1981 to 1997 he also directed the neuroendocrinology
laboratory at the center. The field involves subtle interactions
between the central nervous system and the hormone-secreting
endocrine glands.
</P>
<P>
   Knobil (pronounced no-BEEL) spent five decades unraveling the
mysteries of that relationship, hard to grasp but vital to bodily
health. One of his major discoveries was finding in the brain's
gray matter a hormone that regulates reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery enriched medical knowledge of the 28-day ovulatory
menstrual cycle. Once synthesized, the hormone helped many women to
become pregnant and achieved a better than 90 percent success rate
for a common type of infertility, the University of Texas said.
</P>
<P>
   Knobil also cleared up questions about growth hormones. His
research made possible the treatment of pituitary dwarfs who suffer
from a deficiency in the hormone that controls body growth and is
secreted by the pituitary gland.
</P>
<P>
   He was the co-editor of a four-volume ``Encyclopedia of
Reproduction'' and a two-volume ``Physiology of Reproduction,''
both of which remain in print. He also helped edit issues of the
Annual Review of Physiology.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Knobil was chairman of a National Research Council
panel that studied the health effects of hormonally active
contaminants, or chemicals that mimic sex hormones. The study
concluded that not enough was known for it to be possible to say
whether they posed health problems. The finding continues to be
debated by scientists, policy-makers and public advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Knobil was born in Berlin and grew up in Paris until 1940,
when his parents brought him to the United States. He served two
years in the Army before graduating from Cornell with a degree in
animal science in 1948. He received a doctorate in zoology in 1951,
also from Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted his early research at Cornell and Harvard Medical
School, where he also taught. Knobil joined the Harvard faculty in
1953 and quickly rose through the academic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 he became the founding chairman of the department of
physiology at the University of Pittsburgh. From then until his
move to the University of Texas in 1981, he helped develop the
department's widely respected programs, and founded and directed a
reproduction research center.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Knobil was dean of the medical school in the early
1980s. After his tenure as dean he remained active in the classroom
and laboratory until shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and
the National Academy of Sciences, and was a past president of the
American Physiological Society, the Endocrine Society and the
International Society of Endocrinology.
</P>
<P>
   Knobil is survived by his wife of 40 years, Dr. Julane Hotchkiss
Knobil; three sons, Erich of Menominee Falls, Wis., Mark of
Pittsburgh, and Nicholas of Bowdoinham, Maine; a daughter, Dr.
Katharine Shelly of Raleigh, N.C.; and three grandchildren.

RANGERS EYE SATHER FOR THE FRONT OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
  By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been a silent spring at Madison Square Garden
regarding the vacancies in the New York Rangers' hierarchy, while
Garden President Dave Checketts methodically undertakes his search
for a new general manager. That scenario could change as soon as
Friday night, if the Dallas Stars wrap up their first-round series
against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Oilers are eliminated from the NHL playoffs, their
longtime team president and general manager, Glen Sather, can be
wooed. Even though Sather has two seasons remaining on his
contract, he also has an escape clause. According to several people
in hockey, the Rangers are interested in Sather as a replacement
for Neil Smith, who was fired on March 28 along with John Muckler,
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the playoffs began, Sather said he was not going
anywhere. But in a telephone conversation Wednesday night, Sather
did not rule out the possibility of a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'm flattered that people mention my name when jobs
open up around the league,'' the 56-year-old Sather said from
Dallas. ``I'm really not in a position to make any comments about
that. I haven't given it one second of thought. As far as what I'm
going to do, I haven't made any public statements about it. When
the time comes, I'll deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the Garden interested in Sather, but also, according
to one person in hockey with knowledge of the situation,
``whoever's second is a distant second.'' Because of Sather's
escape clause, the Rangers will not have to ask for permission to
speak with him. That is something they would have to do with
Pittsburgh if they pursue the Penguins' general manager, Craig
Patrick, who is also believed to be on the Rangers' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the proper protocol,'' Sather said. ``But I, on the
other hand, have a loophole that I wrote into my contract that says
that I will be able to do this should I decide to leave Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   One longtime league executive said earlier this week that both
Wayne Gretzky, who played for Sather in Edmonton in the 1980s, and
Commissioner Gary Bettman have encouraged the Rangers to pursue
Sather.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rumor is not correct,'' Bettman said Thursday. ``I don't
do that. It's up to the teams to decide. I don't get involved in
personnel decisions.'' But it is no secret that Bettman and others
hold Sather in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   Sather played for 10 NHL seasons as a left wing for six teams,
including the Rangers from 1970 to 1973. He became the Oilers'
coach in 1977, when they were a part of the World Hockey
Association. Three seasons later, Sather became the team's general
manager and was the architect of the Oilers' dynasty in the '80s,
when the franchise won four Stanley Cups in five seasons (plus a
fifth without Gretzky in 1990).
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers have not advanced past the second round of the
playoffs since 1992, but the Rangers have failed to qualify for the
playoffs in the last three seasons. And there are many league
executives who believe that Sather will allow himself to be wooed
by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But many are also skeptical about the Rangers' chances of
actually persuading him to leave Edmonton. Sather has been there
for 24 years, the last 21 as general manager. That gives him the
second-longest tenure as a general manager in the NHL behind
Boston's Harry Sinden. Sather has long said he is comfortable in
the West. He owns houses in both Palm Springs, Calif., and Banff,
Alberta, and enjoys outdoor life.
</P>
<P>
   Sather's current contract calls for him to be paid just under $2
million in each of the next two seasons. One thing in the Rangers'
favor is their ability to pay him significantly more. &QL;

MIDDLE-AGED FATHER LINKED BY DNA TO AT LEAST 12 SLAYINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEWIS KAMB and SAM SKOLNIK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE _ As the man suspected of killing as many as 18 women
sat in a downtown prison cell, investigators fielded calls from
other detectives who are trying to solve similar slayings across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from as far away as Alabama, New York and even
Germany are wondering whether Robert Lee Yates Jr. _ described by
authorites as a ``family man,'' could be the same person who killed
women.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, detectives dug deeper into an investigation they now
say could take two or more years and millions of dollars to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a busy, but good day,'' Spokane COunty Sheriff Mark Sherk
said Thursday. ``Detectives are relieved we've finally made an
arrest, but the immensity of the task ahead of them is starting to
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives fielded dozens of calls with tips from people who
knew Yates or others passing along information they believed could
be helpful, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratories here and across the state and nation buzzed as
criminologists analyzed crime scene and other evidence generated
since Yates' arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators seized another vehicle _ a van located in Idaho _
they say is one of nine automobiles Yates owned or had been known
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And detectives here and in Western Washington worked with
federal agents to piece together a timeline of Yates' whereabouts
over the past decade trying to place him in areas when and where
bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty confident once we get a timeline, it will all
correspond,''terk said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say DNA evidence links Yates to the deaths of at
least 12 of 18 victims _ women mostly caught in at-risk lives of
drugs and prostitution Evidence may also tie him to all of the
cases, they say.
</P>
<P>
   All of the women were shot. Investigators said Thursday they
have not recovered a firearm in the case, though Sherk said a bomb
sniffing dog that ATF agents from Miami led through Yates' home on
Tuesday hit at least ``six alerts'' _ areas where guns or bullets
may have been kept in the house at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from Yates links him directly to genetic material
the killer left where eight bodies were dumped _ though
investigators would not say what that crime scene material is. Four
other victims investigators say positively link to Yates were also
linked through DNA and other evidence. But again, they would not
disclose how.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, relatives of all 18 victims had been contacted by
investigators. Detectives have not released the names of the 12
directly linked to their suspect, who has yet to be charged in 11
of those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, 47, was charged Wednesday with the first-degree murder of
16-year-old Jennifer Johnson, a wayward youth from Spanaway who
sold sex on Spokane streets up until her disappearance in August
1997. Her decomposing remains were found later that month dumped in
off a roadside in rural Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to link Johnson's death this week to
Yates, an Army vet and father of five who worked at a Mead aluminum
smelter, through blood and other evidence found in a car he once
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic evidence, a button identical to one missing from a
jacket found on Johnson's corpse, and other evidence obtained from
a 1977 white Corvette Yates owned between 1994 and 1998 tied him to
her killing, leading investigators here to arrest him in north
Spokane early Tuesday while Yates drove to work.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from him shortly after his arrest has since
identified Yates as the serial killer of at least 12 women _ and
possibly up to 18 _ across Washington, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the guy we were looking for,'' Sterk said. ``He's
finally behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates sat Thursday in a 8 by 9 foot prison cell in the Public
Safety Building in lieu of $1.5 million cash bail. Prison guards
surveyed him under a suicide-type watch _ checking him every 15
minutes _ though investigators say he has not threatened to harm
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He remains isolated from the general prison population, said
Jail Commander Sheriff's Capt. Dick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Though the murder charge against him has been formally read at a
preliminary hearing, prosecutors have yet to formally file the
charges. They have until Friday morning to do that. After an
arrest, prosecuting attorneys have 72 hours by law to file such
charges or they must release their suspect, court officials said
Thursday. An arraignment will be scheduled once those files are
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Though court officials said Yates has applied for a court
appointed attorney, they would not disclose whether one has yet
been assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   While detectives worked locally to tie him to all 18 murders in
the state, calls began flowing in from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since authorities began investigating the murders, the serial
killer here has been looked at as a person of interest in several
other slayings, including one in Germany, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army helicopter pilot and reservist now in custody moved
with his family across the county over the years. Yates has lived
in New York, Alabama and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Now authorities in some of those areas are looking into whether
Yates alleged killing spree may have started long before he moved
to Washington state
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joseph Goss of the Watertown, N.Y., Police Department says
his detectives are now actively investigating whether that small
city's one unsolved homicide is tied to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hosmer Smith was shot and killed at 4 a.m. august first
1990 on a street just behing Watertown police headquarters. Smith,
an unemployed 20-year-old, was estranged from her husband at the
time. Goss said the husband had a strong alibi and quickly ruled
out as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was not involved in drugs and prostitution, according to
the police file, Goss said. but it's possible that the perpetrator
might have thought that, walking alone on a downtown street at 4
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goss says that Watertown police have called spokane
detectives to inquire about a possible connection to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few fundamental questions outstanding however. it is
unclear whether Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, just outside
Watertown, at the time. Yates first was stationed at Ft. Drum in
late 1990 or early 1991 according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a case we would like to compare notes on,'' said Goss,
``Is there a link? it's to early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a much firmer connection between Yates and
Connie LaFontaine the Tacoma woman found dead on Oct. 13, 1998.
Police have connected LaFontaine, a prostitute, to the serial
murders from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, retired from the army and moved to spokane in 1996. Soon
after, he joined the Washington Army National Guard for the last
three years, one weekend a month, he flew to Ft. Lewis 12 miles
outside of Tacoma to teach helicopter flying lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Dave Hall of the pierce co. sheriff's
department, La Fontaine and Yates seem to be solidly linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say that from what we know so far, it looks very
promising,'' hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yates' arrest, Pierce County sheriff investigators have
been coordinating with Spokane police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Pierce County detectives are concentration on where
Yates might have stayed in the county; what kind of car he may have
been driving at the time; and where he may have flown in her
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about the connections between Yates and Melinda
Mercer, a Tacoma area woman found dead in december 1997. She was
also thought to be the serial killer's victim.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mathis, a spokesman for the Spokane police Department which
is handling the investigation, could not be reached for comment.
Police investigating another the third western Washington woman
connected to the Spokane serial murderer are not yet ready to make
the tie to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Barnes, whose body was discovered in 1995, has hereto
for haas only been listed as a possible victim of the murder. She
was from Port Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsap county sheriff's office chief of detectives Mike Davis
says his office has been communicating with counterparts in Spokane
regularly 'to try to establish a firmer connection between the
Barnes homicide and they're serial murderer.'
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is not as optimistic as his pierce county counterpart
regarding a connection to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's still premature to advise that we've
reached the conclusion that she is indeed a victim of the
particular man they've arrested over there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, an investigator revealed Thursday they got an
unlikely break in the Corvette that helped bring Yates to custody.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Jones, the woman who bought the Corvette from Yates in
1998, is the sister of a woman who works in the Spokane city-county
joint property room. Everything from confiscated pot pipes to
recovered stolen articles is kept there, Detective Cal Walker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After she bought the car, Jones stored it in her sister's garage
for months, leaving crucial evidence that helped link Yates to
Johnson's murder undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no type of cleaning to contaminate the evidence,''
said Walker, who added that the blood, carpet fibers and button
found in the car broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to arrest Yates for Johsnon's murder
largely on that evidence alone. They then were able to draw the
blood that his linked him to 11 other victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Corvette basically has been put to bed,'' Walker said of
the importance of it to the case. ``It probably won't come out
again til court.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators showed media members five other cars they have
confinscated since Yates arrest. Among them, two blue Hondas, two
Ford vans and a Ford pick up that still has a vehicle registration
sticker to Ft. Drum, Ny York from 1993 on its bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also allowed media passed police barricades to
view Yates' South Hill split-level home that hs been shrouded by
tarps since his arrest for the first time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three tripods sat in the home's front and side yards, holding up
sophisticated equipment provided by the Washington State Patrol
that will create a three-dimension map of the scene. A white flag
could be seen in a wood pile next to at least two sheds visible in
the home's yard marking a place of interest to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The house was typical of the split levels that line East 49th
Avenue. Well kept and landscaped, it had flowers shrubbery, a
blossoming cherry tree and evergreens surrounding it. A basketball
hoop hung on the side of a garage.

MATTHAEUS LEAVES METROSTARS DAZED AND CONFUSED
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION, N.J. _ After enduring what might be the most trying month
of his illustrious career, Lothar Matthaeus is scheduled to board a
flight to Germany shortly after the MetroStars play D.C. United on
Saturday night, with the renowned sweeper going to his homeland to
play in an exhibition game with the German national team.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus is expected to return to the United States before
missing the next MetroStars game. But it is not out of place to ask
three questions, all related: Does he want to come back? Can the
MetroStars make him come back? Does the team really want him to
come back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't come
back, and I wouldn't blame him for not coming back,'' goalkeeper
Mike Ammann said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Following a tirade during a 2-1 loss to the Kansas City Wizards
on Wednesday night, Matthaeus met with MetroStars coach Octavio
Zambrano and the team's general manager, Nick Sakiewicz, after
Thursday's practice. On Saturday night in a 1-0 loss to Columbus,
Matthaeus criticized his teammates. Then on Wednesday night, he
argued with the assistant referee Chip Reed, tossing his captain's
arm band at the official and then repeatedly trying to hand it to
him while play continued on the other end of the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting Thursday, Matthaeus explained the most recent
outburst as an attempt to provoke a reaction from his teammates.
While the team accepted the explanation and did not impose a
penalty, the MetroStars also expressed little patience for a repeat
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him that there is no room for that, that it is not
going to fly here,'' Zambrano said. ``I don't endorse it.'' ``If he
genuinely believed that he was trying to wake up the guys, then
what can I say? I can't punish him for that. But he has been warned
that that is not to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus said he did not feel better Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a good feeling after losing games, directly after
the games or the day after, I don't like to lose,'' said Matthaeus,
who has a one-year contract with the team. ``I have no problem with
Octavio or Nick. I speak open, and I think they can understand me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played professional soccer for 20 years, and I have
played on good teams and not-so good-teams,'' Matthaeus said. ``I
know the level is not the same in the Italian League or the Spanish
League as in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I see these guys play good in the practice, and we don't
do that in the game. I don't understand that. I am frustrated
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Wednesday's game, when asked if he would stay, he
said: ``I don't know. After five weeks, it's not a good time for
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in the next weeks, there will be better results,''
Matthaeus said. ``I have my contract here. I will stay in New York
for this season, and it changes a little bit, I can make the
season. For me, it is no problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Zambrano left the door open that the defender might not fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `yes,' right now because I don't think he's a guy that
would walk away from his obligations as a player,'' Zambrano said.
``The only thing that would prevent him from finishing the
situation here would be some outrageous situation that just can't
be tolerated or something of that nature. If he does the same thing
again, I think the nature of our meeting would be of a different
sort.'' &QL;

IDENTITY THIEVES AIMED HIGH IN THEIR FRAUD, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ark., Miss)  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most identity thieves raid the accounts of ordinary
citizens. But big shots have bigger credit limits, and James
Rinaldo Jackson and Derek Cunningham went after some of the
biggest, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   According to an indictment returned Thursday by a federal grand
jury in Manhattan, the two men used credit card and bank account
information stolen from the chief operating officer of Coca-Cola
Enterprises, the chief executive of Hilton Hotels and the late
president of Wendy's International, among others, to acquire more
than $730,000 worth of diamonds and Rolex watches.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 39, and Cunningham, 28, were each charged with 29
counts of conspiracy and fraud for crimes committed between late
December and late February, the U.S. attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who live in Memphis, would obtain prospective
victims' financial data, and, impersonating them, change the
billing addresses for their accounts to hotels in Tennessee,
Arkansas and Mississippi, the indictment states.
</P>
<P>
   Then they would contact jewelers and buy expensive items, like a
five-carat diamond or a $10,000 watch, order them to be shipped to
one of the hotel's addresses, reserve hotel rooms in the names of
their victims, and tell the hotel to expect a package, the
indictment states.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was arrested Feb. 25 after FBI agents watched him pick
up a package at a Tennessee hotel. Cunningham is not yet in
custody, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, one of the men posed as Stephen Bollenbach, the
chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels, called the issuer of his
Visa card on Feb. 22 and changed his billing address to a hotel in
Holly Springs, Miss., according to court records. The next day,
someone ordered two diamonds costing a total of $48,000 in
Bollenbach's name from Diamondcutters.com, a New York City
merchant, and had them shipped to the hotel, court documents state.
</P>
<P>
   The men's deceased victims included Nackey Scripps Loeb, the
publisher of The Union Leader, who died in January, and Gordon
Teter, the president of Wendy's International Inc., who died in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office released the names of some of the
other victims but identified others only by their titles. The chief
operating officer of Coca-Cola Enterprises is John R. Alm, and
Lehman's chairman and chief executive is Richard Fuld. If
convicted, Jackson and Cunningham would face the possibility of
more than 40 years in jail and fines of more than $1 million.

BAKER THE DIFFERENCE IN SERIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He came here full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   After Seattle watched Shawn Kemp grow moody and distant and
demand his divorce, Vin Baker was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in our collective memory, there's an image from his
inaugural season in 1997-98 of Baker running back down the court
after making a big move against Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is pumping his fist.
</P>
<P>
   His intensity and passion and desire were vivid as Kodachrome.
His happiness and sense of hope infused the team with a sort of
refreshed innocence.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. He played. It was all new and unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were bouncy and joyful, too. Instead of being
derailed by losing such a warhorse as Kemp, they kept in step with
their new 6-foot-11 power forward whose talent was ready to be
tapped.
</P>
<P>
   He was at last out of Milwaukee, freed from a team he believed
was holding him back, a team on which Baker had never made a
playoff appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, traded to Seattle, Baker was a main cog in a team that
a contender in '96 and was looking to use Baker and Gary Payton as
the one-two punch toward a new round of NBA title contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics won the Pacific Division. They went 61-21. They had a
party in the visitors' locker room in Portland, where they wrapped
up the regular season with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was time for the 1998 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And then Vin Baker found out what it's like to play basketball
in the NBA's real season.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That season was fun,'' Baker said Thursday, a smile actually
stretching across a face that has spent too much time lately in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great for us but I've said all along it's ironic
because ... within two weeks in the playoffs, that season went down
the drain,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker took responsibility for what happened. He decided his
inconsistent play was the main reason the Sonics did so poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I think I didn't play well in those two playoff
series we had against Minnesota and the Lakers because I did put
too much pressure on myself. I pressed too much,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Vin Baker has never really recovered from that
public exposure of his lack of playoff experience, his
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can observe (the playoffs) but until you're in the middle
of it, you just don't know,'' Sonics' president Wally Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Vin after that first year, when he talked about the
playoffs, he said `I know I've seen it on television but I just
didn't know what it's about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sonics, who barred the media from asking Baker or
Payton anything about Baker's recent disclosure that he is battling
depression, we won't delve into the problems Baker has had this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be said that Baker's inconsistency seems to be a
continuation of what happened during the '98 playoffs and last
season's 50-game nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   This season, as Baker again fell into a prolonged slump, Baker's
most startling admission was that the way he plays is the
difference between the Sonics being a No. 3 seed or a No. 7 seed in
the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He said it again when he admitted his erratic play probably cost
the Sonics 10 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   He understands that if Payton is the Sonics' MVP, then he has
been its MIA.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of his downfall has taken him out of the
starting line-up as of last week and, more critical, is the biggest
underlying question about the Sonics and their future:
</P>
<P>
   Can Baker consistently be the force of which he has shown only
hints?
</P>
<P>
   Can he be the difference between winning and losing?
</P>
<P>
   Can he shake the inclination to internalize his problems and
instead, use his anger or frustration to fuel fire towards a better
performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out and be wild and crazy in this. In my
situation, I don't think things can get any worse,'' he said, again
showing some humor.
</P>
<P>
   If there ever was a perfect time for Baker to shrug off his
demons and dust off his critics, it is now. Saturday is Game 1 of
the Sonics first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   A younger, aggressive and hungry Sonics team has a good shot
against the Jazz, if the team isn't mired in a funk and rotation
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday against Sacramento in the Sonics' paydirt game of the
season, Baker showed signs of being on track. He came off the bench
and contributed to the Sonics' spirited win, first with some
rebounds and defense and eventually, with scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week or so has been better. The other night in
Sacramento was a great game. I don't know how long it's been since
I felt as good as I did after the Sacramento game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to believe he is poised to turn this thing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a great situation. I realize how important these
playoffs are and what you come out of a playoff looking like. I'm
in an ironic situation. Things didn't go well in the regular
season, but being as optimistic as I am, I think I have a great
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He came here full of promise. He came here to play in the
playoffs. Now is the time for Vin Baker.

 &HT;     THE YOUNG AND THE RELENTLESS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is often said what does not obliterate you, will
make you stronger.
</P>
<P>
   So Paul Westphal is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it looked like a time to stick a fork in the
Sonics. But Westphal opted for a paring knife of sorts. The Sonics
coach carved out of the starting lineup despondent power forward
Vin Baker, along with shooting guard Brent Barry and small forward
Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal boldly inserted little-used Cuban forward Lazaro
Borrell and spare guard Shammond Williams. He also promoted backup
forward Rashard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call the changes an act of desperation. More
appropriately, they moves amounted to a calculated gamble that
effectively earned the Sonics a Lucky 7 _ as in the seventh seed of
the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, never in recent history has a team guaranteed a playoff
berth overhauled three-fifths of its starting lineup with five
regular-season games left.
</P>
<P>
   Now begs the question: Will the adjustments hold up in the
life-and-death arena that is the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The timing of it all initially hurt some like rubbing alcohol on
an open wound. But no one is openly upset. No one is struggling.
The only evidence in four legitimate games is that Westphal's
re-vamped lineup has value.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Sonics appear more hearty by the moves, but
their metamorphose from a stagnant team to one that is dangerously
unpredictable could create a respectable edge against the Utah Jazz
in a first-round playoff series, which begins Saturday in the Delta
Center.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what the Sonics are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a different look than we've had, and it gives a
lot of different players to have a good game,'' Westphal said. ``We
can see who is having a good game and make adjustments from
strength with guys that are experienced coming in off the bench. We
can play a lot of different styles, and I think we're a harder team
to prepare for. We certainly have a lot more quickness, and
quickness is hard to counteract.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has been noncommittal on whether he plans to revert to
the team's original starting five. It is possible that Baker, who
has played with confidence in three of the past four games, could
re-join the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lineup the Sonics field likely won't be known until
they step onto the floor for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, difficult to argue with results.
</P>
<P>
   Before Westphal stirred the pot for an April 12 home game
against Minnesota, the Sonics had lost nine of their previous 11
games. Included in that stretch was a five-game losing streak at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the team's downfall seem to coincide with Baker's
struggles. Barry lost his rhythm along the way, too. However, Baker
had grabbed 10 or more rebounds in just one game from Jan. 26 to
March 29. The Sonics went 12-15 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   As the team fell further under a lethargic trance, losing
streaks became normal for the once-surprising Sonics. While making
the playoffs was never in doubt, they found themselves trying to
climb out of the eighth seed, and a quick exit scenario against the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record was 3-2 with the lineup changes, a mark
skewed by a season-finale loss to the L.A. Clippers on Wednesday
when the regulars played sparingly. Aside from a 117-103 loss at
Dallas, the newlook Sonics have been fresh, energetic, quick and
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lineup we had wasn't really working so change was
forthcoming,'' center Horace Grant said. ``(Westphal) didn't have
to explain anything to us. He's the coach. But those young guys are
giving us a spark. We're winning so why not keep rolling with it? I
wouldn't change a thing. We have a chance to run the ball up and
down the court more than we have all season.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, is how the Sonics expect to beat an aging and
less athletic Jazz team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well with this lineup,'' said Baker, who is still
hoping to reclaim his starting spot. ``Those guys give us a lot of
great energy, and obviously with me coming off the bench, it will
be a different look for (Utah). ...Those guys are learning fast and
enthusiastic on the floor. Myself, Ruben and Brent have been
starters all season, but the changes gives us a chance to get in
with the flow of the game. That's an advantage for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages for the Sonics with Lewis, Williams, Borrell,
Grant and Gary Payton starting are three-fold.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, at 6-foot-1, is lightning quick and able to handle the
ball. That allows Payton to operate without the responsibility of
creating shots for others. Payton can instead run off screens and
attack the basket. And whenever Payton draws double teams, Williams
is adept enough to sink open jump shots or take his man off the
dribble and get shot attempts in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup modifications has induced Payton to play the last
week with renewed energy, although the all-star guard seemed
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's been effective,'' Payton said. ``I just
know we're winning basketball games. We started a new lineup, OK.
You think about who has been coming in to play more of the minutes.
It's been Vin Baker and (Patterson and Barry) playing the most
minutes. It doesn't make a difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use Lewis centers mostly on his skill level at
6-foot-10. The 20-year-old can handle the ball and create a
mismatch in the post against most small forwards guarding him.
Lewis' shooting range extends to the three-point arc, and he has
the ability to blow past defenders and explode to the basket for a
dunk or layup in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can outquick them and try to get off to a fast start. Youth
is going to be one thing. But we know we're going to have to rely
on experience because Utah is an experienced team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' leaping ability and enthusiasm makes him a chore for
anyone to contain on the boards. He works hard to grab offensive
and defensive rebounds. The coaching staff is captivated by the
versatility and confidence Lewis displays from game to game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing addition by subtraction was Borrell.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics originally signed the 6-foot-8 forward with an intent
to use him next season. Conventional wisdom suggested that Borrell
needed this season learn English, adjust to the NBA game and life
without his family following his defection.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Sonics learned from Day One in training camp was
that Borrell appeared undaunted about those life changes. He
performed consistently well in practices, using his instincts and
natural feel for the game to establish himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is a crafty defender who does not get burn easily. Although
Borrell is not a serious outside shooting threat, he can score in
the post and take a defender off the dribble. Borrell's most
impressive attribute is his heart. He plays with confidence all the
time and does not appear awe-struck by the NBA arenas and superstar
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any difference to him. He was living in a
shack a year ago,'' Westphal said of Borrell, who defected from
Cuba last season then joined the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Still wondering where Borrell came from and how can the Sonics
afford to rely on him?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on Borrell is that he is a seasoned basketball
player. His experience ranges from playing for Cuba in the Olympic
Qualifying tournament last summer to two stints in the Argentina
Basketball League where he averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds
against international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Sonics keep a plus/minus chart of every player. It is
an evaluation that tells coaches how the score fluctuates when that
player is on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five games Lazaro's plus/minus is better than anyone
we have,'' Westphal said. ``I like that. (The new lineup) gives us
a little bit of unpredictability.''
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of playing essentially two rookies (Borrell and
Williams) and Lewis (a second-year player) is that they have no
playoff experience. How they might react is part of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you can't predict these guys,'' assistant coach Nate
McMillan said. ``But these guys do an excellent job of moving
without the ball. They do an excellent job of defending and
covering for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bold move, but everybody was supportive. We needed a
change. Us being unpredictable is something (Utah) has to be
concerned about. Who do you put your center on? Who do you put
(Karl) Malone on? Are they going to all of a sudden become a
trapping team? Are they going to try and run? They don't kn ow what
we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in itself, brings out another positive aspect of the
lineup shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Sonics' young players not respond well, the team can
quickly go to Baker, Patterson or Barry for an early save. In
effect, Westphal, whose rotations have been capricious until now,
has manufactured a sturdy bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of the season, if you don't have a bench, you
don't win. It's just as simple as that,'' said McMillan, who once
was a Sonic starter before Payton's arrival. ``Your starters are
starters, but your bench players are just as important. Both of
those groups are equal. Whoever plays well in the first half
between those 8 to 10 players will finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some new young talent. We've got new life and no one
knows what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the playoffs, even if it appears the Sonics are
well done.

HOME RUN BY MORA WARMS COLD SHEA
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Melvin Mora dropped his bat and acted as if he had
just hit a single. He motored to first base while keeping his eyes
focused on center field, watching his booming shot off Curtis
Leskanic sail higher and higher. Could it go? Would it go?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it could. Yes, it did.
</P>
<P>
   Mora's first regular-season homer in the major leagues gave the
New York Mets a 5-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in 10
innings at Shea Stadium Thursday night. He finally started trotting
when he got past first base. A swarm of Mets waited for him at home
plate. The postseason hero was suddenly a hero in April, too.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lifeless feeling at Shea before the game even
started. The upper deck was completely empty, the mezzanine was
mostly empty and the fans were mostly chilly. Al Leiter could have
changed this dull atmosphere with a nifty outing, but he failed to
enhance it because he was constantly in danger and was simply
trying to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets survived in a game in which they trailed by 4-1, and
finally they thrived because Mora, who went into the game in the
top of the 10th, crushed Leskanic's 95 mph fastball. The homer
caromed off the television camera stands beyond the center-field
wall, a 417-foot shot that was not as momentous as his homer
against Atlanta in his first National League Championship Series
at-bat last October. But Mora was smiling as if this one was
momentous, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is big,'' Mora said. ``I like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Mora faced Leskanic, Edgardo Alfonzo told him that
Leskanic throws a powerful fastball, a nasty slider and a cut
fastball. As Mora strode to the plate, he said later, ``I wanted to
jump on the fastball,'' which he did.
</P>
<P>
   It helped the Mets sweep a three-game series, beat the Brewers
for the eighth straight time and win for the sixth time in their
last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him hit like that in BP,'' said Derek Bell,
referring to batting practice. ``He got a hold of one and I was
like, `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Leiter struggled all evening while allowing four earned
runs on eight hits and three walks, this would have been a
difficult game for the Mets to lose. The Brewers are more hapless
than pesky and they look like the junior varsity trying to play the
varsity. When Charlie Hayes, who had a homer among his three hits,
is the cleanup batter, the team is not exactly fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Woodard, who has not won a game since July 16, 1999,
squelched the Mets, except for Mike Piazza's monstrous
second-inning homer, through the first six innings. Bell homered to
begin the seventh, and a single and a walk ended Woodard's night.
Todd Zeile hit a run-scoring single off David Weathers and the
Mets' fourth run scored on Jeromy Burnitz's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had trouble navigating through the first inning last
season and searched for remedies to solve this problem. The problem
emerged again Thursday night as the Brewers quickly put him in a
1-0 hole. Marquis Grissom doubled and later scored on Burnitz's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza helped the Mets tie the score as he blasted a 438-foot
homer over the picnic area in left field off Woodard. It was
Piazza's 17th hit in his last 33 at-bats, and it was the most
majestic one.
</P>
<P>
   But James Mouton hit a broken-bat two-run homer off Leiter in
the third, and Hayes poked a homer in the fifth to push the
Milwaukee lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Three Mets relievers helped tame the Brewers after that, as Bell
keyed a three-run rally in the seventh and then Mora played the
hero in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is obviously new at this. After a television interview on
the field, a fan threw a T-shirt that hit him in the face. Mora
stopped, picked the shirt up, signed it and politely returned it to
the fan.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? It had been a good night for the utility player with a
penchant for heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to play every day,'' Mora said. ``I'm the kind of
player who likes to play every day. Now I'm going to continue to do
this because this is how they want me to help.'' &QL;

   COLOMBIA-COCAINE (Montclart, Colombia) _ New York Times Special
Report: Nearly half the world's supply of cocaine comes from within
150 miles of this isolated Colombian military outpost on the
Putumayo River. So when Lt. German Arenas and his anti-drug troops
recently set out by boat, they knew finding a target would be the
easy part. Four hours later, his squadron of young marines stopped
and marched into the equatorial wilderness, guns at the ready. By
nightfall, they had found three crude cocaine-processing
laboratories in the open jungle, more than 6,000 seedlings of a
new, more potent variety of coca plant, a half-dozen large fields
brimming with ripening coca bushes and four hapless peasants. But
after they destroyed as much as they could, arrested the peasants
and headed back downriver, the soldiers left behind at least
another 200 labs hidden in the dense, trackless jungle and
thousands more acres of coca plants, visible from the air
everywhere across southern Colombia. By Larry Rohter.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BACK when, Ray McCallum was named the best little man in college
basketball his senior year at Ball State. And word is that, at 39,
he can still dunk a basketball, although he's no taller _ 5-10 _
than your average sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, he couldn't handle Clyde Drexler one on one. If coaches
got to play, too, the University of Houston would have taken a huge
step backward Thursday. Of course, if coaches got to play, Drexler
wouldn't have lost 39 games over his ill-fated two-season trial at
the Cougars' helm and UH probably wouldn't be bringing in McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, folks. Clyde's spirit might have been willing early on,
but his flesh was never into it. He didn't need the money, and he
found out he didn't need the long hours. But McCallum was never on
the NBA superstar/Hall of Fame track. His short-guy work ethic,
essentially the same gene that turned Napoleon into an emperor,
would be channeled into X's and O's early on. This crazy racket is
McCallum's life.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been a good life. He posted a better record at Ball
State than Rick Majerus had a number of years before him there,
despite having inherited three years of NCAA probation from his
predecessor, Dick Hunsaker. McCallum went 84-15 at home while
averaging 18 victories per season and posting the best winning
percentage (.624) over the first seven seasons of any coach in
league play in the Mid-American Conference's 53-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Another stat: He was 44-0 when the Cardinals held their
opponents under 60 points. Note: His teams get in your face.
</P>
<P>
   So, by any measure except uber-celebrity status, the change
appears to represent tremendous progress, never mind that Ray is as
much an outsider as Clyde was family and as unknown locally as
Drexler was an icon. McCallum is a real coach who eats, sleeps and
breathes the profession. If he can do at UH what he did at Ball
State _ in a word, win _ he won't be an outsider, or unknown, for
long.
</P>
<P>
   OK, should he succeed, can the Cougars keep him? Good question.
But they'll worry about that when the time comes. As athletic
director Chet Gladchuk noted, after saying all the right, polite
things about the residue of the, ahem, Drexler era: ``Winning would
fit nicely into our equation.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Ray's closet is full of red accessories. He doesn't
have to go shopping. He can start recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always recruiting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no alternative, really, as Drexler found out the hard
way.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's first priority is to ``recruit'' the kids Drexler
left him, especially super-freshman George Williams, selling them
on how much fun his program _ a run-the-floor-offense combined with
a squeeze-the-blood-out-of-you defense _ is going to be. Second, he
needs to convince the incoming studs, Alton Ford and Patrick
Okafor, that UH is still the place for them to further their
education. And, third, he needs to make every high school coach
within a 50-mile radius of Hofheinz Pavilion his new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   If selling real estate is location, location, location, coaching
college basketball is talent, talent, talent. And local talent is
the best kind. McCallum can well appreciate same, having grown up
in Muncie, Ind., not far from Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler had a significant natural ``in'' on name recognition
alone, and his assistants, Reid Gettys and George Walker, were
familiar faces around town as well. For that reason, some of you
die-hard Cougars types probably believe Gettys would have been a
smarter hire than McCallum because of his longstanding ties to the
community.
</P>
<P>
   But Reid, a practicing lawyer until Drexler dragged him back to
UH, wasn't any more ready to inherit the head coaching reins than
Clyde had been, and he didn't have Clyde's cachet to boot. In
another year, assuming the Drexler regime finally had enjoyed a
semblance of success on the court, promoting Gettys might have made
sense. It simply didn't under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Walker, on the other hand, seems an option McCallum
needs to consider, although coaches tend to favor assistants they
know. Ray's top aide, John Fitzpatrick, will be a candidate to
replace him at Ball State, though, so perhaps a spot will open up
for George.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick and another Ball assistant, Jerry Francis, were in
town Thursday, and they hit Texas running. While McCallum was
handling the all-important ceremonial duties of his hiring, meeting
the administration and the media and glad-handing the alumni, the
two of them charged out to Baytown's Lee College to attempt to
ingratiate themselves with Okafor, said to be upset that Gettys had
been snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum's stated mission is to restore the Cougars to their
former Phi Slama Jama glory. He must make sure no would-be Clydes
in Houston are permitted to glide elsewhere. &QL;

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
April is not the time to start tossing around phrases like
``must-win game,'' but the Astros needed Wednesday's victory over
the Los Angeles Dodgers the way Mark Chmura needs a good attorney.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 14 games into the season, the jury is out on how good the
Astros are, but the first two weeks of the season have offered some
reasons to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Astros salvaged the road trip to San Diego and
Los Angeles with a 2-3 record is encouraging, considering their
overall play.
</P>
<P>
   But certain trends will have to be reversed if they are to win
the National League Central Division title for a fourth time. For
all the talk about the increased offense throughout baseball over
the past few years, pitching is still the key ingredient to a
winning ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than the Astros, who ranked among the
top three NL teams in ERA in each of their championship seasons.
Their current 5.61 ERA is the highest in the NL and a main reason
they have lost eight of their first 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so much success over the past two years that we
expect to be over .500 and winning ballgames,'' first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``We were 42 games over .500 in 1998 and 32 games
over .500 last year. We don't expect to be under .500, so we have
to turn this thing around now.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, hitter-friendly Enron Field is somewhat responsible for
the inflated ERA, but the pitching hasn't exactly been airtight on
the road, where the Astros have allowed opponents a .307 batting
average and compiled a 5.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are hitting .274 at Enron Field, where the Astros have
a 5.83 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching has been very inconsistent, and the bullpen has
been disappointing,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We
have some young and inexperienced guys in our rotation, and that
creates more uncertainty, but I think the rotation is going to be
OK and I think the bullpen is going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pitching as well as we can pitch, but we have to get
better overall. It's not just one area of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense, which is supposed to be the strength of the team,
has been equally weak. Through Wednesday's games, the Astros' .236
team batting average was 14th in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors contributing to the slow start at the plate
are injuries to Ken Caminiti and Moises Alou and battles with
illnesses by Bagwell and Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Astros know they are a better hitting team
than they have shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no consistency with our lineup,'' Biggio said.
``It's been weird. With guys being sick and hurt, we just really
haven't gotten into a groove. If we continue to play like this,
yeah, I'm going to be worried. But it's still in the early stages,
and if we start panicking now we're going to be in some serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, your gauge for everything is the All-Star break. You
play the first half, and you see what kind of position you're in.
If you have a chance, you know that by the All-Star break. It's a
long season; you don't panic now. Sooner or later, we're going to
get into a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can only hope that process began Wednesday in Los
Angeles, when they scored 10 runs and banged out a season-high 14
hits, which moved them out of the NL basement in team hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday, the Astros ranked last in hitting and
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty bad,'' Bagwell said. ``Offensively, we haven't
been at full strength, and that hurts a little bit. But we're still
not doing the things we're capable of doing. What concerns me is
that we're obviously going to need to pitch better. You can't have
to score six runs to win every single night. If that's the case,
that puts more pressure on the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not doing well, which we're not, the pressure
mounts and everyone is trying to do more. Then there's always the
three-run homer instead of `Let's just get the run across and move
guys over' and things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing at Enron Field, there's pressure to score a lot of
runs because other teams are going to score,'' Bagwell continued.
``It's going to mount up if we don't correct the ship pretty quick.
I don't feel real good about this right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to not look at last in hitting and last in
pitching. That's not a good sign, especially when the division is a
pretty good division. If you start slipping, somebody has the
ability in this division to take off. We're going to have to right
the ship pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, like most of his teammates, is quick to point out that
the Astros' struggles are magnified because they have occurred at
the beginning of the season, rather than in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about us too, until I looked at the schedule and
saw that there were a heck of a lot of games left,'' shortstop Tim
Bogar said. ``The way we've played has been very uncharacteristic
of us, but I wouldn't bail on us yet. We have too many veteran guys
who know how to pitch, who know how to hit and who know how to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stink right now, but we won't stink the whole year. The
expectations are high for us because of the way we played the last
three years. To start off this slow, no one is accustomed to it.
We're too good of a team to be (6-8) right now, but we could run
off 10 or 12 wins and be right back in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guys to panic are always the first guys to fall off
the boat, and we don't want to do that.''
</P>

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
At first, it was the eyes and Ray McCallum's laser-like intensity
that clinched the decision that he should be the next University of
Houston men's basketball coach.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The first time we met, that was the thing I noticed right
away,'' UH athletic director Chet Gladchuk said Thursday as
McCallum was introduced as the Cougars' new coach.
</P>
<P>
   In seven years at Ball State, McCallum's alma mater, the
Cardinals compiled a 126-76 record and made two trips to the NCAA
Tournament and one to the National Invitation Tournament. During
those seven years, the Cougars were 66-123. And they have not been
to the NCAA Tournament since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to outwork coach McCallum,'' said the
5-foot-10 McCallum, a 1983 graduate of Ball State who once was the
all-time career scoring leader in the Mid-American Conference.
``You can see how big I am, so you know I have to do it with work
ethic. That's the way it's going to be with our team. We're going
to bring back the pride and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach McCallum will get excited, I'll tell you that. You'll
see a hard-working team, and one that has fun with it. I'll be
working that sideline and working those officials. We're going to
get it back. Every day, we're going to be doing something to
improve the Cougar program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum, 39, UH's sixth head coach and the third hired in the
last eight years, agreed to a five-year contract that includes
$200,000 in annual base salary and $150,000 a season in guaranteed
outside income. He also can earn bonuses based on overall team
grade-point average, graduation rates and on-the-court achievements
such as postseason appearances and Conference USA records. There
also is a rollover extension for each NCAA appearance.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum was paid $92,000 a year as Ball State's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk's hiring mission, as it was with new football coach
Dana Dimel, was to connect with a young, energetic coach ``on the
upper side of the learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk referred to similar hirings like Georgia Tech's Paul
Hewitt (from Siena) and Nebraska's Barry Collier (from Butler).
</P>
<P>
   McCallum and his wife, Wendy, grew up in Muncie, Ind., attended
high school there and stayed at home to attend Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to leave,'' McCallum said of the move from Muncie,
a college town of about 70,000, to the Houston area and its sprawl
of 4 million people. ``My parents live there, my in-laws live
there, and I left a great team (with just one senior returning from
a 22-9 team).''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum said he doesn't foresee a big adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll just have to allow more time (for the traffic),''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum, introduced three weeks after Clyde Drexler's sudden
resignation March 30 following two seasons as UH coach, met briefly
with his new players Thursday and will meet today with the
basketball staff of George Walker, Reid Martinka, Michael Young and
Byron Smith, who are under contract until June 1. Assistant Reid
Gettys has said he is not interested in returning.
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzpatrick and Jerry Francis, members of McCallum's staff
at Ball State, paid a visit to UH recruit Patrick Okafor at Lee
College in Baytown on Thursday morning. Okafor, Milby's Alton Ford,
Fort Worth Diamond Hill's Chris Booker and Blinn College's Justin
Lyman make up the Cougars' latest recruiting class. McCallum said
he talked briefly Thursday morning with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They signed to play with Clyde,'' McCallum said of the
recruits signed by Drexler's staff. ``I'm sure that Clyde will be a
supporter of our program. I think I'll be a great coach to play
for. I just want a chance to present our program to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The November signees could request a release from their UH
letters of intent if they decide to play elsewhere because of the
coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   UH president Arthur Smith and Gladchuk acknowledged the
contribution of Drexler and his staff in rekindling interest in the
basketball program despite a two-year record of 19-39.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about succeeding Drexler, a hero of the early-1980s Phi
Slama Jama era, McCallum said, ``The guy who replaces me at Ball
State will feel the same kind of pressure, following a hometown
hero. He has showed local kids they can stay home and have a great
career and receive a great education.''
</P>
<P>
   McCallum said he can't wait to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the edge,'' McCallum said. ``We're tired of
being kicked around. It's time to make a statement.''

AVENGERS LOSE HOME OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was their inaugural regular-season home game,
but the Avengers already earned their first on-field distinction
Thursday night: They are the worst expansion franchise in the Arena
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   At least for today anyway, following their 58-50 loss to the
league's other expansion team, the Carolina Cobras, before 10,718
at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is the Arena Football League, so the fans were
probably more pleased with the constant barrage of points than who
actually won the game.
</P>
<P>
   And the game was entertaining, with the Avengers scoring a
touchdown with 24 seconds left on a pass from quarterback Scott
Semptimphelter to Chris Jackson to cut the lead to 52-50. But
Carolina's Dexter Dawson intercepted Semptimphelter's pass on the
two-point conversion to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobras added a consolation touchdown with eight seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough week for the Avengers (0-2), who had only a few
days to prepare for the Cobras (1-1) after L.A. lost its season
opener to Grand Rapids last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will help show the character of this football
team,'' Avengers coach Stan Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Avengers played like characters instead of showing
any, with a sloppy display that included three lost fumbles and two
missed extra points. The performance should reinforce Brock's
promise to make roster changes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the mistakes, the Avengers were in the game
throughout, and managed to rally to tie the game 31-31 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the errors continued in the third quarter when Aaron Frazier
fumbled for the second time, and Carolina quickly jumped out to a
45-31 lead. To make matters worse in the quarter, Avengers kicker
Kyle Pooler missed his second extra point, and L.A. trailed 45-37
entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't quite the way the Avengers wanted the official home
opener to unfold against their fellow expansion colleague.
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a contrast in team philosophy displayed between
the fledgling franchises. The Avengers signed mostly veteran
players while the Cobras were comprised primarily of rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of young guys playing hard,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jim Arellanes, the former Valley College
quarterback who had 219 yards passing and four touchdowns through
three quarters. Avengers quarterback Scott Semptimphelter was
equally effective, completing 16 of 22 passes for 215 yards and
four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Some diehard fans were apparently unaware of those stats,
considering they were chanting ``We want Todd'' in the third
quarter, begging for an appearance by backup quarterback Todd
Marinovich.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there was plenty of scoring. Consider how busy both
teams were in the first half alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers scored on the game's opening drive, as Pooler
kicked a 25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina took a 7-3 lead, however, capitalizing on Avengers
fullback Danjuan Magee's fumble. The Cobras recovered, and on the
next play Arellanes found Jack Jackson completely uncovered for a
26-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Magee atoned for his fumble on the ensuing possession, scoring
on a 7-yard run to give the Avengers a 9-7 advantage after Pooler
missed the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobras took a 14-9 lead seven plays later when Arellanes
found Dexter Dawson for a 4-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing kickoff, Frazier fumbled and Carolina's Tommy
Johnson recovered. Arellanes immediately found Brad Keeney for a
17-yard touchdown and a 21-9 Carolina lead.
</P>
<P>
   This being the Arena League, a double-digit lead doesn't mean
much, and the Avengers took about 10 seconds to reduce the deficit
when Semptimphelter hit Victor Hall for a 45-yard scoring pass. The
Avengers added a two-point conversion on Semptimphelter's pass to
Larry Thompson and trailed 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina added a 42-yard field goal by Remy Hamilton to boost
its advantage to 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers tied the game, on a 12-yard pass from
Semptimphelter to Frazier. Carolina struck back on a 1-yard run by
Bo Kelly for a 31-24 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But with eight seconds left, Semptimphelter found Corey Johnson
on a 24-yard scoring pass and the teams ended the half tied 31-31.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In arena football, any ball that goes in the stands is
property of the fans. So after a ballboy took away a football from
a small child in the end zone seats following a kickoff, Avengers
coach Stan Brock ran over and gave the fan a free ball. Unlike the
Avengers' exhibition game, no fans fell over the retaining wall and
onto the field while chasing loose balls Thursday night.

ANGELS' ERA GOING SKY-HIGH WITH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Anaheim Angels had ``one of those games'' Thursday
night when they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays 12-11 before 13,985
at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is they've had two of those games in the
past two nights.
</P>
<P>
   One night after starter Ken Hill gave up 10 runs in 3 innings,
Kent Bottenfield gave up nine runs in 3 innings in the series
finale. The Angels made a game of it, rallying from an 11-1 deficit
with eight runs in the sixth inning. They had the go-ahead run at
the plate several times in the final three innings before Blue Jays
closer Billy Koch struck out Orlando Palmeiro to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, with all the runs (23) and hits (33) in the game,
the difference might have been the defensive play made by Blue Jays
shortstop Alex Gonzalez in the ninth. Troy Glaus was on second base
with one out, representing the tying run. Matt Walbeck, one of five
Angels to get three hits, hit a pop up to shallow center field.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez, who entered the game as a defensive replacement in
the eighth inning, made a running, over-the-shoulder catch that all
but sealed the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   By that time Bottenfield was long gone, failing to make it out
of the fourth inning. After an easy first inning, he lost his
ability to locate pitches. The Blue Jays hitters, though, located
those pitches off the barrels of their bats.
</P>
<P>
   They scored three times in the second inning, twice in the
third, then broke it open with six in the fourth. Bottenfield left
the game down 7-1 with two out and two runners on in the fourth.
Kent Mercker came in, walked Tony Batista to load the bases, then
surrendered a grand slam to Darrin Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days,'' Bottenfield said. ``I had no idea
where the ball was going. For some reason I was hyped up,
everything was going 100 mph. It's like I lost my whole game plan
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was moving so fast. My heart was going 200 beats a
minute. That's not normal. The game plan I had going in was good,
and I forgot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels trailed 11-1 but were not out of it, knowing that the
Seattle Mariners scored 47 runs in three games against the Blue
Jays before the Angels came to town.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the sixth inning, the Angels broke out with nine hits,
including two by Mo Vaughn, to narrow the gap to 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied we lost, but I'm satisfied with how this
team came back,'' Vaughn said. ``It shows the team's mentality. We
didn't want to start like we did, but we keep pushing. Teams that
play hard when it isn't going well - that's a sign. ... It shows
we're a team that's going to be around all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's three hits could be a sign he's ready to snap out of an
early- season slump. Darin Erstad's three hits were, well, typical.
Erstad went into the game leading the majors with a .483 average,
and he raised it to .492. Adam Kennedy continued his hot hitting by
going 3 for 5 and scoring twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging to see we didn't lay down, and kept
fighting,'' Erstad said. ``We've had some crazy games in this
building.''
</P>
<P>
   The past four games could be included among those Erstad was
referring to, as the two teams combined for 73 runs and 111 hits.
The Blue Jays outscored the Angels in the series 41-32 and won
three of four. It was the first series loss for the Angels since
the season-opening series vs. the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   For a lifelong National Leaguer like Angels manager Mike
Scioscia, the high-scoring games take an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything surprises me, obviously I knew it was a
high-scoring league,'' he said. ``These games got a little out of
hand from what I'm used to. It comes back to the basics - make good
pitches and you get guys out.''

NHRA STRIP A PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Irwindale Speedway track president Bob
DeFazio says the second-year facility has the inside edge on
attracting a National Hot Rod Association-sponsored drag strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told us in no uncertain terms that this is their No. 1
choice,'' DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio and track chief executive officer Jim Williams were
guests of the NHRA when it held its inaugural Las Vegas event two
weeks ago. The two groups met to discuss the NHRA's desire for a
Southern California site for its street legal, import and Junior
Drag events.
</P>
<P>
   NHRA president Tom Compton said Thursday that little has changed
in negotiating with Irwindale, or other tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still awfully early, but things are going well,'' DeFazio
said. ``You can't make soup without the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton has said he would prefer a quarter-mile strip. DeFazio
said the speedway would build an eighth-mile strip. If built, it
would be along the southeast corner of the current track property.
DeFazio said very little of the current site's configurations would
need to be altered.
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA, Fairplex Park and city of La Verne recently agreed to
end the street legal races at Pomona Raceway and to allow only a
set amount of other events. The Junior Drag program was recently
OK'd for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would not be doing this for a large profit,''
DeFazio said. ``We think adding this would be good for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither organization has set a time limit on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Streak on the line: Former Evernham/Hawley chief mechanic Todd
Burns will try to keep his winning streak alive in NASCAR Late
Model Twin 40-lap races Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has won the speedway's first two Late Model races. Burns,
from Riverside, won the pole and eight-lap Trophy Dash his last
time out. In both races, Goleta's James Weston has been second, Oak
Hill's Tony Green third and Cathedral City's Guy Goldstein fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The track's Mini-Stock division and USAC's Three-Quarter Midgets
will be making their season debuts on the oval. Super Stocks and
Figure 8s will also race.
</P>
<P>
   Gates open at 4 p.m., with the first Trophy Dash scheduled for a
7 p.m. start.

WALKER CAN'T LIGHT UP AFTER VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Walker gave race fans at Irwindale Speedway a taste of what
he's capable of by winning three straight main events to close out
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Canyon Country driver made it back to victory
lane in the NASCAR Super Late Model division, the first time this
season for the 18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was absolutely perfect,'' Walker said of his Ford
Taurus. ``It was a bullet right out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking the checkered flag, Walker became the third driver in
as many events to win a Super Late Model race this season at
Irwindale. Greg Voigt of Goleta won the opening-night feature.
Charles Utts of Camarillo won the following main.
</P>
<P>
   For Walker, the win meant that he had to give up smoking, a deal
he made with his team at the start of the season. It also led to
his crew chief, Brett Barnett, shaving his head, another preseason
deal. Both said they were more than willing to make the sacrifices
in exchange for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Walker trails series leader Voigt by two points in the
standings. But Walker said it's too early to start talking about
winning the points title, even though he believes Voigt and Dan
Holtz will be his strongest competitors all season long.
</P>
<P>
   First victory: After narrowly missing an opening-night victory
in the NASCAR Grand American Modified division at Irwindale
Speedway, Rip Michels of Mission Hills took the checkered flag
Saturday night, his first win of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a sweet spot on a car, we're on it,'' Michels
said. ``It's been awesome. I think everything on the car right now
is bullet-proof.''

<P>
   Michels dropped from first to ninth in the opening-night event
because he blew an engine while crossing the finish line. That
caused a red flag, which ended the race 12 laps prematurely.
Because his blown engine led to the red flag and thus the end of
the race, track officials dropped Michels to ninth, the last car on
the lead lap, even though he was the first car across the finish
line when the race ended.
</P>
<P>
   Michels said Saturday night's victory gave him some redemption.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, T.K. Karvasek won the
NASCAR Super Stocks main event, Jon Zernikow of Monrovia won the
Legends main event and Joe Herold of Poway won the Ultra Wheel Spec
Trucks main event.
</P>
<P>
   Racing continues Saturday at Irwindale Speedway with NASCAR
Super Late Models Twin 40s, Super Stocks, Mini Stocks, USAC
Three-Quarter Midgets and figure eights.
</P>
<P>
   Paying dues: Rolando Quintanilla of Calabasas certainly got his
feet wet in the Dayton Indy Lights race at the Grand Prix of Long
Beach on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepperdine student and Indy Lights rookie had to overcome
several setbacks in qualifying just to make the field. He faced
even more on race day, when he finished 14th.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening day of practice, he broke a rod in the rear of
the car. As a result, Quintanilla missed the first session of
qualifying for the race. When he finally got on the track to
qualify, Quintanilla got into an accident and ended up having to
start from the 18th spot on the grid. His crew spent the rest of
the day getting the car ready for race day.
</P>
<P>
   Then during set-up on race day, his crew discovered a gear box
problem that Quintanilla had to race with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going out there with just a car,'' Quintanilla said.
``We didn't know what to expect. But I learned a lot, especially
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to patience, Quintanilla said he learned that while
he might not have been mentally prepared for the race at Long
Beach, he was physically prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Indy Lights schedule is June 4 in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   On to Vegas: The NASCAR Winston West Series picks up again
Saturday with The Orleans 150 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Among local drivers expected to compete are Jerry Cain of Canyon
Country and Bill Sedgwick of Acton.
</P>
<P>
   But Las Vegas native Brendan Gaughan is the driver to watch. He
is hoping his winning ways at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield,
the series' last event, will continue at his home track.
</P>
<P>
   Gaughan won the Winston West race at Mesa Marin and was fourth
at the season opener in Phoenix, making him the only driver in the
series with two top-five finishes this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orleans 150 is part of this weekend's events, which will
include an Indy Racing Northern Light Series race and a concert by
Smash Mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston West race will begin at 4:45 p.m. and be televised
on tape- delay on May 13 at 5 p.m. on Speedvision.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad wins: Steven Conrad of Agua Dulce won the Sprint car
feature at Ventura Raceway on Saturday night. Conrad's victory
snapped a two-race winning streak by Clark Templeman III of Santa
Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Ventura Raceway, Steve Greenland of Reseda
won the IMCA Modified feature.

LAKERS' SEASON DOMINATION GIVES OTHERS LITTLE HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ How ridiculous is this? The Los Angeles
Lakers post the second-best winning percentage in franchise
history, and herewith, your morning newspaper presents a breakdown
of their losses. All, ahem, 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Journalistic nit-picking? No, just consider this a perspective
builder on the eve of the Lakers' pursuit - a very realistic
pursuit - of their first NBA championship in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because really, the most ridiculous notion right now is that the
Lakers can be beaten in a playoff series at all. And it's their
rare defeats that offer insight into why they are heavily favored
to bring home the Lawrence O'Brien trophy in June.
</P>
<P>
   And why New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy almost conceded the
Lakers the title this week, comparing them to one of coach Phil
Jackson's former teams - the 72-10 Chicago Bulls of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Van Gundy said, ``there's certainly a form of
intimidation by them. I know when we played them, we didn't have
that same belief that we have against a lot of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   --The Lakers lost consecutive games only three times all season
never more than two in a row - and the last pair came this week,
when they had nothing left to gain.
</P>
<P>
   --Only three teams beat the Lakers more than once this season.
One, the Houston Rockets, missed the playoffs. The second, the
Portland Trail Blazers, have been a mess since the Lakers beat them
Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The third team is the San Antonio Spurs, the only team to win a
season series against the Lakers this season (3-1). But the Spurs'
last two wins come with, well, asterisks: Shaquille O'Neal didn't
play April 8, and he was among a handful of starters who played
limited minutes in a meaningless season finale two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   --From the second round on, all playoff series are seven games.
It takes four victories to win a series. The Lakers lost four out
of seven games just once all season - during a shaky stretch in
late January when they lost six of nine games. After that slide,
the Lakers went 33-4 to finish the season.
</P>
<P>
   --They have home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, and
the Lakers lost just five times at Staples Center this season.
</P>
<P>
   --And when they do have to hit the road, the Lakers have the
confidence earned by a league-best 31-10 road record.
</P>
<P>
   How do you beat the Lakers? Golden State Warriors coach Garry
St. Jean burst into high-pitched laughter at the very question. ``I
don't think anybody's going to beat them consistently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has this season, as the Lakers have bounced back quickly
from defeat. But as if to pump up opposing coaches' blood pressure
even more, Jackson points to another sign that his team has become
truly dominant: On the occasions when the Lakers played the same
opponent twice in a short span - a week or two - they usually won
the second game (and often the first one, too).
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are adjustment games, or reading games, that really
measure how do you read an opponent from game X to game Y in the
regular season, what adjustments have you been able to make,''
Jackson said. ``And we've done, I thought, very well in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that's a harbinger of doom to opponents, Jackson won't
say so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you're going to convince either Sacramento
or San Antonio or Seattle of that,'' he said. ``Players don't think
in those terms.''
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown of the losses reveals few methods for beating the
Lakers. Double-teaming O'Neal won't always work (unless you have
Tim Duncan and David Robinson), and intentional fouling doesn't
work much either (ask Dallas' Don Nelson).
</P>
<P>
   The majority of losses fall into three categories, none offering
much hope to opponents:
</P>
<P>
   THE NO-SHOWS: Kobe Bryant missed the first month of the season
with a broken hand, and the Lakers collected 27 percent of their
losses (four) before he returned Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a loss at Portland, in a game in which O'Neal was
ejected, stopping a Lakers rally in the fourth quarter. They lost
at home to the Houston Rockets, while O'Neal was serving a
suspension for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   They also lost at home to the Toronto Raptors, and a road game
to the Denver Nuggets, two athletic teams that required a perimeter
defender like Bryant to slow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat them, they were without Kobe Bryant,'' Denver coach
Dan Issel said. ``So if you get them without Kobe Bryant, you have
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was missing for the Lakers' recent home loss to San
Antonio and was held out of the fourth quarter in their loss to the
Spurs this week. Only 10 losses came with both O'Neal and Bryant on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   THE MISSTEPS: In Bryant's first start of the season, Dec. 8, the
Lakers lost at Sacramento. In that defeat, the Lakers got sucked
into the Kings' uptempo game, and Bryant coughed up six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Lakers went 2-3 this season when Bryant committed
six turnovers. The other losses: at Washington, March 16, and at
Dallas, April 18. In Bryant's two other six-turnover games, the
Lakers struggled to pull out the wins - against Cleveland on Jan.
19 and Minnesota on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   FOUL PLAY: One other note to would-be spoilers of the Lakers'
championship run. Go at Shaq and Kobe. Go directly at Shaq and
Kobe, and get them in foul trouble early.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers lost at Washington, Bryant got into foul trouble
and eventually fouled out trying to contain Rod Strickland at one
end, hounded by Mitch Richmond at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also fouled out trying to stop the Pacers' Travis Best,
who dealt him three fouls in the decisive fourth quarter when the
Lakers lost at Indiana on Jan. 14, and he fouled out in the Lakers'
home loss to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was also in foul trouble in the Washington loss, the
Denver loss and the back-to-back defeats at Houston and San Antonio
on Jan. 30-Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   So knocking off the Lakers between now and June will be a tall
order for anyone. But they're not all making Van Gundy-like
concession speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're the clear-cut favorites,'' Utah's Karl Malone
said. ``But there's a lot of teams that want what they want. So you
can't convince other teams out there they don't have a chance to
play against them.''
</P>
<P>
   And a cautionary note from Jackson, who has been in this
position many times before: ``We've been able to do it in an
82-game season. That doesn't mean a series is going to go any
easier for us than anybody else,'' he said. ``It's actually nice
and an honor to have the pressure put on us like this. It says
something about the way we've been playing. But we certainly can't
let it go to our heads.''

ERSTAD GOES BACK TO COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Darin Erstad continues to tear apart opposing
pitching, leading the league in batting average (.492), hits (32),
multi-hit games (12), and on-base percentage (.548). He went 3 for
5 Thursday, and on the current Anaheim Angels road trip he's
hitting .520 (13 for 25).
</P>
<P>
   So what has gotten into Erstad?
</P>
<P>
   It all started in spring training, when hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher sat down with Erstad, who was coming off a miserable season
in which he hit .253, more than 40 points below his career average.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher discovered that Erstad felt the most relaxed at the
plate when in college at Nebraska, so Hatcher had Erstad bring in
some videotape of his college days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took some things off his college tape to make him relax and
put him in good hitting position,'' Hatcher said. ``We did the same
thing with Troy (Glaus). He said in college (at UCLA) is when he
had his best swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad never felt comfortable at the plate last year, and he
kept tinkering with his swing all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the type of guy who over-worked and over-analyzed
everything,'' Hatcher said. ``Now it's simple for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's asked me to watch for certain things in his swing. Even
when he goes bad, he's not going to change anything. There are
going to be times when it happens, but he knows what he needs to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia noted that because of injuries to key
hitters in the lineup last season, Erstad might have tried to do
too much to make up for their absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is his swing where it needs to be, but there are guys
around him in the lineup, guys that make everyone around them
better,'' Scioscia said, adding that last season was a fluke.
``Last year was really the exception of the type of player he is,
not the rule. This is the way the guy can play. This isn't a
career-year, this guy's and All-Star. He's back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo's shift: The Angels have seen ``the shift'' put on for Mo
Vaughn, and now they're doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing defenses shift the infield from left to right on
Vaughn, so that the third baseman is in the shortstop's position,
the shortstop is on the second baseman's side of second base, and
the second baseman moves closer to first base and back into shallow
right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels used a shift of their own when the Blue Jays' Carlos
Delgado and Brad Fullmer, the former Montclair Prep High of Van
Nuys standout, batted during the four-game series, based on their
``spray charts,'' which register the location a player hits the
ball each time up.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bench coach) Joe Maddon does a great job organizing the spray
charts,''Scioscia said. ''They're vital to a club. It helps you
shrink the field and give you a better chance of getting outs.''
</P>
<P>
   How did the shift work on Delgado and Fullmer in the four-game
series? Delgado went 7 for 14 with two homers and four RBI; Fullmer
went 8 for 17 with two homers and 10 RBI.

SCHEDULE WORKS FOR JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ A little time to heal, a little time to
practice. That's all the Lakers need to right themselves for the
playoffs, and it's just what they'll get, thanks to the NBA's
corporate TV partners.
</P>
<P>
   NBC got its wish, getting the Lakers-Sacramento Kings playoff
opener Sunday afternoon, instead of Saturday - and gave the Lakers
an extra day to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA agreement with Turner Sports has stretched the first
three games of the first round over eight days, from Sunday to
Sunday. That gives the Lakers five days off in between games, all
in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Ron Harper and Derek Fisher
all nursing injuries, and with the Lakers having gone 3-3 to finish
the season, the extra time is welcome, even if the drawn-out series
seems awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's awkward or not. We'll see how it works
for us,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``One thing that we can use,
though, is some good practice time, because we tailed off at the
end of the season, shortened the practice time and tried to keep
our bodies live and our players healthy, and in the process lost a
little bit of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the effect of starting Sunday, rather than Saturday, has
given us a day's rest and an opportunity to practice for two days,
which helps. The opportunity then to have four days before the next
game (on Thursday) is an advantage to those teams that can make
adjustments and improve. And every team that is going to win in the
playoffs has to improve from game to game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, too, will benefit from the schedule - perhaps moreso,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it favors Sacramento, and I'll tell you why -
because normally you'd have to be in L.A. for two or three days.
And this way they'll be able to go home and keep the boys out of
trouble, if L.A. is trouble. For visiting teams it sometimes is an
allure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Fisher rejoined the active roster Thursday after
spending a week on the injured list because of a bone spur in his
right ankle. Rookie John Celestand was left off the playoff roster
to make room for Fisher's return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, X-rays were negative on Bryant's right wrist, which
he sprained Tuesday at Dallas and aggravated Wednesday at San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal goes into the playoffs with a sore right shoulder,
courtesy of the Spurs' David Robinson, and Harper continues to
nurse a bruised tailbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they're all a concern,'' Jackson said. ``And yet as
a team I think we're relatively healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to officials: Showing some frustration and perhaps
pre-playoff gamesmanship, Jackson said officials are not calling
flagrant fouls committed against O'Neal. Robinson's rough play
Wednesday prompted O'Neal to elbow him in the gut and draw a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq wanted to let a message be known - you can't just get
away with smacking me around without retaliation,'' Jackson said,
``and it's obvious this league does not call flagrant fouls against
Shaquille. And if they want to do the right thing, they can't let
people just hammer away at this time, because it doesn't matter if
he's big or not, it's still a flagrant foul. ... So I think Shaq
feels justified in his actions in that direction, and I don't
particularly endorse it myself. But I do think there's a limit to
what a person can take.''

 &HT;     MIDDLE-AGED FATHER LINKED BY DNA TO AT LEAST 12 SLAYINGS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LEWIS KAMB and SAM SKOLNIK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE _ As the man suspected of killing as many as 18 women
sat in a downtown prison cell, investigators fielded calls from
detectives across the country who are trying to solve similar
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Police from as far away as Alabama, New York and Germany
wondered whether Robert Lee Yates Jr., an Army veteran and a father
of five, could be the same person who killed women in their
jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, detectives in Spokane and in Western Washington worked
with federal agents to establish a time line of Yates' whereabouts
over the past decade. They are trying to see whether his
whereabouts correspond with other unsolved slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty confident once we get a time line, it will all
correspond,'' Sherk said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, detectives dug deeper into an investigation they now
say could take two or more years and millions of dollars to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a busy, but good day,'' Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk
said Thursday. ``Detectives are relieved we've finally made an
arrest, but the immensity of the task ahead of them is starting to
sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives fielded dozens of calls with tips from people who
knew Yates or others, passing along information they believed could
be helpful, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, criminologists here and across the state and nation
analyzed crime-scene and other evidence generated since Yates'
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also seized another vehicle, a van located in
Idaho, they say is one of nine automobiles Yates owned or had been
known to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was charged Wednesday with murdering Jennifer A. Joseph, a
16-year-old prostitute who was found shot to death in Spokane in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say DNA evidence links Yates to the deaths of at
least 12 of 18 victims _ women mostly living lives of drugs and
prostitution. Evidence also may connect him to all the cases, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women was shot. Investigators said Thursday that
they have not recovered a firearm in the case, though Sherk said a
bomb-sniffing dog that searched Yates' house on Tuesday hit at
least six ``alerts'' _ areas where guns or bullets may have been
kept in the house at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say blood drawn from Yates links him directly to
genetic material the killer left where eight bodies were dumped _
though they would not identify that crime-scene material. Four
other victims positively connected to Yates were also linked
through DNA and other evidence, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, relatives of all 18 victims had been contacted by
investigators. Detectives have not released the names of the 12
directly linked to the suspect, who has yet to be charged in 11 of
those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Through blood and other evidence found in a car Yates once
owned, investigators were able to link Joseph's death this week to
Yates, an Army veteran who worked at a Mead aluminum smelter.
</P>
<P>
   A button identical to one missing from a jacket found on
Joseph's body and genetic evidence obtained from a 1977 white
Corvette Yates owned between 1994 and 1998 tied him to her killing.
That led investigators here to arrest him in north Spokane early
Tuesday while he was driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Blood drawn from him shortly after his arrest has since
identified Yates as the primary suspect in the serial killings of
at least 12 women _ and possibly up to 18 _ across Washington,
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the guy we were looking for,'' Sterk said. ``He's
finally behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yates sat in a 8-foot-by-9-foot prison cell in the
Public Safety Building in lieu of $1.5 million cash bail. Prison
guards surveyed him under a suicide-style watch _ checking him
every 15 minutes _ though investigators say he has not threatened
to harm himself.
</P>
<P>
   He remains isolated from the general prison population, said
Dick Collins, jail commander sheriff's captain.
</P>
<P>
   Although court officials said Yates has applied for a
court-appointed attorney, they would not disclose whether one has
been assigned to him.
</P>
<P>
   While detectives worked to connect him to the 18 slayings in the
state, calls began flowing in from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Since authorities began investigating the homicides, Yates has
been looked at as a person of interest in several other slayings,
including one in Germany, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army helicopter pilot and reservist now in custody moved
with his family across the county. Yates has lived in New York,
Alabama and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joseph Goss of the Watertown, N.Y., police department says
his detectives are now actively investigating whether that small
city's one unsolved homicide can be connected to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hosmer Smith was shot and killed at 4 a.m. Aug. 1, 1990, on
a street just behind Watertown police headquarters. Smith, an
unemployed 20-year-old, was estranged from her husband at the time.
Goss said the husband had a strong alibi and quickly was ruled out
as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was not involved in drugs and prostitution, according to
the police file. However, Goss said it is possible that the person
who killed her might have mistaken her for a prostitute because she
was walking alone on a downtown street at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Yates was stationed at Fort Drum, just
outside Watertown, at the time of the slaying. Yates first was
stationed at the Army base in late 1990 or early 1991, reports
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a case we would like to compare notes on,'' Goss said.
``Is there a link? It's to early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a much firmer connection between Yates and
Connie LaFontaine, a Tacoma woman found dead Oct. 13, 1998. Police
have connected LaFontaine, a prostitute, to the serial killings
from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Yates retired from the Army and moved to Spokane in 1996. Soon
after, he joined the Washington Army National Guard for the past
three years, one weekend a month. He flew to Fort Lewis 12 miles
outside Tacoma to teach helicopter flying lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Dave Hall of the Pierce County Sheriff's
Department, LaFontaine and Yates seem to be solidly linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say that from what we know so far, it looks very
promising,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yates' arrest, the Pierce County sheriff has been
coordinating with Spokane police, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department is
concentrating on where Yates might have stayed in the county; what
kind of car he may have been driving at the time; and where he may
have flown in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about the connections between Yates and Melinda
Mercer, a Tacoma-area woman found dead in December 1997. She was
also thought to be a victim of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mathis, a spokesman for the Spokane Police Department, which
is handling the investigation, could not be reached for comment.
Police investigating the third Western Washington woman connected
to the suspected Spokane serial killer are not yet ready to make
the tie to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Barnes, whose body was discovered in 1995, heretofor
has been listed only as a possible victim of the killer. She was
from Port Orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Davis, Kitsap County Sheriff's Department chief of
detectives, says his office has been communicating with
counterparts in Spokane regularly ``to try to establish a firmer
connection between the Barnes homicide and their serial murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is not as optimistic as his Pierce County counterpart
regarding a connection to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's still premature to advise that we've
reached the conclusion that she is indeed a victim of the
particular man they've arrested over there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, an investigator revealed Thursday they got an break
with the Corvette that helped bring Yates into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Jones, the woman who bought the Corvette from Yates in
1998, is the sister of a woman who works in the Spokane city-county
joint property room. Everything from confiscated marijuana pipes to
recovered stolen articles is kept there, Detective Cal Walker said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After she bought the car, Jones stored it in her sister's garage
for months, leaving crucial evidence undisturbed that helped link
Yates to Joseph's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no type of cleaning to contaminate the evidence,''
said Walker, who added that the blood, carpet fibers and button
found in the car broke the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to arrest Yates for Joseph's slaying
largely on that evidence alone. They then were able to draw the
blood that has linked him to 11 other victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Corvette basically has been put to bed,'' Walker said of
the importance of it to the case. ``It probably won't come out
again 'til court.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators showed media members five other cars they have
confiscated since Yates' arrest. Among them, two blue Hondas, two
Ford vans and a Ford pickup that still has a vehicle registration
sticker for Fort Drum, N.Y., from 1993 on its bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also allowed media members past police barricades
to view Yates' South Hill split-level home that has been shrouded
by tarps since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Three tripods sat in the home's front and side yards, holding up
sophisticated equipment provided by the Washington State Patrol
that will create a 3-D map of the scene. A white flag could be seen
in a wood pile next to at least two sheds visible in the home's
yard, marking a place of interest to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The house was typical of the split-levels that line East 49th
Avenue. Well-kept and landscaped, it had flowers, shrubbery, a
blossoming cherry tree and evergreens surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   A basketball hoop hung on the side of a garage.
</P>
<P>
   As heavily clad TV cameramen, reporters and others filed along
the street to view the house, a neighbor who lived across the
street loudly complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It better not be like this for much longer,'' he voiced to a
woman standing nearby. ``I don't want these (expletives) in my
neighborhood any more.''

   ASTANA _ The election victory last month of Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, was hailed by the presidents of the
ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. But in private they are anxious
to see what policies Putin will have in store for Russia's former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The American government, however, has wasted no time in
asserting its interests in the oil-rich region by dispatching a
series of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the CIA, George Tennet, and the FBI's director,
Louis Freeh, both visited the region immediately after the Russian
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on their heels came Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, who travelled to the capitals of Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and
Uzbekistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to discuss regional security and democracy with
the three countries' authoritarian presidents. Each was offered $3
million to assist in dealing with an increasing cross-border flow
of weapons, drugs and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the carrot came the stick: Mrs. Albright
admonished the presidents for the manifest shortcomings of recent
elections in all three countries, for persecuting political
opponents and, in Uzbekistan, for using the threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism to repress the Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Asian presidents were evidently flattered
by such a high-level American charm offensive, it may not have the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is our God-given neighbor,'' says Nursultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president. He would like to establish a political and
economic partnership with Russia, but also enjoy close relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia matters, not least because a third of the country's
population is Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kirgizstan, one of the smaller countries in Central Asia, also
has little choice about where to look for friends. Last autumn,
hundreds of Islamic militants invaded southern Kirgizstan, taking
four Japanese geologists hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were caught unprepared and Kirgizstan's
president, Askar Akaev, asked Russia for help. After two months,
the hostages were released and the kidnappers escaped to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Mrs. Albright's arrival in Kirgizstan, Russia's
spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had met Akaev in the
capital, Bishkek, and Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed joint measures to combat terrorism and religious
extremism. Yastrzhembsky believes that there is a connection
between the rebels in Chechnya, the incursion in Kirgizstan and
terrorist bombings in Uzbekistan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's argument that democracy is the best defense
against extremism probably fell on deaf ears in Uzbekistan. Karimov
has antagonized many of his citizens by muzzling any form of
opposition, arresting thousands after last year's bomb blasts, in
which he himself narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think his iron rule is at least partly responsible
for the extremism he is now struggling against. Russia says it is
ready to help and will do so without making demands for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which America's dogged efforts to influence
Central Asia's leaders may pay off is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is determined to decrease Central Asia's
dependence on Russia's pipelines for transporting oil to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbaev, who would like to see several pipelines built so that
Kazakhstan can be as independent as possible, has reiterated his
commitment to a 1,730-km (1,075-mile) oil pipeline to run from
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is due to start next year, but the pipeline will be
economic only if Kazakhstan commits 20 million tons of oil a year
to the project. Recently, its officials have seemed to be backing
away from any such commitment, perhaps because they think
Kazakhstan will not be able to produce enough oil, at least before
2004.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot stop Russia from resuming a leading
role in Central Asia, the Americans hope they can at least prevent
a reunification with Russia of some of the former Soviet republics.
They may not succeed even in this aim.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin became Russia's acting president at the end of last
year, Slavic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan called for
referendums on joining the Russia-Belarus Union. Though there is
little support for this among the non-Slav population, many people
feel that their future would be safer under Russian protection.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is attractive, but the countries of Central Asia,
with small populations in relation to their size, feel vulnerable
to Islamic ambitions from Afghanistan. China, too, a giant
neighbor, is historically distrusted by Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be a friend, but it is far away. &QL;

AVENGERS LOSE HOME OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was their inaugural regular-season home game,
but the Los Angeles Avengers already earned their first on-field
distinction Thursday night: They are the worst expansion franchise
in the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   At least for today anyway, following their 58-50 loss to the
league's other expansion team, the Carolina Cobras, before 10,718
at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is the Arena Football League, so the fans were
probably more pleased with the constant barrage of points than who
actually won the game.
</P>
<P>
   And the game was entertaining, with the Avengers scoring a
touchdown with 24 seconds left on a pass from quarterback Scott
Semptimphelter to Chris Jackson to cut the lead to 52-50. But
Carolina's Dexter Dawson intercepted Semptimphelter's pass on the
two-point conversion to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobras added a consolation touchdown on a 10-yard run by
quarterback Jim Arellanes with eight seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But 108 total points scored with flair and style didn't do much
for the Avengers' morale, especially when Carolina scored 21 points
off three L.A. fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't quite the way the Avengers wanted the official home
opener to unfold against their fellow expansion colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have gotten blown out, really,'' Avengers coach Stan
Brock said. ``The turnovers are what kill you. I don't like losing
anywhere, but this is home. The fans are here, and you're
establishing something. This is our turf.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough week for the Avengers (0-2), who had only a few
days to prepare for the Cobras (1-1) after losing their season
opener to Grand Rapids last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, they showed less composure than Carolina,
despite having a team composed of mostly veteran players. Carolina,
by contrast, chose to stock its expansion roster with rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-1) had no turnovers while the Avengers (0-2)
finished with four.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that shouldn't happen with a veteran team,''
Semptimphelter said. ``We've all got to look at ourselves. Whether
it's a change of players, who knows? When you lose, you get sent
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss certainly won't discourage Brock from making promised
roster changes next week, when he has more time to evaluate the
personnel as the team takes a 10-day break before its next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put a group out there that can win,'' Brock said.
``I don't like to lose. I don't accept losing, no matter who we
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the mistakes, the Avengers were in the game
throughout, and managed to rally to tie the contest 31-31 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the errors continued in the third quarter when Aaron Frazier
fumbled for the second time, and Carolina quickly jumped out to a
45-31 lead. The Avengers never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured two excellent performances by the
quarterbacks. Carolina's Arellanes, the former Valley College star,
passed for 231 yards and four touchdowns without an interception.
Semptimphelter completed 25 of 39 passes for 313 yards and six
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Some diehard fans were apparently unaware of those stats,
however, considering they were chanting ``We want Todd'' in the
third quarter, begging for an appearance by Avengers backup
quarterback Todd Marinovich. He did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In arena football, any ball that goes in the stands is
property of the fans. So after a ballboy took away a football from
a small child in the end-zone seats following a kickoff, Avengers
coach Stan Brock ran over and gave the fan a free ball. Unlike the
Avengers' exhibition game, no fans fell over the retaining wall and
onto the field while chasing loose balls Thursday night. ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Muir High and USC cornerback Ken Haslip, who has been the
property of the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos, said
he still intends to play for the Avengers.

<P>
   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent central bank increases interest rates at the first
sign of overheating, before inflation actually takes off. So far
the Federal Reserve has been too lax, and that now makes its task
doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jump in consumer-price inflation _ to 3.7 percent in
March, up from 1.7 percent a year ago _ can be blamed on higher oil
prices. Inflation should drop a bit once these fall out of the
year-on-year figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several optimists still say the March number will turn out to be
a blip caused by special factors. But after a time it becomes
implausible to keep asserting that inflation is subdued if only one
leaves out all the prices that are actually rising.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the ``core'' rate of inflation (excluding volatile
energy and food) is also now creeping up. Plenty of other
indicators suggest that America's economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales jumped by 10 percent in the 12 months to March. GDP
figures out next week are expected to show real growth continuing
at an annual rate of 5-6 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Credit is expanding alarmingly. And the trade and current-account
deficits continue to hit records as rampant domestic demand sucks
in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June the Fed has raised interest rates, in
quarter-point steps, from 4.75 percent to 6 percent. But this
followed a sharp cut in rates in the autumn of 1998 in the wake of
Russia's financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are still only half a point higher than they were
in the summer of 1998. And because inflation has risen, real rates
have actually fallen slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the fact that share prices are still 30 percent higher,
on average, than in August 1998, helping to fuel domestic spending
because consumers feel so much wealthier, and overall financial
conditions are looser today than they were in 1998, despite the
economy's annual average growth since then of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in stock market wealth has been an important
driving force behind consumer spending. From this point of view,
indeed, the recent weakness in equities is welcome. It is certainly
no reason for the Fed to stop pushing up interest rates. A failure
to raise rates would probably cause share prices to surge upwards
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Fed has been too cautious. Each time the markets
have been well prepared for a modest rise, and share prices have
rallied after the Fed has acted, blunting the impact of higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed officials would have preferred to move faster, but Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has been more sympathetic to the
idea that the faster productivity growth of the new economy has
significantly increased the economy's safe speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   He is right to detect some evidence of this. But the snag is
that actual demand has increased faster still. It will now be even
harder for the Fed to engineer a soft landing, with growth slowing
smoothly to a sustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in inflation suggests that the economy is already
operating well above capacity, so growth will need to be slowed
more sharply to below its trend rate. This increases the risk of a
hard landing, in which output actually declines.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the Fed been too slow to raise interest rates to
prevent inflation from rising, but it has also failed to dispel the
belief of many investors that it is ready to ease immediately after
share prices drop _ as it did after the market fell in both 1987
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a moral hazard that has encouraged investors to
take bigger risks. And it makes it even more important that the Fed
does not flinch from the task of raising interest rates, even if
stock markets remain wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed should therefore raise interest rates by half a point at
its next policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years America's economy has enjoyed a virtuous circle.
Rising share prices have lured foreign capital and pushed up the
dollar; this, in turn, has helped to hold down inflation and
interest rates, and so supported share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The risk now is that the circle could turn vicious: if stock
markets tumble, foreigners could flee, pushing the dollar down and
inflation up, leading to further monetary tightening. In such
conditions, rising inflation would leave the Fed with less room to
cut interest rates to protect the economy from a severe stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have, over the past few years, made much of the
Goldilocks economy (neither too hot, nor too cold) should have
remembered that the tale ends with Goldilocks being chased away by
the bears. &QL;

<P>
   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent central bank increases interest rates at the first
sign of overheating, before inflation actually takes off. So far
the Federal Reserve has been too lax, and that now makes its task
doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jump in consumer-price inflation _ to 3.7 percent in
March, up from 1.7 percent a year ago _ can be blamed on higher oil
prices. Inflation should drop a bit once these fall out of the
year-on-year figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several optimists still say the March number will turn out to be
a blip caused by special factors. But after a time it becomes
implausible to keep asserting that inflation is subdued if only one
leaves out all the prices that are actually rising.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the ``core'' rate of inflation (excluding volatile
energy and food) is also now creeping up. Plenty of other
indicators suggest that America's economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales jumped by 10 percent in the 12 months to March. GDP
figures out next week are expected to show real growth continuing
at an annual rate of 5-6 percent in the first quarter of this year.
Credit is expanding alarmingly. And the trade and current-account
deficits continue to hit records as rampant domestic demand sucks
in imports.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June the Fed has raised interest rates, in
quarter-point steps, from 4.75 percent to 6 percent. But this
followed a sharp cut in rates in the autumn of 1998 in the wake of
Russia's financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are still only half a point higher than they were
in the summer of 1998. And because inflation has risen, real rates
have actually fallen slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the fact that share prices are still 30 percent higher,
on average, than in August 1998, helping to fuel domestic spending
because consumers feel so much wealthier, and overall financial
conditions are looser today than they were in 1998, despite the
economy's annual average growth since then of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in stock market wealth has been an important
driving force behind consumer spending. From this point of view,
indeed, the recent weakness in equities is welcome. It is certainly
no reason for the Fed to stop pushing up interest rates. A failure
to raise rates would probably cause share prices to surge upwards
once again.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Fed has been too cautious. Each time the markets
have been well prepared for a modest rise, and share prices have
rallied after the Fed has acted, blunting the impact of higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed officials would have preferred to move faster, but Alan
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, has been more sympathetic to the
idea that the faster productivity growth of the new economy has
significantly increased the economy's safe speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   He is right to detect some evidence of this. But the snag is
that actual demand has increased faster still. It will now be even
harder for the Fed to engineer a soft landing, with growth slowing
smoothly to a sustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in inflation suggests that the economy is already
operating well above capacity, so growth will need to be slowed
more sharply to below its trend rate. This increases the risk of a
hard landing, in which output actually declines.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the Fed been too slow to raise interest rates to
prevent inflation from rising, but it has also failed to dispel the
belief of many investors that it is ready to ease immediately after
share prices drop _ as it did after the market fell in both 1987
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a moral hazard that has encouraged investors to
take bigger risks. And it makes it even more important that the Fed
does not flinch from the task of raising interest rates, even if
stock markets remain wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed should therefore raise interest rates by half a point at
its next policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years America's economy has enjoyed a virtuous circle.
Rising share prices have lured foreign capital and pushed up the
dollar; this, in turn, has helped to hold down inflation and
interest rates, and so supported share prices.
</P>
<P>
   The risk now is that the circle could turn vicious: if stock
markets tumble, foreigners could flee, pushing the dollar down and
inflation up, leading to further monetary tightening. In such
conditions, rising inflation would leave the Fed with less room to
cut interest rates to protect the economy from a severe stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have, over the past few years, made much of the
Goldilocks economy (neither too hot, nor too cold) should have
remembered that the tale ends with Goldilocks being chased away by
the bears. &QL;

<P>
   April has never been a gentle month for Janet Reno, America's
attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, 1993, when she was brand-new to her job, four
federal agents were killed and 87 people incinerated in the siege
of the Branch Davidians' headquarters outside Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, to the very day, a bomb planted in revenge for
Waco in Oklahoma City killed 169 people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perilously near those anniversaries, crowds are massing in
Miami to prevent the seizure by federal agents of Elian Gonzalez, a
six-year-old Cuban refugee who must, under American law, be
returned to his father and to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For all her uncompromising talk, Reno clearly does not know
which way to turn. The parallels with Waco are disquieting. In that
case, Reno justified her intervention because children were said to
be being abused inside the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, too, the charges and countercharges are now
about child abuse: whether his Miami relatives, who took him in
last November, are turning the boy against his father, or whether
his father would treat him more cruelly by taking him back to
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, Reno now faces _ as at Waco _ a crowd of
believers, convinced that Elian has been saved by a miracle for a
life in the United States and determined to die martyrs' deaths to
keep him there.
</P>
<P>
   It need not have come to this. When Elian was first rescued from
the sea, one of three survivors of a raft-load of Cubans, it seemed
that matters would be sorted out swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Both national and international law are clear on the issue: a
child belongs with his surviving parent, unless that parent is
unfit. Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, had nothing that could
be held against him _ except that he lived in Cuba. But that was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   As the relatives became increasingly attached to Elian, their
attitudes hardened, and one can understand why. Since Elian's
mother had risked everything on that hazardous journey across the
Florida Straits, it was surely her wish that her son should become
an American.
</P>
<P>
   To send him back would mark another ``betrayal'' by the
government, a betrayal as callous as when it abandoned the band of
paramilitaries who were sent by the CIA, in 1961, to try to invade
Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. That anniversary, too, fell this week.
</P>
<P>
   Elian thus became, and remains, a captive of the poisonous
relationship between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1960, the two countries have neither traded nor had
diplomatic relations with each other. They lie a mere 90 miles
apart, the citadel of free enterprise and the western world's last
sad, failed remnant of communist central planning.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba longs for the dollars on which it subsists; much of Miami
yearns to be reunited with struggling Cuban relations. But both
sides are far too proud to admit to any complications in their
public loathing of each other.
</P>
<P>
   This long hatred is now summed up in one bitterly divided
family. Neither side trusts, or will even speak to, the other.
Elian's father, dispirited, waits in Maryland, while the Miami
relatives try to engineer yet more legal delays.
</P>
<P>
   They have defied a court order to turn Elian over; his father,
they say, is simply a tool of Cuba's dictatorial leader, Fidel
Castro. Politicians are not helping: the two local mayors, both
facing tough election fights, have said they will not lend support
to any federal agents who are sent to seize the child.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, both George W. Bush and Al Gore are
scrambling for Floridian votes by saying that Elian should stay.
</P>
<P>
   He should not stay. Despite the best efforts of his relatives to
lure him with toys, clothes and video games, his place is with his
father. But it is hard to see how matters can be resolved without
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exiles, though their power has been waning in
recent years, are utterly immovable on one point: they will not
deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil, and
Elian their saint.
</P>
<P>
   His case has become the pivot on which all their arguments, and
all their hopes, turn. They are determined not to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   This small boy encapsulates their message that Cuba is evil,
America is good, and that the two sides must not do business with
each other until the regime has changed. If they have to defy their
own government to make this point, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   How misguided they are. The Economist yields to nobody when it
comes to contempt for Castro. But to use Elian for propaganda
purposes, as the exiles now are, is exactly the tactic Castro would
choose.
</P>
<P>
   He is getting huge mileage out of this case. It shows, even
better than the trade embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the
United States can be.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives believe they are doing the best thing
for him, literally saving his life. But actually they are playing
into the devil's hands; and, in the process, they are also
restricting Elian's choices as surely as Castro would.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more fundamental point. These exiles came to
America after the Cuban revolution not just because they believed
in capitalism, but because, presumably, they believed in the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   They are now treating the rule of law as contemptuously as
Castro himself does. They will abide by it merely if it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   This defiance does not show Castro, and Cuba, that America is a
morally superior place. On the contrary, it displays a country
where even an administration with law on its side may be bullied
out of doing the right thing because it is election year. &QL;

<P>
   Are outsiders making too much of the disturbances in Zimbabwe?
</P>
<P>
   Africa has become a violent continent. Only six years ago, it
was the scene, in Rwanda, of the world's greatest genocidal
slaughter for half a century. Since then, war has spread from
Ethiopia and Eritrea across a swathe in the middle to Angola in the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Warlords have butchered and mutilated the people of Sierra
Leone. At the end of February, hundreds of Nigerians died in an
outbreak of ethnic violence that raised the spectre, at least for a
few days, of a repetition of civil war in the continent's most
populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Far more people were killed in a single explosion in Congo last
week than have died in two months of farm invasions in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Is the western world's concern about the turn of events there
just a reflection of the fact that some of the people being beaten
and shot in Zimbabwe are white?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. There is no other honest answer. Yet that should give
comfort to no one. Outsiders are right to be concerned about
Zimbabwe, not least because what happens there will have an effect
upon what happens in other parts of Africa, and therefore upon all
Africans, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, it is true, is not a very rich country, nor even a big
one. But it has been a hopeful country, one of relatively few in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 20 years of independence, the former British
colony of Southern Rhodesia has been tranquil, harmonious and
reasonably prosperous. This was no mean achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabweans had reason to be bitter: the majority-chosen
government that they might have expected in the mid-1960s was
denied them by Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence.
This led to 14 years in which the white minority imposed a
semi-sanitized form of apartheid and the black majority
increasingly took up arms as guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mugabe, who in 1980 eventually led Zimbabwe to
independence, never showed the capacity for reconciliation that
Nelson Mandela was later to show in South Africa next door, but
neither was he vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Many whites stayed on. They contributed usefully to an economy
that the IMF and others considered well run. The press was lively.
The judiciary was, and is, commendably independent.
</P>
<P>
   Many black Zimbabweans died in a series of massacres in
Matabeleland in the early 1980s, but after that the country seemed
set for a decent future.
</P>
<P>
   With political stability, a fair infrastructure and a large
tourist potential, it could expect investment and other support
from abroad. It would be refreshingly different from the
bloodstained basket cases that have done so much to tarnish
Africa's name.
</P>
<P>
   Now all of that is in doubt. The country is still far from
degenerating into butchery. Indeed, deplorable as it is, the
violence that has so often accompanied the occupation of white
farms is not, in itself, the main cause for concern. Nor are the
calls for land reform, a longstanding and legitimate demand in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister feature, rather, is the president's role in the
current campaign. He ``regrets'' the deaths, but he supports the
takeovers in which they happen, calling white farmers ``the enemy
of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he refuses to condemn the violence unequivocally and
have it stopped. The High Court has ruled the occupations illegal;
the vice-president too has said they must end. But the president
says, ``This is not a problem that can be corrected by the
courts.'' He thereby, in effect, lends his support to mob rule.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why Mugabe is doing this. The generally
hopeful picture of his country outlined above is nowadays largely a
memory. The president's rule has become ever more autocratic, the
government ever more corrupt and the economy ever more enervated.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by inflation, unemployment, chronic fuel shortages and
their country's involvement in a pointless war in Congo,
Zimbabweans are increasingly turning away from their president's
party, which must face an election before August.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe received a bloody nose when he put the draft of a new
constitution to the voters in February. No doubt he thinks the
issue of land reform, violent or not, will help him do better in
the coming poll.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that no one can bring him to his senses. It certainly
will not be Robin Cook, Britain's foreign secretary: any
intervention from the former colonial power is likely only to
antagonize Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   A better bet would be an African voice, preferably several.
Apart from that of Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, they
have been notably silent so far, perhaps because they are talking
privately, perhaps because they have some sympathy for Mugabe or at
least fear that criticism might lose them support in their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, they should lose their inhibitions. If Mugabe
continues to override the rule of law in Zimbabwe, the violence
will intensify, whites will leave, investment will dry up _ and the
infection will spread.
</P>
<P>
   All of Africa's countries risk some damage, but those that stand
to lose most are those closest by. Of these, much the most
influential is South Africa. It can exert economic pressure:
Zimbabwe depends on it for oil and electricity. It can also speak
with moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the strongest of reasons to do so. The
degeneration of Zimbabwe into lawlessness and instability would be
seen as confirmation of the opinion, long held by white racists,
that majority rule in Africa inevitably means autocracy,
incompetence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that view been held more firmly than in South
Africa, and nowhere has it been shaken more effectively, thanks to
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   By staying silent, Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's new president,
risks being seen as condoning the behavior of Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever feelings of solidarity Mbeki has for a fellow president
_ one who, like him, struggled against white rule _ he has a duty
to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe needs the rule of law, an unfettered opposition and
free elections. If it does not get them, and Mbeki stays mute, the
inevitable conclusion will be that they are at risk in South Africa
_ a dreadful prospect for the last, best hope in a strife-torn
continent. &QL;

<P>
   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April
22, 1500, and by accident, when a fleet commanded by Pedro Alvares
Cabral and bound for India was blown off course.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians mark that event this weekend, with a few protests,
and much soul-searching about what makes them unique. Elsewhere,
the anniversary is being almost wholly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Both reactions are predictable. Language, geography and history
have combined to isolate Brazil from its Spanish-speaking neighbors
on the far side of the Amazon rain forest and the Parana Basin, let
alone from the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation has bred introversion. That partly reflects Brazil's
vast size, self-sufficiency and fairly peaceful history. But it
reflects, too, a sense of shame, much of it derived from slavery,
which lasted longer and involved larger numbers in Brazil than
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Its legacies include ugly everyday violence and deep-rooted
social inequalities. Brazil's self-confidence has been shaken, too,
by recurring economic crises, and by difficulties in establishing a
stable democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at 500, Brazil is in many ways still a young country, and of
unappreciated achievements. Only Japan recorded faster economic
growth between 1900 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And though Brazil is not free of racism, it has been strikingly
more successful than the United States and many other countries in
creating a multiracial society.
</P>
<P>
   Its recent democratic governments have made big efforts to
tackle other social problems, ranging from education to land
reform. Having overcome hyperinflation, and ridden out last year's
devaluation, the economy is now set to grow again.
</P>
<P>
   Much remains to be done. Yet if Brazil's prospects now look
brighter, it is partly because over the past decade the country has
moved far in opening itself up: it has slashed tariffs, abolished
state monopolies and sold off state-owned businesses to private
investors, many of them foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Some Brazilians argue that change has gone far enough. They are
cautious about further trade liberalization, through a proposed
Free-Trade Area of the Americas, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who as president since 1994 has
pushed through many of the reforms, is right when he argues that
Brazil has more to gain than to lose from further market opening,
and from playing a more active role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments may seem odd. After all, a degree of economic
introversion is typical of countries of ``continental'' scale and
large domestic markets, such as India, Russia, China or, yes, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas India's geopolitical ambitions have equipped it
merely with nuclear weapons, Brazil's democracy has scrapped a
military dictatorship's nuclear-arms plans, and swapped a prickly
rivalry with Argentina for cooperation in Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   If they care about it at all, though, Brazilians tend to see
Mercosur as a refuge from the wider world. Not, it is true, a very
elaborate refuge: they have not shown themselves eager to turn it
into a genuine common market, still less to contemplate the loss of
sovereignty involved in deepening it in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has Mercosur, nor economic reform, transformed Brazil's
export performance. Between 1989 and 1999, India's exports
increased by 128 percent, China's by 271 percent and those of the
United States by 91 percent, while Brazil's rose by a paltry 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's share of world trade is smaller than in the mid-1970s.
Brazil is less poor than India, China or Russia, but it is in some
ways less open: its total trade amounts to a lower share of GDP
than in any of those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing that decline might be helped if Brazil were to
overcome its lingering inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's diplomats have traditionally been reluctant to strut
the world stage, or even the region's. They do not often take the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Cardoso's initiative in calling, for September, a
meeting of South American leaders to discuss democracy an
interesting one. But it is no substitute for a stronger effort to
compete in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   At 500, inexperience is hardly an excuse. &QL;

<P>
   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this year is the environment. Understandably so. The vice
president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really deeply,
about the planet is not in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In case anybody needed reminding of how very, very deeply he
cares, a second edition of ``Earth in the Balance,'' the green
tract he first published in 1992, arrives in the bookshops this
weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day 2000,''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in contrast looks vulnerable on the issue. Republicans in
Congress have refused to ratify the Kyoto Accord on carbon-dioxide
emissions, thereby signalling, in the view of many
environmentalists, a preference (based on narrow commercial
reasons) for the imminent destruction of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps that, as Gore's new foreword points out, Houston,
in Bush's home state, has replaced Los Angeles as the American city
with the worst air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans these days tell pollsters that environmental
protection should be given priority over economic growth (by a
majority of 70 percent to 23 percent, according to a Gallup poll in
January).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps voters would change their minds if they saw what putting
that preference into practice would mean, but Gore is certainly not
crazy enough to test the strength of their conviction.
</P>
<P>
   His fearless position is that you can have rapid growth and a
pristine environment at the same time. Despite his talk of bold
measures and radical solutions, therefore, what he offers is virtue
without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   As a political program this is hard to beat. Republicans play
into the vice president's hands when they accuse him of being an
environmental extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reply to this charge is, in effect, ``Yes, and what
responsible citizen is not?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-quoted proposals from the first edition of
``Earth in the Balance'' was Gore's plan to eliminate the internal
combustion engine within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the new book he says, Yes, I did write that: ``It is
possible; it needs to be done; it will create more jobs, not
destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words in 1992, and I
reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, so brave, so principled. But look a little closer at this
``plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore calls for a worldwide Strategic Environment Initiative.
This initiative, centered on ``intensive international
discussions,'' would aim to devise ways of encouraging greener
technologies, partly through stricter enforcement of
intellectual-property rights, subsidies for R&AMP;D, government
purchasing programs for ``early marketable versions of the new,''
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   There would be tax incentives and tax disincentives, too. When
it comes to eliminating the internal combustion engine,
``disincentives'' are the crux of the matter _ so on this Gore is
extremely vague.
</P>
<P>
   He favors a carbon tax in principle, but gives no indication of
how big it would have to be. (Adopting an interestingly holistic
approach to fiscal policy, Gore also proposes to spend whatever the
proceeds from this tax may be twice over, once on subsidizing clean
technologies, and then a second time on ``completely'' offsetting
cuts in other taxes. Undeniably, this is how to get better value
from your tax dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore spends more time discussing the constitutional arrangements
of the Iroquois (he admires them) than he does estimating the scale
of any carbon tax.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it would need to be vast, on a par with the oil price
hikes of the 1970s, to have any hope of bringing America into
compliance with the Kyoto limits that Gore says he favors _ let
alone to have a chance of quickly eliminating the internal
combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must be grateful to congressional Republicans for making it
clear that such taxes are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of his book, Gore is not therefore an
environmental extremist _ not, at any rate, judged by what he has
promised to do. He is, rather, a hypocrite of heroic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   His description of the ``crisis,'' and his way of thinking about
it, could not be more extreme. Both are in fact pure Unabomber. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Global warming caused by man is not a theory or even a contested
empirical finding but a spiritual revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues are questions of ethics (it is wrong to
``rip'' things out of the ground), not primarily or even
substantially of economics. Cost-benefit analysis (which puts a
discount rate on the future, and measures in dollars and cents) is
wicked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption (``ravenous, insatiable'') is a kind of addiction;
those who question whether the environment is in terminal crisis
are addicts in denial. Mankind is engaged in ``frenzied
destruction'' of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Gore is losing his sense of proportion. ``The
struggle to save the natural world is in one way much more
difficult than the struggle to vanquish Hitler, for this time the
war is with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He explicitly derides ``marginalist'' and ``adaptive'' responses
to environmental issues (such as those he himself proposes) as
``another form of appeasement,'' and calls for ``an all-out
response to this unprecedented threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``We now face the prospect of a kind of global civil
war between those who refuse to consider the consequences of
civilization's relentless advance and those who refuse to be silent
partners in the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people of conscience are joining the effort to
resist, but the time has come to make this struggle the central
organizing principle of world civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IMF-World Bank protesters in Washington this week
might hesitate to go so far. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   And yet what weapons will this ferocious prophet of the
eco-underground take up against the irredeemably evil forces of
global capitalism?
</P>
<P>
   A little tax-break here, a little subsidy there, maybe a little
tax on gasoline, even, but nothing anybody will notice _ and, oh
yes, plenty of ``intensive international discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between ends and means is startling, but reassuring
too. If Gore believed the anti-capitalist, anti-individual,
anti-liberal, eco-fundamentalist nonsense he pours out in this
book, the possibility of his election to the White House would be
truly frightening to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, though, as his proposals show, he does not.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, what this book on the environment is really
about is politics, and the deplorable tendency of political
leaders, as Gore says of others, ``to base important decisions on
the perception of their impact on the next election or even on the
next public opinion polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Don't you just hate that? &QL;

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK _ In most states a retiring president is treated
like a returning hero, the ultimate ``local boy made good.'' But
not in Arkansas, and not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of America turns its attention to George W. Bush
and Al Gore, Arkansas is still riveted by a man it can't quite work
out whether to hail or sue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' decision to retire to a smart ``New York mansion''
has not gone down well in Little Rock. Many people here consider it
an act of treachery: the Clintons are abandoning the state that
supported the family for more than 25 (often trying) years.
</P>
<P>
   But what should make them stay? The enticements the state now
offers the Clintons include a local lawsuit entangling Bill's
presidential library, various moves to disbar either or both of
them from practicing law, and a whole barbecue-full of gossip that
the first family would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to disbar Clinton revolve around the allegedly
false testimony he gave in the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation
of Atlanta, which filed one of the complaints, says disbarment
should be automatic when Clinton's case goes before the Arkansas
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wanted the matter postponed until he leaves office next
year. A judge refused. Clinton has until April 21 to respond but,
as The Economist went to press, he seemed likely to ask for another
extension.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Clinton paid $850,000 to settle Jones's complaint, which
is not part of the conduct committee's complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he did not fight a civil contempt citation over what
a federal judge, Susan Webber Wright, called ``intentionally
false'' testimony about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is also under pressure, in her case from the Whitewater
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary arm of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reviewing
allegations by Landmark Legal Foundation, another conservative
group, that Mrs. Clinton violated the state's code of conduct,
which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation wants the court to look at a real-estate document
which Mrs. Clinton created and was later used to deceive federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   It allegedly assisted the payment of $300,000 in real-estate
commissions to the father-in-law of Mrs. Clinton's former law
partner, Webster Hubbell (who pleaded guilty last June to various
Whitewater charges). These complaints will rumble on.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest immediate headache is the building that Clinton has
said should be ``a museum, not a mausoleum.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a team of New York architects ponders designs for the
$125 million Clinton presidential library and policy institute, no
actual ground-breaking work can be done because of Gene Pfeifer,
who owns two of the 27 acres of the area the library needs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer's complaint is not about the price _ he thinks the
$400,000 the city has offered is fair enough, even too much _ but
about the city's acquisition methods and what the area really is.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Pfeifer argues that the city can take over
private land only if it sees fit to create a park. This bit of
land, he says, is outside the zoning area for parks, so it is not _
and cannot be _ a park.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the city recently re-zoned the presidential
library area, but designated it for urban use instead of as green
space for a park.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock's lawyer, Tom Carpenter, replies that if the city
calls something a park then a park it must be. A judge is due to
give a ruling by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton wins this battle, the library faces other
challenges. Some people have questioned the use of city bonds to
buy the land which will be given to the National Archives for the
library.
</P>
<P>
   The city's board of directors floated $16.4 million in bonds,
vowing to pay them off with revenues raised at city recreation
facilities, including the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Rock's zoo is hard up, and has lost its accreditation
with the National Zoological Association because it has been
accused of, among other things, not looking after its animals
properly.
</P>
<P>
   There are anyway doubts about the part of Little Rock chosen for
the Clinton shrine. The seedy warehouse district and the
rat-infested weeds on the banks of the Arkansas River have never
been exactly a popular spot.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists point out that what they call the River Market has
been livened up with some new hotels, the inevitable convention
center and the odd tourist bar. But the claim by the library's
supporters that it will be the only presidential library with its
own marina seems a little desperate.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to rumors that Clinton may choose a new site _
perhaps Georgetown University in Washington _ for his library. That
still looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has chosen a loyal friend in Arkansas as the private
contractor to build the library. But it would not be the first time
that the first couple have broken a promise; and to take the
library off to Washington would add to Little Rock's fury about the
house-removal to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is supposed to make a few formal remarks about his
library on a visit to the state on April 27. Optimists talk of
Clinton persuading U2, an Irish band, to play at a free concert to
celebrate the library's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Less kindly people are already smirking about the library's
possible interactive displays (a three-dimensional hall of
mistresses and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the frustration on both sides lies a shared wish: to
recapture a glimmer of the magic that illuminated the state eight
years ago, before scandal tarnished both the state and the man who
should be its favorite son. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ It was not Seattle, but neither was it a damp
squib.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 protesters descended on Washington last weekend,
intent on shutting down the spring meetings of the IMF and the
World Bank on April 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Seattle, the aim was to use ``nonviolent civil
disobedience'' to stop the meetings from taking place. In other
words: block roads by forming human chains, and stop anyone getting
through.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters failed to shut down the meetings of the Fund and
the Bank, but they did paralyze large parts of downtown Washington
and cause the delegates much inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The police sealed off a huge 90-block area around the Bank and
Fund buildings. By the eve of the meetings hundreds of policemen
were on guard in full riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the staff of the Bank and the Fund spent the night in
their offices, with videos and inflatable mattresses. Others were
told to report for work at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were driven to the meetings from their hotels in
police-escorted buses soon after dawn. Those who tried later
(including Laurent Fabius, the French finance minister) failed to
make it past the human chains.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone naive enough to wander among the demonstrators in a suit
was likely to be treated to an impromptu lecture on the evils of
global capitalism. Most of the time, the mood was festive.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of placards (``Imperialist Monetary Fiend,''
``Indigenous Manipulation Fund,'' ``Spank the Bank''). Huge banners
spanned the streets (``IMF/World Bank: start shakin'; today's pig
is tomorrow's bacon'').
</P>
<P>
   Bare-breasted women demanded the end of corporate rule;
makeshift bands of drummers banged empty water bottles on plastic
buckets; three young women from Vermont, in bright red evening
dresses, pranced around quoting from the ``Communist Manifesto,'' a
book whose message they felt was ``pretty accurate for right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find any protesters with a coherent explanation
of why they were there. The usual responses were mumbled slogans
saying that the World Bank and the IMF oppressed the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators seemed to be students, many inspired
by recent teach-ins on the evils of the IMF at their college
campuses. Several admitted that they had not heard of these
organizations two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some were even younger: a group of 14-year-olds from a suburban
Washington high school claimed they were there to protest against
the World Bank's ``corrupt'' loan system.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sinister element. Groups of black-masked anarchists
_ similar to those who smashed windows in Seattle _ roamed around
looking for trouble. But by Seattle standards it was all fairly
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested around 1,300 people, including 600 the day
before the main protest started and another 400 who were
``voluntarily arrested'' after they crossed a police line.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no vandalism (a few cars got smashed); and
some pepper spray was used. Despite a few photographs of students
being clobbered, the police were widely praised for doing a good
job.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss, Charles Ramsey, became something of a media star as
he walked around chatting with demonstrators. ``They're just kids
with a cause,'' he said at one of the many press briefings. ``God
bless 'em. That's what America is all about.'' &QL;

A NEW BOOM FOR 'OL MAN RIVER, THE MISSISSIPPI

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ De Soto bathed in it in 1542, Joliet and Marquette
canoed along it in 1673. But the modern story of the Mississippi
River does not begin until a century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1851, some land-hungry whites got the Dakota Indians to sign
a treaty that gave them much of the territory around the upper
Mississippi. Soon afterwards, in 1854, the Chicago and Rock Island
Railroad pushed its way up to the river. Travellers from the east
could now reach the Mississippi in a mere three days.
</P>
<P>
   The railway's managers celebrated its completion with a Grand
Excursion. They invited some 1,200 stockholders, journalists,
novelists and academics (plus an ex-president, Millard Fillmore) to
board seven steamboats at Rock Island, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The boats' great paddle wheels propelled the excursionists
upstream to St. Paul, almost as far as the boats could then go.
</P>
<P>
   One stricken New York Times writer swooned: ``Over 150 miles of
unimaginable fairyland, genieland and world of visions have we
passed during the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Back east, this sort of thing increased the fervor of restless
would-be pioneers. By the time Mark Twain visited St. Paul in 1882,
71,000 people lived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a manufacturing city, of course _ all the cities of the
region are _ but he is peculiarly strong in the matter of
commerce,'' wrote Twain, in his muscular way.
</P>
<P>
   Downstream, Twain saw St. Paul's bigger twin, Minneapolis,
bustling with river trade. Mills powered by the Falls of St.
Anthony mashed wheat into flour. There was a flourishing of
sawmills, cotton mills, paper and oil mills.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis had become the milling capital of the world by 1880,
and would keep the title for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few
months ago,'' Twain said, ``but were growing so fast that they may
possibly be joined now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the Twin Cities were still bustling with
trade. But the mills began to run on steam, not hydropower; so they
no longer needed to be next to the river. Riverside industry faded.
</P>
<P>
   The planners began to look for new ways of using the land. In
1970, Minneapolis created the Riverfront Development Coordination
Board to reclaim industrial land alongside the river. The railways
were persuaded to move some of their tracks to open up space for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the river is having a new boom. In Minneapolis,
developers are converting empty mills and warehouses into expensive
apartments with views of the river; nearly $1 billion of private
capital has been put into riverside projects.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Paul, public agencies and private companies have built a
science museum, a hockey arena and a convention center. Officials
are asking for millions of dollars of public money to build a park
on land once used by the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   In September, there will be a ceremonial opening of Harriet
Island in the middle of the Mississippi, featuring a ``healing
garden'' and steps that descend into the river.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite an argument over a proposal to build a cable-car
connecting the city and the island. Those in charge of these grand
projects operate on the theory that, as technology makes geography
less and less important, they must use historical charm to create
the ``sense of place'' that lures the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 2004, cities from St. Paul to Davenport, Iowa, plan to
celebrate the sesquicentennial of the Grand Excursion by doing it
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the new excursion will put the northern
Mississippi back on the map for international tourists in search of
an ``authentic'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also, of course, a solid economic motive. The new
excursion, it is reckoned, should help the river cities to convince
legislatures and voters to support their riverside redevelopment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   These riverside towns also hope to bargain for federal dollars
in order, among other things, to clean up the land that riverside
industry polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, notables and journalists _ this time from all around
the world _ will be invited to climb on board (restored) steamboats
at Rock Island. They will then travel upstream to ``rediscover''
the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Actors will impersonate the first excursion's characters.
Someone will dress up as Millard Fillmore and parrot the former
president's praise of this once virginal river.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the decks may be less than a rediscovery of Eden.
The steamboats will have to navigate a gauntlet of locks and dams,
and paddle among huge barges heading downstream laden with coal and
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   They will pass federal Superfund sites and will see, for the
most part, a riverfront vastly different from that which the first
excursionists gazed at so ardently 150 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The excursion's organizers trust that the new
celebrants will enjoy themselves enough to send glowingly nostalgic
reports back home.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people who live in the cities and towns that flank the
Mississippi have forgotten that a river as grand and nearly as long
as the Nile flows beside them.
</P>
<P>
   The planners of the coming 150th anniversary are hoping to
reconnect people and water. They want to revive an awareness of
what the Algonquin Indians, intimate with its power, called
michi-sipi, the Big Water. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In all the upheaval that has been brought about by
changing technology, one constant has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, where so many denizens of the high-tech world have
acquired purple hair and started bringing their budgerigars to
work, the sales force has kept its aura of 1960s Organization Man.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to customer calls, white-shirted and neatly coiffed, the
salesman seems to have changed little in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force serving the technology industry is immense. IBM
has nearly 30,000 salesmen; Oracle another 10,000; the four
next-biggest software companies that many again.
</P>
<P>
   Not for much longer. E-business, transformer of all corporate
processes, has arrived in the land of strong handshakes and special
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Oracle and IBM, SAP and other big
software firms have started selling their expensive flagship
products over the Web, in many cases bypassing their sales forces
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the company that is leading the way, all the
mysteries of pricing, from incentive discounts to ``bundle
savings,'' which have so long been the salesman's stock-in-trade
are going or gone.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are a la carte menus, with greatly simplified
pricing options and the same prices for everybody. The salesman has
become an ``educator'' and ``evangelist,'' even a ``consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   The grubby work of actually striking the deal is now
increasingly done by software robots. Over the next year, Oracle
plans to shift 80 percent of its sales to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has started to sell its software, from databases to Lotus
Notes, on private extranets connected to the consultancies and
systems integrators that are its business partners; soon it will
start to offer them to everybody on its public Web site, too.
</P>
<P>
   SAP already sells some of its cheaper products this way; for
more expensive products, it now allows customers to pick software
configurations on the Web, stopping short only at the price, which
still requires a call to the company. But it, too, sees automated
selling as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple change, but one with enormous consequences. Take
the sales force out of the loop and suddenly opaque pricing becomes
transparent pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Access to price information shifts the balance of power to the
buyers: they can buy as little or as much as they need, treating
the order form as if it were a spreadsheet, to see the effect of
volume discounts or of adding or removing features.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that the average prices of these products on the
Web will go down. Indeed, anticipating this, Oracle cut its prices
when it introduced Web ordering. But, at the same time, a company
with Web sales is likely to reach more customers, including the
dot.com start-ups that would be too small to justify a sales call
even if the salesman had heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're betting that the increase in volume will more than
compensate for the fall in prices,'' says Ray Lane, Oracle's
president.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, just a bet, and despite a lot of financial
modelling before the change, he admits that he can only guess at
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the straightforward commoditized e-commerce of the
sort employed by Dell or Amazon. The big databases and
enterprise-resource planning suites from these companies cost
anything from tens of thousands to millions of dollars, and can
take a dizzying array of configurations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, most sales came either through a consultant or
systems integrator or through the firm's sales force. Each was
priced according to a mysterious calculus tainted by greed or
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Salesmen knew that deep discounts could cement relationships
with big customers or close a deal before the crucial end of the
quarter. But they also knew that the biggest commissions came with
complex packages that threw together multiple products and service
plans _ perhaps more than the customer needed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was often confusion, and not just for buyers. Oracle,
says Lane, used to have ``as many different kinds of contract as we
had customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Without standardization, contracts had to be approved and
tracked separately, limiting efficiencies of scale. The sales force
spent much of its time negotiating deals and processing order
paperwork. And because the different contracts made comparisons
difficult, the firm could not easily track trends, predict revenues
or make the most of its customer database.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the move to Web sales has already saved Oracle tens
of millions of dollars in sales and processing time, contributing
to its record revenues and margins in recent quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the sales force itself? Initially, says George
Roberts, the head of Oracle's North American sales division, sales
reps were horrified to have pricing, one of their most powerful
tools, wrenched from their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say: `My value-add before was negotiating contracts.
What's my value-add now?''' The answer, he says, is that the sales
rep becomes more of a consultant _ a job with less tedium and
paperwork, and more challenge and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not as odd as it sounds. After all, many management
consultants actually serve as salesmen, recommending and
contracting new IT systems for clients. Why should the opposite not
hold as well?
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is retraining most of its sales force in e-business
technology and business practices in the hope that, now that they
no longer have to haggle over contract terms, they can spend more
time understanding the customer and the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some day salesmen could even charge customers by the
hour for their visits. Organization Man would be proud. &QL;

RE-INVENTING THE WHEEL: PIRELLI TIRES TREAD NEW GROUND

<P>
   Every company dreams of changing its industry. Pirelli, an
Italian industrial group spanning tires and cables, may actually
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If a new and flexible tire-production system fulfils its
potential, tire making will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Steel was transformed by mini-mills and sheet glass by the
float-glass process. Given the tire industry's chronic overcapacity
and low profitability, Pirelli's new method not only makes better
tires, but also promises to shatter the economics of a business
worth $70 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims have been made before. Indeed, most of the world's
big tire companies have pet technologies aimed at making tires more
efficiently. Yet little in the way of new production has been
achieved with all this technology, something that leads analysts to
wonder whether technological ambitions have not been thwarted by a
fear of ruining existing manufacturing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Michelin, then the world's biggest tire firm,
introduced ``C3M,'' a flexible-production method, into its plant at
Clermont-Ferrand in France. It hinted at productivity benefits of
up to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the process remains highly secret and appears to have had
little of its promised impact: only a handful of C3M units are in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Similar miracles have been promised by Bridgestone's ``Tochigi''
and Goodyear's ``IMPACT'' systems. Again, details of these
manufacturing systems are as hazy as the promises are grand.
Goodyear, for instance, will take 15 years before its plants are
all using IMPACT _ scarcely a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Pirelli's claims seem equally open to question.
Although the company is the market leader in high-performance
tires, it is only the sixth-largest world producer, and an unlikely
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The new manufacturing technique has been under development for
two years and is still in a research facility, hidden among the
grubby buildings of Pirelli's sprawling Bicocca plant on the
outskirts of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   A few chunky robots sit among strange tubular machines alongside
which are buckets containing ropes of rubber. Steel wires and tapes
run everywhere in apparent chaos. If this is the future, it seems
disturbingly hectic.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the system starts to run does its elegance suddenly
become apparent. While the robots sway and dance with startling
precision, a high-performance tire appears as if by magic.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the large tire makers, Pirelli has shown a
remarkable willingness to demonstrate its ``modular integrated
robotized system'' (MIRS) to big car and motorcycle makers such as
BMW, and to the press, which will be able to see the first factory
version of the system when it begins continuous operation in a few
months' time.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS has several features that distinguish it from traditional
labor-intensive tire factories. Perhaps the most striking is that
tires are produced entirely by machine.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by software, a series of robots carry the tires right
through construction to molding and vulcanization. Thanks to its
robots, MIRS improves labor productivity by up to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The system is small and modular, unlike traditional tire making,
which has big economies of scale. The basic production line fits in
a mere 350 square meters and costs a modest (euro)45 million-50
million ($42 million-47 million).
</P>
<P>
   Working continuously seven days a week, this mini-factory can
produce a million tires a year, at an overall cost one-quarter less
than that of a mid-size traditional plant, which might produce 6
million tires a year. This frees Pirelli from the physical
constraints of traditional large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS can be installed almost anywhere, if necessary right next
to a car maker's factory so that it delivers tires directly as they
are needed. It is also easy to add more production lines.
Additional modules can sit alongside the existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a MIRS plant can be assembled quickly wherever it
is needed. The contrast with the capital-intensive and huge
traditional tire plant could not be greater.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 patents protect the MIRS system, 12 of them related to
the method of building each tire, the rest to the software
processes.
</P>
<P>
   The main technology was invented by Pirelli 20 years ago, but
proved uneconomic. But what was then impractical has become
possible with today's robots. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIRS builds each tire around an appropriately shaped aluminium
drum. Raw rubber is heated and extruded on to the drum, followed by
successive layers of steel wires and strips as the tire takes
shape. At the end of the process, the drum ingeniously collapses,
leaving the finished tire ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   The system is flexible. Change the shape of the drum and you
change the tire that emerges. With the right software programming,
MIRS can build car, motorcycle, truck and tractor tires. A
prototype motorcycle tire is in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli boasts improvements in quality as well as productivity.
Traditional tire making is done in huge batches, with tires
assembled gradually. At any moment, only 12 percent of materials in
a given batch are being processed. The rest are in storage, waiting
until required.
</P>
<P>
   It takes six days to get from raw materials to tires. MIRS takes
72 minutes. But it also points to why tires made using MIRS are
better.
</P>
<P>
   Stored batch materials cool and must be reheated before use,
conditions that can create flaws in the rubber, as well as waste.
MIRS creates tires at a uniform temperature in a single process,
eliminating both problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli says that leading car makers have been so excited by the
improvements in quality that they have rushed the new tires into
their test programs.
</P>
<P>
   The road ahead If MIRS's benefits were limited to the creation
of a better class of tire, it would be of somewhat academic
interest. But, says Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's chairman
and chief executive, the system's scope is far greater.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it will change Pirelli in fundamental ways, helping
the firm to work more closely with its customers. These are not
just the vehicle makers, for whom the main advantages are clear.
They are also dealers who sell and maintain tires and who control
the retail aftermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the car makers. In future, they can have a
just-in-time tire-making facility wherever they want, allowing them
to squeeze inventory costs a precious notch. But they can do
something more profound.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS is controlled by a software system, so in theory tire
makers can feed their requirements directly into a production line,
changing ingredients and design features as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   This opens new possibilities for integrated vehicle and tire
design, as well as for accelerated testing of new ideas. That could
help to elevate tires from humble load bearers to sophisticated
elements of a vehicle's overall design. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli is already developing new ideas to take advantage of
MIRS. For instance, the system makes it easier to embed intelligent
sensors into tires. These could be linked to a car's electronic
information system and continuously pass on measurements of, say,
pressure, triggering an alarm if it predicts a puncture. Optical
sensors could monitor wear to determine when a service is due.
</P>
<P>
   Such improvements could have a big impact on any large fleet of
vehicles, but especially on trucks, which make money by spending as
little time as possible off the road. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,225) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equally exciting, says Tronchetti Provera, is the effect that
MIRS will have on Pirelli's relations with dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of MIRS will allow Pirelli to slash dealers'
inventories, giving it a big advantage over other tire firms.
Dealers can order what they want online and know that it will
arrive just as they require it.
</P>
<P>
   The largest dealers might replace their costly inventories with
a MIRS unit inside their own plant, so that Pirelli can build
different tires as needed. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC;   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike competitors who have mostly dabbled with their new
systems, Pirelli is placing MIRS at the heart of its strategy for
tires, which represent roughly half the firm's overall business.
</P>
<P>
   Tronchetti Provera says that he wants a quarter of his
production to use MIRS within two years, an ambitious target. The
effort will focus on Pirelli's existing strength, the top end of
the market, supplying high-performance tires to car makers such as
BMW, Porsche and Jaguar, as well as to the popular four-wheel-drive
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   MIRS's strength is not just its technological elegance, but its
energetic backing from Pirelli. The firm could have used MIRS
simply to cement its market position. But that would have meant
laying off thousands of workers from traditional plants _ one
reason why larger firms have been secretive and slow to roll out
their new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pirelli is aiming to expand, increasing its presence in
the less valuable, mass-market, bits of tire making. With the
arrival of MIRS the rest of the tire industry might have little
choice but to be more adventurous. &QL;

<P>
   VIENTIANE _ Broadly smiling faces grace a calendar that calls on
people to ``Visit Laos Year 2000.'' Tourist dollars are important
for this sparsely populated, landlocked country, where the economy
is struggling and most of the 5 million people survive on
subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
   But now Southeast Asia's poor relation could be facing the
resurgence of a war that many had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last month an explosion in a restaurant in the capital,
Vientiane, injured 13 people. Although some attribute the incident
to a business dispute, the Communist government has blamed it on
insurgents from the Hmong, an ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they were responsible for attacking the
restaurant, there is evidence of a renewed campaign by surviving
remnants of the Hmong guerrilla army that America's CIA used to
fight Lao communists during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have ambushed army convoys and burned houses in
the central province of Xieng Khouang.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas continued a low-intensity war long after their
enemy, the Vietnam-backed Pathet Lao, claimed victory in Laos in
1975. Now Hmong fighters seem to be gaining more support, perhaps
because of growing discontent with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the guerrillas had few coherent aims. But they have
now started to attack corrupt leaders, and those involved in
unpopular resettlement policies. In one recent raid, they killed
local officials who were said to have been hoarding currency.
</P>
<P>
   They are also believed to have tried to defend families forced
to move from their highland homes to the plains. Although the
government has said that these moves are necessary to preserve the
ecology of the mountains, many suspect the resettlement was
primarily to help logging operations, from which the army profits.
</P>
<P>
   Laos has enjoyed steady growth since it began opening up its
economy more than a decade ago. But most of the benefits have gone
to the government and the army. Some onlookers reckon the army
takes nearly half the profits from Lao casinos.
</P>
<P>
   For most ordinary people, times have become harder, especially
since financial trouble first struck Laos's neighbors in 1997. The
currency, the kip, collapsed last year. It has now stabilized, but
things could still go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Hmong rebels may have interpreted these economic
difficulties as evidence of a weak government. If so, they are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist regime, largely dominated by generals, has
recently improved the efficiency of its secret police and has
brought in army recruits from the countryside. These recruits have
no qualms about cracking down on any sign of dissent in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
   At Vientiane National University, long a meeting place for
intellectuals, students are now discouraged from mingling on
campus. Most of them go home immediately after class rather than
risk trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters planned an anti-government demonstration in Vientiane
last October, but were detained before the march. The whereabouts
of at least six of them is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few Vientiane residents who can get independent news _
an even smaller number than in notoriously mediaphobic Myanmar _
are too frightened to speak out, let alone organize.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, says Sunai Phasuk, a Laos specialist at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, the conditions for peaceful
political change simply do not exist in Laos. Nor do government
opponents expect much support from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments tend to criticize Laos less severely than
Myanmar, perhaps because the country does not have an attractive
opposition leader like Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the United States has suspended normal trading
relations, and is likely to continue to do so until the matter of
``the disappeared'' is cleared up, according to Stanley Roth, a
senior State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   These particular ``disappeared'' are Houa Ly and Michael Vang,
two Hmong-Americans who vanished last April while visiting the
Thai-Lao border. The government says it knows nothing about them,
but suggests that they may have been crossing into Laos to meet
Hmong insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ly helped to rescue American pilots who were brought
down in Laos during the war, and Vang is related to Vang Pao, a
former Hmong leader, their relations insist that the men have
nothing to do with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 Hmong live in America, most of whom arrived
after the Communists took over. Like Cuban-Americans, they are a
vocal pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   Now Laos has another problem with disappearances. Recently,
several Thais have vanished near the border, which has prompted
calls for an inquiry from people in Bangkok. Laos can hardly afford
to alienate Thailand, the richest of its neighbors, and a major
source of visitors, especially to the country's profitable
casinos. &QL;

   ASTANA _ The election victory last month of Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, was hailed by the presidents of the
ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. But in private they are anxious
to see what policies Putin will have in store for Russia's former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The American government, however, has wasted no time in
asserting its interests in the oil-rich region by dispatching a
series of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the CIA, George Tennet, and the FBI's director,
Louis Freeh, both visited the region immediately after the Russian
election.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on their heels came Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, who travelled to the capitals of Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and
Uzbekistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission was to discuss regional security and democracy with
the three countries' authoritarian presidents. Each was offered $3
million to assist in dealing with an increasing cross-border flow
of weapons, drugs and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the carrot came the stick: Mrs. Albright
admonished the presidents for the manifest shortcomings of recent
elections in all three countries, for persecuting political
opponents and, in Uzbekistan, for using the threat of Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism to repress the Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Asian presidents were evidently flattered
by such a high-level American charm offensive, it may not have the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is our God-given neighbor,'' says Nursultan Nazarbaev,
Kazakhstan's president. He would like to establish a political and
economic partnership with Russia, but also enjoy close relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia matters, not least because a third of the country's
population is Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Kirgizstan, one of the smaller countries in Central Asia, also
has little choice about where to look for friends. Last autumn,
hundreds of Islamic militants invaded southern Kirgizstan, taking
four Japanese geologists hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were caught unprepared and Kirgizstan's
president, Askar Akaev, asked Russia for help. After two months,
the hostages were released and the kidnappers escaped to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before Mrs. Albright's arrival in Kirgizstan, Russia's
spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had met Akaev in the
capital, Bishkek, and Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, in the
Uzbek capital, Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed joint measures to combat terrorism and religious
extremism. Yastrzhembsky believes that there is a connection
between the rebels in Chechnya, the incursion in Kirgizstan and
terrorist bombings in Uzbekistan in February last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's argument that democracy is the best defense
against extremism probably fell on deaf ears in Uzbekistan. Karimov
has antagonized many of his citizens by muzzling any form of
opposition, arresting thousands after last year's bomb blasts, in
which he himself narrowly escaped death.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think his iron rule is at least partly responsible
for the extremism he is now struggling against. Russia says it is
ready to help and will do so without making demands for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The one issue on which America's dogged efforts to influence
Central Asia's leaders may pay off is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The American government is determined to decrease Central Asia's
dependence on Russia's pipelines for transporting oil to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarbaev, who would like to see several pipelines built so that
Kazakhstan can be as independent as possible, has reiterated his
commitment to a 1,730-km (1,075-mile) oil pipeline to run from
Azerbaijan's capital Baku on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is due to start next year, but the pipeline will be
economic only if Kazakhstan commits 20 million tons of oil a year
to the project. Recently, its officials have seemed to be backing
away from any such commitment, perhaps because they think
Kazakhstan will not be able to produce enough oil, at least before
2004.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States cannot stop Russia from resuming a leading
role in Central Asia, the Americans hope they can at least prevent
a reunification with Russia of some of the former Soviet republics.
They may not succeed even in this aim.
</P>
<P>
   When Putin became Russia's acting president at the end of last
year, Slavic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan called for
referendums on joining the Russia-Belarus Union. Though there is
little support for this among the non-Slav population, many people
feel that their future would be safer under Russian protection.
</P>
<P>
   Independence is attractive, but the countries of Central Asia,
with small populations in relation to their size, feel vulnerable
to Islamic ambitions from Afghanistan. China, too, a giant
neighbor, is historically distrusted by Central Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may be a friend, but it is far away. &QL;

<P>
   RIYADH _ The view from the bluffs above the Wadi al-Laban gully
in Riyadh encapsulates the dilemma facing Saudi Arabia's
less-than-harmonious royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The locals who gather there at sunset have come to admire the
elegant and expensive new suspension bridge that links a once
isolated quarter to the center of the city. But, in the distance,
hawk-eyed visitors can make out the cranes that Prince Abdelaziz
bin Fahd, one of King Fahd's sons, is using to build himself a
grandiose replica of Spain's Alhambra palace.
</P>
<P>
   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as
the price for the rapid development and relative stability that
they have brought to the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Saudi Arabia's almost limitless reserves of oil are no
longer quite enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a
steep $25 or so a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The sums are alarmingly simple. In 1999, Saudi Arabia clocked up
its 17th straight year of deficits. Public debt has reached around
120 percent of national income, which is about the same level as
Lebanon's, impoverished after its long years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The government calculates that the electricity industry alone
will require investment of $80 billion over the next 20 years to
cater to the country's mushrooming population. But last year, with
salaries and interest payments eating up most of its revenue, it
could set aside only $450 million for infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
   The government's problems are all the greater since most Saudis
look to it, not the private sector, to provide employment.
</P>
<P>
   The population has been growing a couple of percentage points
faster than the economy for most of the past 20 years, helping
income per person to tumble from $16,650 in dear-oil 1981 to $6,526
in cheap-oil 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has always tended to inflate its population
figures, perhaps to exaggerate its place in the world: it claims
around 16 million Saudi citizens, but some think that 12 million or
so might be nearer the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, to generate new jobs for all the young Saudi men
entering the labor force (let alone the few women who make it), the
economy would have to grow by some 6 percent annually. Last year it
managed about 1 percent, and this year it may reach 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself
and all its citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   These worries have impressed themselves on Crown Prince
Abdullah, now in effect Saudi Arabia's ruler since his elder
brother, King Fahd, is a sick man.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when the oil price rises, Saudi Arabia's rulers dust
off their laurels and lay thoughts of reform to rest. But Prince
Abdullah has bluntly declared that all Saudis will have to tighten
their belts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, as the price of Saudi crude tripled, he
doubled visa fees for foreign laborers, introduced a hefty airport
departure tax and slashed subsidies on electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, with oil prices at their peak, the cabinet
approved a package of new measures to promote foreign investment.
The state telephone company will soon be sold off, with electricity
firms to follow.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist body has been set up in a bid to persuade Saudis to
spend their vacations at home and to persuade foreigners to visit.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered new economic council has promised to regulate the
stock market, revamp the tax code, amend the property and
employment laws and get the country into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds wonderfully resolute but, in the words of a jaded
banker, there is no such thing as a Saudi fast-track. It took the
council two months even to meet. And as Prince Abdullah tries to
ratchet up government revenue, his more profligate relations are
busy increasing their spending to match.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, thanks to rising oil prices, the treasury raked in $7
billion more than expected _ but over $4 billion of that
disappeared in a bonanza of unbudgeted expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent countryside tour, Prince Sultan, Prince Abdullah's
brother, rival and potential successor, dished out scholarships,
cars and cash to assorted supplicants with gay abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Saudis love to trade tales of royals muscling in on profitable
businesses, appropriating land or flogging their grace-and-favor
tickets on the national airline.
</P>
<P>
   As one of a group of powerful brothers, Prince Abdullah can read
the riot act all he wants but, until he becomes king, he does not
really have the authority to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, humbler Saudis are feeling the pinch. Many now
welcome the relatively menial jobs they once would have deemed too
lowly for a Saudi citizen, as hotel receptionists, for instance, or
supermarket cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, there were almost no Saudi security guards; now
foreigners are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   A disgruntled bedouin, who uses a borrowed car as an unlicensed
taxi, complains that he cannot pay the increased power bill for his
family of five. A teacher bemoans the rise in class sizes and the
fall in standards at state schools.
</P>
<P>
   Local journalists mutter about a crime wave. Yet, so far,
dissent remains muted. With a bit of bullying and bribing, the
government stamped out the anti-royal whispering campaign that was
stirred up by Islamists in the mid-1990s. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   PORT OF SPAIN _ Africa apart, nowhere in the world suffers more
from AIDS than the countries of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 percent of their population, or half a million people,
are infected with HIV (the virus which causes the disease).
</P>
<P>
   Though this is a much lower rate than in several African
countries, the impact is broad, growing, and potentially
devastating to what are already some of the most vulnerable
countries in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Some places are worse hit than others. In Haiti, the incidence
of the disease is similar to that in sub-Saharan Africa: 12 percent
of Haitians in urban areas are infected, and 5 percent of those in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   At the main hospital in Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, a
study last year found nearly 40 percent of young men's deaths were
linked to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, Guyana and the Bahamas, routine
testing of pregnant women and blood donors (groups not especially
at risk) shows a prevalence of well over 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly effects of these figures will become fully clear only
in coming decades. AIDS is already the largest single cause of
death among young men (aged 15-44) in the English-speaking
Caribbean; within 20 years, it is expected to account for
three-quarters of all such deaths, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   The number of orphans in the Caribbean, now 83,000, is likely to
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate by the World Bank, the disease has
already cost the Caribbean region some 6 percent of its potential
wealth, because of lost workers, increased dependency on those who
do work, higher medical spending and reduced savings.
</P>
<P>
   Public awareness and understanding of AIDS has been slow in
coming. Health campaigns have faced big obstacles in efforts to
change sexual practices (a billboard in Guyana used to advise men
to ``wear a fresh condom every time'').
</P>
<P>
   At first, treatment of those who admitted they had the disease
could be rudimentary and cruel. Some AIDS sufferers were allowed to
die in the streets; some hospital staff refused to touch corpses of
victims; and in Barbados an infected man was even stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, better drugs and education have improved matters,
but problems remain. Peggy McEvoy, who heads UNAIDS in the
Caribbean, says the region is particularly vulnerable because its
people are young, and many are sexually active from an early age.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong influences of churches, whether Catholic or
evangelical Protestant, has led to public reluctance to discuss sex
or encourage the use of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception to this bleak regional picture, as in many
other health matters, is Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its historical intolerance of homosexuality, Fidel
Castro's regime has set up an effective screening and reporting
system for AIDS. As a result, the infection rate in Cuba has been
kept remarkably low, at just 0.02 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, some efforts are being made to tackle the
disease. A plan backed by all the region's governments aims to
boost public-health education.
</P>
<P>
   Good screening programs in the Bahamas have helped to slow the
infection rate, and drug treatments there and in Barbados that help
to prevent pregnant mothers passing the disease to their children
have been copied elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But too often politicians are not leading. ``In some countries,
during election years there is a deafening silence on the issue for
fear of clashes with the church,'' says McEvoy. &QL;

   It was not a replay of riotous Seattle, but neither was it a
damp squib. Some 10,000 protesters descended on Washington, D.C.,
last weekend, intent on shutting down the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on April 16 and 17.
Despite a few photographs of students being clobbered, the police
were widely praised for doing a good job of containment. As D.C.
Police Chief Charles Ramsey, seen chatting with demonstrators,
said, ``They're just kids with a cause. God bless 'em. That's what
America is all about.'' &QL;

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet
Central Asian republics. It dispatched a series of senior
government officials _ including CIA head George Tennet, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as

enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a steep $25 or
so a barrel. With income per person having tumbled from $16,650 in
dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully
clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself and all of its
citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul. &QL;

   For too long many people who live in the cities and towns that
flank the mighty Mississippi have forgotten that a river as grand
and nearly as long as the Nile flows beside them. But not for much
longer. The Mississippi is enjoying a new boom, and a new
appreciation of what the Algonquin Indians called michi-sipi, the
Big Water. &QL;

   It was not a replay of riotous Seattle, but neither was it a
damp squib. Some 10,000 protesters descended on Washington, D.C.,
last weekend, intent on shutting down the spring meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on April 16 and 17.
Despite a few photographs of students being clobbered, the police
were widely praised for doing a good job of containment. As D.C.
Police Chief Charles Ramsey, seen chatting with demonstrators,
said, ``They're just kids with a cause. God bless 'em. That's what
America is all about.'' &QL;

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet
Central Asian republics. It dispatched a series of senior
government officials _ including CIA head George Tennet, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

   Saudis have long accepted their rulers' lavish way of life as
the price for rapid development and relative stability. But Saudi
Arabia's almost limitless reserves of oil are no longer quite
enough to pay for everything _ even with prices at a steep $25 or
so a barrel. With income per person having tumbled from $16,650 in
dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully
clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself and all of its
citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul. &QL;

   In all the upheaval that has been brought about by changing

maintained its aura of 1960s Organization Man. Driving to customer

changed little in decades. Alas, not for much longer. E-business,
transformer of all corporate processes, has arrived in the land of

 &HT;    SOME CALL FOR A LITTLE CIVILITY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, PLEASE
 &HT;    630&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enough, already! The purveyors of etiquette and
civility have had it up to their arched eyebrows with rude
political candidates and the unruly journalists who pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns may not be tea parties, but a little politeness in our
politics wouldn't hurt. It would even bring honest differences into
sharper focus, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the rules of etiquette that enable people to air
controversy,'' Judith Martin, better known as the columnist ``Miss
Manners,'' declaimed this week at a forum at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the controversy, the more rules you need,'' she
said, ticking off examples such as Robert's Rules of Order for
legislatures, the formalities of the courtroom and military
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Few such restraints exist on the campaign trail, where attack
ads smear opponents, candidates misstate each other's positions and
video masters use techno-tricks to ``morph'' a competitor's face
into something akin to Frankenstein. Add to that the rise is
surreptitious phone campaigns in which callers try to plant doubts
about an opposing candidate's character.
</P>
<P>
   These are all among the no-nos in ``The Little Book of Campaign
Etiquette,'' authored with a light touch by Stephen Hess of
Brookings and updated for this election year. The guide lays out
rules for the political road from A (for advertising without
distortion) to W (winning or losing with grace).
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, a collection of about 50 denominations known
as the Interfaith Alliance has drawn up its list of ``thou shalt
nots.'' The group denounces ``deception, half-truths, falsification
or innuendo,'' and calls on politicians to avoid all references
that tend to ``demonize or dehumanize those holding opinions
different from yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts are hardly the first attempts to bring civility to
a field that has long resisted taming.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, etiquette has been treated as such a sissy
restraint on virtue that obeying it must be a sign of moral
turpitude and defying it a sign of moral fervor,'' Miss Manners
writes in the introduction of Hess's book.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hess offers rules of etiquette for the campaigners, the
press and even the public.
</P>
<P>
   For candidates, he says that ``comparison,'' which highlights
legitimate policy differences, is good. But he says its evil twin,
``negative'' campaigning, is debasing American politics. Hess
defines ``negative'' campaigning as ``nasty and mean-spirited
remarks based on rumors, lies, and half-truths.''
</P>
<P>
   The book urges journalists to overcompensate for their biases,
stop using bellicose metaphors such as ``battleground'' and ``war
chests,'' and be willing to admit their own mistakes. ``Being a
professional should mean sometimes saying you're sorry,'' Hess
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign etiquette requires citizens to call ``local TV stations
and newspapers, as well as the headquarters of slandered
candidates, to register disgust'' whenever they receive a call that
appears to be part of a smear campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hess also assigns a rule of etiquette for sex scandals, which
during the Clinton administration have divided the public into
those who are outraged at the politician's misbehavior and those
who are angry at the news media for reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual misconduct should be part of campaign coverage, he says,
if the candidate lies about it or is currently involved in a
liaison, if the relationship affects the politician's public life,
or if the candidate is guilty of outright hypocrisy. The Wall
Street Journal's Albert R. Hunt, who formulated this scandal test
in 1992, told the Brookings gathering this week that he still
stands behind it.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether anyone will heed these rules of campaign
decorum.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent presidential primaries, all the major participants
signed on to the Interfaith Alliance campaign credo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential candidates affirmed civility as a concept
almost like motherhood and apple pie. It sounded like they were
running for Holy Man of the Year,'' said the Rev. C. Welton Gaddy,
executive director of the interfaith group.
</P>
<P>
   But when the campaign heated up, Gaddy acknowledged, the
promises went up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   His group has not given up, however. They announced this week
that more than two dozen congressional candidates from both parties
have endorsed its standards.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have signed up are Florida's three leading
candidates for U.S. Senate, Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher
and Rep. Bill McCollum, both Republicans, and Bill Nelson, the
Democratic state insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Also endorsing the standards are House candidates, including
Democrat Roger Kahn, who is running in Georgia's 7th Congressional
District, and Rep. Tom Sawyer, running for re-election in the 14th
District of Ohio.

FIGHT RACISM ACROSS THE RAINBOW, REV. JACKSON

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An open letter to the Rev. Jesse Jackson:
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, it was said the most dangerous place in the
world was the space between you and a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   Cute. But as I've said before, why shouldn't you be a publicity
hound? How can you not take advantage of your fame to advance the
cause of the week or the boycott of the month? It's your job. It's
what you do. It's who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Saw you were in the news again last week. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   You toured Gladstone Elementary School in Chicago and encouraged
education officials to improve conditions in minority-attended
schools. And you marched with 1,000 supporters to Cook County Jail
to protest racial profiling and to call for better treatment of
incarcerated minorities. Then you protested racial profiling in a
Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, your activities were well-documented by the media.
Good job, reverend. You keep walking and talking, we'll keep
writing and broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   In that same vein, I don't know what you've got on your calendar
this week, but might I bring something to your attention?
</P>
<P>
   It's an alleged hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, a 25-year-old man man was walking on the
South Side of Chicago about 6 p.m. last Monday, on his way from his
job at Columbia College to an art studio, when he was suddenly and
without provocation attacked by a teen-ager wielding a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager allegedly bashed the young man in the head with
the club, causing a deep gash that would require multiple stitches.
As he swung the club, the attacker allegedly made a pointed
reference to the young man's race and said something like, ``You
... shouldn't be here. ... you don't belong!''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose we can't be shocked that this sort of thing still goes
on in the year 2000, reverend _ but we can be outraged, appalled
and disgusted. What kind of world do we live in when a young man is
attacked in broad daylight simply because of the color of his skin?
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago police spokesman told me that a 14-year-old suspect
has admitted he attacked the young man and made the racial remarks.
The juvenile _ already on probation for a stickup _ was picked out
of a lineup by the victim. He faces felony charges of aggravated
battery and committing a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Call a press conference, Rev. Jackson. Take a photo op with the
victim. Demand justice. Lead a march through the neighborhood.
Initiate a healing process within the hateful soul of this young
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what am I doing, advising you? You're the master of
protest theater! You don't need any tips from me.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I haven't mentioned, though I can't see why it would
make any difference in the grand scheme of things:
</P>
<P>
   The victim is white. His alleged attacker, who reportedly
shouted, ``You white boys shouldn't be here! Go on, whitey, you
don't belong''?
</P>
<P>
   Black.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting statistic, reverend. According to the
Chicago Commission on Human Relations, in 1999 there were 20
reports of blacks attacking whites because of race, and 22 reports
of whites attacking blacks.
</P>
<P>
   So it's about ``even,'' if we can use such a term to describe
this garbage.
</P>
<P>
   As you've no doubt heard over the years, Rev. Jackson, a lot of
white people wonder why you seem to be concerned exclusively with
injustices, inequality, hatred and prejudice as it affects black
people. Your critics seem to think you should feel everyone's pain
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair. On the other hand, why wouldn't you be offended
by this alleged incident of last week? Why wouldn't you take a
public stance against hate crime on any side of the rainbow
coalition?
</P>
<P>
   Even from a cynical standpoint, imagine the public relations
value in making this your cause celebre of the moment. Even your
most virulent and vocal detractors would have to admit you'd thrown
them a curve. Even the whites who can't say your name without
making a sour face would have to give you credit for being an equal
opportunity crusader for justice.

 &HT;    Maybe you should let your child wear the Emperor's new uniform
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ If there is something that I understand less
than why we really need uniforms at our local junior high, it is
why some parents seem to be so upset over the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The high percentage of teens wear uniforms daily: blue jeans and
a t-shirt. They all look alike now. With little exception, there
isn't a thread of intentional individuality in clothing from ages
12 to 17. For teens, being an individual is not seen as a good
thing and this conformity is supported, sometimes forcefully, by
the parents themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (This, of course, is also the reason I am baffled about why we
need uniforms, but, that is another column.)
</P>
<P>
   But for a couple of months, anyway, your child will trot off to
school looking ever so nice and neat. Is that a bad thing? Haven't
you been trying to do that forever?
</P>
<P>
   Rejoice and take plenty of pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Because, unfortunately, it will not last. Within just a few
months time, the uniforms will get scruffy or show fraying or
downright holes. Some will lose buttons that will never be
repaired. Some will be put in the wash with red or purple socks and
will forever carry the patina of the laundry-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, perhaps they will change the uniforms to tie-die
so that the coming mustard and ketchup stains will be
complimentary, or at least unnoticeable.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems to me that the absolute worst thing you can say
about uniforms is that they will have no effect at all. And however
much you hate the idea, you must agree to the fact that a few
students may actually benefit from the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   So why the uproar from some parents? I haven't heard a single
compelling argument that uniforms will hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   If you are really concerned about your child's stunted
individuality, I suggest you let them practice it with abandon
elsewhere. Let them wear their beer T-shirts to church. Take them
out to eat wearing the Emperor's new uniform. Let them be free!
</P>
<P>
   To those who think that we are asking too much of our dear,
sweet children, think just a moment please. Most of us send them to
school expecting them to eat cafeteria food, others willfully send
them off on speeding school buses. Your concern is in the wrong
place.
</P>
<P>
   In more than three years, no public discussion has depressed me
more than those who oppose the necessity of providing uniforms for
those who cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   Uniforms may be less expensive than designer clothes, but they
may be much more expensive than some of the clothes needy children
were going to wear.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major selling points of this whole program is
self-esteem for those who cannot afford good clothes, remember?
</P>
<P>
   Some families have a ritual each year of buying new school
clothes and think that is the way it is for all children.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Most of us don't understand what real poverty is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   There are more children than we would like to believe in our
community who simply don't get new store-bought clothes _ ever.
They use hand-me-downs from relatives or they go to resale shops
and get them at much-reduced prices. Some simply fit into the
clothes they wore last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful that, as the program begins, private donations
have been helping these children, but school district officials
need to understand this is our responsibility, donations or not.
When donations dry up over the months or years, poor kids will
still be needing uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   If we aren't prepared to use tax money to pay for these few
uniforms, then we shouldn't begin the program at all.
</P>
<P>
   These are the students who might actually benefit. We should not
leave them without a safety net.

 &HT;    Out of Egypt: Tombs, temples, people preserved in memory
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABU SIMBEL, Egypt _ She was sitting atop her suitcase as I
struggled to get it closed. Packing for the trip home is our
biggest challenge when we go abroad. A souvenir here and a souvenir
there, and pretty soon we have a yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can hang on two more days I think you'll survive,'' she
said. Abu Simbel, home of the Temple of Ramses II and our last
stop, lies deep in Africa, near the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope so,'' I said. ``I'd hate to die over here and wind
up just another mummy.'' After viewing the mummies in the King Tut
collection in Cairo, I don't think I'd especially enjoy being one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mention it before we left home,'' she said, ``but
when I told our pastor we were planning a trip to Egypt he said an
elderly member of his former church died over here. His wife
thought it too much trouble to bring him home, so she just left him
in one of the mausoleums.'' One thing I appreciate about my wife is
her sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Our excursion to Cairo and up the Nile River has been
enlightening. I learned not to say Sahara Desert. Sahara means
desert in Arabic. Saying Sahara Desert is like saying Desert
Desert, or like saying Liberal Democrat back home in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Our Egyptologist guide cleared up a misunderstanding about the
Pyramids. They were not built by slaves toiling under whips of
cruel overseers as depicted by Hollywood. They were built by local
farmers, who when the growing season was over, were hired out to
wrestle 20-ton blocks of granite to pick up a little extra change
from wages paid by generous kings.
</P>
<P>
   That's their story and they're sticking to it. We had a similar
situation in Fayette County in the '30s and early '40s when farmers
were hired on at the peach packing plant in Woolsey after lay-by
time.
</P>
<P>
   On the voyage up the Nile and down into Africa, our numerous
stops included a visit to King Tut's tomb, the temple at Luxor
where terrorists machine-gun tourists, and the Temple of Karnak,
made famous by Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has no shortage of antiquities. In fact, if the Russians
hadn't sprung for a loan to finance a dam for the world's largest
man-made lake at Aswan, inundating thousands of acres and hundreds
of tombs and temples, we'd have been lucky to be home for Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians are proud of their embalming skills. They were
described in detail at almost every stop. Although this tended to
become redundant and a little boring, it was worth the time. If
Social Security goes into the tank, I'm now qualified for at least
part-time work at one of the H.M. Patterson &AMP; Son funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a bow-splintering collision with another boat on a
sailing trip at Aswan, where sailors are endowed with skills
similar to New York taxi drivers, the highlight of our Nile cruise
was a celebration of Jim and Marjorie Waggoner's 30th wedding
anniversary. The Waggoners have one of the most successful mixed
marriages I know about. She is a devout Florida Gator and he an
unabashed barking Georgia Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Since they bake a cake and pass out free champagne, it's prudent
to line up several anniversaries and birthdays whenever you're
aboard ship with a tour group. My colleague Bobby Mobley has become
a much sought-after traveling companion after word got around that
he can always be depended on for one of each on any given trip.
</P>
<P>
   English-language newspapers in Egypt carry a lot of interesting
news that is ignored at home. I was surprised to learn that
transplanting pig parts into humans has become so successful that
only the eyes are not used. Pigs have red eyes and nobody wants red
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazette also reported a local trend I wouldn't mind seeing
take hold at home. You can rent a preacher in Cairo. The reverend
will come to your home for a set fee and deliver a sermon as long
or short as you specify, and since you're paying, say pretty much
what you want to hear. You don't have to hold hands with strangers
or try to sing politically correct hymns even the choir doesn't
know.
</P>
<P>
   According to our Egyptologist guide, average per capita income
is a little more than U.S. $1,300. The low figure isn't all that
surprising considering that a man can have up to four wives and has
to pray five times a day. Not much time is left for earning a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Counting all the bad things that could have happened, including
Russian-made airplanes that make funny noises and are flown by
pilots who might take a notion to drop in on Allah, this trip
hasn't been all that bad. There is one good side effect I had not
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have any social engagements in Peachtree City or north
Atlanta right after we get home?'' I asked my wife. ``It would be
an ideal time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one in Peachtree City,'' she replied. ``Why is it an
ideal time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because with two weeks away from the garden and not having to
grease the bushhog, my fingernails are clean.''

 &HT;    Big brother tool may be watching
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While nosing around on the Internet the other day, I
came across a Web site that will delight woodworkers who have a
sense of humor, especially woodworkers with a sense of humor who
feel the demonizing of firearms has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   The site, called Mothers Insisting on Licensed Tools, can be
reached via http://www.frenchu.com/tpg/drill.html, and is quite
large for a spoof site.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing about it, once you start reading the many
entries, is that it's really straightforward; it just puts a nasty
spin on tools.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for instance, a picture of a standard half-inch drill
labeled ``The Assault Drill,'' with arrows pointing to its features
_ it's a .50 caliber tool, it has not one but two pistol grips, can
be set for full automatic and with the right bit, it's
armor-piercing.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse is the Milwaukee Sawsall, a standard reciprocating
saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industrial monster not only has NO child safety features
to prevent young hands from starting it, but it also has a giant
blade with sharp teeth fully exposed with no guards of any kind!
</P>
<P>
   ``When we at MILT saw one of these monsters, all we could do was
murmur to each other that if we had set out to design a tool for
the sole purpose of maiming children, this is what it would look
like. A 10-amp motor and over 3,000 strokes per minute _ My God,
what are these people thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs that kind of cutting power? Can you imagine how
quickly the delicate wrists or neck of your toddler would surrender
to this reciprocating Blade of Death?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, MILT reported, hardware stores are routinely
selling these machines to children, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   MILT sponsors tool buy-back programs, presents an assortment of
occasionally gruesome Biblical quotes to show that tools are
anathema, and, best of all, presents case studies under the heading
of True Tool Crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides employing tools other than firearms or knives are not
at all uncommon, of course, but some of these are priceless in
their descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   From the Manchester Guardian:
</P>
<P>
   ``... Holleran told psychiatrists that Mr. Stephenson had
criticised him for not lifting the seat when he went to the toilet,
and had hit him on the chin ... Holleran had then fetched the
hammer and hit his landlord as he sat in an armchair (killing him).
</P>
<P>
   ``Holleran left and joined a Christian sect in Northampton.''
</P>
<P>
   I think we had all better catch up on our dues to the National
Tool Users Association. You know how it works. First they'll come
for our table saws, and they won't be satisfied until they've taken
our chisels, too.

 &HT;    Christian musicians gather to focus on God
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ One of the little-publicized parts of Gospel
Music Week is the Sunday-night worship service. It's the one time
of the week when the Christian music artists, retailers, industry
representatives and media who are in town for seminars, networking
and lots of performances forget about careers and appearances and
gather as a body to focus on God.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, it is among the week's highlights, and this year
was no exception. In 1999, the event was moved to the Gaylord
Center and was open to the public for the first time. Sunday's
musical service, however, was only for those attending Gospel Music
Week and returned to the more intimate surroundings of Ryman
Auditorium, an appropriate venue because it was once a church and
still feels like holy ground.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 well-known worship leaders, from Fred Hammond to
Michael W. Smith to Darlene Zchesch, led songs during the 2
1/2-hour service. From the boisterous celebration of Hammond
leading ``We Lift Up Your Name From Praise'' to the humility of
Smith choosing others' praise songs rather than his own, to Pete
Shambrook's quiet, awe-filled plea, ``Give Me Jesus,'' the service
ebbed and flowed in a river of unself-conscious expression.
</P>
<P>
   The only nonmusical moments were a prayer and benediction led by
Gospel Music Association Chaplain Darrell A. Harris, who during one
particularly moving song could be spotted in the wings offstage
with his hands raised, dancing to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   The modern worship songs led by Shambrook and Rita Springer were
intimate and painfully honest, emphasizing God as
overcomer-redeemer and humanity as broken, yet salvageable. As a
counterpoint, Fernando Ortega offered the traditional hymns ``Come
O' Redeemer Come'' and ``Come Thou Fount,'' whose lyrics showed
that hymn writers' subject matter hasn't changed as much as some
critics of current music might think.
</P>
<P>
   The service seemed a call to surrender all to God, a spirit
summed up by Zchesch in ``Potters Hand'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Take me, mold me/Use me, fill me/I give my life to the
Potter's hand./Call me, guide me/Lead me, walk beside me/I give my
life to the Potter's hand.'' Amid all the ``business'' of Gospel
Music Week, Sunday's service offered a much-needed pause for
spiritual refreshment and renewal _ and a healthy motivation check.

   OLD WEST-LAW-ENFORCEMENT _ WACO, Texas _ In the movies the good

reality of the past is not that clear, and the reality of the

   ONCE-AND-AGAIN _ A few weeks ago, I was on the phone with a
publicist for HBO. After we chatted at length about The Sopranos,
we turned our attention to other TV shows we like and don't like.
``Do you watch Once and Again?'' I asked. ``Nah, it's too sappy,''
the publicist said. ``I saw the first two episodes and stopped
watching.'' Of course, I told her that was a mistake. A big one, in
fact. Not only is Once and Again, whose season finale airs Monday,
far from sappy, it remains TV's best new drama. Calm down, West
Wing fans. NBC's political drama comes in a close second.

   BOOKS-SOUTH-MYSTERIES _ Southern mystery writers have learned a
valuable lesson from such masters of the genre as Raymond Chandler
and Dashiell Hammett: Where a crime takes place is as important as
whodunit. Carl Hiaasen's novels of greedy developers destroying the
environment would not be the same outside of ecologically fragile
south Florida. James W. Hall's bone-fishing loner Thorn would be
lost away from the Florida Keys. And Kathy Hogan Trocheck's
Callahan Garrity would seem out of place cleaning houses anywhere

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Five years ago, when the Library of America series
inducted Raymond Chandler into what amounts to a hall of fame of
the native tongue, it was acknowledgment that the detective mystery
had achieved a certain respectability. ``As I look back on my own
stories,'' he wrote in ``The Simple Art of Murder,'' ``it would be
absurd if I did not wish they had been better. But if they had been
much better they would not have been published.'' Chandler wrote
pulp fiction, and he neither apologized for it nor thought it
literary. And yet literary it was _ in the creation of a believable
character and a psychological world, in the cadence of his
sentences, in the concrete images. (Skube, Atlanta

   COXNET HEALTHY LIVING 0418: TREATING SHYNESS -- A professor at

are either triggered or worsened by stress. ``We don't know exactly
how or why stress triggers these diseases. And people don't have to
have any psychological disorder. It's just the way they deal with
stress, how the stress affects their body,'' she said. (Susman,

and lots of performances forget about careers and appearances and
gather as a body to focus on God. (Lloyd, Dayton Daily News). 11.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I've been married for 14 years to a wonderful guy,
who has no concept of romance. He thinks romance and sex are the
same, and expects me to be ready whenever he is.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried everything _ hints, suggestions and coming right
out with it, but to no avail. I can't remember the last time I had
a climax. Sex seems so dry and mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   Am I crazy or do women need more time? I would give anything for
a soft touch or a compliment. Most of the time I feel like he
doesn't care as long as he is satisfied, and that is making me
depressed. Should I accept the fact that I will never enjoy sex
again? _ R.D.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It is time to have a serious conversation with your
husband. Criticizing his technique will only make him mad. Why not
say to him: ``Listen, I want you to be my love slave tonight. I'm
going to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. Then I'll be
your love slave tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   This should be fun for both of you. Most men haven't really been
taught much about sex. You're absolutely right that women need more
time to become relaxed and lubricated, but don't give up on him or
the relationship. You need to be braver and more assertive. Explain
to him _ in a playful way _ what you'd like him to do.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: My girlfriend of six months told me that she
wanted to break up with me because she goes to college about three
hours from were I live. She also told me that she has mixed
feelings about the decision because she really likes me but wants
to spend time with her friends at school.
</P>
<P>
   She usually comes down to my place every weekend. She said that
she still wants to come visit me and told me not to jump into
another relationship right away because she may change her mind. I
told her it would be too hard for me to spend time with her if we
weren't going out. She said it could help her decision.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to come down and see me on a weekend that I have a
party arranged. I told her I didn't think it would be a good idea,
but she said she really wants to come. What should we do? _ C.S.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The two of you need to decide to fish or cut bait. If
you really care about her, and want to continue the relationship,
let her come to the party. Don't make silly sounding excuses that
you've made other plans.
</P>
<P>
   If you want her to be in your life, then let her be in your
life. If you want to break it off, be honest with her. Tell her
you're ending the relationship because she lives far away and she
has said that she is less interested in the two of you staying
together.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. JOY: I am a happily married man of 61. My lovely wife
is 57. We have been in love for about 19 years and married 16
years. We had enjoyed a wonderful, exciting and satisfying sex life
for most of that time _ until menopause came into the picture. My
wife does not want to use estrogen replacement because it increases
the risk of developing certain types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   I will not offer an opinion, mostly because I don't want her to
think that it matters so much to me whether or not we have a sex
life _ and it doesn't, if that is what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think our sex life is essentially over or will my wife
continue to have some interest? How should I conduct myself in this
circumstance? _ R.L.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Don't give up on your sex life so quickly. Sex is a
normal part of a relationship and can be mutually satisfying to
both of you as you grow older. You're asking a perfectly legitimate
question, but you're asking the wrong person. You should be asking
your wife.
</P>
<P>
   While your wife may not want to take estrogen replacement, there
are herbal remedies available. In terms of lubrication, you can
always apply a topical ointment. While the jury is still out on
estrogen replacement, Viagra turns out to be a useful prescription
for women as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways the two of you can be physical and sensual with
one another without being sexual, per say.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than making unilateral decisions or being a martyr, have
a serious discussion with your wife. Tell her: ``Look, I'll love
you to my dying day, whether we're sexual or not, but I miss our
sex life. Do you? And what can we do about it?''

GUNS ARE ANOTHER CAMPAIGN WEAPON FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition'' is the capsule
description of the gun policy of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While he gets queasy when the National Rifle Association accuses
Bill Clinton of outright murder and mayhem, the Texas governor is
foursquare in favor of packing heat in your pocket, purse,
waistband, or ankle holster.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make the best of a loser hand on gun control, Bush
played the ``character education'' card in a Texas elementary
school memorial service commemorating the 13 Columbine students and
two teachers slain a year ago. Bush, who believes that the
government cannot be trusted with your tax money or your census,
suggested that the government be responsible for ``character
education'' in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That's how best to curb school and workplace massacres, the
Republican candidate for president said. Bush is also for a
lifetime ban on gun possession for every juvenile offender, which
sounds tough until you realize how hard it is to enforce a law like
that.
</P>
<P>
   They already have ``character education'' in Texas schools. And
since his state has something approaching 150,000 of the nearly 2
million convicts imprisoned in the United States, they might want
to reexamine this ``character education'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   With a school or workplace shooting somewhere in the United
States nearly every week, gun control may be a bigger factor in the
November election than ever before. Vice President Gore wants photo
licenses for gun buyers and a paper trail on every gun sold. Gore
would prevent people from buying more than one gun a month and make
them wait three days for that.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Gore grew up in a rural, progun state, but he's moved
leftward more nimbly than Bush, whose campaign depends on shoving
him closer to the middle on issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his first term as governor, Bush signed a ``right to carry''
law that made it legal in Texas to carry a concealed handgun. Three
years ago he made it even easier to carry a concealed firearm by
amending the part of the law that barred concealed guns in churches
and synagogues that don't post signs asking you to park your heat
at the door. Now you can pray in Texas if you're packing.
</P>
<P>
   The gun issue is a classic case of the Democrats marching faster
to the pace of social change while Republicans cling to the old
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, with some enthusiasm, and Bush, dragging his cowboy boots
in the dust, both support the current ban on assault weapons like
the murder weapons used at Columbine. And both support instant
background checks at gunshow sales, bans on juveniles owning
assault weapons, import of high-capacity ammo clips, and raising
the legal age for possessing a handgun from 18 to 21. During the
primary season, Bush said initially he was for ``voluntary''
efforts to install trigger locks on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Later he modified that to say he'd sign a law requiring trigger
locks to be sold with new handguns. Bush vows more money to enforce
existing gun laws, and he'd require jail time for young gun
offenders. A Pew Research poll gave Gore a marginal edge on Bush
when voters were asked whom they trusted more on gun issues (Gore
41 percent, Bush 37), and the Democrats edged Republicans 36-30 on
the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately four times every hour, another American falls dead
to gun violence. Of those who get shot and survive, their
individual medical treatment costs on average $145,000. It's
estimated that gun violence costs $20 billion a year in medical
expenses and lost productivity. We have stricter laws on cars, lawn
mowers, and chainsaws than on guns in some respects.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times every day, a young person perishes by gun. The video
of the Columbine kids fleeing their two murderous classmates is all
over TV these days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should carry most of the rural Western and Southern states
where gun control is unpopular with conservative legislators and
NRA types. Gore will carry the Northeast, California, and
traditionally Democratic enclaves like West Virginia, which is
progun but votes Democrat for president.
</P>
<P>
   The swing voters in the swing states will determine the election
if things go according to form. Those are the 20 percent of the
voters in states like Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and
New Jersey who are weak on party identification.
</P>
<P>
   The women among them are liable to be more for Gore than Bush,
and guns play a big role with motivating that subgroup. The men
among the undecided tend, like most male voters, to be more
pro-Bush than pro-Gore. Then there is another set of odds that must
be factored in. That is the likelihood that there will be several
more multiple shooting deaths between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   It is very bad news that those are very good odds.
</P>
<P>

   With Passover beginning Wednesday, there's no better time to
check in with Kosherfinder, a site that celebrates all things
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The opening page includes links to a special Passover report,
and also features sections on health and nutrition, wine, kosher
dishes, books, colleges and dispatches from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``on campus'' features notes that this summer,
20 Dartmouth students will be participating in ``Israel 2000,'' a
program that allows Jewish college students who have never been to
Israel to visit the Jewish Holy Land for free.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the news section led off with a British court ruling
against historian David Irving, who challenged the scope of the
Holocaust. Irving had sued an American scholar for libel, claiming
she had labeled him a ``Holocaust denier.'' In ruling against
Irving, a British judge labeled him ``anti-Semitic and racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Passover section is especially interesting, even for the
uninitiated. It explains the origin of the Jewish holiday, the
significance of the Seder plate and how to prepare for Passover,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe section (known alternately as ``Kosher Classics'' and
``Bubbie's Kitchen''), offers Passover specialties, such as
cauliflower kugel with mushrooms.

   In the problems-we-wish-we-had department, there's a big piece
on ``sudden-wealth syndrome'' {ndash} essentially people who strike
it rich investing in Internet stocks or somesuch and immediately
plunge into depression. Apparently, psychiatrists solve the problem
by charging outrageous fees and siphoning off some of that
new-found wealth. Favorite line in the piece, ``Once you're done
sneering{hellip}'' Oh, I don't think we'll ever be done. There is
also a fairly useful story on tech investing, which tries to steer
you toward the stock that isn't about to crash into a bridge
abutment and burst into a ball of flame. Bottom line: You might
have better luck picking winners at Phoenix Greyhound Park. There
is also an interesting short written by someone who made a cell

   It's only like a page long, but Chris Harris' takeoff on the
Census (an ersatz letter written by Census director Kenneth
Prewitt) is one long belly laugh. A few samples: ``We have been
accused of undercounting certain segments of the population. This
is simply not true, and we think all three of our nation's Native
Americans will back us up on this.'' Or, ``Moreover, although there
are no problems with the Census, we are constantly making
improvements to correct those problems.'' There is an interesting
piece on the Russian mob in America, noting FBI warnings that the
so-called ``Mafiya'' could soon become the No.1 criminal
organization in the U.S. Finally, an explanation for the popularity
of Yakov Smirnoff. A well-done piece on obsessive-compulsive
disorder questions whether it's such a great idea to drown the
``doubting disease'' in an ocean of Prozac.

   TRUE WEST
</P>
<P>
   This fun little mag , published in Cave Creek, devotes itself to
debunking some of the myths of the Old West perpetuated by
Hollywood. For example, John Wayne didn't really die in
(beginitalic)The Cowboys(enditalic). So you can stop being so mad
at Bruce Dern. Seriously, this month's issue notes that not all
cowboys carried Colt Peacemakers. Some, including notorious outlaws
Frank and Jesse James, were more partial to Remington revolvers.
Also, Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane were not lovers, despite
what the supermarket tabloids said. There is also an interesting
piece on Western ``stock actors,'' who traveled from town to town
performing in different plays, making the grandiose sum of $8 per
week. The most famous stock performer may be John Wilkes Booth,
Lincoln's assassin.
</P>
<P>
   VANITY FAIR
</P>
<P>
   There is the usual Hollywood feature, this time on flaky cover
girl Kim Basinger, the Janie one-note actress who is always being
compared to someone who was a lot better. In this case, it's
Marilyn Monroe. Puh-lease. We get to hear about her angst over
being famous, beautiful and married to hunk movie star Alec
Baldwin. It's a heavy load to bear. Searching for more fluff? The
magazine doesn't disappoint, posing Sarah Ferguson in a blazer and
fishnet stockings for a Q&AMP;A. On the serious side, there is a book
excerpt on the real-life maritime disaster that inspired Melville
to write (beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic): the 1820 sinking of the
Nantucket whaler, (beginitalic)Essex, (enditalic)by a rogue sperm
whale. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick draws on newly discovered
documents to weave the tale of the crew, who were driven to near
madness after being set adrift in the Pacific.

   Francisco Goldman ((beginitalic)The Ordinary Seaman(enditalic))
points out that Gabriel Garcia Marquez once was asked to write the
introduction to a book about Che Guevara, and he said, roughly,
``Sure, but I'll need 1,000 pages and 10 years to do it.'' That,
Goldman says, is the way he felt when he sat down to write about
his mother. But he managed (in only 12 pages), and so did the other
contributors to this anthology of poignant essays written by Latin
authors about their mothers. Dagoberto Gilb ((beginitalic)The Last
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Known Residence of Mickey Acuna(enditalic))
writes about his love as a young child for the beautiful woman who
gave birth to him, and the sadness of his estrangement from her as
he grew older. Editor Santiago (beginitalic)(When I Was Puerto
Rican)(enditalic) recalls the difficult life of her mother, a
determined, tenacious, sometimes violent woman who was, her
daughter says, ``an example of what we should avoid and what we
should aspire to.'' Other contributors include Junot Diaz and
Gioconda Belli.

   This is a terrific first novel that will appeal to readers who
loved Charles Frazier's 1997 book, (beginitalic)Cold Mountain.
(enditalic)You might even think they're the same story for a while,
because Lent's hero, like Frazier's, is a soldier making his way
home at the end of the Civil War. But Lent's Norman Pelham reaches
his family's farm in Vermont quickly and without trauma, and he
brings a woman with him. Her name is Leah, and she is a runaway
slave who helped Norman when she found him wounded in Virginia.
Lent's novel tells three stories: that of Norman and Leah, their
marriage and family and the making of their successful farm; that
of their troubled son, Jamie, a bootlegger during the years of
Prohibition; and that of Jamie's sweet-tempered boy, Foster, who
travels into the South to uncover the secret that eventually
destroyed his grandmother's life with Norman and their children.
There's violence, romance and poetic prose here, from a writer who
shows remarkable talent. Enjoy.

   During filming, studio censors suggested, laughably, that
``either Karen or Warden put on a beach robe or some other type of
clothing before they go into the embrace.'' Karen was Deborah Kerr,
Warden was Burt Lancaster, and the beach robe was notably absent
from their surf-jostled kiss in (beginitalic)From Here to
Eternity(enditalic). Lancaster, Buford says, ``blends into our
collective memory like a famous uncle who was once a great
athlete.'' Throughout his life, he was a study in contradiction.
Known for his rages, promiscuity and mood swings, he also was
capable of great kindness and loyalty. In his youth, he was one of
Hollywood's most macho stars, yet the town simmered with rumors of
his bisexuality. And his movies were both provocative
((beginitalic)Atlantic City(enditalic)) and vapid
((beginitalic)Airport(enditalic)). Most of all, he was known for
his physical presence - his strength, his beauty, his sexuality.
That's what readers bring to the table, and what makes this
biography so fascinating: our memories of how splendid he was.

<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Your mind will wander as you read this, and who's to say that's
not what it's supposed to do? Solnit offers a history of walking,
in which meandering, both mental and physical, is part of the
exercise. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau said, ``I can only meditate when
I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind only works
with my legs.'' Or, as Solnit writes, ``Walking is a state in which
the mind, the body and the world are aligned, as though they were
three characters finally in conversation together, three notes
suddenly making a chord.'' She discusses how walking touches many
fields - anatomy, gardening, anthropology, architecture, geography,
history, literature, philosophy, sexuality, religious studies.
This, of course, gives her license to talk about everything and
everyone, from the street sense of Charles Dickens to the poetry of
Gary Snyder to the role of walking in courtship, protest and
emancipation. Best of all, this is a book that encourages you to
put it down, and go for a walk of your own.

REBEL EDUCATOR BUCKED ESTABLISHMENT TO FOUND UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX

</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- John Sperling doesn't dwell on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he could. In his 79 years, Sperling survived a
harrowing childhood, sailed in the merchant marine, flew in the
Army Air Forces, earned a Cambridge degree and worked as a
firebrand union organizer.
</P>
<P>
   He also parlayed a $26,000 investment into the University of
Phoenix, the nation's largest for-profit university, an empire
worth more than $2billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he defied the education establishment, which
tried to label his school a diploma mill and run him out of town.
In recent years, he was demonized by some for attacking the
government's drug war and pushing a medical marijuana initiative.
</P>
<P>
   His many battles are chronicled in his coming autobiography,
(beginitalic)Rebel With a Cause(enditalic), which comes out next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Sperling keeps score but no trophies. His
Venetian-style home in the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix is
decorated with sculptures and artwork, including a series of four
Andy Warhol originals that hang in the entryway. In his modest
office out back, he has virtually no keepsakes. The only link to
his past is a single black-and-white photograph of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most influential person in my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't explain why. Sperling is moving too fast to be
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in the present and plan the future,'' Sperling said.
``It's more fun. Optimists live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his enemies, Sperling quotes Cardinal Richelieu, a French
statesman from the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richelieu, who was very old, was being brought up the Rhone
River after visiting the naval base at Toulon,'' Sperling said.
``And his aides said, 'Sire, aren't you afraid that your enemies
will gather in Paris against you?' And he said, 'Peace, my son.
They're all dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling grins. ``My kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Sperling is a leftist-turned-entrepreneur, a union
organizer who became the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the troops would say, 'Sperling, are you in this to
improve education or make money?''' he said. ``And I had a mantra:
If we don't make money, we won't improve education. You understand
that? You have to have money to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, powerful forces have conspired to kill Sperling's
brainchild, only to be vanquished by his unique blend of political
savvy, gutsy risk taking and plain old stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Sperling reveled in the battle. In the 1970s,
when he was scrambling to keep his school alive, he worked 80-hour
weeks. Exhausted, he would pull his car to the side of the road,
sleeping as the traffic roared by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fight,'' Sperling said. ``If you like fighting, it
doesn't bother you. For some reason, I didn't think I'd ever
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling asks for and gives no quarter. Over the years, he's
fired friends who grew weary of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As CEO, you're responsible for everyone and their kids,''
Sperling said. ``You've got several thousand employees depending on
the company for their livelihood, and you don't endanger that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's life is about forgetting the past, moving on. He was
raised poor, and he never wanted to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to separate myself as far as possible,'' Sperling
said, ``to put as much distance between me and my past (as I
could.)''
</P>
<P>
   A sharecropper's son
</P>
<P>
   John Sperling was born in 1921 in a log cabin in the Missouri
Ozarks, the youngest of six children and the son of a sharecropper.
</P>
<P>
   Things were rough from the beginning. At age 7, Sperling
contracted a lung ailment and needed a dangerous operation to save
his life. Using local anesthetic, a doctor sawed through one of
Sperling's ribs to drain pus from his lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the incision like a knife in my brain,'' Sperling
recalled in his book. ``I screamed and struggled ... it took all
the strength of the two doctors and two nurses to hold me down ...
when it was over and as I lay moaning, I kept repeating, 'Oh,
please let me die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling was deeply ashamed of his father, who failed miserably
at farming and was often out of work. He also whipped Sperling with
a belt on a regular basis, until young John threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one day the miracle happened,'' Sperling wrote. ``He
died in his sleep. In the morning when my mother told me my father
was dead, I could hardly contain my joy. I raced outside, rolled in
the grass squealing with delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling had five siblings but was close to only one, his sister
Ruth. Of the others, he wrote, ``I neither asked of them nor gave
of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death, Sperling's family moved to Portland,
Ore., and he soon signed aboard a freighter, working in the engine
room. There, Sperling's education began. Many of the crew brought
books aboard, and almost all of the crew members were leftists
{ndash} socialists, Trotskyists and Stalinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any political philosophy, my political awareness
began at that time,'' Sperling said in an interview. ``I was only
vaguely aware of fascism. They were violently anti-fascist. They
awakened me to what was going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's interests shifted from the maritime to the academic.
When World War II broke out, he was attending Reed College, a
prestigious Portland liberal arts school, then joined the Army Air
Forces. He learned to fly, but the war ended before he saw combat.
</P>
<P>
   True to his nature, he never climbed into a cockpit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last plane I flew in and landed, I got out and kissed the
ground, and that was the last time I would fly a plane,'' Sperling
said in an interview. ``I thought, 'God, I haven't killed
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a short, failed marriage, Sperling enrolled in graduate
school at the University of California-Berkeley, which he
considered to be ``the intellectual capital of the world.'' He
married again and was accepted into the doctoral program at
Cambridge. When he returned to the United States after three years,
Sperling found jobs scarce and accepted an instructorship in the
history department at Ohio State. While in Columbus, Sperling
joined the American Civil Liberties Union, but he otherwise hated
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced around the Midwest for a few more years, then landed
at San Jose State, where he would become active in the teachers
union.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sperling was ultimately dumped from the union's
leadership, he said the experience proved invaluable later in life,
when he had to defend the University of Phoenix from legal assaults
and attempts to legislate it out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   His union job a memory, Sperling threw himself back into
academia and soon would sow the seeds that would grow into an
education empire.
</P>
<P>
   An innovator
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, while at San Jose, Sperling worked on a federal grant
to lower juvenile-delinquency rates. He developed curricula for
teachers and police officers, and before long they were asking for
more classes.
</P>
<P>
   The small program grew into the Institute for Professional
Development, which became affiliated with the University of San
Francisco. At the time, there was little in the way of college
classes for working adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person could go two or three nights a week for 10 years and
maybe get a degree,'' Sperling recalled, and he told the story of
Bobby Maybee, a police detective who had accumulated 130 credit
hours but still had no degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget when we finally got him into this program,
and he said, ``Now, Sperling, if I go through this, I'm going to
get a degree, right?' And I said, 'Bobby, so help me God, yes.' And
he patted his shoulder holster and said, 'I hope you're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Sperling went from university professor to
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was popular, Sperling's adult-education program came
under attack from heavy hitters among the education establishment
in California. To them, a for-profit institution with part-time
instructors and no tenure was an anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents pressured the University of San Francisco to drop the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling survived there for five years, just enough time to get
his organization moving. After leaving California, he began
searching for another site and settled on Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The move gave Sperling several advantages. The state was covered
by a different accreditation body and the atmosphere was
pro-business. Although the accreditation process was rough,
Sperling made some powerful friends: Gov. Bruce Babbitt, state
House Speaker Burton Barr and Dino DeConcini, brother of former
U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini. Babbitt even met with Sperling on the
sly to help advise him, having lunch in a hotel suite and leaving
through the service entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, when I got our message through the Legislature, then
the Legislature became friendly,'' Sperling said. ``If we hadn't
had a friendly Legislature, I think the public university system
would have been able to destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the state Board of Regents attacked Sperling on every
front, and the University of Phoenix was trashed with allegations
that it was a diploma mill.
</P>
<P>
   The late '70s were a rough time for Sperling. He was in the
battle of his life on two fronts, defending his school and fighting
prostate cancer. He eventually was fitted for radioactive implants,
which caused a constant burning sensation. Sperling numbed the pain
with Percodan, alcohol and, eventually, marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Although the University of Phoenix won accreditation in 1978,
the regents went after Sperling again, seeking new legislation and
ultimately refusing to accept University of Phoenix credits. The
last effort was turned back by Barr.
</P>
<P>
   With his university safe and his health back on track, Sperling
turned to other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he began a self-proclaimed stealth campaign against the
government's war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling argued that the drug war was little more than a
publicity stunt, using dramatic busts to mask the huge fiscal and
human costs.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Sperling argued, although it filled up prisons, it did
nothing to stem the tide of drugs. And because enforcement
increased the price of drugs, Sperling said, users were forced to
commit crimes to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's plan was to offset the drug war by legalizing certain
drugs for medical use and diverting some drug offenders into
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his strategy, Sperling wanted to stay under the radar
screen, to keep the opposition from organizing against him. He
conducted a quiet effort to make sure public officials didn't try
to destroy it, lining up a powerful list of backers, capped by
Dennis DeConcini and Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters met privately with members of the congressional
delegation, most of whom agreed to stay neutral. As Election Day
1996 approached, drug czar Barry McCaffrey launched an attack, but
Sperling blunted it with a $1million radio and television assault,
which was funded mostly by Sperling and two partners, New York
financier George Soros and Cleveland businessman Peter B. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds allowed us, in the final two weeks before the
election, to turn our stealth campaign into a blitzkrieg,''
Sperling wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Proposition 200, passed by a ratio of almost
2-1. The next year, Sperling had to fight a rear-guard action to
keep it mostly intact. This year, supporters are pushing another
initiative, seeking a state distribution network for medical
marijuana and reductions in sentences for possession.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Sperling said, public officials are losing their fear
that the drug war is a so-called third rail of politics.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Sperling noted that recently in the U.S. House of
Representatives, ``there was a 21/2-hour debate on drug policy. A
handful of representatives, led by Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco,
attacked the drug war directly. That hasn't happened in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Sperling is staying busy with programs such as
Seaphire, a seawater irrigation program, and the Kronos Group,
which is involved in longevity research. His son, Peter, is still
involved with the family business and is active in other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling is enjoying life. He throws lavish parties at his
Arcadia home and maintains a place in San Francisco. Despite all
that's happened, he says each new day is the best day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make sure that whatever I'm doing,'' he said, ``I'm
enjoying it intensely.''

   True to his nature, he never climbed into a cockpit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last plane I flew in and landed, I got out and kissed the
ground, and that was the last time I would fly a plane,'' Sperling
said in an interview. ``I thought, 'God, I haven't killed
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a short, failed marriage, Sperling enrolled in graduate
school at the University of California-Berkeley, which he
considered to be ``the intellectual capital of the world.'' He
married again and was accepted into the doctoral program at
Cambridge. When he returned to the United States after three years,
Sperling found jobs scarce and accepted an instructorship in the
history department at Ohio State. While in Columbus, Sperling
joined the American Civil Liberties Union, but he otherwise hated
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced around the Midwest for a few more years, then landed
at San Jose State, where he would become active in the teachers
union.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sperling was ultimately dumped from the union's
leadership, he said the experience proved invaluable later in life,
when he had to defend the University of Phoenix from legal assaults
and attempts to legislate it out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   His union job a memory, Sperling threw himself back into
academia and soon would sow the seeds that would grow into an
education empire.
</P>
<P>
   An innovator
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, while at San Jose, Sperling worked on a federal grant
to lower juvenile-delinquency rates. He developed curricula for
teachers and police officers, and before long they were asking for
more classes.
</P>
<P>
   The small program grew into the Institute for Professional
Development, which became affiliated with the University of San
Francisco. At the time, there was little in the way of college
classes for working adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person could go two or three nights a week for 10 years and
maybe get a degree,'' Sperling recalled, and he told the story of
Bobby Maybee, a police detective who had accumulated 130 credit
hours but still had no degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget when we finally got him into this program,
and he said, ``Now, Sperling, if I go through this, I'm going to
get a degree, right?' And I said, 'Bobby, so help me God, yes.' And
he patted his shoulder holster and said, 'I hope you're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Sperling went from university professor to
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was popular, Sperling's adult-education program came
under attack from heavy hitters among the education establishment
in California. To them, a for-profit institution with part-time
instructors and no tenure was an anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents pressured the University of San Francisco to drop the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling survived there for five years, just enough time to get
his organization moving. After leaving California, he began
searching for another site and settled on Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The move gave Sperling several advantages. The state was covered
by a different accreditation body and the atmosphere was
pro-business. Although the accreditation process was rough,
Sperling made some powerful friends: Gov. Bruce Babbitt, state
House Speaker Burton Barr and Dino DeConcini, brother of former
U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini. Babbitt even met with Sperling on the
sly to help advise him, having lunch in a hotel suite and leaving
through the service entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, when I got our message through the Legislature, then
the Legislature became friendly,'' Sperling said. ``If we hadn't
had a friendly Legislature, I think the public university system
would have been able to destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the state Board of Regents attacked Sperling on every
front, and the University of Phoenix was trashed with allegations
that it was a diploma mill.
</P>
<P>
   The late '70s were a rough time for Sperling. He was in the
battle of his life on two fronts, defending his school and fighting
prostate cancer. He eventually was fitted for radioactive implants,
which caused a constant burning sensation. Sperling numbed the pain
with Percodan, alcohol and, eventually, marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Although the University of Phoenix won accreditation in 1978,
the regents went after Sperling again, seeking new legislation and
ultimately refusing to accept University of Phoenix credits. The
last effort was turned back by Barr.
</P>
<P>
   With his university safe and his health back on track, Sperling
turned to other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he began a self-proclaimed stealth campaign against the
government's war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling argued that the drug war was little more than a
publicity stunt, using dramatic busts to mask the huge fiscal and
human costs.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Sperling argued, although it filled up prisons, it did
nothing to stem the tide of drugs. And because enforcement
increased the price of drugs, Sperling said, users were forced to
commit crimes to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's plan was to offset the drug war by legalizing certain
drugs for medical use and diverting some drug offenders into
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his strategy, Sperling wanted to stay under the radar
screen, to keep the opposition from organizing against him. He
conducted a quiet effort to make sure public officials didn't try
to destroy it, lining up a powerful list of backers, capped by
Dennis DeConcini and Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters met privately with members of the congressional
delegation, most of whom agreed to stay neutral. As Election Day
1996 approached, drug czar Barry McCaffrey launched an attack, but
Sperling blunted it with a $1million radio and television assault,
which was funded mostly by Sperling and two partners, New York
financier George Soros and Cleveland businessman Peter B. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds allowed us, in the final two weeks before the
election, to turn our stealth campaign into a blitzkrieg,''
Sperling wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Proposition 200, passed by a ratio of almost
2-1. The next year, Sperling had to fight a rear-guard action to
keep it mostly intact. This year, supporters are pushing another
initiative, seeking a state distribution network for medical
marijuana and reductions in sentences for possession.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Sperling said, public officials are losing their fear
that the drug war is a so-called third rail of politics.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Sperling noted that recently in the U.S. House of
Representatives, ``there was a 21/2-hour debate on drug policy. A
handful of representatives, led by Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco,
attacked the drug war directly. That hasn't happened in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Sperling is staying busy with programs such as
Seaphire, a seawater irrigation program, and the Kronos Group,
which is involved in longevity research. His son, Peter, is still
involved with the family business and is active in other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling is enjoying life. He throws lavish parties at his
Arcadia home and maintains a place in San Francisco. Despite all
that's happened, he says each new day is the best day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make sure that whatever I'm doing,'' he said, ``I'm
enjoying it intensely.''

REBEL EDUCATOR BUCKED ESTABLISHMENT TO FOUND UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX
(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a)

<P>
   (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS. MOVING IN
</P>
<P>
   ``A'' AND ``K'' CATEGORIES)
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- John Sperling doesn't dwell on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he could. In his 79 years, Sperling survived a
harrowing childhood, sailed in the merchant marine, flew in the
Army Air Forces, earned a Cambridge degree and worked as a
firebrand union organizer.
</P>
<P>
   He also parlayed a $26,000 investment into the University of
Phoenix, the nation's largest for-profit university, an empire
worth more than $2billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he defied the education establishment, which
tried to label his school a diploma mill and run him out of town.
In recent years, he was demonized by some for attacking the
government's drug war and pushing a medical marijuana initiative.
</P>
<P>
   His many battles are chronicled in his coming autobiography,
(beginitalic)Rebel With a Cause(enditalic), which comes out next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Sperling keeps score but no trophies. His
Venetian-style home in the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix is
decorated with sculptures and artwork, including a series of four
Andy Warhol originals that hang in the entryway. In his modest
office out back, he has virtually no keepsakes. The only link to
his past is a single black-and-white photograph of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most influential person in my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't explain why. Sperling is moving too fast to be
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in the present and plan the future,'' Sperling said.
``It's more fun. Optimists live longer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his enemies, Sperling quotes Cardinal Richelieu, a French
statesman from the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richelieu, who was very old, was being brought up the Rhone
River after visiting the naval base at Toulon,'' Sperling said.
``And his aides said, 'Sire, aren't you afraid that your enemies
will gather in Paris against you?' And he said, 'Peace, my son.
They're all dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling grins. ``My kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Sperling is a leftist-turned-entrepreneur, a union
organizer who became the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the troops would say, 'Sperling, are you in this to
improve education or make money?''' he said. ``And I had a mantra:
If we don't make money, we won't improve education. You understand
that? You have to have money to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, powerful forces have conspired to kill Sperling's
brainchild, only to be vanquished by his unique blend of political
savvy, gutsy risk taking and plain old stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Sperling reveled in the battle. In the 1970s,
when he was scrambling to keep his school alive, he worked 80-hour
weeks. Exhausted, he would pull his car to the side of the road,
sleeping as the traffic roared by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fight,'' Sperling said. ``If you like fighting, it
doesn't bother you. For some reason, I didn't think I'd ever
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling asks for and gives no quarter. Over the years, he's
fired friends who grew weary of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As CEO, you're responsible for everyone and their kids,''
Sperling said. ``You've got several thousand employees depending on
the company for their livelihood, and you don't endanger that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's life is about forgetting the past, moving on. He was
raised poor, and he never wanted to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to separate myself as far as possible,'' Sperling
said, ``to put as much distance between me and my past (as I
could.)''
</P>
<P>
   A sharecropper's son
</P>
<P>
   John Sperling was born in 1921 in a log cabin in the Missouri
Ozarks, the youngest of six children and the son of a sharecropper.
</P>
<P>
   Things were rough from the beginning. At age 7, Sperling
contracted a lung ailment and needed a dangerous operation to save
his life. Using local anesthetic, a doctor sawed through one of
Sperling's ribs to drain pus from his lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the incision like a knife in my brain,'' Sperling
recalled in his book. ``I screamed and struggled ... it took all
the strength of the two doctors and two nurses to hold me down ...
when it was over and as I lay moaning, I kept repeating, 'Oh,
please let me die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling was deeply ashamed of his father, who failed miserably
at farming and was often out of work. He also whipped Sperling with
a belt on a regular basis, until young John threatened to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one day the miracle happened,'' Sperling wrote. ``He
died in his sleep. In the morning when my mother told me my father
was dead, I could hardly contain my joy. I raced outside, rolled in
the grass squealing with delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling had five siblings but was close to only one, his sister
Ruth. Of the others, he wrote, ``I neither asked of them nor gave
of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death, Sperling's family moved to Portland,
Ore., and he soon signed aboard a freighter, working in the engine
room. There, Sperling's education began. Many of the crew brought
books aboard, and almost all of the crew members were leftists
{ndash} socialists, Trotskyists and Stalinists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any political philosophy, my political awareness
began at that time,'' Sperling said in an interview. ``I was only
vaguely aware of fascism. They were violently anti-fascist. They
awakened me to what was going on in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling's interests shifted from the maritime to the academic.
When World War II broke out, he was attending Reed College, a
prestigious Portland liberal arts school, then joined the Army Air
Forces. He learned to fly, but the war ended before he saw combat.
</P>
<P>
   True to his nature, he never climbed into a cockpit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last plane I flew in and landed, I got out and kissed the
ground, and that was the last time I would fly a plane,'' Sperling
said in an interview. ``I thought, 'God, I haven't killed
myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a short, failed marriage, Sperling enrolled in graduate
school at the University of California-Berkeley, which he
considered to be ``the intellectual capital of the world.'' He
married again and was accepted into the doctoral program at
Cambridge. When he returned to the United States after three years,
Sperling found jobs scarce and accepted an instructorship in the
history department at Ohio State. While in Columbus, Sperling
joined the American Civil Liberties Union, but he otherwise hated
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced around the Midwest for a few more years, then landed
at San Jose State, where he would become active in the teachers
union.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sperling was ultimately dumped from the union's
leadership, he said the experience proved invaluable later in life,
when he had to defend the University of Phoenix from legal assaults
and attempts to legislate it out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   His union job a memory, Sperling threw himself back into
academia and soon would sow the seeds that would grow into an
education empire.
</P>
<P>
   An innovator
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, while at San Jose, Sperling worked on a federal grant
to lower juvenile-delinquency rates. He developed curricula for
teachers and police officers, and before long they were asking for
more classes.
</P>
<P>
   The small program grew into the Institute for Professional
Development, which became affiliated with the University of San
Francisco. At the time, there was little in the way of college
classes for working adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person could go two or three nights a week for 10 years and
maybe get a degree,'' Sperling recalled, and he told the story of
Bobby Maybee, a police detective who had accumulated 130 credit
hours but still had no degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget when we finally got him into this program,
and he said, ``Now, Sperling, if I go through this, I'm going to
get a degree, right?' And I said, 'Bobby, so help me God, yes.' And
he patted his shoulder holster and said, 'I hope you're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Sperling went from university professor to
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was popular, Sperling's adult-education program came

<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-U-571 (Undated) _ In a way it's refreshing how
unrefreshing the new submarine thriller, ``U-571,'' is. Taut,
suspenseful, good-looking, it strives to be old-fashioned
entertainment, complete with cardboard characters (who have names
like Chief, Rabbit and Trigger) injected with doses of star power.
Almost belligerently, it refuses to break new ground (or water, for
that matter). By G. ALLEN JOHNSON.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BASKETBALL (Undated) _ ``Love and Basketball,'' a
romantic comedy about a love triangle between a boy, a girl and a
game, has some nice moves and winning players, but ultimately loses
steam down the stretch. The film plots out a predictable romance
between two young ballplayers who've grown up as next-door
neighbors: Monica Wright, played by the earnest and likable Sanaa
Lathan and Quincy McCall, played with much swagger and sweat by
Omar Epps. By KRIS WORRELL.
</P>
<P>
   TV-STOOGES (Undated) _ Before there was professional wrestling,
``Monday Night Football,'' muscle cars or Playboy, there was ``The
Three Stooges.'' The brothers Howard, Larry Fine and a pair of Joes
pounded, poked and nyuk'ed each other through 190 or so film shorts
for Columbia Pictures from 1934 to 1958. They later became staples
on television _ where they live on today _ as well as a successful
touring act. The ABC biopic ``The Three Stooges'' is a fun and
touching, if sketchy, homage by producer and major Stoogehead Mel
Gibson that airs Monday. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-RESTAURANT (Undated) _ Eric Bross did not set out to
make a film about race. He set out to make a film about
restaurants. He had spent years working in them, his collaborator
had spent years working in them, and the nightly hustle and bustle
just seemed fair bait for a small feature. But along the way to
making ``Restaurant,'' Bross' study of Gen-X Jersey food workers
became something else: a movie about blacks and whites, and the
uneasy space between them. By AMY BIANCOLLI. (For release Sunday,
April 23.)

   VENUS-GLOW (San Francisco) _ Scientists at SRI International in
Menlo Park, Calif., have received a $250,000 NASA grant to
scrutinize the legendary ``ashen light'' of Venus, the second
planet from the Sun. The ashen light is an elusive luminescence,
sometimes faintly visible on the dark side of Venus. It has
enchanted and mystified generations of stargazers. By KEAY

Brown, joining a disgruntled population that's tired of being

case. By ILENE LELCHUK.

almost too gorgeous to be a Mitsubishi. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS

the candy. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS. (For release Sunday, April

coincide this weekend, as they frequently do. Yet something is
different; for many Catholics and Jews, there is a new awareness of
each other. Last month, when Pope John Paul II asked for
forgiveness of sins committed by Catholics across the last two
millennia, he included Jews and Muslims. That confession, followed
by the papal visit to the Holy Land _ to Israel, the Palestinian
territories and Jordan _ spoke eloquently to a collective hope for
the future. By JOHN P. SCHLEGEL.

RUSSIA SEIZES JAPANESE BOAT IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Russian coast guard fired on and seized a Japanese
fishing boat Friday in waters near Japan's northernmost main
island, according to Japanese and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The incident threatens to revive tensions between the countries,
which have had disputes about maritime boundaries and possession of
a number of small islands in the area since the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, is scheduled to visit
the Russian president-elect, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on April 29.
Japan has been pressing Russia to negotiate a formal peace treaty,
which it says should include the return of northern islands seized
by Moscow in the closing days of the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian officials who briefed journalists in
Moscow, the Japanese fishing vessel disobeyed orders from a Russian
patrol boat to stop for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intruder was shelled by the Russian border guards when it
attempted to escape from the Russian economic zone into neutral
waters,'' the Russian ITAR-Tass news agency said. None of the 20
crew members was injured, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities said the Japanese ship, the No. 7
Daitoku-Maru, was operating with its name and identification
numbers concealed and had tried to escape after being summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities gave an entirely different account, saying
that the fishing vessel was operating in Japanese waters near what
Japan calls its Northern Territories.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese coast guard sent three aircraft and four patrol
boats to the scene, 60 miles south of the cape of Ochiishi off the
island of Hokkaido. But officials said the Japanese coast guard
withdrew after the fishing vessel was brought, under escort, into
Russian waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that two Russian soldiers are standing on the
bridge of the Japanese ship,'' said a Japanese official quoted by
Reuters. ``If this continues, we will consider the ship seized.'' &QL;

&HT;     A TOUCHING FILM ABOUT RACE RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Bross did not set out to make a film about race. He set out
to make a film about restaurants. He had spent years working in
them, his collaborator had spent years working in them, and the
nightly hustle and bustle just seemed fair bait for a small
feature.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way to making ``Restaurant,'' Bross' study of
Gen-X New Jersey food workers became something else: a movie about
blacks and whites, and the uneasy space between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurant is kind of a metaphor for our American society,
because we have a kind of a melting pot, as they say here in
America,'' said the director, 31, chatting earlier this week from
his home in Los Angeles. ``We thought it was a perfect kind of
metaphor (or) microcosm of what we see in our world today:
undercurrents of racial tension within a harmonious environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we said, `Hey, let's set out to do it.' It just
kind of grew.''
</P>
<P>
   And as it grew, it matured into an honest-yet-subtle look at the
intersection of African-Americans and Caucasians in contemporary
urban life. Chris (Adrien Brody of ``The Thin Red Line''), the
young white protagonist, is a Hoboken bartender and aspiring
playwright who's still heartbroken over an ex-girlfriend's long-ago
infidelity. It so happens that the ex-girlfriend (played by hip-hop
Grammy winner Lauryn Hill) is black. It so happens that Chris'
current girlfriend (Elise Neal of TV's ``The Hughleys'') is black.
And it so happens that the idealistic, even-handed Chris, a
peacemaker in the restaurant's racial politics, finds that he can't
quite escape the bigotry he observed _ and loathed _ in his own
father.
</P>
<P>
   The film splits its time between intimate one-on-ones (Chris and
his girlfriends; Chris and his pals) and the noisy crosstalk of
work and parties. Well-acted by a young ensemble that also includes
David Moscow, Malcolm Jamal-Warner and Jesse Martin, the plot
crosses a lot of territory: racial, generational, romantic, human.
</P>
<P>
   Retooled punctuation here: None of it's facile, although some of
it's messy. Much of the mess involves characters facing down a few
nasty ethnic stereotypes. The `N' word gets a work-out.
</P>
<P>
   Bross said he and screenwriter Tom Cudworth ``were striving to
say, `You know, let's just be honest.' In our world today, we're
becoming more and more intolerant of racism. But there's another
thing growing out of it, which is this whole political correctness
_ which is a danger in itself. To be politically correct implies a
sort of stricter kind of rule, where you're asking people to
repress something, to hide something.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Restaurant,'' he said, ``I felt we were more capable of
saying, `I have that, I'm willing to deal with that, I'm willing to
face it.' It's psychology: If you don't address the issue, how can
you deal with it? In the African-American community, one of the
gripes they have is they feel that white people aren't honest
(about racism) ....
</P>
<P>
   ``I still agree there's something correct about political
correctness,'' Bross said. ``It's a good idea, but it's not
perfect. It should be a guideline more than a rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Bross' film is one of several in current or recent release to
address the subject of black-white relations. ``Liberty Heights,''
another Brody film, takes a look at interracial dating. James
Toback's ``Black and White'' also tackles matters of race, albeit
in a much sloppier and less insightful manner. (Bross' previous
collaboration with Cudworth, ``Ten Benny'' _ again with Brody _
followed lifelong buddies in suburban New Jersey and made a minor
splash with critics.)
</P>
<P>
   Why now? Why so many films on a topic so often overlooked by
mainstream movies? Bross isn't sure, but he suspects filmmakers are
tracking the cyclical nature of American racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things build to a certain point, and there's cultural
change,'' Bross said. ``Right now, the hip-hop thing is sort of
scaring a lot of white people _ I mean, really scaring a lot of
white people _ and they don't understand it, and it's spreading
into their own children's lives. It's becoming cultural. And when
that sort of thing starts to happen, it becomes not just a black
thing but a black-and-white thing. And therefore, I think, people
start to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bross, for one, was deeply influenced by an early encounter with
racism. Reared by liberal-minded parents in West Caldwell, N.J., he
was taught not to judge his playmates by the color of their skin.
Then the African-American family next door had their lawn torched
by angry whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4 or 5 years old, and I just never forgot it. I'll never
forget it _ the family, the Winstons, sitting in our living room,
because our yards were connected and we used to have barbecues
together, and we used to play with their daughters,'' Bross
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid you don't make those (racial) distinctions. You don't
think about it, and I never have. I'm not gonna sit here and say I
don't have the same kind of white fear that (other) white people
do, but what this did for me was I saw firsthand how people were
behaving. And I never fully understood what it meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, his mother _ Joanna Bross, a lyricist and writer _ got
a job coaching candidates for Miss Black New Jersey. The girls and
their beaus often visited the Bross household for sessions on
public speaking and deportment. Apparently, the sight of beautiful
black couples traversing the white side of town was too much for
the neighbors, and they complained. Often. Loudly. ``It was just
very bizarre, very bizarre,'' Bross said.
</P>
<P>
   Such youthful introductions to bigotry had a profound effect on
Bross, underscoring for him the absurdity of adult prejudices _ and
our equally absurd reluctance to talk about them. When it comes to
race, no one is wiser than a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's fine for children to explore differences,'' he
said. ``I remember sitting with my sister _ my older sister's a
year older than me, so she must have been five and I must have been
four _ with the girls next door, twins named Judy and Becky. It's a
memory I have of sitting there with my sister there in the dirt,
and my sister's putting dirt on her legs and saying, `Now I look
like Judy and Becky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids address differences. They don't address them as an issue
or as a problem, but as something that's interesting,'' he said.
``Something that's different.''

GRINDER POEDIN HAS COLORADO RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ No one is saying that he is going to dominate the
playoffs or turn himself into this spring's surprise sniper, a la
John Druce or Chris Kontos or Stephane Matteau of playoff years
past, but Colorado left wing Shjon Podein already has broken out in
this year's Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   By all definitions, he's an NHL grinder, a guy who skates his
lane, takes the body, and who for the better part of eight seasons
now has chugged along in two-bladed anonymity. However, in the
first three games of Colorado's first-round series against the
Coyotes, the reliable, hard-working Podein scored three of the
Avalanche's 13 goals.
</P>
<P>
   In today's low-scoring, clutch-and-grab, offense-be-damned NHL,
three goals from a guy like Podein is a downright embarrassment for
the third- and fourth-liners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's an ambassador for us all,'' kidded teammate Jeff
Odgers, the ex-Bruin who has made a career of filling out third and
fourth lines, mostly for his pugilistic prowess. ``Shjon Podein,
the people's wrist shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team far better known for its multitude of offensive
riches, Podein for the most part is just a suit, the navy blue 40
regular kept in the back of the closet for family functions and
annual performance reviews with the boss. Originally a draft pick
of the Oilers, he played two-plus seasons in the AHL (Cape Breton)
before finally getting his chance in Edmonton, and his stay there
was fragmented over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed up at my first Oiler camp at 225 pounds,'' recalled
Podein, now a well-conditioned 200. ``I went in thinking that I'd
bulk up, that I'd need that extra weight and muscle to play in the
NHL. I was going to be that big defensive winger. It took me about
two shifts to realize that I was skating about half the speed of
everyone else. I figured right there, `Hmm, this ain't gonna work.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, he was accustomed to the hockey world
flying by him. Born and raised in Rochester, Minn., Podein wasn't
drafted out of high school as an 18-year-old. He also was left off
everyone's wish list the next year, in the 1987 draft. By the time
the '88 draft rolled around, and the local paper was running
stories of how he probably would get selected this time, after a
respectable freshman season (4-4_8 in 30 games) at the University
of Minnesota-Duluth, Podein had learned not to get too emotionally
invested in the annual amateur jamboree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember driving back from California with a friend of
mine, and I stopped in Omaha to call home,'' said Podein. ``My dad
was telling me, `You know, there's a story in the paper here that
says you'll probably get drafted.' They were saying maybe I'd go in
the fifth or sixth round, somewhere in there, but I'd heard all
that before. I didn't think it would happen, and if it didn't, I
was going to finish my four years at college, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did care about, if someone did want him, was the state
of the NHL at the time. Summed up neatly, that state was Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The high-powered Oilers, who were still a few weeks away from
trading Wayne Gretzky, already had won four Stanley Cups. There was
a bonafide dynasty in northern Alberta, with the likes of Mark
Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey filling out
the most powerful offense in league history. They scored at will
and skated like the wind.
</P>
<P>
   No way in the world, thought Podein, would Edmonton want a guy
like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton,'' came the voice over the public address system that
late afternoon at the draft, ``your selection, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton, with the 166th selection,'' answered the Oilers'
table, ``drafts Shjon Podein from the University of
Minnesota-Duluth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, just back from the drive from California, Podein
tiptoed into the family home in Rochester in the wee hours of
Sunday morning. There was no note on the kitchen table: ``Shjon,
good goin', you're a proud member of the (fill in the blank).'' He
tapped his mom's shoulder around 3 a.m., and listened incredulously
as she mumbled his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's all groggy and everything, but she says, `Oh, yeah, you
got picked by Edmonton,' '' he recalled. ``Edmonton? No way. The
fastest, best-skating team in the whole league, and they pick me?''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years later, history shows that Podein, though not fleet
afoot, was the best of the 13 picks the Oilers made that June day.
Their top choice, No. 19, was Francois Leroux, the lumbering
6-foot-6-inch defenseman who never has made it beyond journeyman
status in his tours with Edmonton, Ottawa, Pittsburgh, and
Colorado. Of the 11 other picks, the only to enjoy even limited
success has been Len Barrie, playing these days with Florida, his
second stop there after tries with Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and
even a couple of seasons in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Before Podein got anywhere in the NHL, he had to drop the 25
pounds and pick up his pace. That meant two full seasons in Cape
Breton, playing for the Oilers' farm team, where he worked first
and foremost on his skating. Eventually up to speed, he got two
looks with the Oilers, each lasting about half a season, but 27
points over 68 games would not be enough to convince the Oilers to
keep him in the organization. In the summer of 1994, the Flyers
signed him as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In his four-plus seasons with the Flyers, cast into the
defensive winger role, Podein's scoring pace picked up slightly.
His best season there, though, was only 32 points (14 goals) in
1996-97. By early last season, the Flyers were looking for someone
with similiar size, but with more of a scoring touch. The answer,
they thought, was Keith Jones, the ex-Washington right wing whose
scoring touch was beginning to wane in Colorado. On Nov. 12, 1998,
Jones headed east and Podein went west.
</P>
<P>
   ``His production had kind of slowed down,'' said Colorado
general manager Pierre Lacroix, referring to Jones. ``He'd been
used on top lines, previous to us, and his production here had
slowed down. We were pleased with what we'd seen in (Chris) Drury
and (Milan) Hejduk, and Podein looked like more of an all-around
player for us. It was a question of adjusting the chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the tinkering looks like a magical touch. Podein
was shut out in Colorado's 3-2 loss to the Coyotes Wednesday night,
dropping the Avalanche's series lead to 3-1, but his offense and
speed have made him an unsavory presence for the Desert Dogs. It
was hard enough for them to cover the likes of Joe Sakic, Peter
Forsberg, Drury, and Hejduk. Now they've got to find a way to
contain the guy with that funny first name.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon. It was a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wanted to name me Wolfgang,'' said Podein. ``My mom
didn't like that. She wanted Shaun. They put that together with my
grandfather's name, Jon, and went with Shjon. I think Wolfgang
would have been kinda tough, sort of like that song, ``A Boy Named
Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue, the sniper with the sizzling wrist shot. It probably
wouldn't have caused many to quake in their skates. But it is the
playoffs, a time when the otherwise unknown often do make a name
for themselves.

COSTAS PREACHES THE WORD OF BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody made him do it. And he's not doing it for the money,
either. All the net proceeds from ``Fair Ball'' are earmarked for
the B.A.T., Baseball Assistance Team, which provides financial
assistance to ``those members of the baseball family in need.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows the critics have him in their rifle cross hairs.
Many people think he's a dilettante who mounts his little pulpit to
preach about his tired, favorite topic at every opportunity. Geez,
they say. It's bad enough he's always talking about it. Now he's
got to write about it, too?
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Costas has taken the chance. He just happens to love
baseball, and he is very worried about the long-range prospects for
the game. He can't keep his mouth shut. Or his computer turned off.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want much. Really. ``This isn't a fan's diatribe
against the sport,'' he writes, ``but rather, a fan's case for
baseball. What do I want? I think the same thing most baseball fans
want: To see the game prove worthy of our devotion. To watch it
move forward into the next century, while retaining the essence of
what made it so worthwhile in the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the work of a windbag. It's a minimalist tome, sort of
a writer's answer to a Red Barber telecast. He gets in and gets
out, without name-calling or hysterics of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about these issues in one forum or another
for many years,'' he explains. ``I figured I might as well collect
everything in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair Balls'' is concise, orderly, witty, and, above all,
logical. Costas thinks that Major League Baseball is kidding itself
if it thinks it can survive as presently constituted. If Minnesota,
which won two championships in a four-year period from 1987-91 now
has No Chance; if Kansas City, which was a dominant team in the
'70s, now has No Chance; if Pittsburgh, which was a dominant team
in the late '80s and early '90s, now has No Chance; and if
Montreal, which may have been the best team in baseball until the
1994 strike hit now has No Chance; then baseball has wounded itself
severely.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: serious revenue sharing. It is, he says, the only
way baseball can rectify an absurd discrepancy in financial
situations. He knows how hard it will be to get the big market
teams to go along with this, and he finds it oddly amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the large market teams _ and I'm not pointing any
fingers, but it's obvious who they are _ balk at revenue sharing,
but they don't see anything wrong with going to the taxpayers for
help in order to subsidize the construction of stadiums that will
only make them richer,'' he says. ``Does that make any sense to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   He sees nothing wrong with a salary cap for baseball, especially
since there would be a floor figure that would make life much
better financially for the average player, just as it does in the
NBA. The Players Association, of course, would rather have its
members take Loyalty Oaths or agree to work on clean-up crews when
the game is over. He's hardly antiplayer. He even includes Gene
Orza, the Association's feisty No. 2 man, in his acknowledgements.
But he does think the players have gotten a little full of
themselves. What would be so bad about the $15 million men being
limited to $10 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line,'' he maintains, ``principle has
morphed into fanaticism.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pitch for revenue sharing (and, yes, he has specific
recommendations) is the core of the book, his greatest emotion is
reserved for the wild card. Simply put, he's against it. He doesn't
just hate the wild card, he loathes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennant races,'' he says. ``There aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas thinks baseball has sold its soul by attempting to
emulate football, basketball, and hockey. He feels that the
greatest thing baseball had going for it was the great pennant
race, and that when the wild card was introduced, baseball lost its
uniqueness. To him, it's a clear either-or.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are some truths you can't get past,'' he says. ``Pennant
races are the lifeblood of baseball's history. Wild cards are the
product of modern times. And in baseball, you have to choose one or
the other. You can't have them both.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're already a Costas fan _ and if you're not, what the
hell is the matter with you? _ then you won't be surprised to learn
that he writes as well as he talks. He refers to a pennant race as
having a ``remorseless justice,'' for example, and he even goes so
far as to use that intimidating word ``paradigm.'' Referring to the
occasional difficulty one has in obtaining accurate information as
to broadcast revenues, he says, ``Major League Baseball guards the
actual figures as if they were the combination to Scrooge McDuck's
bank vault.''
</P>
<P>
   I realize it's difficult for anyone to believe that a guy making
a million or two a year working for NBC can actually retain true
empathy for the fan experience, so I guess you'll just have to
trust me on this one. All I know is that the guy still carries that
Mickey Mantle baseball card in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   He really does care about the game, and he worries about it
because he is in a position to see that the game is not necessarily
in the custody of people who love it as much as he does, I do, or,
perhaps, you do. And don't lump him with the hoity-toity set,
either. His is a Baseball Encyclopedia love for the game. He
doesn't consider baseball a metaphor for anything; he just thinks
it's a great game to watch and talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' he tells us, ``I'm a `Bull Durham' guy, not a
`Field of Dreams' guy.'' His father was a sicko gambler who raged
when a favored player like Mantle cost him a bet. ``I rode the
subways to Yankee Stadium, and saw and heard many things,'' he
says. ``But not, `If you build it, they will come.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have long felt he would make a good baseball
commissioner will have their judgment confirmed by ``Fair Ball.'' I
prefer to think this book is chicken soup for Bob Costas's baseball
soul.

   BOSTON _ Sharon Daniels has seen opera from every side. During
the '70s and '80s she was one of America's most captivating
sopranos, successful not only in opera but on Broadway, where she
sang a three-month run of ``The Most Happy Fella'' _ the Frank
Loesser show was also taped for television and shown on ``Great
Performances.'' Now she is one of Boston's most successful voice
teachers and stage directors..
</P>
<P>
   Recently Daniels, still blond, sparkling, and chic as she sails
through her 50s, took a break between rehearsals to talk about ``La
Clemenza di Tito,'' a student production of Mozart's last opera,
and her triple career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this opera is a most unusual choice for a student
production,'' she admits, ``but we have two wonderful full casts,
and an additional cast of covers that is ready to go on. The piece
is a big challenge, but everyone has worked really hard and is
ready for it. I'm also very happy with the design by Tod Shiba, who
made it a point to know the score. I was determined that there
would be no slow and squeaking scene changes. We had the
opportunity to use some elements of the Huntington Theatre's set
for `Mary Stuart,' but Tod incorporated them into a fabulous design
that is all his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The work will be sung in Italian. ``No one wanted to hear those
great arias in English. But this is also a show that is full of
recitative. We began to address the problem of singing convincing
Italian a few years ago by setting up a conversation class, which
really paid off in our productions of `La Boheme' and `Gianni
Schicchi.' In this opera we have singers of American, Armenian,
Portuguese, and Korean origin, and everyone was held accountable
for the Italian text. We began by asking them to paraphrase the
text in their own languages, to identify and physicalize their
objectives for every line. Only then did we move on into the
Italian. I think the audience will not need to look at the
supertitles very often. The costumes are soft and flowing and
emphasize the humanity of the piece, although the period puts the
two women who sing men's roles into skirts, which poses a challenge
they have met. No, it never occurred to me to have the wigmaster
put hair on their legs!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Daniels was born in Arizona in 1943 and began singing solos in
church as a child; ``I'd Rather Have Jesus'' was her debut number.
At Chapman College in California Daniels developed a special talent
for acting, appearing in straight plays as well as in musicals and
even an opera, ``Amahl and the Night Visitors.'' While her first
husband was studying for a pastorate at the Pacific School of
Religion, Daniels embarked on a career in elementary school
teaching. ``Yes, I was at Berkeley in the '60s,'' Daniels says, her
eyes dancing. ``And I was teaching second grade in Oakland. But I
found a wonderful voice teacher named Amy MacMurray, who was about
90 years old, and that saved my life. I began to sing concerts and
appear with all the local orchestras; I had no idea I could make a
career in opera.''
</P>
<P>
   When Daniels auditioned for the Merola Program for young singers
sponsored by the San Francisco Opera, she knew only five arias. She
sang small roles with the parent company and saw prime-time Beverly
Sills in Massenet's ``Manon.'' ``When I saw that, I said, `I'm
going to do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels's career, like so many others, began with the touring
Goldovsky Opera Theater; she sang ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``La
Traviata,'' and ``Don Giovanni.'' Soon Daniels was singing
regularly at the New York City Opera (for her debut in the title
role of Offenbach's ``La Belle Helene'' she was paid $150 a
performance) and on the American regional opera circuit. She
developed a particularly close relationship with the Kansas City
Lyric Opera, where she sang ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' in two
different productions and later returned to direct the opera. Over
the years she sang Micaela in ``Carmen'' and Musetta in ``La
Boheme'' countless times, and says she never tired of singing
Micaela. She was a vivacious and popular Merry Widow, and she
particularly loved singing Marguerite in ``Faust'' and all of those
roles in American operas thatgive great acting opportunities to a
singer, particularly Birdie in ``Regina,'' Baby Doe, the title role
in ``Susannah,'' and Curly's Wife in ``Of Mice and Men.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniels took her first step into directing 14 years ago. For
years, both she and her second husband, baritone Daniel Sullivan,
were busy traveling and performing, and wherever they went, they
took their daughter Megan, now 21, with them. ``But then, suddenly,
Megan was 7, and she didn't know where she lived,'' Daniels recalls
ruefully. ``We wanted to see what we could do to center her life,
and our lives, too, so Dan took a job at the University of Arizona,
and Tucson became our home base. At first this was very difficult
for us; I missed New York and I felt that by going back to Arizona
I was somehow going home and giving up. But I needed to be reminded
that I could do other things besides sing. For five years I ran an
educational program about opera that traveled all over the state
and I did a lot of work with affiliate-artist programs, small
hands-on residencies. When you are performing all the time, you get
into the habit of promoting yourself and the product, and it is all
too easy to forget your roots, and the human reasons why you wanted
to do this in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels came to Boston University in 1991 on a temporary
appointment as artist in residence, and she has been here ever
since; Sullivan came too, and has remained active as a performer
(he's been in several Boston Lyric Opera productions). Daniels has
directed BU productions of ``The Mother of Us All,'' ``The Merry
Wives of Windsor,'' ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' ``Street Scene,''
``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and ``Albert Herring''' she also
directed ``Baby Doe'' for the Boston Lyric. Along the way, she _
and others _ discovered what a gifted and inspiring voice teacher
she is. ``A voice teacher should be like a launching pad for a
singer,'' Daniels says firmly. ``Not like a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Daniels tried to keep on performing. She gave a
recital here, took the lead in a BU production of ``A Little Night
Music,'' and went to the Opera Theatre of St. Louis to sing the
lead in a revival of Conrad Susa's ``Black River.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she loved doing the Susa opera. ``One of the reasons I
enjoyed it is that I was playing an older woman rather than a
perpetual ingenue or soubrette, and I had a great mad scene. That
was five years ago, and I haven't done any performing since then. I
still want to sing, but my life isn't about finding time to sing
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the next chapter, Daniels says, ``I am totally
committed to everything I'm doing, but it's a struggle to keep
everything in balance; I probably say yes to too many things. I
love teaching voice and I love directing _ not many people do both.
But I have to say that I miss singing. I would love to work up a
new recital program and try it out in some inconspicuous venue,
nothing grand, but something special, for me. My voice is still
fresh, and I think I still have something to share. Singing is like
a very dear friend that I have neglected for too long.''

<P>
   When submarines stopped being driven by diesels and went
nuclear, the submarine movie genre took a dive. ``Crimson Tide''
and ``The Hunt for Red October'' can't hold a torpedo to ``Das
Boot,'' ``Run Silent, Run Deep,'' or ``The Enemy Below.'' Jonathan
Mostow, who demonstrated an uncommon ability to breathe new life
into an old genre in ``Breakdown,'' gives it a good try in
``U-571.'' Propelled by nonstop action sequences, it's a slickly
crafted throwback to those World War II movies in which character
didn't matter as much as the fact that we, the good guys, won in
the end, even if it meant believing that the Germans couldn't shoot
straight and we couldn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' not only wants to place itself alongside ``Das Boot''
in its depiction of the perils faced by a submarine crew on a
dangerous mission, but freely admits being heavily influenced by
the German award-winning undersea saga. Several of its designers
and technicians were hired to work on ``U-571.'' The result is a
film that never lets down, even if depth of character always takes
second place to depth charges. There's never a dull moment aboard
the sub. There's also never any serious attempt to establish
characters who are more than emblematic. The young crewmen have
generic American names like Trigger, Rabbit, and Tank. They may
barely be old enough to shave, but they come through with huge
heroics.
</P>
<P>
   They frankly come off better than the leads, although Matthew
McConaughey looks better than he has in his last few so-called
serious roles and is more focused and compelling. It's too bad that
he's stuck with a script that reduces him to little more than his
character's macho need to prove himself under fire to resolve any
doubts his commander (Bill Paxton) may have had about his ability
to lead. For all its aspirations to follow in the wake of ``Das
Boot,'' this film never tries for the tragic dimension enveloping
that film's U-boat commander, Jurgen Prochnow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Harvey Keitel's chief petty officer, who could have
bolstered ``U-571'' with his aura of experience, but isn't
permitted to, one could wish that he didn't have to bark lines like
``I'm a sea dog.'' But if the interpersonal dynamic seems stunted
and stereotyped in ``U-571,'' the ensemble cast throws itself at
its work wholeheartedly. They and the absolutely first-rate
technical experts never give you time to contemplate the film's
shortcomings at length. Mostow's jackhammer pacing keeps throwing
trouble first at the US sub and then, after a firefight, the
commandeered German U-571 with the secret code the Allies badly
need to stop getting clobbered by the U-boats. (There actually was
such a device, called the Enigma, and it was captured by the
British; we later captured a U-boat.)
</P>
<P>
   They get fired upon by destroyers and other subs, and the model
builders do a sensational job of convincing us we're seeing both
subs dodge torpedoes and depth charges by the dozen, while
continually improvising the repairs they need to keep going and
keeping a wary eye on their not-to-be-trusted prisoner, the U-boat
commandant (Thomas Kretschmann). There's no end of suspense, as
depth charges and torpedos come as close as grazing the hull of the
sub with the Americans, while our side can usually take care of
things with one well-aimed shot. It has to be one because we
haven't got the time or ammo for two.
</P>
<P>
   For all its wish to show ordinary guys rising to heroism,
``U-571'' turns out to be one of those old-style World War II
movies that depends for Allied success on the Germans having bad
aim. More than once, the film's biggest struggle is not with the
Germans, who are rather too easily eliminated, but with its own
growing credibility gap. The American commandos operate the
captured German sub proficiently in minutes even though only two of
them can read and comprehend German. Mostow's intermittently
successful game plan is to never let the film sit still long enough
to make its shortcomings _ which is to say its essentially
mechanical, generic nature _ apparent.
</P>
<P>
   He ratchets up the suspense by frequently having the sub dive to
avoid depth charges, with the crew huddling tensely as they listen
to the noises that mean the steel sides are groaning under the
pressure. When in doubt about what to do next, Mostow simply has
the sub spring another leak, complete with crew member grimacing as
he tries to free up a balky valve handle or hatch cover. ``U-571''
works well enough as a straight-ahead adventure thriller as long as
you don't stop and think about it, and instead just let it sweep
you up in its momentum. But not every detail contributes to the
film. Why, for instance, do the crew members whisper when they've
got an enemy ship in their sights? Do they think they'll be
overheard 500 yards away? Adrenaline-filled as the submerged
``U-571'' may be, it spends a lot of time, figuratively speaking,
on the surface.

SQUIRRELS NO MATCH FOR A MAN OF STEEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There must be some relation between working outdoors and having
fun outdoors. Between:
</P>
<P>
   Shoveling snow and skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Mowing a lawn and walking on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Raking leaves and hiking in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Even _ if we really narrow the focus _ painting the house trim
and painting the boat bottom.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is a chore, the other a joy.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter S. Thompson inspired me with a fantasy that visits often
in the spring when I am trying to get my lawn mower going, having
neglected to have it serviced _ as suggested in the long-lost
maintenance manual _ in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, you may have read, had a Jeep he disliked. Living in
the ranch country of Woody Creek, Colo., Thompson parked the Jeep
near enough to his house to take shots at it with all manner of
weapons _ shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, and the like. He even
wired it with dynamite as part of his crusade of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   So my fantasy involves moving into my log house on some woody
shore left in its absolutely wild state. Neither the house nor the
grounds would require the least maintenance. Then I wheel my lawn
mower out to its execution, shoulder my Remington 870 pump, and
blast it to bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``And here's one for the time you wrecked my back. Remember
that?'' I would growl. ``Sixty-seven pulls before you started!
Remember?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you remember the time your wheel fell off right by the
garden and you wrecked those azaleas?''
</P>
<P>
   Blam!
</P>
<P>
   ``And you remember how you'd always be dripping oil on the
garage floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Blam!
</P>
<P>
   ``And how your adjustable wheels were always stuck and never
adjusted? And how in the spring your gas line was caramelized and
required an $80 job at the fix-it shop, and it took three weeks to
get done? And by then the lawn looked like a Wisconsin wheat
field?''
</P>
<P>
   Blam! Blam! Blam!
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what I call combining outdoor work with recreation
in the best possible way.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose having a bad relationship with an inanimate object may
seem a bit perverse. So let's try creatures, for this season of
renewal almost always rekindles my war with the squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   No, I do not try to kill them or harm them in any way, yet I
would not be reporting this were I not winning the war in rather
dramatic fashion. I am delighted to say that not a single squirrel
has reached my bird feeder for seven years now.
</P>
<P>
   The old ones have long given up, but as the youngsters start
gamboling around my yard in the spring, they pause now and then,
behold the huge feeder chock full of gray stripe and black oil
sunflower seed, and set about trying to get at it. Simply watching
them is worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   But first the device itself: The feeder has three columns of
seed, each about 14 inches tall, covered on top by a plastic dome.
When full, the feeder holds about 10 pounds of seed, so it needs
strong support. Several attempts to fit it atop the aluminum pole
that came with it ended in failure, as the squirrels would reach
the feeder within seconds of my turning my back on it.
</P>
<P>
   Greasing the pole with Crisco made for some fun viewing for a
while (even more fun with Crisco and hot pepper), but soon the
first few sacrificial squirrels would have cleaned the grease off
the pole and they'd be back at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well,'' said my kindly wife, ``squirrels have to eat,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   No way. I wasn't giving in to that nonsense. Our house is
surrounded by big oak trees teeming with these rodents, and I
needed some kind of victory. So I turned to my fishing gear for
help. (I was still mentally a long way away from aforementioned
shotgun.)
</P>
<P>
   Finding a long, overhanging oak branch about 25 feet high, I
cast a sinker over it and rigged the feeder to a length of strong
twine. The squirrels could not leap up to the feeder, or jump to it
off the tree. But their valedictorian figured out that he (she?)
could merely go up the branch from which it hung and bite through
the twine. I found the ransacked feeder on the ground, seed half
gone.
</P>
<P>
   I tried Stren 30-pound test monofilament, which did not last
much longer, but then I knew exactly what was needed. In my tackle
box was a reel of 40-pound stainless steel wire, which, once rigged
with the bird feeder, solved the problem for good.
</P>
<P>
   The feeder now swings in the breeze about 9 feet off the ground,
20 feet out from the tree in a space absolutely inviolable by the
squirrels. It withstands blizzards and summer blows, and is
patronized by all manner of small birds, from wrens to bright red
cardinals and goldfinches; even an occasional pair of Baltimore
Orioles, with those striking orange breasts, stops along its
migration route.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then a young squirrel will make a new attempt, but it
always ends the same. Starting from the branch above, he will grab
the wire _ unable to chew through it _ and try descending it. But
once his back claws leave the limb, he streaks down the wire out of
control, bonks his head on the feeder and flips onto the lawn,
where he lies until recovering consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   He then _ I fervently hope and almost believe _ goes back into
the woods to warn the others about a bird feeder they should
definitely not attempt mess with. They don't.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is the time to renew the wire and set the feeder once
again in mid-air, attatched to its squirrel-proof skyhook. And I
remain ready to capture on video the attempt by the next young

NHL'S DILEMMA: NO ONE'S WATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the same old story with the NHL _ very few people are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Fox tried everything, including the infamous blue puck, and
couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   And now ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 have completed the first regular
season of their five-year, $600 million television deal, and the
ratings numbers are the lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for lack of trying. ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2, all
subsidiaries of the Disney Co., have cross-promoted the sport like
crazy and still can't grow the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into this knowing that some building had to occur,''
said Artie Bulgrin, ESPN's senior vice president of research,
sales, and development.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgrin is at least telling the truth. ESPN is up 2 percent for
its coverage of six first-round playoff games, from a .64 rating
last year to a .65 this year. ESPN2 has had seven playoff games and
its numbers dropped by 16 percent, from .56 last year to .47.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Point something or other. The NHL is the only
major professional sport for which the bulk of the playoff games
are not only shown on cable but also generate such a chilly
response.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season wasn't much better. The last regular-season
game on ABC, on April 9, averaged a 1.0 rating and a 2 share.
Unlike Fox, which aired 11 days of regional games, ABC opted to
have four days of regional games. ABC averaged a 1.3 rating and a 4
share, the lowest in the history of network sports television.
</P>
<P>
   Fox didn't do much better when it had the rights to the NHL. In
1997, the network aired six games and averaged a 1.9 rating. That
number fell by nearly 30 percent when Fox officials decided to air
five more games the next year. In 1998, with 11 games, the ratings
dropped to a 1.4.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is an embarrassment on television for all the reasons
that viewers have known for years. The sport doesn't translate well
to the small screen. The sport has a regional appeal, and, for the
most part, the game's biggest stars are not home-grown talent.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Eliot, CNN/SI's NHL analyst, said another reason for the
lack of interest is Americans' unfamiliarity with the sport. ``Most
people have played catch with a football or baseball or played
basketball, but very few have actually played hockey,'' Eliot said.
``The lack of grassroots knowledge has hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing. Eliot said that the emergence of the
in-line game has helped younger fans gain knowledge about the game,
and as ESPN officials tell the story, the networks have seen proof
of a growing interest in hockey among Gen Xers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bulgrin said, the number of male viewers ages
18-34 has grown by as much as 70 percent over the last year. ESPN
aired 27 games last year and delivered about 124,000 men in that
key demographic last year. ESPN delivered about 165,000 this year
during the regular season. The numbers dropped slightly on ESPN2,
but Bulgrin explained that the Deuce showed more games. Last year
ESPN2 aired 75 games and delivered about 76,000 men ages 18-34.
ESPN2 aired 101 games this regular season and delivered 69,000.
ESPN2 did deliver a much younger audience. Men ages 12-24 increased
by 4 percent on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fairly good proof that we are connecting with the
young male viewer,'' Bulgrin said. ``All of this bodes well for the
networks. We recognize the value and growth potential of this
important demographic and are very encouraged by what we have seen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Apocryphal or not, the NHL still has a long, very long, way to
go. The consistently low numbers belie a deeper question: Can
hockey ever become a popular, nationally televised sport in this
day of a gazillion channels filled with sports programming?
</P>
<P>
   The NHL contract with Disney expires in four years. What happens
if ESPN decides not to air the games and finds other suitable
programming to fill the NHL's place in March, April, and May? ESPN
and ABC officials remain optimistic, but for how long?

FOR RAYTHEON, DIVERSIFICATION WAS THE WRONG MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many moons ago _ 16 years, to be exact _ we were summoned to
Raytheon headquarters for a dressing down by then chief executive
Thomas Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Our sin? We had the temerity to write an article that had
suggested Raytheon would be better off selling its commercial
businesses and concentrating on defense.
</P>
<P>
   A decent but stern man, Phillips let us know we were all wrong.
The defense business, he told us, was a fickle one. Defense
build-ups were inevitably followed by defense build-downs. A
company heavily dependent on the Pentagon could wind up in deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was diversification. A Raytheon with one foot in the
commercial world and another in the defense world would produce the
steady results investors would appreciate, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, Raytheon is finally reversing course.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Lexington, Mass. company announced the sale of
its troubled engineering and construction unit. Rumors suggest the
commercial aircraft business is on the block, too. The appliance
business was sold off in 1997 and 1998; the publishing and
road-building arms of Raytheon are gone as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant future, Raytheon may be just what Tom
Phillips didn't want it to be: almost a pure-play in defense
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a good idea? Wall Street thinks so and has thought so
for a long time. ``The company should focus on its knitting,'' said
Keith Patriquin, an analyst with Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at Raytheon's history doesn't give you that much
confidence the new course will be a better one. If anything, what
Raytheon has proved is that there are risks both inside and outside
defense and that shareholders can be blindsided by either.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon began its diversification efforts in 1964 with the
purchase of Amana, an appliance maker. Over time, the company
became a miniconglomerate. The commercial businesses had their
moments; Amana always had a good reputation. In the mid-1990s, the
construction company was extremely profitable. The Beech Aircraft
line is still considered a bona fide success.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Wall Street has been underwhelmed by Raytheon's
performance in commercial lines. ``The returns have not been
stellar,'' said John Hayes, an analyst with Independence Investment
Associates in Boston. Others use words like ``spotty'' and
``mixed'' to describe the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awful'' would be a better description for the recent
performance of the construction business. Raytheon practically
handed the division over to Morrison Knudsen this week _ the
purchase price was actually $10 million. Writing off the business
forced Raytheon to post a $181 million loss for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s, Raytheon excelled on
the defense side. When the Cold War ended, Raytheon gobbled up its
weaker rivals to ensure it would be one of a handful of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But since last fall, the company has reported heavy casualties
on the defense side, too. Part of the problem is the environment.
As The Wall Street Journal wrote Thursday in a story about
Lockheed, ``Despite a decade of consolidation among US weapons
makers, a global downturn in high-tech arms sales means even the
most competitive contractors are living hand-to-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wounds, however, have been self-inflicted. Raytheon
has discovered a series of problems in the units it acquired from
Texas Instruments and Hughes Electronics Corp. that have led to
several quarters of disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has noticed. Since July, Raytheon's stock has lost
70 percent of its value. Over the long haul, the numbers look
equally dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, Raytheon's stock has provided an annual average
return of 6 percent, compared to 18 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index. Put another way, if you had invested $10,000 in
Raytheon in 1984, it would now be worth about $26,000. A comparable
investment in the S&AMP;P would be worth about $148,000. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts and money managers applaud Raytheon's decision to
focus on its core business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good time to be concentrating on defense
electronics,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research.
Nisbet expects defense spending to pick up in the years ahead; that
spending could grow faster still if Republicans win the White House
this fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman isn't so sure. An analyst with the S&AMP;P Equity
Group, he said that Raytheon is back to square one. The company
moved away from defense in the first place because defense was an
unreliable business. In Friedman's opinion, it still is. He
complains about the government's ``dysfunctional'' procurement
system and the Pentagon's push ``to cut costs to the bone.'' Said
Friedman, ``I have a negative outlook on the whole industry.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the answer? Will Raytheon be better off mostly as a
defense electronics company than it was as a diversified company?
</P>
<P>
   Check back with us in 2016 _ 16 years from now _ and we will
compare the numbers.

 BARTER'S BACK, BUT WITH A CYBER-TWIST

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Internet, everything old is new. Even barter, the
practice of buying goods with other goods instead of with money,
has made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   New Web sites have sprung up to help consumers swap their old
boring books and music recordings for new interesting ones. No cash
changes hands. It's almost like a high-tech return to the Stone
Age, with hunter-gatherers trading meat for vegetables, and waiting
for somebody to invent money.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kevin Wells has done _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Swapit, a Maynard-based music CD exchange launched this month by
Wells and partner Howard Schneider, features bartering with a
difference. His company provides a guaranteed market for people
with unwanted CDs. No need to wait for someone who wants what
you've got; Swapit will take it off your hands, in hopes of trading
it at a profit to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that there are a lot of friction points for folks in
barter right now,'' says Wells, chairman of the firm's board. One
of these friction points is painfully obvious. How can you be sure
that someone will want to trade their John Coltrane for your Pink
Floyd?
</P>
<P>
   This inability to consistently match buyers and sellers has
always been the crippling defect of barter systems. So people came
up with the idea of money _ an all-purpose medium of exchange that
you could always use to buy something you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Swapit has come up with its own barter currency, called Swapit
Bucks. Customers get them by sending in disks they no longer
desire. Right now, Swapit only handles music CDs, and only
recordings likely to appeal to a youthful audience, like rock and
rap. The company hopes to add computer games and DVD movies this
June.
</P>
<P>
   People who register at the Swapit Web site (www.swapit.com) can
download and print out postage-paid mailing labels that they can
use to mail the merchandise to Swapit's warehouse in Chicago.
Swapit also plans to set up Federal Express-like drop boxes on
college campuses all over the nation. They're starting out with
drop boxes at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the warehouse, all disks are inspected to ensure they're fit
to be swapped. Each disk that passes muster is worth a minimum of
$2 in Swapit Bucks, or more if it's an especially valuable
recording. The company sets disk values with the help of a database
of prices for 300,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Once the user has swapped in a few disks, he can start swapping
out others already stored at the warehouse. The Swapit Web site
lists every available disk. If the customer sees something he
likes, he pays the listed price in Swapit Bucks, plus a $2 per disk
transaction fee, which is where Wells figures to make his profit.
There's also a shipping charge of $2.95 per shipment, no matter how
many disks you order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally take five CDs out of the inventory for a
grand total of $12.95,'' said Wells. ``That's the best deal on the
Web, off the Web, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Swapit's competitors might not think so. Such firms as Mr. Swap
and Switchouse use a more conventional approach. Users post
messages about what products they'd be willing to swap and what
products they'd like in exchange. Michael Lin, CEO of San
Francisco-based Switchouse, says that because his site has 200,000
items listed, there are plenty of opportunities to do a deal.
``When you add the tens of thousands of people together, you begin
to find that the matches do exist,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells doesn't see why customers should have to wait until
exactly the right swap partner comes along. Besides, Swapit
actually inspects every bartered item, and makes sure they get
shipped. The two parties aren't forced to simply trust each other,
as in a traditional barter system.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists take the barter business seriously; Swapit
is being backed by NetValue Holdings. But Jonathan Gaw, who tracks
e-commerce for International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif.,
is dismissive of Internet swap sites. ``Why would I give up the
flexibility of cash for something called Swapit Bucks?'' he
chuckled. ``Money was invented for a very good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Wells claims that 42,000 people have registered at
Swapit since the site went live on April 4, and thousands of swaps
have already taken place. Perhaps barter isn't quite obsolete after
all.

RESEARCHERS WORRYING AS TEENS GROW UP ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teens don't understand the big fuss. As the first generation to
grow up in a wired world, they hardly know a time when computers
weren't around, and they leap at the chance to spend hours online,
chatting with friends. So what?
</P>
<P>
   But researchers nationwide are increasingly concerned that, as
cyberspace replaces the pizza parlor as the local hangout,
adolescents are becoming more isolated, less adept at interpersonal
relationships, and perhaps numb to the small _ and big _ deceptions
that are so much a part of the e-mail world.
</P>
<P>
   From Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the Internet
Addiction Center at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., researchers
are asking just how the futures of teenagers are changed when so
many of them are spending an hour or two on the Internet each day,
replacing face-to-face contact with virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only looking at what the computer can do for us, but
what are they doing to us,'' said Sherry Turkle, an MIT sociologist
who has secured start-up funding for a Center for Technology and
Identity. ``It's on so many people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkle's center will study, among other things, how today's
teens are affected by growing up with interactive computer
technology. She wants to know how a teen's sense of self and values
may be altered in a world where personal connections and the
creation of new identities can be limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh is beginning a study on
the long-term effect on teenagers when the computer becomes a
central part of their social lives. Social psychologist Robert
Kraut said he's concerned about the ``opportunity costs'' of so
much online time for youths.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut found that teens who used computers, even just a few hours
a week, showed increased signs of loneliness and social isolation.
In his 1998 study of 100 Pittsburgh families that use the Internet,
Kraut said these teens reported having fewer friends to hang around
with, possibly because their computer time replaced hours they
would have spent with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chatting online may be better than watching television, but
it's worse than hanging out with real friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in cyber-chatting teens goes beyond academia. Next
month, a White House conference on teenagers is sponsoring a
session on teens and online behavior, including warnings about
cyber-stalkers and other predators.
</P>
<P>
   But today's teens don't see anything strange in the fact that
the computer screen occupies a central place in their social lives.
Just as their parents' generation quickly adjusted to microwave
ovens and touch-tone phones, so have today's teens to personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when America Online burst onto the scene with chat
rooms and instant-messenger systems, teens flocked to them by the
millions. Traffic soared in the mid-1990s when AOL developed a
``buddy list'' for the instant-messenger system, enabling teens to
know when friends were online, and then start a conversation. If
all the buddies wanted to e-mail at once, they could enter their
own chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage use of computers grew even more over the last two years,
thanks to the steep drop in prices of personal computers. About 40
percent of US households now have a computer, and nearly 70 percent
with incomes more than $50,000 have them, according to the Yankee
Group, a Boston-based technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, AOL reports a spike in instant-messenger
traffic in the mid-afternoon, just after school lets out. Teens say
it's little different than the rush at McDonald's after 2 p.m. as
adolescents look for ways to unwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is stressful and busy. There's almost no time to just
hang out,'' said Parker Rice, 17, of Newton (Mass.) South High
School. ``Talking online is just catch-up time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teens acknowledge there's an unreal quality to their
cyberspace communication, including their odd shorthand terms, such
as POS (parent over shoulder) or LOL (laughing out loud).
Psychologists see this code as part of the exclusive shared
language that teenagers love.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to e-mail exchanges, teens also show a remarkable
tolerance for each other's fudges or deceptions. Nor are they
surprised when a mere acquaintance unloads a personal secret
through e-mail. Nobody seems to expect the online world to be the
same as the real world.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting outside school recently, Rice recalled a timid boy
in class who recently got up the nerve to send her an e-mail. At
the end, he issued an uncharacteristically macho send-off, ``Later,
Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd never say that to me face to face in school,'' said Rice,
more amused than annoyed. ``Sometimes people try to seem more
self-confident online.''
</P>
<P>
   And consider the fact that Jonathon Reis, 14, of Somerville,
didn't seem the least bit put off when a girl who had described
herself online as slender turned out to be quite heavy. ``I know
it's likely they'll say they look better than they are,'' he said
while shopping at a Boston mall.
</P>
<P>
   Teens say they also appreciate the ability to edit what they say
online, or take the time to think about a response. As cowardly as
it may seem, some teens admit that asking someone for a date, or
breaking up, can be easier in message form.
</P>
<P>
   But they insist there's no harm intended, and cyberspace has
become just another medium _ like the telephone _ in the
often-clumsy, experimental world of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the view of these youths, Turkle, an MIT specialist in
the computer's impact on human behavior, sees cyberspace as the new
electronic ``playspace'' for adolescents, an escape from the
pressure of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   While she worries about some safety issues, Turkle said the
anonymity and distance of cyberspace allow young people to try out
new identities. For instance, an artistic boy can admit to an
interest in fashion or an awkward girl can reach out to some new
friends with little fear of rejection. Shaping their own identities
and forming strong peer groups are among the most central themes of
adolescence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is the location where much of the work of adolescence
is being done these days,'' said Turkle.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers don't think everything is so benign,
worrying that some teens will mistake the ``weak social ties'' so
easily found among e-mail buddies for genuine friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the kind of relationships that will sustain you
if you have a personal crisis or a death in the family,'' said
Harry Waxman, a psychologist and chair of the Project on the
Internet and Human Behavior at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman and others worry about raising a generation of teens who,
as adults, would rather solve a dispute through e-mail than in
person. In some ways, the Internet exacerbates the trend toward
isolation and away from community that Harvard government professor
Robert Putnam has described as ``bowling alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of social isolation, a small group of
researchers speculates that the developing neural connections in
the brains of teens could be affected by such intense involvement
with the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you restrict your experience to staring in front of the
screen, you may be short-changing your brain,'' said Dr. Martin
Teicher, head of developmental biopsychiatry at McLean Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McLean Hospital has already set up an Internet
Addiction Center for teens as well as adults who fear computers are
harming them psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Maressa Hecht Orzack, its coordinator, said she gets many
teenage patients, often youngsters who are socially marginalized or
among the ``bright and bored.'' She's eager for more research to be
done on the impact of online life on teens, saying the good and bad
of the medium is not yet fully known.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people may be losing connections to real
objects,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Ananova, the computer-generated character billed as ``the
world's first virtual newsreader,'' just so darn creepy?
</P>
<P>
   It's not the green hair. It's not the jerky facial movements or
the robotic voice that sounds a bit like Max Headroom on estrogen.
It's not the hype that surrounded her debut this week on
ananova.com, a news site launched by the British Press Association.
And it's certainly not the fear that this digital lady will replace
all legitimate journalists and send us begging for PR jobs at _
gasp _ some dot-com startup.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's none of that. The real problem is that she looks
exactly like Mary Poppins.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously. Watch her tilt her head and purse her lips with a
certain smug satisfaction. Give her an umbrella and a perky little
hat, and the next thing you know, she'll be telling you to take
your medicine while she reads the latest headlines. This is too
much to handle: A virtual Mary Poppins look-alike dishing up dirt
in a virtual broadcast shown in streaming video format. It's just
too, well, weird to see the flying nanny tarted up like one of the
Spice Girls (she is said to resemble Posh Spice) and programmed to
express virtual emotions. She winks, she blinks, she grins. When
will she burst into song?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the New New Thing in news delivery or is it a gimmick?
Consider the top stories the synthespian ``covered'' on the Web
site one night recently: An Austrian television station is trying
to attract more female viewers by offering free breast
enlargements; Saddam Hussein's son was voted journalist of the year
by the Iraqi Journalists' Union even though reportedly he can
barely read and write; and a New Zealand cat survived an electric
shock.
</P>
<P>
   These are real stories that were read by the virtual anchor. At
one point in the broadcast, she asked, ``How bizarre is this?''
Good question. It's hard to know which is more disturbing: the
sensation over a crude digital creation or the sensational news she
delivers. Why make such a big deal over a robotic announcer when
instant news read by real anchors is available 24 hours a day on
CNN? And most major news operations are now offering streaming
video coverage of breaking stories on their Web sites.

   The folks who gave life to Ananova claim that their creation
isn't just a marketing scheme for the Web site, which is a news
portal. She was designed to deliver information on mobile
telephones, says Mark Hird, publishing director of Ananova Ltd.,
the Press Association's new media division. ``There is a bit of fun
to be had with the concept, but for us, it's deadly serious,'' he
says. ``We are in the real-time information business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was certainly doing serious business after the
announcement hit all the major news media Wednesday. It took
forever to gain access to the site after traffic skyrocketed. One
television station even conducted a ``live'' interview with the
synthespian. Hird says Ananova has ``an army of fans'' and has
received a few marriage proposals. But despite all the hype, she's
just a computerized glam girl with glassy eyes. It just goes to
show that it doesn't take much to garner headlines these days _ or
to read them.

   The prim Mary Poppins wouldn't be too popular in a nutty new
online game called Sissy Fight. The game takes you back to the
schoolyard, where catty little girls gang up on each other and
scratch and tease and tattle and cower. Decidedly low-tech, the
game is pretty hilarious. You pick a name, say All That or Marcia
Brady, and compete against as many as five other players. You don't
have to know how to handle a joystick: This is a girl's game, after
all. You chat with the other players as the game proceeds and win
self-esteem points by successfully terrorizing the other players.
The girl with the most self-esteem points wins. The game is at

   While some folks were learning to survive in the schoolyard,
others escaped into the supernatural world of the ``Lord of the

thing, but it continues to be widely popular. In fact, a film
adaptation that won't even be released until December 2001 is
already creating quite a stir online. The trailer for ``The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings'' was downloaded 1.7 million
times in the first 24 hours after its release online a few weeks
ago. The film stars Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler. The trailer is at

   It's a strange day, indeed, when the president-elect of Russia
emulates an American horror writer. But that's exactly what
happened this week when Vladimir Putin's publisher announced that
an English translation of the Russian politician's memoirs will be
available on the Internet at the same time it is released in US
bookstores next week. Stephen King made headlines earlier this year
when he published his newest novella, ``Riding the Bullet,''
exclusively online. The e-book version of Putin's memoirs, titled
``First Person,'' will be distributed at www.peanutpress.com.

   The upheaval in the music industry continues apace, as Dr. Dre
threatened to sue Napster, which developed the popular online
song-swapping program, if Napster doesn't remove his songs from its
system. Earlier this month, Metallica sued Napster for copyright
and also sued Yale University, the University of Southern
California, and Indiana University, where the popular program is
widely used; the heavy metal band has since dropped the suit
against Yale, which has banned Napster on campus. And April 20
Indiana blocked the program on its campus as well. The battle seems
like it's only going to get hotter and more contentious.

   Meanwhile, EMI announced that it is putting its entire catalog
online _ in sheet music form, that is. Musicians who want to cover
songs by Sting, Aerosmith, or other EMI artists can download the
sheet music from www.net4music.com for $3.95 a song. It's hardly a
revolution, but like Ananova, it's being billed as another
(dubious) Internet first.

TAUT `CROUPIER' DEALS A WINNING HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
CROUPIER 
Directed by: Mike Hodges 
Screenplay by: Paul Mayersberg 
Starring: Clive Owen, Gina McKee, Alex Kingston, Alexander Morton,
Kate Hardie, Nicholas Ball 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Unrated 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three best British crime movies of the last few decades are
``Get Carter,'' ``The Long Good Friday'' and ``The Krays.'' Mike
Hodges's ``Croupier'' isn't quite in their class, but it comes
pretty close. It's brilliantly precise in its detailing, stylishly
jagged and sensual by turns, and utterly unpredictable. Hodges, who
also directed ``Get Carter,'' sets ``Croupier'' in an airless
world, whether in the glassy closed circuit of the casino, or the
cramped basement flat where the croupier of the title lives with an
ex-policewoman girlfriend who romanticizes his own view of himself
as a writer and, without meaning to, increases the tension level
between them by trying to nag him into writing a literary
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Owens's title-role in ``Croupier'' is just as arresting
and compulsively watchable as Michael Caine's avenger gunning for
the man who killed his brother in ``Get Carter.'' But while Caine's
nemesis figure went looking for trouble, Owen's sinister but more
passive protagonist goes to a lot of trouble to insulate himself
from it. A native South African, he has come to England partly
because literary careers are not made in South Africa, and partly
because he wants to get beyond the reach of his con-man father, who
keeps phoning him long-distance and posing as a big shot while
working as a bartender in a resort.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Jack says, ``I hate cheaters,'' and means it.
But what he's really saying is that he hates his father, played,
during the few times we see him on the phone, with a con man's mix
of bluster and desperation. Of course, Jack is a run-of-the-mill
fugitive from intimacy, too. When he fears he's growing too
dependent on his girlfriend's salary, he reluctantly but resolutely
goes back to the one thing he does know well, which is how to cut
the cards and stay cool. Apart from the fact that he's got the
right skills, the croupier's job suits him temperamentally. Unlike
the players and the plungers, he can hang back and be in the
action, but not of it.
</P>
<P>
   What changes his game plan, and forces him to scramble to find a
new one, is first an involvement with Kate Hardie's sexy little
sparrow of a fellow croupier, then a flirtation with a worldly
woman (Alex Kingston), whose invitation to drinks quickly turns
into a heist scheme. Naturally, none of this sits well with his
girlfriend, the ex-cop. In several ways the walls close in, and
Owen's taciturn pillar of non-involvement exchanges his slightly
sinister look for a hunted expression. Can he negotiate the
labyrinth devised by someone cleverer than he? Or will he become
yet another neo-noir casualty? Hodges and Owen keep us guessing _
and caring _ in this delicious little silken minefield of a movie.

`FILTH' DOCUMENTS PISTOLS' FURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE FILTH AND THE FURY 
Directed by: Julien Temple 
Produced by: Anita Camarata and Amanda Temple 
Starring: Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, Steve Jones, Paul Cook and
Glen Matlock. 
Running Time: 105 minutes 
(Unrated) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most rockumentaries _ documentaries that look back on the glory
days _ are insufferable. They tend to be stupefyingly dull, smugly
self-aggrandizing, or they follow the cliched arc of
struggle/success/failure, as the ancient (surviving) band members
reminisce about all the drugs taken, groupies plundered, and music
made. Those were the days, my friend . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Sex Pistols' rockumentary, ``The Filth and the Fury,'' made
by director Julien Temple, is a different animal. True, the
pioneering British punk rock band imploded after one album and one
US tour, with singer Johnny Rotten spitting out ``Ever get the
feeling you've been cheated?'' at the audience during the last
show, in San Francisco. And, true, one of its members, Sid Vicious,
is shown nodding off during an interview, being jabbed by his
junkie-nag of a girlfriend Nancy Spungen. And, after being accused
of killing her, Vicious overdoses on heroin and dies shortly after
being released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sex Pistols really did change the course of pop history
_ their angry, bastard children are still spitting out songs of
discontent. The Sex Pistols came from another time and place _
certainly not a less cynical time, but a time when rock revolution
seemed a possibility. In 1976, the Pistols emerged from the
underbelly of London's working class and, with the aid of manager
Malcolm McLaren, turned 1976 upside down in its native land,
landing a no. 1 single, ``God Save the Queen,'' that the BBC
banned. They got signed by one record label _ then sacked. Signed
again _ sacked. They were, as Rotten sang, ``the poison in the
human machine . . . the flowers in the dustbin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Filth and the Fury,'' which employs previously unused
concert footage and intercuts it with scenes of London street life
at the time, makes its point: The Pistols were very much about the
collision of rock and politics. They came from a time before rage
was codified _ before it became a product and entertainment tool.
It is richly ironic that Temple made an earlier Sex Pistols movie,
``The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle,'' as a fantasy concocted by
McLaren; the current movie, as Rotten says as a key narrator (in
silhouette), was done to right the many wrongs. As to the band, he
posits, it was ``a bit like a Harold Pinter play _ it shouldn't
work but it does.'' Fast hard music, quick cutting from scene to
scene, with step-back moments such as Rotten musing about his old,
duped friend Vicious: ``I wish I was smarter. Poor sod.'' This is a
warts 'n' all portrayal _ there's no dodging the feelings of both
disgust and amusement the Pistols take toward Fleet Street and the
muck they kick up. (The movie's title is taken from a tabloid
headline the day after the Pistols appeared on national TV and,
goaded by a drunken host, cussed and cut up on camera.) Rotten is,
as always, entertaining and lacerating _ both to himself and
others. Guitarist Steve Jones also hits with comments that often
counter Rotten's perception.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Temple interrupts the action and the yak to
include scenes from the 1955 film version of ``Richard III,''
suggesting the Pistols saga is a classic three-act tragedy and that
Rotten modeled his hunchbacked persona after the doomed king. The
Sex Pistols proclaimed ``No future!'' and, of course, it was
self-fulfilling. But the hellbent ride they went on was
exhilarating. ``The Filth and the Fury'' captures the essence of
that trip and the surviving, older Pistols put it all in context.
One thing you come away with: This was rebellion, this was anarchy,
but this was fun. Briefly, the world was their oyster and, even if
they hated oysters, they loved spitting them out.

GRINDER PODEIN HAS COLORADO RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ No one is saying that he is going to dominate the
playoffs or turn himself into this spring's surprise sniper, a la
John Druce or Chris Kontos or Stephane Matteau of playoff years
past, but Colorado left wing Shjon Podein already has broken out in
this year's Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   By all definitions, he's an NHL grinder, a guy who skates his
lane, takes the body, and who for the better part of eight seasons
now has chugged along in two-bladed anonymity. However, in the
first three games of Colorado's first-round series against the
Coyotes, the reliable, hard-working Podein scored three of the
Avalanche's 13 goals.
</P>
<P>
   In today's low-scoring, clutch-and-grab, offense-be-damned NHL,
three goals from a guy like Podein is a downright embarrassment for
the third- and fourth-liners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's an ambassador for us all,'' kidded teammate Jeff
Odgers, the ex-Bruin who has made a career of filling out third and
fourth lines, mostly for his pugilistic prowess. ``Shjon Podein,
the people's wrist shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team far better known for its multitude of offensive
riches, Podein for the most part is just a suit, the navy blue 40
regular kept in the back of the closet for family functions and
annual performance reviews with the boss. Originally a draft pick
of the Oilers, he played two-plus seasons in the AHL (Cape Breton)
before finally getting his chance in Edmonton, and his stay there
was fragmented over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed up at my first Oiler camp at 225 pounds,'' recalled
Podein, now a well-conditioned 200. ``I went in thinking that I'd
bulk up, that I'd need that extra weight and muscle to play in the
NHL. I was going to be that big defensive winger. It took me about
two shifts to realize that I was skating about half the speed of
everyone else. I figured right there, `Hmm, this ain't gonna work.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, he was accustomed to the hockey world
flying by him. Born and raised in Rochester, Minn., Podein wasn't
drafted out of high school as an 18-year-old. He also was left off
everyone's wish list the next year, in the 1987 draft. By the time
the '88 draft rolled around, and the local paper was running
stories of how he probably would get selected this time, after a
respectable freshman season (4-4_8 in 30 games) at the University
of Minnesota-Duluth, Podein had learned not to get too emotionally
invested in the annual amateur jamboree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember driving back from California with a friend of
mine, and I stopped in Omaha to call home,'' said Podein. ``My dad
was telling me, `You know, there's a story in the paper here that
says you'll probably get drafted.' They were saying maybe I'd go in
the fifth or sixth round, somewhere in there, but I'd heard all
that before. I didn't think it would happen, and if it didn't, I
was going to finish my four years at college, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   What he did care about, if someone did want him, was the state
of the NHL at the time. Summed up neatly, that state was Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The high-powered Oilers, who were still a few weeks away from
trading Wayne Gretzky, already had won four Stanley Cups. There was
a bonafide dynasty in northern Alberta, with the likes of Mark
Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey filling out
the most powerful offense in league history. They scored at will
and skated like the wind.
</P>
<P>
   No way in the world, thought Podein, would Edmonton want a guy
like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton,'' came the voice over the public address system that
late afternoon at the draft, ``your selection, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton, with the 166th selection,'' answered the Oilers'
table, ``drafts Shjon Podein from the University of
Minnesota-Duluth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, just back from the drive from California, Podein
tiptoed into the family home in Rochester in the wee hours of
Sunday morning. There was no note on the kitchen table: ``Shjon,
good goin', you're a proud member of the (fill in the blank).'' He
tapped his mom's shoulder around 3 a.m., and listened incredulously
as she mumbled his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's all groggy and everything, but she says, `Oh, yeah, you
got picked by Edmonton,' '' he recalled. ``Edmonton? No way. The
fastest, best-skating team in the whole league, and they pick me?''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years later, history shows that Podein, though not fleet
afoot, was the best of the 13 picks the Oilers made that June day.
Their top choice, No. 19, was Francois Leroux, the lumbering
6-foot-6-inch defenseman who never has made it beyond journeyman
status in his tours with Edmonton, Ottawa, Pittsburgh, and
Colorado. Of the 11 other picks, the only to enjoy even limited
success has been Len Barrie, playing these days with Florida, his
second stop there after tries with Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and
even a couple of seasons in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Before Podein got anywhere in the NHL, he had to drop the 25
pounds and pick up his pace. That meant two full seasons in Cape
Breton, playing for the Oilers' farm team, where he worked first
and foremost on his skating. Eventually up to speed, he got two
looks with the Oilers, each lasting about half a season, but 27
points over 68 games would not be enough to convince the Oilers to
keep him in the organization. In the summer of 1994, the Flyers
signed him as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In his four-plus seasons with the Flyers, cast into the
defensive winger role, Podein's scoring pace picked up slightly.
His best season there, though, was only 32 points (14 goals) in
1996-97. By early last season, the Flyers were looking for someone
with similiar size, but with more of a scoring touch. The answer,
they thought, was Keith Jones, the ex-Washington right wing whose
scoring touch was beginning to wane in Colorado. On Nov. 12, 1998,
Jones headed east and Podein went west.
</P>
<P>
   ``His production had kind of slowed down,'' said Colorado
general manager Pierre Lacroix, referring to Jones. ``He'd been
used on top lines, previous to us, and his production here had
slowed down. We were pleased with what we'd seen in (Chris) Drury
and (Milan) Hejduk, and Podein looked like more of an all-around
player for us. It was a question of adjusting the chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the tinkering looks like a magical touch. Podein
was shut out in Colorado's 3-2 loss to the Coyotes Wednesday night,
dropping the Avalanche's series lead to 3-1, but his offense and
speed have made him an unsavory presence for the Desert Dogs. It
was hard enough for them to cover the likes of Joe Sakic, Peter
Forsberg, Drury, and Hejduk. Now they've got to find a way to
contain the guy with that funny first name.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon. It was a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wanted to name me Wolfgang,'' said Podein. ``My mom
didn't like that. She wanted Shaun. They put that together with my
grandfather's name, Jon, and went with Shjon. I think Wolfgang
would have been kinda tough, sort of like that song, ``A Boy Named
Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue, the sniper with the sizzling wrist shot. It probably
wouldn't have caused many to quake in their skates. But it is the
playoffs, a time when the otherwise unknown often do make a name
for themselves.

THE LIFE AND HARD TIMES OF A JAZZ PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MORNING GLORY: A Biography of Mary Lou Williams 
By Linda Dahl. 
Pantheon Books, 463 pp. illus. $30.00. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Lou Williams was the first great woman instrumentalist in
jazz. Born in 1910, she started playing the piano by ear when she
was 3, and spent much of the remaining 67 years of her life at the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   She was not just a superb pianist but a first-class musician who
created jazz Masses, attempted a concert suite, and wrote tunes and
arrangements for Benny Goodman, Jimmy Lunceford, and Duke Ellington
himself. Her real genius nevertheless lay not in composing or
arranging, but in improvisation, in letting her soul pour through
her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Her career was not an uninterrupted series of musical triumphs.
She made everything she did sound easy, but in fact she achieved
every success in the face of intimidating obstacles _ personal,
musical, artistic, financial and social. She was an
African-American women working in an artistic field that was
inventing itself as it went along; her art was produced in the
moment, but there is no way to extricate it from her life and its
times.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's life makes a great story, and Linda Dahl's new
biography narrates it with zest and compassion. Williams was born,
out of wedlock, in Atlanta. Her mother took in laundry and drank.
She never met her father until she was in her mid-20s. When she was
5, the family moved to Pittsburgh, where she became ``the little
piano girl of East Liberty.'' She played for friends and neighbors,
she played in church, roadhouses, saloons, and brothels. The
sporting men looked out for her until her natural beauty came into
bloom, and then she had her hands full.
</P>
<P>
   Abused and unhappy at home, Williams left at age 13 to join a
``talent show'' called Boise De Legg and His Hottentots; she spent
decades in what she called ``the mud and muck'' of life on the
road. Her first great success was with Andy Kirk and his Twelve
Clouds of Joy; as ``The Lady Who Swings the Band,'' she was to a
significant degree responsible for that success. She married a
couple of times, had an abortion, went through a long series of
love affairs, but steered clear of the occupational hazards of
drink and drugs. She had a big heart, and her Harlem apartment was
for decades a kind of informal rehab for family members, friends,
and jazz musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Williams enjoyed great success and was ``taken up'' at various
times in her life from childhood on, but when you are taken up, it
isn't long before you are put down. Williams was never financially
secure until the last three years of her life, when she became
artist-in-residence at Duke University (a plan for her to come to
the University of Massachusetts never came to fruition). By the
mid-1950s, Williams had reached some kind of personal and artistic
crisis. The personal crisis found resolution when she entered the
Catholic Church. That decision may have prolonged the artistic
crisis, because Williams became reluctant to play in nightclubs and
other ``sinful'' environments; she tried to support herself by
opening a thrift shop. Several priests proved helpful to her,
persuading her that she could serve her faith through her music;
one of them, a Jesuit, Peter O'Brien, became her manager, and
brought her back into her musical world _ she trusted him to
protect her. Much of her music from that time on was religious in
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl depended on O'Brien's cooperation to produce Williams's
biography, so she handles him with kid gloves, but it's still
abundantly clear why he became a controversial figure, and how
their friendship brought both deep satisfaction but also unleashed
complex tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl is unsatisfactory only in describing the most important
part of Williams's life, her music. For decades Williams kept up
with changing styles and fashions in jazz, from boogie to bop,
often one step ahead of others, while always remaining true to
herself. Sometimes a somewhat radical figure, Williams became
fundamentally conservative, and mistrustful of developments she
thought inimical to the true spirit of jazz. Because Dahl is wobbly
when writing about music, she turns to a variety of sources of
variable quality when she needs to describe Williams's playing,
improvisation or composition. When an observation comes along that
actually make sense, and lets you hear Mary Lou Williams, it
usually comes from Gunther Schuller.
</P>
<P>
   What Dahl's book does make you want to do is listen to Mary Lou
Williams again. Although Dahl's ``selected discography'' runs to
some 30 pages, not enough of it is readily available, and even the
complete discography is hardly an adequate survey of her art _
Williams made no solo records between 1929 and 1971, for example,
and many of the records she did make were poorly recorded and
undertaken in adverse circumstances. Has anyone ever mentioned, or
even noticed, that she recorded one of her famous creations, the
``Zodiac Suite,'' on an inferior and out-of-tune piano? The
``Zodiac Suite'' is a series of playful, allusive and elusive
portraits of jazz colleagues, but it also tells you a lot about
Williams. What the recording sounds like tells you about what she
had to overcome.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thieves have swiped personal data such as Social
Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for more than a decade
to gain access to bank accounts and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But now the crime of identity theft is becoming more complex as
rings of crooks use other people's personal data to open telephone
and other utility accounts, rent apartments, apply for loans, buy
cars, set up new businesses, and even declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Victims are often left with damaged credit ratings _ and
complicated paperwork to untangle their messy personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing much more varied and more sophisticated means by
which identities are being stolen and used in ways they weren't
used before,'' said James Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement
at the Treasury Department. ``The limit is as broad as the
imagination of the crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it can take ``hundreds of hours of leg work,'' and
the help of lawyers to restore a victim's good name, not to mention
the toll it can take in emotional anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person's good name has been stolen, it is not an
ordinary theft,'' Johnson said. ``It's not as if someone has stolen
the radio out of your car. It's taking the information that is most
private to you and exploiting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Identity swindlers frequently steal key data such as Social
Security numbers and birth dates from the mail or the trash, when
people discard documents. They also get it through the Internet, by
stealing wallets or credit card numbers, fraudulently obtaining
credit reports or getting personnel records from the workplace. The
number of identity theft victims is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration received more than 30,000
complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers last year;
most of the complaints concerned identity theft. That is an
increase from about 11,000 complaints in 1998 and 7,868 complaints
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   An identity theft hotline established last year by the Federal
Trade Commission reports getting 400 calls a week. (The FTC hotline
is 877-438-4338.)
</P>
<P>
   Identify theft has brought huge complexity to Marvin Young, a
32-year-old San Francisco man who works as a clerk for an Italian
paper company.
</P>
<P>
   Young says he has spent $10,000 in lawyer's fees and thousands
of hours trying to salvage his credit rating since his Social
Security number was stolen in 1989. His troubles began when he
handed over his Social Security number and driver's license to rent
a room.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards, another man had obtained a copy of his
Mississippi birth certificate and opened credit cards in his name,
charging purchases worth $80,000 on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   The thief also has opened several checking accounts in Young's
name, an account at Montgomery Ward and has bought a car and a
condo in Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   When Young was stopped by police near Hayward, Calif., in 1997
for driving alone in a carpool lane, he was told there was a
warrant out for his arrest. The policewoman wouldn't tell Young
what the arrest warrant was for and detained him for an hour until
his employer verified that he had been a victim of identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living a life like he's me,'' Young said. ``He would
start doing a fraud on me, then he would stop and I would get my
life together and my credit again Now I have bad credit, I can't
get the credit agencies to take this information off my credit
rating and stores don't believe I didn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is drafting legislation that
would restrict the sale of Social Security numbers, a key
ingredient in identity fraud, and their display on mailing labels
and other public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee of Terrorism, Technology and Government Information,
and Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
introduced legislation that would restrict credit bureaus from
selling personal information such as Social Security numbers and
birth dates.
</P>
<P>
   It would require the credit bureaus to provide each citizen a
free credit report every year, investigate potential fraud and
alert potential creditors that the citizen has been the victim of
identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   If a credit card issuer is notified about a change of address of
the card owner, the issuer would be required to notify the owner at
both the original and the new address.
</P>
<P>
   That is intended to protect the credit card holder against a
swindler trying to hijack the card to another address. It sometimes
can take months before victims realize their personal information
has been stolen this way.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would authorize the Social Security Administration
to impose up to a $5,000 maximum fine for the misuse of a Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore., who has sponsored a matching House
bill, says credit bureaus ``have a responsibility to help stop
fraud'' and that it is ``outrageous'' that they sell personal
information such as Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mierzwinski, programs director at U.S. PIRG, a watchdog
consumer organization, says legislation is urgently needed
``because the crime has gotten so much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it used to be that victims only had to clean up credit
card debt, which was a hassle but not devastating. Credit card
companies usually cover most of the charges that have been rung up
on a credit card by a thief.
</P>
<P>
   But Mierzwinksi said the ``mission creep'' of the crime,
especially in California, means victims have ``a real mess on their
hands.'' He notes that swindlers are even committing crimes in
other peoples' names using false IDs and are renting apartments in
a victim's name and then filing bankruptcy to stall eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way, light years worse than stealing a credit card,''
Mierzwinski says.
</P>
<P>
   Mierzwinkski says Congress and state governments need to force
banks, credit bureaus and retailers to better verify the identities
of credit applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have passed laws since 1996 making identity
theft a crime. In October 1998, Congress passed legislation
sponsored by Kyl and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., that made identity
theft a federal crime, punishable by fines and up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Givens, director, of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a
consumer information and privacy organization in San Diego, says
those laws have done little to stop the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime is not going away,'' Givens said. ``The key to
reducing the crime is for the credit industry and for all entities
that use sensitive information like Social Security numbers to make
that information secure and keep it out of the hands of identity
thieves.''

CLAYMATION `MIRACLE' SOMEWHAT WOODEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MIRACLE MAKER 
Starring the voices of: Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson, Julie
Christie, Ian Holm 
Directed by: Stanislav Sokolov and Derek Hayes 
On: ABC, Sunday at 7 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the dog with a conscience on ``Davey and Goliath,'' the
stop-action animation series on Sunday mornings in the '60s and
'70s? A few minutes into ``The Miracle Maker,'' a new clay
animation feature about Jesus Christ, you may begin waiting for
Goliath to wander onto the streets of Galilee, plaintively
muttering something like ``But Day-vee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miracle Maker,'' which airs Sunday at morning, is
old-fashioned Sunday-morning TV, for sure. While ABC has scheduled
it in prime time, in honor of Easter, the movie would stand more
comfortably beside daytime religious-school programming for kids.
From its quaint, retro look to the way it makes its morals and
lessons extremely plain, ``The Miracle Maker'' is traditional,
educational, and a little dull.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Jesus is popular on TV these days, maybe as a
result of network honchos on the prowl for big millennial themes.
Last November, NBC served up ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' and next
month CBS will deliver a two-parter called ``Jesus.'' This version,
made in the UK, follows the familiar narrative path, as the adult
Jesus gains the trust of the people while he poses a threat to the
powers that be. He selects his apostles, one of whom will betray
him; he teaches his parables, which are shown to us in 2-D
animation; and he performs miracles, most notably bringing Lazarus
back from the grave. The movie skips quickly through the
Crucifixion, placing more weight on the later resurrection of
Christ and the faith that it engenders.
</P>
<P>
   The voice cast is impressive, with Ralph Fiennes as a gentle
Jesus and Miranda Richardson as the outcast ``Mad Mary'' Magdalene.
But the characters' clay figures appear exceedingly stiff, and many
of the male faces are generic. It takes a while to distinguish the
apostles, as they move about in jittery increments. Maybe I've been
ruined by the slick stop-motion approach that you find in the
music-video era, maybe I like a few humorous moments blended in
with all the earnestness, but I found ``The Miracle Maker''
visually monotonous and thematically oversimplified. It's an
honorable portrayal of Jesus, one that won't offend, but it's not
very dynamic television.

SHOOTING HOOPS, WINNING `LOVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
LOVE &AMP; BASKETBALL 
Written and directed by: Gina Prince-Bythewood 
Starring: Omar Epps, Sanaa Lathen, Alfre Woodard, Dennis Haysbert,
Debbi Morgan, Harry J. Lennix 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexuality and language) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' is not only Hollywood's first film built
around a woman basketball player. It's also Hollywood's first good
film built around a woman basketball player. It's a breakthrough
movie with a breakout performance by Sanaa Lathan as a woman who
resents having to choose between love and basketball, and wants
both. You'll care whether she gets both because love counts for as
much as basketball in this film that's much more than a sports
highlight reel as the boy next door and the girl next door fall for
each other, helped by their mutual passion for the game, then spend
years trying to balance both.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a driveway scrimmage in an LA suburb as a bunch
of preteen guys are forced to admit that the girl who tricked them
into letting her play by hiding her long hair under a baseball cap
is demonstrably better than most of them. Then the film skips a few
years and really gets interesting on a couple of fronts. Omar
Epps's high school all-star goes on to USC. It's expected of him,
given that his father (Dennis Haysbert) is a former NBA star.
What's not expected is that Lathan's young woman hoopster will also
go to USC and play varsity basketball there, too.
</P>
<P>
   When they take their identical dreams to the next level, they
aim at the NBA and WNBA, respectively. They also have eyes for each
other, and one of the things that sets this film apart not only
from most sports films, but from most Hollywood films, is that they
are given the chance to let us feel how their relationship deepens
over time. Both performers are warm and personable, and we want to
see them get together. They try to in college, but they can't make
it work, mainly because Epps's Quincy is too self-centered not to
allow for the fact that Lathan's Monica must battle harder than he
has to in order to be a player.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, basketball comes a lot easier than the rest of life
does to each of them. Each has to work at love, or, rather, at
finding room for it alongside the single-mindedness demanded by
their passion for the game. Problems between his parents call forth
a becoming sensitivity from Quincy. Monica's parents (Alfre
Woodard, Harry J. Lennix) are blessed with a more stable life. Most
of her problems stem from a fiery nature she must learn to control.
Each is generous, but at different stages in their respective
lives. The romantic suspense is generated by the question of
whether they'll ever get their believably deep and genuine feelings
for the other in phase.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the basketball-playing component of their respective
lives is a breeze. Commendably, the film plays down glamour to
spotlight the grueling routine of the fast-track professional level
each is chasing. Nothing quite works out as either plans, but
another engaging thing about the film is the way it allows its
characters a few missteps, yet lets them keep their dreams alive.
``Love &AMP; Basketball'' has a bit more sprawl than is good for it; on
the other hand, it breathes and has an emotional amplitude that is
all but unknown in sports movies. In basketball, the best shooters
have soft hands. In filmmaking, too. ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' is the
cinematic equivalent of a high, arching rainbow of a three-pointer
from midcourt.

ANOTHER GEM FROM NEIL YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Neil Young was the star of the recent Crosby,
Stills, Nash &AMP; Young tour that passed through town. Ask people who
were there and the answer is the same. They'll tell you that
Young's comrades performed well, but that he stole the show,
whether it was on cosmic hippie ballads or on primitivistic rockers
that he lifted into &UR;  &LR; the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 2000, a keen argument could be made that Young, even
more than Bob Dylan, is the most skilled troubadour of his time _
or at least the most enduring and most reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Young can seem ageless, which is how he appears on his new solo
album, ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' (Reprise Records), due out Tuesday. An
acoustic-based work, it completes a trilogy of sorts that started
with his ``Harvest'' album in 1972 and continued with ``Harvest
Moon'' in 1992.The zenith is reached in ``Silver &AMP; Gold,'' which
has some of the most affecting, and certainly most pure, love songs
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Harvest'' was more damaged _ think back to its
centerpiece song, ``The Needle and the Damage Done'' _ the new
album reveals Young to be a contented man who has recaptured an
almost childlike belief in love. He starts out with ``Good to See
You,'' a jaunty acoustic track (with harmonica and pedal steel
guitar) in which he sings, ``I've been down on the endless highway
. . . Now at last I'm home to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has enjoyed a solid marriage to his wife, Pegi, who is
known nationally for organizing the annual Bridge School benefit
concert in San Francisco, which aids disadvantaged children and has
starred everyone from Pearl Jam to David Bowie. The Youngs have a
son with cerebral palsy. They've worked together to support him _
and that loving bond is supremely apparent on the new CD.
</P>
<P>
   The title track, ``Silver &AMP; Gold,'' is a prime example. Amid
ringing guitar chords and silvery harmonica runs, Young sings, ``I
don't care if the sun don't shine and the rain comes pouring down
on me and mine/Because our kind of love never seems to get old/It's
better than silver and gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The dobro-flecked ``Red Sun,'' featuring gleaming harmonies from
Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, is another example. Young the
innocent poet sings: ``When the red sun sets on the railroad
town/And the bars begin to laugh with a happy sound/I'll still be
here right by your side/There'll not be anyone in my heart but
you.'' Warm and fuzzy, yes, but the music is simply transporting.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when many musicians feel they must shout to be heard,
Young succeeds with an unspeakably tender tone on this year's best
album. Nine of the 10 tracks are superb _ and not all are about his
wife. ``Daddy Went Walkin','' a country-spiced tune with pedal
steel guitar licks from Ben Keith, is about Young's parents: an
``old man crossing that road, he's feeling fine/ Mama's waiting at
the top of the hill/They'll be laughing, oh the stories they'll
tell/When he holds her in his arms again, they'll be sweethearts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Young is mostly blissed out on this album, he looks back
longingly to the '60s when he was in the band Buffalo Springfield
with future CSNY member Stephen Stills. ``I'd like to see those
guys again and give it a shot/Maybe now we can show the world what
we got/But I'd just like to play for the fun we had,'' sings Young.
</P>
<P>
   The sparsely arranged, quietly brilliant album is being released
in conjunction with a ``Silver &AMP; Gold'' home video, which is
another treat. It's a concert special taped in Austin, Texas, with
Young sitting at a stool surrounded by 10 guitars or alone at an
upright piano. Dry-ice smoke wafts up occasionally from behind his
amp, which heightens the mystique. That, and sheer talent, enable
Young to capture the viewer's attention and never let it go.

BONHAM REDISCOVERS HERSELF `DOWN HERE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a contrast. Tracy Bonham had her fleeting moment of
Grammy fame four years ago when nominated for two awards for her
debut album (``The Burdens of Being Upright'') and its modern-rock
hit, ``Mother Mother.'' She won neither award _ and the next year
was back in the Boston suburb of Watertown, wearing her pajamas all
day and mired in the dreaded sophomore slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hole myself up and try to write, but my mind would take
over and I'd worry about all the people who might really hate me,''
says Bonham. ``And I'd have (record label) people come in and hear
what I was doing and say, `I don't know if I hear a single. Can you
fix that?' So I was rewriting all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, she overcame her malaise. She took a mind-clearing trip
to Belgium with her new husband, Steve Slingeneyer (a drummer who
now plays in her band), and read the self-help book ``The Artist's
Way,'' by Julie Cameron, which eased her fears with its suggestions
to lighten up and not be so hard on oneself.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 10 years around Boston and attending Berklee
College of Music, Bonham then moved to Brooklyn, and the new
surroundings further unlocked her creativity. The upshot is the
much-anticipated sophomore disc, ``Down Here,'' which is worth the
wait. It features a sturdy rock framework of riffing guitars
enhanced by more of her sensuous violin accents (she had even
played violin with Page &AMP; Plant at their Boston show), topped by
her famously malleable voice and survivor lyrics such as ``Thank
God that I'm not perfect _ I happen to like all my defects.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham has a new single, ``Behind Every Good Woman,'' which is
another likely hit. It's a satirical, role-reversal story that
turns the cliche of ``behind every man lies a good woman'' to
``behind every good woman lies a trail of men.'' She admits that
she's poking fun at the machismo of the record business, but also
at the culture in general, exemplified by the song's video in which
a motorcycle-driving Bonham visits a strip club and high-fives
other patrons just as men might do.
</P>
<P>
   The new album also has empowering tracks ``Jumping Bean'' (``I
can't be your jumping bean anymore'') and ``You Don't Know Me''
(``You think you own me, but you don't know me and your thickness
is hard to believe''). Bonham may be happily married these days,
but she still hasn't forgotten past relationship hurts. It's a
personal album and a highly musical one thanks to the ingenious
experimental production team of Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're complete opposites,'' Bonham says. ``Tchad looks like
he should be in a pickup truck driving through the desert. He
brought in a loose element of `who (cares)?' But Mitchell is more
uptight and brainy _ very Woody Allen-like.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's now in New York, Bonham hasn't lost touch with
Boston. She has two Boston musicians in her band _ Peter Adams and
Joe Klompus, who was in Jack Drag and Orangutang. And though she
doesn't miss some of the jealous, local ``backstabbing'' that
occurred after her ``Mother Mother'' success, she admits, ``I miss
a lot of things about Boston. I miss all the good bands.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Bloodhound Gang spoof: The song has been all over rock radio
with its refrain of ``You and me, baby, we ain't nothing but
mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel.''
Entitled ``The Bad Touch,'' it's a hit for the Bloodhound Gang, a
former frat-party band whose frontman, Jimmy Pop, wrote it after
``watching monkeys mate'' on the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not write a song about it?'' asks Pop, has rib-tickled the
mainstream with previous ditties such as ``Why's Everybody Always
Pickin' on Me?'' and ``Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop readily admits that his group's music revels in junk culture
(``People can relate to junk culture everywhere in the world,'' he
says), which is obvious on the band's new album, ``Hooray for
Boobies.'' Some of the songs, however, are a lot less clever, and a
lot raunchier, than the Discovery Channel anthem. As Pop writes in
the bio that accompanied copies of the record sent to the press: ``
`Hooray for Boobies' is stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with him on such songs as ``The Ballad of
Chasey Lain'' (a paean to a porn queen) and ``The Inevitable Return
of the Great White Dope,'' of which he says, ``I tried to write a
song about how cool I am, but I ended up sounding like a 7-year-old
in a crash helmet having a temper tantrum through a Mister
Microphone.'' But other songs are hilarious in a kind of Kid
Rock-meets-Kinky Friedman way, including ``Hell Yeah'' (with its
line, ``If I were god, I would not worship false Billy Idols'') and
``Take the Long Way Home'' (``Life is an aimless drive that you
take alone/ You might as well enjoy the ride'').
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the Bloodhoung Gang is heavily influenced
by shock jock Howard Stern, who has often played their music on his
syndicated morning show. ``I grew up listening to Howard Stern,''
says Pop. ``He's amazing.''
</P>

<P>
   Korn backlash: This writer is still digging out from some
hostile e-mails concerning the positive review I gave Korn at the
Worcester Centrum Center recently. Korn sold out two nights and
gave its best show in memory, but detractors were quick to mail in
their dissension. Wrote one: ``Next time you are searching for
adjectives for lame, flavor-of-the-month groups such as Korn, think
twice before you use words such as `heavy.' . . . Rap-rock groups
like Korn are riding the coattails of far more deserving, true
metal bands.'' Another wrote: ``Here's a list of bands to check out
(instead): Opeth, Emperor, Satyricon, Mayhem, Immortal, Absu
Abigor, Cryptopsy . . Incantation, Morbid Angel, etc.'' Hey,
whatever gets you through the night.

&HT;     THE THREE STOOGES STORY: BIO-PIC DOES HONOR TO AMERICAN ICONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years back, a buddy of mine was getting married. Killing
time before the ceremony, we clicked on the television in the B&AMP;B
where we were staying: On popped ``The Three Stooges.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't get it, don't worry: It's a guy thing. The marriage
didn't stick, but the Stooges are forever.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was professional wrestling, ``Monday Night
Football,'' muscle cars or Playboy, there was ``The Three
Stooges.'' The brothers Howard, Larry Fine and a pair of Joes
pounded, poked and nyuk'ed each other through 190 or so film shorts
for Columbia Pictures from 1934 to 1958. They later became staples
on television _ where they live on today _ as well as a successful
touring act.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was and remains strictly male. Why do most women hate
the Stooges?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because of all the wanton violence, base behavior,
meanness, pure idiocy and absence of plot. In others words, for all
the reasons guys love 'em.
</P>
<P>
   But even women should like the ABC biopic ``The Three Stooges,''
a fun and touching, if sketchy, homage by producer and major
Stoogehead Mel Gibson that airs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While they were the kings of irreverence, the Stooges are looked
upon reverentially by fans. Portraying the act known for more than
65 years on film and four decades of television is a risky
proposition. (Go try to find a satisfying dramatic rendition of
Babe Ruth.)
</P>
<P>
   We know Moe, Larry and Curly, and lesser Stooges Shemp, Joe and
Curly-Joe. Screw up a re-creation of the boys and it will leave us
with a bitter taste _ and you with an eye poke, face slap and shin
kick.
</P>
<P>
   No worry: ``The Three Stooges'' does honor to the Three Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   As Moe Howard and his lifelong friend Larry Fine, Paul
Ben-Victor (``Crazy in Alabama'') and Evan Handler (``It's like,
you know ...'') bear a strong resemblance to their counterparts,
while John Kassir is a more than adequate Shemp.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Chiklis (``Daddio,'' ``The Commish'') has the
toughest role, playing the often imitated but never duplicated
Curly, with his finger snapping, face rubbing and nyuk-nyuking. The
whole movie hinges on Chiklis being able to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   He does. In fact, the makers of the film _ based on Michael
Fleming's biography ``From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons:
The Three Stooges'' _ felt comfortable enough to let the actors
re-create scenes from some of the classic shorts. Chiklis nails it,
especially the famous shellfish-spitting scene.
</P>
<P>
   Told from Moe's perspective, ``The Three Stooges'' follows the
trio from their stage beginnings through the untimely deaths of
little brother Curly and Shemp and their post-film careers.
</P>
<P>
   While two hours doesn't offer much of a chance for depth, it
would have been nice to get more than thumbnail sketches of each
performer: Moe got bamboozled by the studio execs; Larry was a
gambler who felt Hollywood was ripping off the troupe; Curly just
went along with his big brother when not out partying; and Shemp
was a nervous wreck.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even Stooge fans (although not the die-hards) will
learn things from this film:
</P>
<P>
   Shemp, not Curly, was in fact an original Stooge, although he
left the act before the boys hit it big in Hollywood. ``I haven't
run out of brothers yet,'' Moe says when Shemp left in 1933. Shemp
only returned after his brother Curly's 1946 stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Moe, Larry and Shemp started out in vaudeville working as backup
players to a jealous egomaniac named Ted Healy (Marton Csokas), who
grossly underpaid them. ``I know it's rough, but we are stooges,''
the movie Moe tells his brother Shemp in 1925. ``We're a dime a
dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   Curly was known as Jerry (his given name was Jerome) to his
friends, and Babe (for baby brother) to his sibling Moe.
</P>
<P>
   For a short time after his film career waned, Moe delivered
sandwiches to Hollywood lots. The act was chronically underpaid,
although that practice was pretty common under the studio system.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``The Three Stooges'' could have given us a little
more on the women in their lives to provide context, but Gibson and
company did not attempt to make a definitive history here. A hammer
to the head, a double-gut punch and a good nose wrench is good
enough. Must be a guy thing.

   IDENTITY-THEFT (Washington) _ Thieves have swiped personal data
such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for more
than a decade primarily to get bank and checking accounts and
credit cards. But now identity theft is becoming more widespread as
crooks use other people's personal data to open utility accounts,
rent apartments, apply for loans, start businesses, buy cars and
even declare bankruptcy. Some lawmakers, led by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., are pushing legislation to curb the problem.

</P>
<P>
   CHILDCARE (Washington) _ Child advocacy groups say the 1996 law
requiring welfare recipients to go to work is not providing enough
money for most of them to put their kids in day care. Only about 15
percent of the youngsters eligible for the federally funded care
actually get the subsidy. So many parents can't work or can't get
better paying jobs. But the push for additional funds is iffy since
most Republican lawmakers don't want to spend more for ``a national
nanny,'' as one puts it. By DAN FREEDMAN.

Staff Writer &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' has chewed through more
pocketbooks than any 3-D movie ever made for the large-format IMAX
screen, grossing more than $43 million so far, yet it somehow has
managed to avoid the Los Angeles market. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening of an IMAX screen at Universal CityWalk's
theater complex in Universal City, the movie has finally come to
L.A., about two years after it first hit the very big screens of
IMAX around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It arrives at an auspicious time for oversized ancient reptiles,
in the weeks leading up to Disney's much-awaited animated epic
``Dinosaur,'' with Universal Studios' own ``Jurassic Park'' ride
still going strong down the hill, and the BBC releasing a fabulous
DVD compilation of its terrific TV series, ``Walking With
Dinosaurs.'' And it comes paired with another IMAX megahit,
``Everest,'' to form an adventurously commercial pair of
science-oriented films.
</P>
<P>
   To watch this 45-minute movie, viewers must don headsets with
sensors and special polarized lens that alternately shutter open
and closed 48 times a second. The heavy headsets are somewhat
annoying, but the tradeoff is that they allow the filmmakers to use
a more mobile, compact 3-D camera, and in turn, to get shots that
really weren't attainable with older, bulkier 3-D rigs.
</P>
<P>
   In the film itself, we see bright but neglected teen Ally Hayden
(played somewhat flatly by Liz Stauber) as she becomes frustrated
with her preoccupied paleontologist father (Peter Horton) and his
inability to focus on either her own small science project or her
desire to join him on bone digs in the fossil-rich rock formations
of Canada's Dinosaur Provincial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Left in her father's work area at what is supposed to be the
American Museum of Natural History, Ally is overcome by gases
emitted when what may be a fossil T. Rex egg (which is the correct
way to write the creature's name) falls from a workbench.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film follows her hallucinatory expeditions
through time, visiting with storied dinosaur digger Barnum Brown (a
century later, scientists are still picking through his accumulated
discoveries) and painter Charles Knight, who at the turn of the
century imaginatively put flesh on the bones Brown found for an
increasingly fascinated public.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film features a number of authentically
re-created dinosaurs too, in compelling 3-D animations, as Ally
makes her fume-induced way through the museum's treasures. There
are at least half a dozen different species represented, including
a very protective and vividly realized mama T. Rex.
</P>
<P>
   As performances go, Stauber isn't particularly engaging, her
range of expressions more limited than one might prefer. But Horton
is a pro, and the camera technology allows for some startling
shots, such as those on a platform suspended on a cliff face where
Horton and his assistant have spotted a new find.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs themselves look great, even for 3-year-old
technology, because the 3-D visuals and huge IMAX screen (six
stories high by eight stories wide) give them a corporeality
impossible on the smaller, 2-D screens of most theaters or
television.
</P>
<P>
   Director Brett Leonard (``Lawnmower Man,'' ``Virtuosity'') moves
the story along briskly. Unlike in ``Jurassic Park'' and many other
dinosaur movies, however, he and the rest of the film's creators
have tried to stick closely to the scientific facts behind
dinosaurs, not exaggerating their look for scary effect, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an unlikely moment when Alex pets the nose of the
territorial T. Rex, it hews closely to the science of things, while
providing solid entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the film, though occasionally mildly surprising, is
fine viewing for children of most any age. There's not even blood
shown when the female T. Rex grabs an egg stealer in her jaws and
tosses it to the side. Bet !ital!that never happened back in the
Cretaceous. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday April 13 approved, 50-48, a five year,
1.8 trillion budget compromise for fiscal year 2001. The measure
would offer tax cuts of at least $150 billion over five years, and
as much as $215 billion if the economy continues to grow. The
budget also allocates spending for defense, education, and a
prescription drug benefit. Supporters said the budget plan would
help eliminate the national debt, provide needed tax relief, and
boost education defense and health research spending. Opponents
said the budget plan offered large tax cuts at the expense of
important social programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the budget.

&HT;     ``U-571'': A SOLID MOVIE BUT NOT MUCH DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a way, it's refreshing how unrefreshing the new submarine
thriller, ``U-571,'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Taut, suspenseful, good-looking, it strives to be old-fashioned
entertainment, complete with cardboard characters (who have names
like Chief, Rabbit and Trigger) injected with doses of star power.
Almost belligerently, it refuses to break new ground (or water, for
that matter) _ certainly it isn't about to give ``Das Boot'' a run
for its money _ but nevertheless it is irresistible entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Based loosely (very loosely) on actual World War II missions to
recover the Enigma coding devices, which contributed largely to
Allied victory, ``U-571'' opens with the German crew of the title
boat in a thrilling battle with a U.S. destroyer. The U-boat
escapes, but is severely crippled and radios for help.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Capt. Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) and his rag-tag crew, who
have just been granted 48 hours' leave. Now it is revoked. The
mission: get to the U-boat, disguised as Germans, capture the
Enigma decoding device and sink the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, each character has flaws _ cliched and almost proud
of it _ to overcome. But the most important plot line _ and really
what the film is about if you are to dilute it to its
pop-psychology moral _ is second-in-command Tyler (Matthew
McConaughey), who has just been passed over for command of a boat
of his own, and Dahlgren had something to do with it. Keeping the
peace is Chief (Harvey Keitel), who has such memorable lines as
``What the hell are those yardbirds doing on my boat?''
</P>
<P>
   Simple stuff, but the action is well thought out, logical and
wastes no time getting down to it. Director Jonathan Mostow keeps a
brisk pace and always seems to come up with the perfect shot,
exploiting the U-boats like some elaborate Rube Goldberg device,
except with the stakes raised high.
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't be surprising for anyone who saw ``Breakdown,''
Mostow's kinetic and gripping thriller starring Kurt Russell as a
yuppie whose wife is kidnapped by an evil trucker. His direct,
no-nonsense style makes him different from the hyper-productions of
John McTiernan (``Die Hard,'' ``The Thomas Crown Affair'') or the
super-cool flash of John Woo (``Face/Off,'' ``Mission Impossible
II''), but he is with them in that pantheon of Hollywood action
directors.
</P>
<P>
   What's odd here is how muted all these personalities are. Tense
submarine movies have big stars _ Cary Grant in ``Destination
Tokyo,'' Burt Lancaster in ``Run Silent Run Deep,'' Sean Connery
and Alec Baldwin in McTiernan's ``Hunt for Red October,'' Denzel
Washington and Gene Hackman in ``Crimson Tide.'' They rely on those
stars for those over-the-top performances that push the tension
forward in the super-cramped spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But the players in ``U-571'' all come in under the radar, a
method that worked for Mostow in ``Breakdown'' but seems out of
place here. When you've made Jon Bon Jovi, as a jar-head
lieutenant, and Keitel into standard characters, you know you've
done something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Keitel, he's taken a scary turn in his career. The
otherwise dangerous, iconoclastic independent actor has in the last
month played a pilot in the live TV production of ``Fail Safe'' (in
which the biggest suspense was not so much will Moscow be
destroyed, but if Keitel would swear on national TV) and now he's a
Navy underling.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? An Air Force colonel, to complete his military
trilogy, who's ``getting too old for this crap?'' A disaster movie
with Harvey Keitel as the president? Someone phone Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of this heap is McConaughey, who was once touted
as the next Paul Newman in the years of ``A Time to Kill'' and
``Amistad.'' He's serviceable here, which is about all you can
really expect of him.
</P>
<P>
   He's as much Newman as ``U-571'' is ``Das Boot'': Good-looking,
solid, but not nearly as much depth.

&HT;     ``LOVE AND BASKETBALL'' IS SWEET BUT GOOEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball,'' a romantic comedy about a love triangle
between a boy, a girl and a game, has some nice moves and winning
players, but ultimately loses steam down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The film plots out a predictable romance between two young
ballplayers who've grown up as next-door neighbors: Monica Wright,
played by the earnest and likable Sanaa Lathan (who also appeared
in ``The Best Man'' and ``The Wood'') and Quincy McCall, played
with much swagger and sweat by Omar Epps.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's basic game plan goes something like this: Boy meets
girl. Girl and boy play basketball. Girl loses boy. Girl gets boy.
Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by rookie Gina Prince-Bythewood, ``Love and
Basketball'' is produced by Spike Lee and his 40 Acres and A Mule
Filmworks. But those looking for another Spike Lee Joint like ``He
Got Game'' _ or even a modern ``Hoosiers'' _ won't find it here.
The title is ``Love and Basketball,'' after all.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't plenty of suspenseful game
sequences, filmed in the familiar fast-break music video style or
hear-your-heartbeat slow motion. But basketball is really just the
arena in which the bigger and more important games of the heart are
played out.
</P>
<P>
   Epps, who made his screen debut with Tupuc Shakur in ``Juice''
and also appeared in ``The Wood,'' delivers the film's most
engaging performance. With his bedroom eyes and basketball jones,
Epps is as believable sinking jump shots as he is delivering the
film's frequently flat dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Lathan, whose character is the focus of the film, gives up a
pleasant if less compelling performance as Monica, the tomboy next
door who worships Magic Johnson and hopes to be the first woman in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But the supporting characters are stereotypes: As Quincy's
father, Dennis Haysbert (``Waiting to Exhale'') plays the standard
macho ex-athlete; Monica's mother (Alfre Woodard of ``Passion
Fish'') remains the prissy stay-at-home mom who never watches her
daughter's games. They mostly serve as backboards off which the two
lead characters bounce their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie about such a fast-paced sport, the film has some
surprisingly slow passages _ perhaps because the characters are not
deeply developed, or because the plot is stretched a little thin.
Director Prince-Bythewood slows things down even more with loving
and lingering shots of a character's profile or objects in a
bedroom, set to Quiet Storm-style R&AMP;B music.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the film takes on the feel of a music video with
characters shooting around to New Edition's ``Candy Girl,'' or
bumping and writhing through a high school dance to the sounds of
'80s hip hop.
</P>
<P>
   There are some star cameos _ by Magic Johnson, supermodel Tyra
Banks and the ubiquitous Dick Vitale _ and genuine laughs,
especially early in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after meeting his new neighbor, 11-year-old Quincy
bluntly asks Monica if she'll be his girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I have to do?'' she asks. He informs her that they'll
play basketball and ride to school together and ``when you get mad
at me, I got to give you flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica frowns. She doesn't like flowers. ``How about Twinkies?''
she suggests.
</P>
<P>
   And that really sums up ``Love and Basketball'': sweet, light, a
little on the gooey side.

 &HT;    Old-timey, comfy songs grounded in real-world experience
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first sound you hear when you put Stacey
Earle's debut CD into the player is probably the most important
sound _ a distinctive, immediately identifiable noise that most of
us don't hear very often anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It's the soft pop, crackle and hiss of a needle dropping onto a
record. It's there on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took an old Radio Shack record player and got a really old,
scratched-up copy of `Rubber Soul,''' Earle said. ``We wanted it
just right.'' But this was more than just a sound effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost so much when we lost vinyl,'' she said. ``I actually
like that hiss. When albums went away we lost some great things,
like sequencing _ when you made album, you got an extra chance to
sequence your songs on the B side. It gave the listener a chance to
pause and think about what they'd heard when they stopped to turn
the record over. It gives the ear a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a CD and you put 13 songs on there, they'd better
all be strong songs. Lots of people don't have time to listen to
the whole CD all the way through, and you may lose them. I wanted a
side A and a side B.''
</P>
<P>
   Album sides, needle drops _ ``Simple Gearle'' is proudly
old-fashioned. It's a lovely, summertime waltz of a record, 13
gentle country-folk songs about the joys and hardships of
day-to-day life _ wedding nights, next-door friendships, teenage
rebellion, lost and found lovers, getting ready to face another day
and finding strength in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Earle put the record out on her own tiny Gearle Records label,
using E-Squared as a distributor. But getting to that point took a
long, long time _ and a relatively late career start.
</P>
<P>
   She watched as her famous brother, Steve Earle, forged a career
as a roughhousing country-rocker of considerable acclaim, and also
helped him through his equally famous substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   Family is important to her. She raised her own sons _ Kyle Mims,
now 18, and Christopher Mims, 21 _ as a single mom in Louisiana and
moved to the Nashville suburb of Ashland City in 1990 to be near
her brother. He asked her to sing backup and play guitar on a
record and some dates. She enjoyed it enough that she started
writing a lot of songs _ getting a job as a staff songwriter at Ten
Ten Publishing, and eventually hosting the weekly songwriter's
night at a place called Jack's Guitar Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids were always so supportive,'' the 38-year-old said.
``They'd always say, `Come on, Mom, go play tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   So play she did. She learned writing basics and tricks at Ten
Ten, but Earle noted that the more commercial, country-radio type
songs she was being paid to write at the office didn't go over as
well as the songs she wrote for herself at the kitchen table in the
mornings before work. ``Those were the ones where I'd see people's
heads pop up,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence grew, and things started to click. She met and
married Mark Stuart, one of the musicians she met at Jack's, in
1994. They've written, sung and played together ever since. (His
album, ``Songs From A Corner Stage,'' also on Gearle, also starts
with a needle drop). Her son Kyle stopped playing ska and punk long
enough to become her drummer. Her brother helped out with
encouragement. ``Simple Gearle'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   The followup, ``Dancin' With Them That Brung Me,'' in stores May
9, has a little more polish but still the same old-timey, comfy
feel. It includes a song by her brother and a guest turn by Sheryl
Crow, who turned out to be a fan of the first record.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty exciting,'' Earle said. ``It was nice to have
the nod and the OK from my peers and the veterans in the music
world.''
</P>
<P>
   She's touring extensively _ 274 shows last year _ moving through
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Family operation, family show, she says. She's happy to have had
years of motherhood, neighborhood and real life happen to her
before she started a career in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets at all,'' she said of her late start. ``All
that gave me lots to say. Some people keep journal or diaries. I
write songs, and I write them about the regular things in life that
go on around me. You can hear the happy times, the tough times, how
I turned it around for me and the kids and what I learned from it.
But they aren't depressing records; I don't live on a negative
note.'

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Burning issues and a torrent of
mail
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ From Elian to flag burning, from capital
punishment to Microsoft, from guns to chili, such are the burning
issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The readers write ...
</P>
<P>
   From Crawford Parker Jr., a lawyer in Carthage, Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``We who served in the military did so to protect the rights of
all Americans, not some rights, but all rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is unbalanced or warped enough to burn the
American flag, that person surely has the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, that is what we served our country for, to protect the
rights of all Americans regardless of their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   From Susan Dart, North Carolina:
</P>
<P>
   Concerning Microsoft: ``It's like AT&AMP;T's stranglehold on the
telephone business. For years we had to use AT&AMP;T's phones and their
long distance service, with unbelievable rates, and poor people
simply could not afford to talk long distance. This is called a
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   From Pat Cunningham, Pineland, Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am of the opinion that if the state or government can kill
(execute) our sons and daughters for murdering someone, then we as
parents should be able to apply some corporal punishment
(spankings) when they are young to teach them that there are
consequences to hurting others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that if parents were encouraged to discipline
their little darlings, there would be fewer people in the prisons
and on death row.''
</P>
<P>
   From E.J. Karcher, North Carolina:
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose I, an American, had a wife who was an Iranian citizen.
Suppose she took our son to Iran to visit and then refused to
return my son to me. Where does Elian belong?''
</P>
<P>
   From Joyce Barnes, Springfield, Ohio:
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in the father's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to various reports, his ex-wife kidnapped his son to
embark on an impossibly risky escape from Cuba by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only through a miracle did his son survive the ordeal, then
was whisked away to a family of relatives he probably had never
met, and used as a political tool for their purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of his uncles had served jail sentences for drunk driving.
How would you feel to have your son taken from you in this
fashion?''
</P>
<P>
   From Mary Lou Siau, ``a 74-year-old lady,'' no address:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know how to safely shoot a gun, but I do know they do
not hurt anyone or anything until a human is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, saving the most important issue for last, that of suet
as an ingredient in chili:
</P>
<P>
   From Lorraine Luca, Lufkin:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you were misinformed about the definition of suet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to my trusty old Webster's dictionary, and he agreed
with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suet is the hard fat deposited around the kidneys and loins of
cattle and sheep, and is used in cooking and as a source of tallow,
which is the nearly colorless and tasteless solid fat rendered from
the suet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also used in making candles, soap and lubricants. It is
good as food for wild birds in the winter. I guess it gives them
energy, and they don't have to worry about the cholesterol or their
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. One reader also wrote to ask how are my dogs. My dogs are
fine, thank you.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS TRY TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THE `ASHEN LIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They're the ghosts of the solar system, eerie
glows that haunt the night sky and the otherwise dark void between
planets.
</P>
<P>
   Most astronomers are annoyed by these faintly luminous clouds of
gas or dust, which have exotic names such as ``zodiacal light'' and
``gegenschein.'' Their glow is a mildly irritating distraction
during observations of more distant, spectacular sights, such as
super-clusters of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   But now, scientists at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.,
have received a $250,000 NASA grant to scrutinize one type of
celestial specter _ the legendary ``ashen light'' of Venus, the
second planet from the sun. The scientists are Tom Slanger and
David Huestis, both chemists who specialize in aeronomy, the study
of the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ashen light is an elusive luminescence, sometimes faintly
visible on the dark side of Venus. It has enchanted and mystified
generations of stargazers, a few of whom have speculated about its
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strangest speculation came from a German astronomer
in the early 19th century. He suggested that the glow revealed
massive political rallies on the planet Venus, as mobs of Venusians
with torches gathered to honor a new monarch.
</P>
<P>
   A less exotic explanation is preferred by today's scientists.
They believe the ashen light, technically known as Venusian
nightglow, comes from oxygen molecules high in the planetary
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   On the sunlit side of Venus, Huestis says, solar ultraviolet
radiation bakes atmospheric carbon dioxide, COel,4 2el,-4. Each
carbon dioxide molecule consists of one atom of carbon and two of
oxygen. The intense UV light splits a COel,4 2el,-4 molecule into
CO (carbon monoxide, like the poison gas from cars) and single
oxygen atoms.
</P>
<P>
   Then high-altitude Venusian winds blow the CO and O atoms to the
far, unlit side of the planet. This happens quickly, because
Venusian winds blow incredibly fast, far faster than the planet
below rotates, thanks to a still-somewhat-mysterious process known
as ``superrotation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the dark side, the lone oxygen atoms recombine into molecular
oxygen, that is, Oel,4 2el,-4 . As they recombine, they emit light.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the continual recombination of oxygen atoms into Oel,4
2el,-4 molecules creates a continual faint glow, a visual chorus of
aerial light. Sometimes the light is barely enough to be seen
through earthly telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   A related process creates the airglow in Earth's atmosphere,
Huestis says. In the upper atmosphere of Earth, UV light splits
Oel,4 2el,-4 molecules into separate oxygen atoms. These then
recombine, emitting light.
</P>
<P>
   Terrestrial airglow is typically much too faint to be seen with
the naked eye, especially in or near cities, where electric
lighting _ ``light pollution,'' as astronomers call it _ washes out
much of the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Huestis says Earth's airglow is ``about one-fourth as bright as
the Milky Way (galaxy).''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site showing space shuttle photos of terrestrial airglow,
as viewed from Earth orbit, is at
http://plasma2.ssl.berkeley.edu/atmos/wave.html.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen explanation of the Venusian airglow was first
suggested in the mid-1970s. That was during the Cold War, when
U.S.-Soviet space competition spurred the Russians to launch
numerous robotic spaceships toward Venus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, two Russian space probes orbited Venus and used
spectrometers to analyze its atmospheric composition, which is
mostly carbon dioxide. The sensors detected the Venusian airglow;
further analysis of the images identified it as glowing atmospheric
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Slanger and Huestis hope to obtain more refined
measurements by using the giant Keck telescope in Hawaii. It's
perched atop an extinct volcano on the big island of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Keck is so powerful, with its 33-foot-wide mirror, that it
can see the Venusian atmosphere more distinctly than did the
Russian space probes, which flew past the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spectral resolution of the Russian (observations) is more
than 100 times worse than Keck can do,'' Slanger said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also plan to use the Keck telescope to try to
detect airglow on the dark side of Mars, the fourth planet from the
sun (Earth is third), starting in the spring of 2001. The Venusian
observations will begin in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Why study the Venusian night glow at all? It offers no known
practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   The research is interesting for its own sake, at least partly
because it elucidates a natural explanation for an old astronomical
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   By observing the motion of glowing air in the Venusian
atmosphere, scientists can better understand the dynamics of that
atmosphere. That might, in turn, shed light on the dynamics of the
earthly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Also, scientists hope to refine observing techniques that might
be used to study the atmospheric composition of planets that orbit
other stars. Some of those planets might be inhabited by plants or
animals, and it would be fascinating to learn what kind of
atmosphere they breathe.

 &HT;    Lakers sitting pretty as playoffs begin
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From where the Los Angeles Lakers sit, the fall would be
startling. And loud.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the championship coach, MVP candidate and
brilliant young star is unfazed about its position atop the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why settle for the apartment?'' center Shaquille O'Neal asked.
``We want the whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   The best record in the league during the regular season is a
nice start toward the final goal. Only a championship will satisfy
the cast in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It is set up perfectly for the Lakers. They have the home-court
advantage through the playoffs. They have coach Phil Jackson, who,
with Michael Jordan's help, led the Chicago Bulls to six titles in
the 1990s. They have the best player in the league in O'Neal and
one of the most complete players in Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, the most dominant team in the regular season, have
the respect _ and in some cases, fear _ of every team in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and Sacramento put a lot of effort into trying to finish
above the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference, to avoid
facing Los Angeles. The SuperSonics ended up seventh and will face
the Utah Jazz; the Kings landed in La La Land, a.k.a. trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no bargain playing Utah, but I think even Utah would have
to admit that it's more wise putting off playing the Lakers as long
as possible,'' Seattle coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for Sacramento, which became a national darling
last year when it put up an admirable first-round fight in losing
to Utah. The Kings won just one of four meetings against the Lakers
this year, but because of their offensive potency, L.A. is not
taking the first round for granted. Even so, O'Neal expects
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the best team, everybody wants to come at you and
beat you, and the Kings are very confident,'' O'Neal said. ``With
that comes a lot of adrenaline, a lot of luck. But our A game
against their A game, we'll win eight times out of 10. So, we just
have to be prepared and bring our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Their best depends on O'Neal. The 330-pound all-star has played
brilliantly all season. He has shown more determination on defense
and some nimble low-post moves on offense, but his strength remains
the foundation of his production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a word to describe his strength,'' Seattle forward
Horace Grant said. ``There's really not. To try to describe his
strength would be to disrespect him in a way. You can't explain
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs, but
this championship appears to be the Lakers' to lose. The Spurs have
had a tumultuous season, with Sean Elliott's kidney transplant and
remarkable return, the erratic play of Mario Elie and, now, Tim
Duncan's knee troubles that threaten his availability or
effectiveness. San Antonio's first-round date with the Phoenix Suns
is not a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland TrailBlazers, who opened the season as a title
contender, became ordinary after the Lakers went to the Rose Garden
and won about six weeks ago. The Blazers have the depth to beat
Minnesota in the first round, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In the West,'' Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said,
``outside of the way the Lakers are playing, I don't think there's
any series that would be an upset. Any team (ranked) two through
eight right now can win a five-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   The East might not be as strong, but it's just as competitive.
Indiana has the best record, but the Pacers were 20-21 on the road,
where they probably will have to win to finally get past the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Eastern Conference champs, the New York Knicks,
have the team built to return to the NBA Finals again. With Patrick
Ewing strengthening the inside game and Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell on the perimeter and on the fast break, the Knicks are
tough.
</P>
<P>
   But their first-round opponent is Toronto, which has beaten them
three of four times this season. Vince Carter, who averaged 33
points against New York, ``scares'' the Knicks, according to coach
Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are confident. ``We play good in the Garden; that
might be our second home,'' Toronto forward Charles Oakley said.
``Like the song said: `Papa was a rolling stone, wherever he laid
his hat was his home.' We've got two hats, one in Canada and one in
the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every team in the East has such confidence, because no
one has been dominant. The Philadelphia 76ers, with the addition of
Toni Kukoc and their forceful defense, believes it has a legitimate
shot. So does their opening-round opponent, the remarkable
Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Through Bobby Phils' death, Anthony Mason's arrest and constant
griping, the car accident involving Derrick Coleman and Eldridge
Recasner, and the release of veteran three-point artist Dale Ellis,
coach Paul Silas has held together a team that enters the playoffs
hotter than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets have won seven in a row, and they have the weapons
to make some serious noise. Charlotte, after handling the 76ers,
very well could defeat the No. 1-ranked Pacers in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the scene is established for the Knicks to face
nemesis Miami in the second round. New York and the Heat form the
most fierce rivalry in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither team has a pass to the next round. In Miami's
case, its trouble is more about not having point guard Tim Hardaway
(sprained foot) than about its underwhelming opponent, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway is not allowed even to walk, so his availability is
questionable. Alonzo Mourning ``is by far and away the most
dominating player we have, our best and most impactful player,''
coach Pat Riley said, ``but there's something about Tim Hardaway
that creates a confidence and a spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence abounds throughout the league.

STATE CASTOFFS ARE GOING, GOING, GONE ON THE INTERNET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Ore., Calif.)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year and a half, Massachusetts officials tried and failed
to dispose of a 128-foot lightship, the Nantucket I, most recently
used as a floating museum. ``This was something we couldn't give
away,'' said Paul Guerino, coordinator of the state's surplus
property.
</P>
<P>
   So the state tried one more tack. It posted the lightship on
eBay, the online auction site more commonly used by consumers
emptying their attics of unwanted wedding gifts or Beanie Baby
collections.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the auction was over a few weeks ago, bidding on the
Nantucket I had reached $126,100, and the buyers, a former state
senator and his wife, were making plans to have the historic boat
refitted and moved to Boston Harbor, to be used as office space.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other state governments have found what
Massachusetts did with its lightship: that surplus property fetches
a whole lot more online, where a world of enthusiastic amateurs are
ready to bid, than it does through traditional channels, which
rarely attract buyers beyond a small core of gimlet-eyed
professional bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Governments often have a lot of stuff to get rid of _ old office
equipment, overstocked supplies, abandoned property, items seized
from criminals or tax delinquents _ and are generally required by
law to offer it publicly to the highest bidder. Traditional
auctions tend to be lightly publicized, inconvenient and a bit
intimidating for ordinary people, so pennies-on-the-dollar prices
have long been the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of online auctions is changing all that,
commonly doubling and tripling the amounts that states receive for
auctioned property. ``I actually thought it was a brilliant
strategy,'' said the new co-owner of the Nantucket I, William
Golden.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure which state thought of it first, but Oregon is
considered a leader in online sales. The state, whose eBay identity
is oregontrail2000, started a year ago with one item, an engraved
commemorative Snap-On Tools socket set from the Portland Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, it had 47 single items or lots posted for sale
on eBay, including seized jewelry, an IBM Selectric typewriter and
a six-volume 1904 reprinting of the original journals of Lewis and
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do an auction, you've got 400 people in a room for
five hours in a single day,'' said Skip Morton, property
distribution center manager for Oregon's Department of
Administrative Services. ``With eBay, you're dealing with people 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials have been so pleased with the online results
that they have installed public computer terminals in a state
warehouse to allow any resident to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see electronic commerce, electronic marketing as the way
things are going to be in 5 years, 10 years most certainly,''
Morton said. ``We'd rather be in the forefront than eating dust in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 states are now active on eBay, according to Don Coy,
the eBay business manager _ and the federal government is working
on its own auction site for public property, which state
governments will eventually be invited to join.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, states are climbing up the learning curve on
commercial sites like eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign that the lines between the government and private
sector are blurring,'' said Pete Williams, surplus property program
manager in the California Department of General Services, which
sells on eBay under the ID californiagold2000.
</P>
<P>
   The states are selective about what they post online; they find
that smaller, more valuable goods that can be shipped easily tend
to do best. An Olympus 35 mm camera that might have sold for $25 in
a warehouse auction fetched $91 online last week, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a state official will post something more
unwieldy, like a 1992 Chevrolet Camaro Z28, equipped for police
use, offered by Oregon earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one this afternoon; he had a Lear jet he was
possibly going to put on the site,'' said Coy of eBay. ``It didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerino of Massachusetts said that for some items, it was
difficult to find the appropriate product category. For the
lightship, he had to settle for sporting goods, because that was
where boats were listed.
</P>
<P>
   States like the prices they get from online buyers, but some
buyers also see an advantage in Internet auctions of government
property: officials don't always know what they have.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Heath of Las Vegas won the bidding for an old wooden
file cabinet from Oregon, paying $210 plus $127 for shipping. Only
after it arrived did she discover that it was a sought-after Globe
Wernicke cabinet from 1938. ``They could have gotten probably five
times what I paid for it,'' she said.

 PASSION FOR THE ARTS: Actor Anthony Quinn turns his
legendary  energy to painting, sculpture  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Anthony Quinn won an Oscar for his portrayal of
the passionate French painter Paul Gauguin in the 1956 film ``Lust
for Life.'' The movie was about Van Gogh, but the title was
tailor-made for Quinn, whose zest for living and making art has
hardly diminished as he turned 85 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to work,'' says Quinn, who's in San Francisco for the
opening of an exhibition of his artwork at the Richard Thomas
Galleries. It features about 100 paintings, sculptures and prints
by the legendary actor, a lifelong visual artist who planned to
pursue painting and architecture until Hollywood came calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can't go on acting all my life,'' Quinn says in that
famously rough, resonant voice. ``I'd love to make a couple more
pictures. But if I can paint the way I'm painting now, I'd just as
soon settle for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn has made close to 250 movies, bringing to life such
unforgettable characters as Zorba the Greek, the brute Zampano in
Fellini's ``La Strada'' and the Bedouin chief Auda abu Tayi in
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people don't know that he's been equally active as an
artist, turning out thousands of works in a modern Expressionist
mode that draws inspiration from a wide range of sources, from
Picasso and Matisse to African sculpture and Mexican art.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been productive in another area, fathering 13
children, the oldest of whom, Christina, is 56. He and his third
wife, Kathy, who's 37, are raising their two children, Ryan, 3, and
Antonia, 6. They travel with him everywhere, he says, and they're
the focus of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, every moment is wonderful with them,'' says Quinn, who
lives on a seaside estate in Bristol, R.I., where he paints and
sculpts daily after taking his daughter to school.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Quinn carved big chunks of marble brought
from the hills of Carrera to the villa he once shared with ex-wife
Iolanda and their three kids. ``It's become a big physical job, and
I don't do it as much,'' says Quinn, who these days tends to work
with materials close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and my daughter and wife and I walk around our
property, and we find wonderful stones along the ocean, wonderful
pieces of wood in the forest. I pick them up, take them home, carve
on them, and they turn out to be sculptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who's of Irish and Mexican ancestry, was born in
Chihuahua, Mexico, in the midst of the Mexican Revolution. His
parents joined Pancho Villa. After moving from Texas to
migrant-worker shacks in California, the family settled in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who began painting at 5, made money drawing pictures of
movie stars (Douglas Fairbanks gave him $10 for a portrait the
young artist mailed him).
</P>
<P>
   After winning an architectural competition in high school, he
was given a scholarship to study with Frank Lloyd Wright. The great
architect, Quinn says, thought he had a speech impediment;
believing that architects needed to speak clearly, Wright sent him
to a doctor to be examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor sent me to an acting class to learn how to speak,''
Quinn recalls. ``I did a play by Noel Coward, and somebody at
Universal saw me and offered me a contract. I called Mr. Wright and
told him they offered me $300 a week to become an actor. He said,
`By God, take it. You'll never make that from me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike acting, Quinn says, he can take his time making creative
decisions when he's painting or sculpting.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, you have to come up with truth at 8 o'clock, when
the curtain goes up or it's `Action!' There's no time to be
self-critical or analyze, like you can with a canvas or a piece of
marble. I've been working on paintings for 40 years, and I still
haven't found out what I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He has yet to finish a painting in which he holds his friend,
actor Vittorio Gassman, in his arms. ``I want get the truth of that
moment, and it's quite difficult,'' Quinn says.
</P>
<P>
   He cites Picasso, Matisse and Miro as primary influences, and he
greatly admires Rembrandt. African and Mesoamerican art have
inspired him as well. The masklike face of his painting ``Pride''
suggests the African-influenced Cubist forms of Picasso's
``Demoiselles d'Avignon'' period.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes Picasso and laughs: ``A poor man borrows, a rich
artist steals. I steal, of course. With the wealth of art that
Africa has produced, the wealth of art from the Aztec and Incas? My
God, you steal from them and hope you make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn tries not to repeat himself in his art. ``You find you do
that more as an actor because something sells and you want to do it
again. I'm much more honest in my painting than I am as an actor.
You can't do 240 films and do your best in each one. You go on the
set, hoping it's going to be great, and the director gives you the
wrong direction, and you say (to yourself), `We're heading the
wrong way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He's quick to add that he's worked with some great directors _
Fellini, George Cukor, David Lean. He's made his share of ``awful
pictures,'' he says, but some good ones, too. Among his favorites
are ``Zorba,'' ``La Strada,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Requiem
for a Heavyweight.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's most recent film is Ricardo Bravo's ``Oriundu
(Foreigner),'' filmed last year in Brazil. He plays a 93-year-old
man who thinks he sees his late wife _ who died at 23 _ at his
birthday party. He turns down almost all the scripts he's offered
because the roles are usually ``the routine old man,'' Quinn says,
``and I don't like to play the routine old man.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd rather spend his days with his family, carving a chunk of
wood or exploring his ``fantasy world'' in paint.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how one stays vital at 85, he replies, ``Keep walking.''
Then he talks about an old oak tree near his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part Druid, and we love trees. I have this tree that I'm
absolutely insane about. It says, `This is the way to ride it out.'
Just stand there and listen to the wind blow through your arms and
legs. It's thrilling.''

MAKE A BUG SPRAY IN THE BLENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 23, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have heard of soapy sprays for bugs that are safe for the
environment. With the season coming up, I wonder if there are any
that I can make myself.
</P>
<P>
   DONALD BAILEY, Londonderry, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of insecticide sprays that you can make.
Soap is one of them, mixed in various strengths. You can make a
spray of water and soap, which will be helpful when sprayed on
roses and other plants. Commercial nontoxic sprays are also
available. One brand name, Safer, is basically soap mixtures. You
can find it in garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   Grinding up old insect bodies such as Japanese beetles in a
blender and combining them with water makes a good antibug spray,
biodegradable, organic, and safe. It will be effective against
Japanese beetles, and perhaps other bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell your spouse that you pureed Japanese beetles in her
blender.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean old headstone or grave markers? Some of my
family's stones are pretty spotty, stained, and weather-beaten.
</P>
<P>
   L.C., Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A. Headstones, footstones, and markers can take a real beating
from the dry winds of Kansas. Slate and sandstone, usually in old
cemeteries in the East, stand up the least, and marble tends to
wear and stain badly. Granite is the best and longest-lasting, but
all the materials can be cleaned the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what to try: Make a strong mix of Spic and Span and
water, and add a cup of household bleach. Wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Apply this solution to the marker, and let it sit for several
minutes, without evaporating. Then scrub with a bristle brush and
rinse. Any solution that spills on the grass or earth will not hurt
the greenery, although bleach can do a job on greenery if used full
strength. Try this solution on a small, obscure area of the marker
before doing the whole job to make sure it does not affect the
marker in any way you don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Easier to transport to the cemetery is mechanics' handsoap, the
gel that really cuts through grease, oil, and dirt. Scrub this on
and rinse thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you could try StoneWash, a TileLab care product sold at
Home Depot. If you can't find it, call 800-272-8786.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My plastic-coated wire shelving is weirdly sticky and is
driving me bananas. How can I make it unsticky?
</P>
<P>
   JEANETTE EDSEN, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sticky plastic is always a pain, and since the development of
plastic-coated wire shelving, it continues to be a problem. I also
have heard of sticky vinyl wallpaper. I suggest washing the shelves
with a solution of Spic and Span and water, rinsing thoroughly, and
toweling dry. If that doesn't work, wipe them down with rubbing
alcohol. If all fails, try dusting the shelves with talcum powder.
</P>
<P>
   And, a shot in the dark: polish the wire shelves with Armorall,
sold in auto stores for treating vinyl dashboards and other vinyl
material in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Improvements catalog carries a transparent liner
for putting on wire shelves to keep things from falling through the
shelving. This might take the curse off the stickiness, although it
is plastic and it too might get sticky. Call 800-642-2112.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The parquet floors in the old house I just moved into are
heavily waxed and pretty dull. I'd like to remove the wax and put
down polyurethane varnish, but both Home Depot and Bruce, the
manufacturer of prefinished wood flooring, said that I cannot
varnish over a waxed surface, even if I try to remove all the wax,
enough wax will remain no matter what I do. Is this so?
</P>
<P>
   S.G., Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you heard it from some pretty reliable sources, so you
can take it from there. It is unlikely that you can get every bit
of wax off (it gets into the pores and into the seams) so as not to
interfere with varnish.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. That parquet is dull because there is too
much wax on it, so don't try to remove the wax, but try simply to
power buff it. If that restores the shine, you're all set.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, strip the old wax with paint thinner,
apply new wax, and power buff it.
</P>
<P>
   Still another trick is to defy the specialists and strip the wax
and apply two coats of an oil-based polyurethane varnish. But try
it in a small area (1-by-1-foot or so) to see if it peels or fails.
If there is wax present, it will fail quickly. If not, finish the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   What I am saying is that no floor should be waxed. A waxed floor
needs too much maintenance.
</P>

FROM A WORLD PERSPECTIVE, CLINTON HASN'T BEEN SO BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 23)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blessed are the peacemakers,'' quoth the Book of Matthew,
``for they shall be called the Children of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the peacemakers can also get called a lot of other
things, as the up-and-down career of one of the all-time busiest
peacemakers, Mr. Bill Clinton, demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the planet's best-known and most powerful individual,
America's president of seven years has traveled far and wide in the
peacekeeping role he attends to virtually every day on the job. But
his reputation, image, and influence shrink the closer he gets to
home. The farther he goes from the Beltway, the better he does with
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   He is the world's most influential character, by virtue of his
office, mostly, but also thanks to his remarkable personality. But
it is his character, or the news media's perception of same, that
drags his personal popularity level down well below his
surprisingly durable job approval rating, the best on average of
any recent president.
</P>
<P>
   Today's $64 question: How many countries has Bill Clinton
visited in the seven years of his presidency? And the $64 answer?
Sixty-four. Bill's Victory Lap year in the Oval Office took him
most recently to India (his 62d foreign visit), Pakistan (63d) and
Bangladesh (64th).
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's home, he's thinking distantly; he spent a good
part of Holy Thursday massaging Yasir Arafat to coax the
Palestinians into a term-ending Middle East peace treaty. The week
before, Bill schmoozed with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has more foreign visitors than Kennedy International
Airport. And he apparently never turns down a chance to fly. He's
on the road almost as much as Whitey Bulger. The White House Press
Office said Friday it no longer logs how many miles the president
has flown.``We don't get frequent-flier miles,'' said a press aide
somewhat ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Can you name a country where Clinton hasn't either gone, phoned,
sent money or planes or medics, had the ambassador in, or tossed a
dinner for the local potentate (and a few dozen interested parties
who might also make campaign contributions from time to time)?
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton has so far missed going to either pole; until
now he's not hosted a fund-raiser at McMurdoo Sound, to my
knowledge. And I'm sure there are some African backwaters, remote
Pacific islands, and old Soviet Union body parts with names
consisting of a handful of consonants ending in ``-stan,'' whose
air space has yet to be penetrated by Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   But not many. Big Bill has logged umpteen thousands of air miles
and swallowed a forklift-load of Air Force One peanuts in his urge
to splurge on the free plane tickets to anywhere that come with the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a foreign minister with whom he has not palavered? A
king or emperor he hasn't had in for the inevitable
sitting-either-side-of-the-fireplace photo? They love Clinton in
Northern Ireland, in Britain, on the Continent. In most countries
of the world, he is as or more popular than the local chieftan,
nabob, or emperor.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton had left India for arch-enemy Pakistan, an Indian
commentator told the BBC that the visit had mesmerized Indians of
every class and stripe.
</P>
<P>
   At home, alas, it is a much different story. Clinton's problems
with old and newer girlfriends, old and newer special prosecutors,
and the old-new-we-never-really-change-our-stripes news media have
left his public image hide lacerated with reopened wounds and
running sores.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment battle found his enemies coming up short. But
the snarling continues. Kenneth Starr's successor has vowed to
continue the war to destroy Clinton's reputation at government
expense. Like the Japanese soldiers who went to ground in the
jungles of the South Pacific archipelago, Starr's worn-out veterans
mumble bravely about fighting the fight forever.
</P>
<P>
   The public may be sick of it, but the Republicans trying to hold
onto control of the House and Senate keep telling one another
there's something buried that will somehow come to light and enable
the Great Right Wing Conspiracy to finally topple Bonnie Prince
William.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare moment, Clinton indulges in a bit of sport with his
enemies in the media conglomerates. After ABC News mangled a
trivial Earth Day photo-op interview with the prez by sending in
teen heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio to interview the Leader of the
Free World, Clinton gouged the red-faced network bosses for trying
to weasel their way out of the resulting PR debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you news people ever learn?'' deadpanned Clinton at the
Radio and TV Correspondents dinner, one of those dreadful DC
wingdings presidents are blackmailed into attending. ``It isn't the
mistake that kills you, it's the cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But rare are the opportunities for the target to one-up the
shooters. Dragged before the American Society of Newspaper Editors'
annual clambake in Washington for yet another go-round with the
flower of American journalism, Clinton was asked two insulting
questions by editors who inquired if he'd line himself up a
presidential pardon, as Nixon got from Gerald Ford, and did he
contemplate adding an impeachment wing to his presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   His ill-fated dalliance with Lady Monica cost him dearly. He
confessed to the editors that he ``struggled very hard to save my
relationship with my wife and daughter _ I have paid quite a lot''
for what he called ``the wreckage'' he brought on himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of Americans who hate Clinton, or scorn him,
or wish him to fry in the deepest vat of whatever it is they cook
those french fries in. Some of that is just politics. But a lot of
it is pure hatred. Perhaps because of his looks, his easy manner,
his mysterious knack for connecting with the masses on TV and in
person, those opposed to his policies gnash their teeth in envy.
</P>
<P>
   Deep inside Bill's well-thumbed Bible is a passage from the
Sermon on the Mount with which our battle-weary president may take
some solace this Easter Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   ``Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
you.''
</P>

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO'S MAYOR TAKES AIM AT CELL PHONE USERS

   SAN FRANCISCO _ You are trying the mayor's patience.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you. You with your cell phone ringing. The one playing a
teeth-grating, tinny rendition of Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown, joining a disgruntled population that's
tired of being interrupted by beeps, pings and ditties, said he's
had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, three times this one guy's goddamn cell phone
went off,'' Brown said after a Thursday morning press conference
about affordable housing That was frequently interrupted by
electronic hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has weighed in, with increasing frequency, about the
burgeoning use of the noisy technology that seems attached to
nearly every belt, suit jacket, purse and brief case.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has snapped at department heads, reporters, even at
audience members when cell phones have gone off during formal
swearing-in ceremonies for commissioners. And his staff will soon
post a sign on the door to the mayor's press conference room that
will remind visitors to put their pagers and cell phones on
vibrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your situation is such that you are expecting such a great
emergency, then we should change the meeting so you can deal with
the emergency,'' Brown, a democrat, chided a group.
</P>
<P>
   And don't get him started on drivers and their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state of California has got to do something,''
said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is not alone. San Francisco restaurateur Ed Moose, for
example, recently banned cell phone use inside his popular Moose's.
And the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in May will put up signs
telling visitors not to use cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   As for drivers using hand-held phones, San Francisco Supervisor
Amos Brown has called for a hearing on the matter. A proposed
statewide ban failed in the legislature three years ago but the
discussion is continuing here and in 15 other states and dozens of
cities across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash is growing as the number of cell phones _ about 91
million in the United States _ increases. Almost one in three
people owns a cell phone, said Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb is, mind your manners,'' Nelson said.
``Think if your parents were right there with you, what would they
say? And if they didn't raise you well, then borrow someone
else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there's a learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Carlson, vice president of the Pacific Exchange, said a
colleague answered her phone during a business lunch and he was so
insulted he grabbed it and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was mortified,'' Carlson said. ``But I was pretty
mortified. I would hope over time ... there are some standards of
behavior and etiquette that become widely accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he was recently shocked when a cell phone rang
while he was watching the movie ``Rules of Engagement'' at an area
cinema. He was thrilled to see a manager escort the offender out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so damn rude,'' agreed Marc Pascucci, spokesman for Loews
Cineplex Entertainment, which owns the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Loews doesn't, as a policy, kick out every cell phone user, but
the noise is becoming a problem, Pascucci said. Loews is
considering filming a preview that would lay down the rules of
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco city hall, Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano also is cracking down on noisy electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rude. It's self-centered and somewhat pretentious, I'd
say,'' Ammiano said. ``Particularly annoying are the little musical
numbers. I really don't want to hear `Row row row your boat' when
we're taking testimony about someone being evicted. It trivializes
the whole democratic process of a committee or board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano turns his phone off. And the mayor says he doesn't carry
a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to use one,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Then what's that in his chauffeured black Lincoln Towncar?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Brown shrugged. ``Whatever the cops put in the
car.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stepping out recently in a certain strapless taffeta
gown, I felt a mixture of embarrassment and anticipation. Not that
the shirred olive-colored dress wasn't flattering. But I was
wearing a knockoff of the endlessly photographed gown Hilary Swank
had so stunningly preened in three and a half weeks earlier at the
Academy Awards _ a copy ginned up by an ever nimbler arm of the
fashion industry specializing in reproductions from runways and
awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed ridiculous trying to trade on a movie star's cachet.
But I also hoped that for one split second I might be mistaken for
this year's best actress. Or at the very least, as someone wearing
a dress with major snob appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To my dismay, my entrance at the Waldorf-Astoria _ at a gala
celebrating the 55th Anniversary of the Boy's Town of Italy _ went
unnoticed. No flashes erupted, no shutters snapped, no one
requested autographs. I wasn't expecting a high-fashion crowd, but
the guests included luminaries like Gina Lollobrigida, Franco
Zeferelli and Ivana Trump. When I spotted someone I knew, Dr.
Lucinda Harris, my internist of eight years, not only did she fail
to recognize my dress, she didn't even recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   As I passed the statuesque model Noemie, one of the hot new
faces gracing runways and magazine covers, she touched the fabric
of my gown and asked, ``Is this the new season of DKNY?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the new season of ABS, a moderately priced clothing
line designed by Allen B. Schwartz, the king of phony couture.
Within 12 hours of the Oscars on March 26, he came up with an
approximation of Swank's dress and four others that had stolen the
show: the ``Charlize Theron,'' ``Cameron Diaz,'' ``Cate Blanchett''
and ``Ashley Judd.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before buyers from Bloomingdale's, Saks, Macy's and Lord &AMP;
Taylor had seen the dresses, thousands were on order, and in little
more than a week after the awards, the gowns were featured on seven
television shows. Although they won't be in stores until late July,
I was able to borrow samples of two of them.
</P>
<P>
   I made my way across the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf to chat
with the designer Mary McFadden, assuming that she would
immediately recognize my famous gown. ``That looks like the dress
Hilary Swank wore,'' she said, pronouncing the star's name
``schwank.'' ``How pretty you look.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodice's unraveling lining caught McFadden's eye. ``You just
have to sew that down, and then it could look like the real
thing,'' she said, blowing my cover. ``But don't worry, at
nighttime it looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Duke, the designer who created Swank's dress, had
warned me that his original, inspired by the master couturier
Charles James, would be a tough act to imitate. A few years back,
after Schwartz had whipped up an impressive replica of a slinky red
dress that Duke had designed for Minnie Driver, he wised up and
began concocting designs defying easy duplication. For Swank, he
used 20 yards of bronze-colored douppioni silk from the 1950s. Each
fold of the dress was sewn by hand, and a petticoat, with 30 layers
of silk tulle, gave the skirt its soft volume. To recreate the
one-of-a-kind dress in the vintage fabric, Duke estimated, would
cost $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   When I put on Schwartz's copy, it was so cumbersome I felt as if
I were wearing the drapes ripped off a window a la Scarlet O'Hara.
The skirt had stiff tulle netting, giving it substantial pouf. In
place of antique copper silk, Schwartz had used olive green
polyester. The tight, strapless bodice was asymmetrical and
ill-fitting, the shirring pretty shoddy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the price was $320.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to make my exit from the Waldorf party when a
thirtysomething blonde, wearing a skintight white sheath, stopped
me. ``Love your dress!'' she fawned. ``It looks like the one from
the Oscars _ that woman who won and had the big teeth wore it,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Before I could answer, she stepped in closer, eyeing the fabric.
``Hey, is that an Allen Schwartz?'' she asked. ``I almost bought
one of his dresses, the pink one, last year. Didn't I see your
dress on the `Today' show?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but Randolph Duke did the original,'' I stammered, as if
that conferred prestige on the facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I never knew who did it,'' she shrugged and disappeared
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness, I realized, the copy had eclipsed the original. After
all the refracting media images of Oscar dresses and their
mass-marketed knockoffs, Duke's prototype was almost beside the
point. To some, the surrogate had acquired more allure than the
original.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schwartz insisted, ``My dresses are better than the
originals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more forgiving, less risky,'' he told me. ``They're a
good fit at a good price. Movie stars and suburban housewives buy
our clothes. Nobody in the real world wears the real dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are few legal limits to what a knockoff house can do as
long as it does not use a designer's label or logo. Clothing has
little protection under copyright law, and designers, of course,
borrow from one another all the time, in ways subtle and not so
subtle. Schwartz is in the latter category. He said that he had
sold 80,000 copies of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's wedding dress.
``Last year,'' he boasted, ``I sold 20,000 pink Gwyneth Paltrow
dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the cult of the celebrity rules, but why would anyone
want to wear a dress identified with the personification of
uniqueness, namely a movie star?
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I had to admit that my weakness had a history. In
1986, when I married, the bridal gown du jour was the one worn by
Diana, Princess of Wales _ a silk and taffeta confection with bows
trimming the neckline and a 25-foot train. Diana, who had married
five years earlier and was my age, seemed to live a real-life
fantasy. I bought a copy of her dress, sans train, for $1,500 at
Kleinfeld, the Brooklyn bridal shop. While I took my vows under a
chuppa at the Garden City Hotel on Long Island, no St. Paul's
Cathedral, I half hoped the royal lineage of my gown might make my
dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   I had something similar in mind last week when I slipped into
ABS's version of the halter-style dress Charlize Theron had worn on
Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   The original Vera Wang creation was cut on the bias and made of
gossamer layers of irisdescent tangerine silk chiffon. The straps
of the dress were adorned with a $95,000 pair of diamond butterfly
clips by Fred Leighton. Were the dress to sell at retail, without
the clips, it would cost $4,000, Wang said. By contrast, the orange
ABS version, with red and coral acetate underlayers _ and
rhinestone clips included _ was $360.
</P>
<P>
   Copying Theron's 1930s hairstyle for the Oscars and wearing the
imitation of her dress, I ascended the steps of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the 4-foot train of the knock-off slithering behind
me. I was attending the Acquisitions Fund Benefit, a lavish affair
where a swell crowd, including Annette de la Renta and Mercedes
Bass, gathered in the Great Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dress is really terrific,'' said Edwin Weisl, the former
Parks commissioner, greeting me as I tripped over the hem, ``but it
looks hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly. When Myra Walker, the acting curator of the
Costume Institute, accidentally stepped on my train, I jerked
backwards, splashing my glass of Perrier down the front of my gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great dress,'' Walker said, after apologizing for the
faux pas. ``It looks vintage. But is that ABS? I saw it on
`Oprah.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the copy had more name recognition than the
original. And even the cognoscenti seemed to like it. Stephanie
Krieger, an antiques dealer, wearing a flesh-toned, sequined column
dress by Oscar de la Renta and a chinchilla-trimmed cardigan,
offered compliments, as did de la Renta himself.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, I felt a dainty hand on my bare back, adjusting a
hook that had come undone on my halter. ``I had to fix your
dress,'' purred Jill Swid, a style editor at Mirabella, in a
stunning black Christian Dior gown.$``I know it's not Vera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you tell?'' I asked glumly, as she looked me up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fit, the fabric and those clips,'' she sniffed. ``They are
definitely not Fred Leighton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those clips are very crackerjack,'' added her date, Jim
Brodsky, president of Sharp Communications. ``We figured your dress
was from Strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   That did it. In certain circles where status and style are
closely scrutinized, copies still don't cut it. And as my stardust
fantasy faded, I vowed never again to wear a dress that has all but
a starlet's name tag on it.

WINNER ALWAYS GETS OUT IN TIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SERGE WILSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember musical chairs? Think of it as a paradigm for the new
economy, where it has morphed into ``musical shares,'' a game that
anyone can play.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: First, buy equity in a company incorporated in the
state of NL _ Negativemargin Land _ where the motto is ``Loss is
lovely.'' You can get in before the company goes public, by playing
as an employee, angel investor, venture capitalist, private bank or
corporate player, or you can get in later.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have your stake, it's time to play evangelist. Get in
those chat rooms. Tell your friends. And remember that all news is
good news: ``Losses widening? Great! We're aggressively acquiring
customers!''
</P>
<P>
   Once the market at large starts believing _ and these days it
doesn't take long _ you quietly get out with a tidy profit. Don't
worry about leaving money on the table; you can always play again
with a new company. What you don't want to be is the sucker holding
a lot of NL stock when the market wakes up and realizes some
things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Your company's market (books, pet supplies, whatever) is very
competitive, with low margins.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet players will drive margins even lower, down to
commodity levels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Profits for commodity retailers are made through efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   _ NL companies are not very efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The last point is the crux. It's already conventional wisdom
that the Internet is a giant steamroller, crushing inefficient
infrastructure as it rumbles through market segments. You might
infer that the companies that will be left standing are the lean,
mean, efficient ones that can survive on the slim margins of the
newly disintermediated world.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the paradox: Most of the Internet companies that are
supposedly driving the steamroller will instead be steamrolled
themselves, because they have no incentive to operate efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The way these companies begin is horrifying. A start-up can get
a venture capital firm to throw $10 million at it by persuading
1,000 people to buy something online at 50 percent off. The company
is encouraged to burn through that $10 million and go for an
additional $100 million _ fast.
</P>
<P>
   All the focus on being the ``first mover'' and ``grabbing market
share'' sucks all the cash into marketing. A company burns $3
million for one Super Bowl ad or pays insane bounties to drive
``customers'' to a Web site. But if you walk, look, and quack like
a duck.com, you get to your initial public offering faster.
</P>
<P>
   What does this cash-fueled orgy produce? A bloated, inefficient,
self-indulgent company that doesn't know how to control costs, or
even want to _ just the kind of business that the Internet
steamroller will crush to smithereens on the next lap.
</P>
<P>
   As a dot-com chief executive, I've seen companies that hand out
cell phones and Palm V's to employees as if they were after-dinner
mints.
</P>
<P>
   I have a barometer for such waste: I ask partners and potential
partners at well-financed Internet start-ups how much they pay for
chairs. So far I've heard $800, $900 _ even $1,500 apiece. I'm
waiting for the $2,000 chair _ it's inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are adding employees as wastefully as chairs, often
without having a job for them or anyone to train them. (But they do
get a nice place to sit.) When most of us landed our first jobs,
our transcripts were scrutinized and references checked. Today you
can get in at some dot-coms on nothing more than an odd haircut and
a mini-backpack.
</P>
<P>
   (Contrast this approach with that of, say, Cisco Systems, which
does not let any department grow faster than 10 percent a year, so
it can maintain the quality of training and level of experience of
the group.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day you have a company that is full of:
</P>
<P>
   _ Human resources people that never had to make a good hire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salespeople that never have to sell at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marketing people with unlimited ad budgets and no
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buzzword-slinging executives to manage all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a steamroller, perhaps we should picture the Internet
as a scythe, with razor-thin margins serving as its business end.
It is only a matter of time before masses of venture capital- and
Nasdaq-fattened Baby Hueys are mown down by the digital economy
they helped create.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, of course, their nimbler backers will have dined
very well indeed, and moved on to even greener pastures.

   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ The federal government doesn't want
employers to discriminate against a prospective employee because of
her age, and it will sue you if you do. But when the government is
doing the hiring, it seems to cut itself some slack. Federal law
enforcement agencies have a rule that new hires cannot be 37
years-old or older by the time they join. By L.M. SIXEL.

hear arguments on the constitutionality of a state's ban on
late-term abortions. By MARK HELM.
</P>
<P>
   IDENTITY-THEFT (Washington) _ Thieves have swiped personal data
such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for more
than a decade primarily to get bank and checking accounts and
credit cards. But now identity theft is becoming more widespread as
crooks use other people's personal data to open utility accounts,
rent apartments, apply for loans, start businesses, buy cars and
even declare bankruptcy. Some lawmakers, led by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., are pushing legislation to curb the problem.
By JUDY HOLLAND. (1STLD-WRITETHRU filed.)
</P>
<P>
   CHILDCARE (Washington) _ Child advocacy groups say the 1996 law
requiring welfare recipients to go to work is not providing enough
money for most of them to put their kids in day care. Only about 15
percent of the youngsters eligible for the federally funded care
actually get the subsidy. So many parents can't work or can't get
better paying jobs. But the push for additional funds is iffy since
most Republican lawmakers don't want to spend more for ``a national
nanny,'' as one puts it. By DAN FREEDMAN.

<P>
   IRAN-REFORMS (Tehran, Iran) _ Social strictures imposed after
the 1979 Islamic Revolution are beginning to ease across Iran. Yet
many remain skeptical of the ability of the reformers, led by
President Mohammed Khatami, to bring significant political change
to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since Khatami was elected in 1997,
the reformers have been locked in a political dance with the
conservatives to determine the direction of the country, moving in
a pattern of two steps forward, one step back. By DEBORAH HORAN.

   IRAN-WOMEN (Tehran, Iran) _ Many Iranian women are testing the

   IRAN-INTERNET (Qom, Iran) _ Perhaps more than anything else, the
Internet, which the ruling mullahs praise as an Islamic research
tool, has helped Iranians break out of the profound sense of
isolation they have felt for the last two decades. The free flow of
information makes any effort to keep outside influences from
seeping into the country more difficult and allows the world to
more easily find out what's happening inside Iran. By DEBORAH
HORAN.

   NEW YORK _ Brent Sterling Nemetz has perfected the art of
hanging from cables on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and climbing
backward up the ladder in the Statue of Liberty's arm, all the
while asking questions and shooting from a Sony video camera.
Wednesday night found him going the wrong way down the stairs from
the 110th floor of the World Trade Center, Tower No. 2, looking for
the night's interview subject, Samantha Hue, a tour guide at the
observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   Nemetz has a day job shooting footage for slick television
fashion shows _ ``You know, all the ones that are on Saturday
morning,'' he said _ and editing film and video at his Manhattan
production company, Sterling Films. But in his spare time, he
exercises the curiosity that has made him a video Studs Terkel, a
man obsessed with New York's unsung laborers _ the people who
fillet fish, makeup artists on ``Cats,'' Zamboni operators on
Madison Square Garden ice and people who sell toy mice on sidewalks
or carve gargoyles on the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   He compiles his interviews into a half-hour series on PBS called
``Souls of New York,'' which appears locally at 8:30 on Thursday
nights. Last Sunday, he was awarded a New York Emmy for Outstanding
Director of a Documentary Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is documentary lite,'' he said of his brief lives, the
two-and-a-half-minute segments outlining what it's like to be a
grave digger at Potter's Field, an auctioneer at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Nemetz, 26, operates as a one-man band. He does his own
lighting, finds his own subjects _ Hue appeared on the 110th floor
at 8:30 after taking a late ``lunch break'' _ writes his own
questions, runs the camera, shoots ``A'' roll and ``B'' roll
(primary interview and background footage) and edits. ``I can shoot
anywhere from 10 minutes to one and a half hours to get enough for
a two-and-a-half-minute segment,'' he said. ``The editing can be
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly stationed Hue near the rail on the north side of the
building, with an awesome view of the Empire State Building, while
the full moon rose like a klieg-lighted egg yolk. Then he asked her
his usual softball questions: how she got her job, why she likes
it, if she's ever met any celebrities. (Two: Danny DeVito _ ``He
was nice,'' she said, with a dazzling smile _ and Ricky Martin.)
</P>
<P>
   He dragged his camera and tripod down to the south railing and
filmed her pointing out the Statue of Liberty. ``Everyone wants to
see her,'' she said. Then he hit the east side of the building,
``the windy side,'' she noted with another dazzling smile, and
asked her to interact with tourists. She asked a young woman if she
would like to be in the photo she was taking, then advised the
whole family to scrunch down a little, so the moon could get into
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the guards shooed the last tourists off the 110th
floor and closed the observation deck for the night, Nemetz said
goodbye to Hue and went downstairs to shoot the building from
street level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done 180 of these things,'' he said. ``It's such an
education for me. Doormen, dog walkers, squeegee guys. I like the
nickel-and-dime people best.'' And the ones with truly odd jobs,
like poisoning rats in the subway. ``I said, `This job is not for
everyone,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Which could be the mantra for many of the people he films,
including one of the city's last scissors sharpeners, the last
milkman, the last civilian lighthouse tender. ``I'd stop doing
this,'' he said, as he walked down a Wall Street canyon looking for
a bottle of water to top off the night, ``but I don't see anyone
else doing it.''

THE 3 LIVES OF GEORGE WALLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GEORGE WALLACE: SETTIN' THE WOODS ON FIRE 
Produced and directed by: Daniel McCabe and Paul Stekler 
Written by: Steve Fayer, McCabe and Stekler 
Based in part on: ``The Politics of Rage'' by Dan Carter 
On: PBS, Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rise and fall and rise of George Corley Wallace is an
astonishing story that would also be deeply tragic if his appetite
for power hadn't swallowed up most of his own humanity.
</P>
<P>
   He was once a liberal Alabama judge, and many believe his early
racial egalitarianism was the real thing. But when he perceived
that it cost him his first run at the governorship, Wallace called
for ``segregation forever.'' That propelled him to the State House
in Montgomery and onto the national stage. He spewed race hate at
home, then coded it in softer language when running for president,
which he did four times, once nearly throwing the election into the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, he fostered ghastly violence against black civil
rights activists. And his national messages left destruction in
their wake, perhaps including the 1972 assassination attempt that
left Wallace himself paralyzed. Then came an extraordinary
transformation. From the wreck of his political and personal life,
Wallace rose again and, through public repentance, won black as
well as white support to become Alabama's governor for a fourth
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mere outlines of his life are the stuff of great drama.
PBS's ``American Experience'' captures it in all its dark and
dazzling complexity in ``George Wallace: Settin' the Woods on
Fire,'' airing Sunday and Monday nights at 9 on Channel 2. This is
a mesmerizing chronicle of a fascinating political opportunist and,
lest we forget, once an influential and dangerous national voice.
The three-hour documentary brilliantly balances the epic and the
intimate _ sweeping almost 80 years from Wallace's roots in the
poor rural South to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, TNT broadcast an arresting docudrama starring a
galvanic Gary Sinese as ``George Wallace'' and covering some of the
same material. As excellent as it was, ``Settin' the Woods on
Fire'' is better still. To its roaring plot line, the nonfiction
version adds enlightening commentators including Wallace family
members and colorful cronies as well as crackerjack journalists and
historians. None is wiser than J.L. Chestnut, a deep-voiced black
civil rights attorney whose penetrating remarks rise to the level
of a Greek chorus. After Wallace is shot in Maryland campaigning
for the presidency, he says: ``You just can't go around preaching
hatred, however you dress it up . . . and not have it come back and
bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers masterfully braid revealing political and personal
subplots into the main story line, almost any of which could have
been spun into a self-contained historical drama. One is a
suspensful account of Wallace's assailant, Arthur Bremer,
methodically stalking the candidate through the '72 primaries _ the
archival footage of Bremer is copious and chilling. Another
involves President Nixon and his machinations to undo Wallace, whom
he saw as a formidable threat to his own power.
</P>
<P>
   And threaded through ``Settin' the Woods on Fire'' are the vital
parts played by the strong, devoted women in Wallace's life,
notably Lurleen, his first wife, and Cornelia, whom he married
after Lurleen died of cancer. Because Alabama's governors couldn't
succeed themselves at the time, Lurleen ran for the office in 1966
to hold on to her husband's national power base. Later, Cornelia
gave him a makeover to enhance his national appeal, inspiring a wag
of the day to note that the couple was ``a kind of Dogpatch version
of Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, and many Wallace adversaries, were deceived by
his rustic rhetoric and redneck persona. He loved power, as he told
his daughter Peggy, and he not only knew how to pander to southern
whites to get it, but also cleverly exploited the national media.
Campaigning in the North, he wanted scruffy-looking Vietnam War
protesters to give him the Nazi salute in front of TV cameras. The
nightly news footage would solidify his angry, conservative
blue-collar constituency.
</P>
<P>
   What we have in the end is more than a detailed, full-length
portrait of the pugnacious Wallace: an amateur boxing champion and,
later, shrewd and often cynical political combatant. It is more,
too, than a useful, alternative lens through which to examine the
turbulent '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Through close attention to biographical and historical nuance,
``Settin' the Woods on Fire'' raises enduring questions about the
very nature of political ambition and, of course, about the core
nature of George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Was he really contrite when he phoned his old enemies before the
1982 gubernatorial election and recanted his racist dogma? Veteran
civil rights leader John Lewis thinks so, contending that Wallace
reverted to his liberal roots, ``his true self.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in any event, a tribute to the film that it depicts this
evildoer in all his clenched ambiguity and even allows the story of
his life to move us. Wallace possesses a kind of animal tenacity
and courage that's impossible to ignore and hard, at moments, not
to admire.
</P>
<P>
   The eloquent Mr. Chestnut should have the last word. ``How is
it,'' he says, ``that a demagogue, insulting 20 million black
people daily on the television, can rise to the heights that
Wallace did? . . . Forgive? Yes. Forget? Never.''

   MELBOURNE _ Twenty-five years after the fall of South Vietnam to
the Communists, and the ignominious American flight from Saigon,
the fear that other non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia would
topple like a row of dominoes seems farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Communist-ruled Vietnam and Laos have joined the
Association of South-East Asian Nations, the group of non-Communist
countries that they previously castigated and threatened to
subvert.
</P>
<P>
   But what would have happened if U.S. President Lyndon Johnson,
faced with the awful choice of opting in or out of Vietnam so early
in his presidency, had elected not to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Soon after dawn on Aug. 17, 1964, a crowd began gathering in
Merdeka Square outside the gleaming white presidential palace in
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, when President Sukarno, the self-styled Great
Leader of the Revolution, mounted the podium to deliver his annual
independence day address, the crowd had grown to a million.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno once said that to intoxicate the masses was what he
lived for. Never before had he succeeded so well, and never would
he again. His address, interrupted by frequent applause, took three
hours to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery leader called 1964 ``A Year of Living Dangerously,'' a
title that was both apt at the time and prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours earlier, Indonesia had landed 50 guerrillas on
the west coast of the Malayan peninsula, striking for the first
time against the heartland of Malaysia, which then included
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Sukarno was launching an armed ``confrontation'' against what he
claimed was a British-sponsored neocolonial federation. Three weeks
later the air force followed with an airdrop of paratroops into
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed in the media by events in Vietnam, the southern
tier of Southeast Asia came close to war.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union and China had become bitter rivals,
Sukarno and the Indonesian Communist Party, with its 3 million
members and 10 million sympathizers, turned to China and received a
warm response.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Sukarno proclaimed the year of living dangerously,
the People's Daily in Beijing, speaking for the Chinese Communist
Party, linked the Malaysian and Vietnam crises as joint struggles
against U.S. imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival in Jakarta of Marshal Chen Yi, the Chinese foreign
minister, in October 1964, marked the start of violent
anti-American demonstrations in Indonesia. These were followed by
the establishment of what became known as a Beijing-Jakarta axis.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia walked out of the United Nations and formed an
alliance with China to make Jakarta the world center of
anti-imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta warned that if Britain, which had substantial military
forces in Malaysia, attacked Indonesia during its confrontation
with Malaysia, Chinese forces would intervene directly while
Beijing stirred up revolutionary elements in other parts of
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai arrived in Jakarta in April
1965 to advise Sukarno to create a ``people's army'' outside the
control of the regular army, which remained anti-Communist although
it was being infiltrated by leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of weapons, shipped in from China as building equipment,
were distributed to Communist youth and women's units in Indonesia.
Communists took control of Antara, the official Indonesian news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of troops moved into eastern Sumatra, posing a
threat to the west coast of the Malayan peninsula. In Kalimantan,
the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, some 15 battalions
took up positions close to the Malaysian states of Sabah and
Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
   All of this occurred when the situation in South Vietnam was
deteriorating rapidly. The Vietcong had become strong enough to
mount terror attacks in the heart of Saigon. They were also
threatening to cut South Vietnam in two. Regular North Vietnamese
forces were for the first time moving into the South.
</P>
<P>
   Without heavy American intervention, the war in Vietnam was
lost. Washington had two options: It could bow in massively or bow
out. President Johnson decided to intensify U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Jakarta, only the generals stood in the path of vigorous
pursuit of the revolution that Sukarno demanded. In a speech on the
night of Sept. 30, 1965, he called for those military leaders to be
crushed. That night six generals were killed in an attempted coup
in which the Communists were deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   General Suharto, who led the successful countercoup, was
fortuitously left off the death list prepared by the coup planners.
He quickly took control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia went into reverse gear. The Beijing-Jakarta axis
collapsed, and ``confrontation'' with Malaysia ended. Tens of
thousands of Communists were massacred and the party was banned.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly relations were re-established with the United States,
and Indonesia joined Malaysia and Singapore in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Marshall Green, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia at
this tumultuous time, wrote that a ``successful Sino-Indonesian
alliance would have created a great Communist pincer in Southeast
Asia, with the largest and fifth largest countries in the world
enclosing not only Vietnam but also the vulnerable countries of
mainland Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had withdrawn from Vietnam before the
attempted Indonesian coup, the effect would have been to strengthen
Sukarno's pro-Communist stance and his determination, with Chinese
backing, to crush Malaysia. It would have undermined the will and
means of the Indonesian generals to resist the Communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the late Indonesian foreign minister Adam Malik,
who became vice president under General Suharto, if the attempted
coup against the Indonesian generals had not taken place, Sukarno
would soon have presided over a Communist Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of Southeast Asia the situation was precarious. Laos
was all but in Communist hands. In Cambodia, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk had decided that Hanoi would win in Vietnam and had thrown
in his lot with China. Thailand faced a Beijing-sponsored war of
national liberation. And across the Strait of Malacca from
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia had separated bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely then that Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
caught in the pincers that Green referred to, would not have
survived the pressure. The dominoes would have fallen. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

was all but in Communist hands. In Cambodia, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk had decided that Hanoi would win in Vietnam and had thrown
in his lot with China. Thailand faced a Beijing-sponsored war of
national liberation. And across the Strait of Malacca from
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia had separated bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely then that Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand,
caught in the pincers that Green referred to, would not have
survived the pressure. The dominoes would have fallen. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, on April 17, 1975, I was in
Phnom Penh. It was a city that had been under siege for months, a
place of fear and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge rockets rained down daily, bringing random death,
injury and destruction. The population had been swollen to 3
million, mainly by people fleeing the war-torn countryside.
</P>
<P>
   We were warned that Phnom Penh's defenses could not hold out
much longer. I remember hearing a Voice of America radio broadcast
in which President Gerald Ford warned Congress in a somber tone
that the situation in both Cambodia and South Vietnam had reached a
critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options before us are few and time is very short,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I was working as a Cambodian staff member of the American aid
agency CARE. I had my chance to leave Phnom Penh. In the early
morning of April 12, a U.S. Embassy official told me that I had to
get to the embassy within an hour if I wanted to be evacuated from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The American staff of CARE had gone, leaving the management of
its multimillion dollar program in our hands. My mind was on the
plight of more than 3,000 refugee families in the provincial town
of Kampong Speu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Khmer Rouge tightened their noose around Phnom Penh,
we had been able to arrange trucks to carry food and medical
supplies to these refugees. Now the road had been cut and I was
preoccupied with a meeting that morning to finalize an airlift of
supplies instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, I suddenly realized that I was running
late for the rendezvous at the U.S. Embassy. I arrived just in time
to see the last of the evacuation helicopters taking off. There was
no other way out. I was trapped, like everyone else in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   People prayed that the Cambodian New Year that started the
following day would turn a fresh page in Cambodia's recently
tormented history. We knew that the war would soon be over. But we
did not know whether its end would bring peace or more death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Khmer Rouge soldiers clad in black pajamas and
carrying AK-47 assault rifles walked into the city. Many were just
teenagers. People thought that between Cambodians we could work
things out.
</P>
<P>
   I went to one of the city's main hotels, where the Red Cross had
set up a neutral zone. I spent the day helping its staff in the
emergency room in one of the bungalows. Later that afternoon the
Khmer Rouge ordered the entire city emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Our family group of 16 left that night along with thousands of
others. Imagine 3 million people trying to get out of the city.
Among the forced evacuees were huge numbers of women, children,
elderly and infirm _ even thousands of hospital patients, many
seriously ill or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   This forced march was desperately slow. It took us 10 days to
get to Tonle Bati, usually reached from Phnom Penh in an hour. This
was just the beginning of the Killing Fields.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, also fell to
the communists.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 months were a time of unimaginable horror in
Cambodia. I managed to survive by disguising my identity and slowly
working my way westwards towards the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1976, I crossed into Thailand, joining other
Cambodians in refugee camps there. Later, I was taken to America.
But of the 16 members of my family, I was the only one to make it
to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Have Cambodia and Vietnam learned any lessons from this terrible
period?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the alliance between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese
communists during the years of the war in Indochina, both countries
underwent internal purges and fought against each other. The
conflict resulted in a 10-year occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cambodia and Vietnam have mended their relations.
Both are now members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, and espouse market economics. Both have relative stability
and considerable economic potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's communist rule and its inability to end corruption
and bureaucratic red tape scare away many investors. Cambodia, too,
has governance problems. Yet even its less-than-fair elections have
awakened the population to the importance of having their voices
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cambodia and Vietnam must accept the bright light of
accountability and transparency before they can enjoy the full
benefits of democratic prosperity _ and be sure that the dark
period of their recent history is never repeated. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

GARDENING: A WALK IN THE WOODS, WITH EYES NEWLY OPENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, April 23)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I wander the woods in Maryland these days, I find myself
bending down to admire tiny little flowers I never noticed before,
counting petals, noting the shapes of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   I've been inspired by a book with the catchy title ``The New
England Wild Flower Society Guide to Growing and Propagating
Wildflowers of the United States and Canada'' (Houghton Mifflin,
$40). Just out, it's written by William Cullina, the propagator and
manager of the nursery at the society's Garden in the Woods in
Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Cullina, 35, who has run the nursery for five years, has a flair
for description. The open seedpods of claytonia, for example,
remind him of ducks opening their bills wide and sticking out their
tongues, an image I'll remember when collecting seeds.
</P>
<P>
   I think Claytonia virginiana, or spring beauty, is growing in my
woods. The tiny little white flower, with its faint pink striping
on five rounded petals and narrow, grasslike leaves, matches
Cullina's description and the accompanying photograph. And Maryland
is within its range.
</P>
<P>
   But the propagation notes _ ``moderately easy from seed; easy
from division'' _ raise a question that is hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   With even common wildflowers disappearing under housing
developments and roads, every gardener can bolster biodiversity by
growing the native plants most suited to local conditions, insects
and animals.
</P>
<P>
   But when, if ever, is it beneficial to collect seeds or make
divisions of wild plants?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have as much of a problem with collecting seed, as
long as you're taking a small amount and it's not a rare plant,''
Cullina said in a telephone interview. Digging corms or making
divisions is trickier. ``I used to think that taking a few spring
beauties from a big patch wouldn't hurt, but look at what happened
to the fishing industry,'' he said. ``People keep harvesting and
harvesting, and then they're all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He encourages gardeners to join local native plant societies or
botanical gardens, which often sell or swap local plants, divisions
and seeds. The book has a good list.
</P>
<P>
   I want to increase the population of the spring beauties in my
woods, but Cullina warns that growing them from seed is difficult
(which is like holding a red flag up to a bull: here goes). The
ducklike pods shed their seeds quickly, within a month of
flowering, so you have to keep an eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   Cullina picks the pods, lets them dry several days and then sows
the shiny little black seeds outdoors, where they lie dormant
through the summer and winter and germinate in the spring. The
plants take years to reach blooming size, however, ``so I usually
let them self-sow and dig up sections when I need to,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Cullina suggests planting claytonia in drifts with dicentra,
asarum, creeping phlox, sanguinaria and tiarella. His 300-page book
explains the divisions and families of the plant kingdom, the
definitions of shade (less than two hours of sun) and wet soil
(when you dig with a shovel, standing water is visible one foot
down). He discusses the ``floristic provinces'' of the country,
from tundra to Great Plains to Eastern deciduous woods, explaining
how basic conditions like sea level, weather and soil have shaped
them. Rocky Mountain plants, for instance, have thick,
semitranslucent leaves and a covering of down, to protect them in
thinner air from the sun's radiation.
</P>
<P>
   If you understand these traits, you will be less likely to try
to propagate alpine plants, say, around the muggy Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, our marshy woods is a mass of emerald green skunk
cabbages and May apples (Podopyllum peltatum) unfurling their
umbrellas. I could spread the wealth to neighbors who have the
right conditions, but no plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``May apple is extremely tough and, once established, can grow
in poor, droughty conditions where most woodland wildflowers
fail,'' Cullina writes. But in rich, moist soil, the deeply
indented leaves, aloft over delicate flowers, can reach a foot in
diameter and make a wonderful ground cover. Judging by its picture
in the book, I think Trientalis borealis, the starflower, is also
in our woods. This common spring ephemeral's creeping rhizomes send
up stems with a whorl of leaves and little white starflowers on
threadlike stalks. It is equally at home, Cullina says, in dry
sandy soil or swampy hummocks.
</P>
<P>
   See what a lot of work this book could be? The waxy gray seed
clusters should be collected as soon as the leaves wither, but they
are difficult to spot, so Cullina suggests marking the plants while
in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The book is also full of easy-to-increase common wildflowers.
``Anything in the aster family is easy,'' Cullina said. ``Butterfly
weed is easy to grow from seed. And jack-in-the-pulpit is good for
a woodland.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget solidago, or goldenrod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convincing gardeners to grow goldenrods is a bit like trying
to sell Toyotas in Detroit,'' Cullina writes. But goldenrods are
insect-pollinated, he explains, so their pollen is heavy and
sticky, to hang onto a transporter's body. So don't blame goldenrod
if you can't breathe: wind-pollinated ragweed, grasses and trees
are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The plants can be divided in spring or early summer, but don't
wait until midsummer, because they are weaker from flowering and
may not root well before winter, Cullina advises. Seeds germinate
easily after a cold period and should be collected when heads are
brown and fluffy. Softwood cuttings taken in spring also root
easily.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why I'm so happy about this book. It just means a
lot more work in the garden. And this one has no walls.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; THIS WEEK: PUSHING TULIPS AND PULLING ROOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PATRICIA JONAS &LR;  &QC;   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tulips require at least six hours of sun a day and good
drainage. Small flowers are a sign of inadequate light or
nutrition. Mulch with compost or well-rotted manure in fall, or
apply high-nitrogen fertilizer in spring just as shoots emerge.
Foliage provides nutrition for next year's flowers and must be
left, unbraided and untied, to die back naturally.
</P>
<P>
   When planting container-grown perennials, don't coddle the root
balls: work roots apart with your hands, or cut upward with a knife
about a third from the bottom in three places. Encourage roots to
grow out, not around, to keep the plant from strangling.

   (For release Sunday, April 23)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard to say exactly when I cleaned a small
fortune's worth of clothes out of my closet and began to stockpile
my new look. First came the tubs of berry-colored lip gloss that
could smother a fly. Then I bought a pair of denim flares with
braided detailing at the waist, a flowing chiffon blouse and tinted
aviator sunglasses. And finally I went to the drugstore and spent
$6.99 on that instrument of torture I hadn't braved since I was 12,
a curling iron.
</P>
<P>
   I had become obsessed all over again with ``Charlie's Angels,''
the hit television series from 1976 to 1981, my pre-preteen years,
about three beautiful she-detectives who peeled around in cool
sports cars and used kung fu on bad guys even as they changed
outfits a dozen times an episode, putting on a fashion parade.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, I desperately wanted to be Jaclyn Smith, who played
the classy brunette Kelly Garrett with luscious, hot-rolled curls.
In my quest to re-embrace the show, I even asked for a ``Charlie's
Angels'' haircut, but unfortunately I forgot to specify which
Angel, and instead of Kelly's feathered wings, I walked out into
the Manhattan night with the signature athletic crop of Kate
Jackson's character, the masculine Sabrina Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that I had gone too far. I was considering
therapy until I realized I was not alone. On a couch at Moomba, I
met Allison Sarofim, a co-owner of the Tribeca restaurant Vandam.
She was wearing the same 1970s-style jeans by Katayone Adeli that I
had on, and she had a gold name chain that read ``Candy'' in
cursive lettering, exactly like the one Jackson used to wear over
ribbed turtlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   Sarofim, 28, had also been hit by the ``Charlie's Angels''
lightning. ``I just started losing interest in all my black clothes
by Helmut Lang and Calvin Klein and started gobbing on the frosty
blue eye shadow,'' she said. Hours earlier she had sat with big
can-size rollers in her hair under a dryer at a Lower East Side
salon to achieve those perfect angel curls.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Kelly Lamb, a New York artist who sported
salmon-colored Gucci hip-huggers, strappy heels and a glittery
Chloe blouse at her opening at the Spencer Brownstone Gallery in
March. Underneath her photographs of fleshy Playboy bunnies, which
were juxtaposed with a video of a disrobing geisha, she told me how
she had recently started scouring dusty dime stores for Bonnie Bell
kissing sticks and oversize aviator sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' look is the female equivalent of a guy
trying to look ghetto fabulous,'' Lamb said as she shellacked her
lips with Chanel's new sparkle gloss. ``It's a parody of being sexy
and bad, but at the same time you actually get to look sexy and
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Angels'' craze is being fueled primarily by a Columbia
Pictures film adaptation of the television series that will star
Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. The three sashayed onto
the stage in skin-baring synchronicity at the Oscars last month to
present the award for best costume design. But in an example of the
blistering pace of fashion cycles, trend-setters are being
influenced not by the movie, but by anticipation of the movie,
which will not be released until November.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Elle, Mademoiselle and Jane magazines have
had fashion layouts inspired by ``Charlie's Angels,'' each with its
own take on the same silk chiffon halter tops and slinky wrap
dresses by Louis Vuitton, Emanuel Ungaro, Celine and Versace. Jon
Moore, Elle's style director, used a 14-page ``Angel'' spread in
February to present the spring collections to working women. Three
Angel look-alikes appeared primarily in office settings, sitting on
desks and strutting down corridors with long flipped tresses,
tight, elegant slacks and Lucite heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the spring collections, there was no way to avoid
the over-the-top glamour,'' Moore explained. ``Vogue addressed it
in terms of rich suburban housewives whose primary concern was
cocktail parties, but Charlie's Angels were very modern in the
sense that they were glamour girls who also had jobs. The timing
for that idea is perfect right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Versace ads with the model Amber Valletta in
a low-cut, palm-tree-print wrap dress, her hair feathered and her
lips glossed to kill, in what seems a strong set of ``Angels''
references.
</P>
<P>
   Donatella Versace, who briefly had discussions about designing
the ``Charlie's Angels'' movie costumes, said in a faxed reply to a
question about her influences: `` `Charlie's Angels' is about
maximal fashion _ glossy lips, layered hairdos and highly
accessorized, body-conscious looks. Minimalism seems over and
clearly never was in at Versace. Often when a trend dies, people
look to the opposite, so that's why the Angels are back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a nonstop procession of 1970s revivalism has occurred
in the last 10 years. The movie ``Boogie Nights'' unearthed
roller-disco styles, which have been echoed by Stella McCartney at
Chloe, and scruffy young artists in the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn and Silverlake in Los Angeles are in perennial thrall to
the geek chic of the Brady Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to ``Charlie's Angels'' style, the interest is
in the swank, almost conservative elegance of classic Yves Saint
Laurent, Evan-Picone and private labels of long-forgotten Beverly
Hills boutiques. The Angels wore career-woman classics like pleated
pantsuits or knee-length A-line skirts in neutral browns or ivory,
paired with big-collar shirts or turtlenecks. They lounged on
leather couches or behind the bar at the Townsend Detective Agency,
where their boss, Charlie, would brief them by speakerphone. (``The
water runs deep in this case, Angels, and I'm up to my hips in it
right now,'' he'd say as a bikinied girl massaged him in a hot
tub.)
</P>
<P>
   The three Angels had distinct personalities, and even their
haircuts and clothes matched their images. Jackson played the
razor-tongued smart Angel with the butch gait and severe straight
hair. (Neighborhood bullies liked her the best.) Smith was the
fashion plate with playful curls, and Farrah Fawcett, with her
trashy blue eyeliner, fluoride smile and flirty feathered tresses,
was the dream babe that a generation of women fried their hair
trying to duplicate. (Guys thought she looked California natural.)
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett left after the first season, and Cheryl Ladd came in as
her character's cute kid sister. Jackson was later replaced by the
bookwormish Shelly Hack and then the streetwise Tanya Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being professionals, if the job called for it, the
Angels would strip down to more revealing attire like lacy
nightgowns and string bikinis. That was inevitable with story lines
like ``Lady Killer,'' where Fawcett went under cover as a porn
centerfold, and ``Consenting Adults,'' with Smith posing as a call
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The series, produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg for
ABC at the height of the women's liberation movement, was in the
top 10 in the Nielsen ratings for three of its five years. It
stirred a huge debate among feminists, who said it represented a
retreat for women's images. In a 1976 issue of Time, ABC's head of
programming was quoted as saying, ``Typically, each `Angels'
episode makes sure at least one co-star strips down to a bikini in
the first 10 minutes, the better to keep males in a state of
gape-jawed passivity and expectation thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, many remember the series as liberating, because it
was one of the first to have female leads who were not playing the
roles of secretaries or nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels were total knockouts, but they were constantly
strategizing about catching the criminal and being the most
efficient at their jobs,'' said Marcelle Karp, a co-founder of the
postfeminist 'zine Bust, who as a teen-ager feathered her hair and
rode a skateboard in homage to Fawcett. Karp said the series had
more in common with the girl-power genre that includes ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' and ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' than with the
modern-day jigglefest ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Each episode of ``Angels'' had an unprecedented $20,000 budget
for wardrobes and styling. The show's costume designer, Nolan
Miller, said Spelling let the actresses pick out and then keep a
majority of their costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare,'' Miller recalled. ``Every Monday they'd
come in with huge lists of boutiques in Beverly Hills where they
had thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise on hold. But it was
smart on Aaron's part, because the girls really started to develop
their own style.'' Fawcett was into the daring trends shown on the
runways in Paris, including the braless look.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Farrah stopped wearing bras, the other girls followed,''
Miller said. ``The networks relaxed a little bit and let the
outline of a nipple show through a slightly see-through silk
blouse. Before that we used to have to tape the nipples.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith liked Italian-made classic gabardine pantsuits with
matching blouses and vests from the Alan Austin boutique, which was
in Beverly Hills. And Jackson had a penchant for denim and
turtlenecks. ``We must have bought about 300 black cashmere
turtlenecks for Kate,'' Miller said with a fond sigh.
</P>
<P>
   As the decades wear on, this kitsch classic is remembered more
through the filter of nostalgia than reruns on TNT, leaving
personal attempts at duplicating the ``Charlie's Angels'' style
open to interpretation. At a party in the West Village on a recent
Saturday night, Anita Vasmani, 26, was wearing a MaxMara purple
halter top that tied around the neck like a scarf while grooving to
'70s disco songs remixed by Dimitri From Paris, a French DJ. ``It
was so `Charlie's Angels' I couldn't resist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett herself, speaking by phone from the fitting room of a
Gucci boutique in Beverly Hills, where she was looking for
something to wear to a New York film premiere, said that she, too,
had noticed an ``Angels'' revival. She had just tried on a gray
pinstriped pantsuit with a narrowly cut blazer and slacks that
flared at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it I smiled, because it reminded me of something I
might have worn on `Charlie's Angels,''' she said. ``I guess even
I'm dressing like myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith told me from her California home that she has started
slipping ``Charlie's Angels'' references into the sportswear line
that she designs for Kmart, like scarves that tie around the neck
and retro colors like browns and taupes. (You can imagine my
elation at getting to talk to my idol Smith, although she did seem
a little unsettled when I told her about the impact she was having
on my life.)
</P>
<P>
   I decided I had to have a new Louis Vuitton wrap dress with a
halter top plunging down the middle of the chest and a retro block
pattern. It reminded me of the one Smith wore in the episode where
she went under cover as a fashion model. Too bad it costs $1,020.
</P>
<P>
   I'm only going to look at it, I promised myself as I pushed
through the mausoleum-heavy doors of the SoHo Vuitton boutique for
the first time. I had once thought the brand was too old-fashioned
for me and had never ventured inside. Downstairs in the women's
section, one glance at the meticulous racks of clothing told me the
dress wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to a saleswoman, who seemed to be sizing up my freshly
feathered hair. ``The halter dress, right?'' she said. She'd seen
my type before.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try back in a few more weeks,'' she said gently.

   BUSH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ In an extraordinary retreat
from traditional Republican tenets, Gov. George W. Bush has in
recent weeks advocated an expansion of the federal role on programs
ranging from education to low-income housing to health care. And he
has made overtures to constituencies, like gays and gun-control
proponents, that have never been mainstays of his own party. Yet
what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the nine weeks
since the South Carolina primary, when he presented himself as an
unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal and social
conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about past
nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative

Muti, currently the music director of La Scala Opera in Milan, will

GLADIATORS IN PACIFIC TEAL, OH MY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 23)  
 By MARK LASSWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Hockey League playoffs are in full
swing, and for the third year in a row the New York Rangers aren't
skating. That's OK. The Rangers have already won an important NHL
distinction: most jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   That would be four: one blue and one white, each with
R-A-N-G-E-R-S stepping diagonally down the front, and two
alternatives, white and dark blue, each featuring the face of the
Statue of Liberty. The Liberty jerseys were introduced during the
Rangers' wretched slide following their Stanley Cup victory in
1994, when the team appeared to be concentrating more on sales of
licensed merchandise than on acquiring high-scoring players.
</P>
<P>
   I know something about obsessing over hockey apparel when a
team's on-ice efforts are just too ugly to contemplate. The
adult-league team I play on is so bad that recently I found myself
deceiving my 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   When he earnestly asked, the morning after another
middle-of-the-night loss, how the game had gone, I told him we had
won, 4-2. But my team is past caring about losing. Like the
Rangers, we have decided that if you can't beat 'em, get new
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, outfitting a hockey team with new uniforms might sound
simple. Pick a color. Order 15. Put them on. That formula doesn't
take into account one of the sport's great mysteries. For all their
testosteronic slamming on the ice, hockey players can be finicky
about appearances.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think that the most nonmacho thing about hockey was
the time after a game when the guys clomp into the locker room and
start ripping off their gear _ until that tender moment when they
have to undo the garter belt holding up their hockey socks. It
feels like closing time after a hard night at a bordello.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the great jersey debate. It began when our team
started hating teal. There was a time when teal was the sports
world's color sine qua non.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, I had just joined the team as it moved from the
old Sky Rink on West 33rd Street to the Chelsea Piers. In the ratty
Sky Rink, we wore kelly green practice jerseys, drab synthetic
pullovers with a number silk-screened on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In the gleaming new Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers, we unveiled our
new shirts: the gaudy Pacific teal of the NHL's San Jose Sharks,
roomier and cut from a better class of synthetic, with sewn-on
numbers. Our logo was San Jose's hockey-stick-chomping shark,
flanked by two foamy beer steins, in homage to our sponsor, the
Molly Wee Pub and Restaurant. The beers were drawn free-hand,
possibly by someone wearing hockey gloves.
</P>
<P>
   I doubted the jersey from the beginning. Departing from primary
colors sounded like asking for trouble. To play any sport is to
open yourself up to humiliation. Why invite it with your wardrobe?
The staid NHL was startled when teal-clad San Jose entered the
league in 1991. Yet, sales of the team's licensed merchandise
soared, and lots of amateur squads started wearing teal, even
though the Sharks played like jellyfish. But by 1994, when we
jumped on the bandwagon, fabulous teal was teetering on overness.
</P>
<P>
   I kept my concern to myself, at least for a while. That first
season in teal we made the playoffs, but gradually, our fortunes
soured. Our sponsor dumped us, and who could blame them? The team
used to reflexively stop by the Molly Wee Pub on Eighth Avenue
between 29th and 30th Streets after our games because the old Sky
Rink was practically next door. But after the move downtown,
players quit coming in. We also started losing with frightening
consistency. And that's when the jersey gripes began.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was just good-natured whining. Adopting the Sharks'
look had been the inspiration of our team captain, Charlie. So
before games we knew we were sure to lose, or after games we had
lost, we would grouse, ``Charlie, these jerseys stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a locker-room debate would flare over whether the
offending shade was teal at all. Someone would say, ``These are too
blue, and teal is green.'' Another would argue, ``No, Pacific teal
is kind of blue-green.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a turning point for our uniforms. Molly Wee (we
kept the name because we were stuck with the logo) has been blessed
for the past couple of years by the presence of a goalie, Sean,
whose brilliance in the net regularly turns games that could have
been 15-1 blowouts into 6-1 mini-blowouts. For all the breakaways
and uncontested slap shots that he has endured, he never
complained. Except once. After another numbing loss, Sean plopped
down on a locker-room bench and said, ``I don't mind losing, but I
sure do get sick of watching you guys skating around in those
god-awful jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   That did it. Even Charlie realized the time had come for a
change. But to what? Having played in expensive NHL-style jerseys
(75 bucks apiece!), no one wanted to go back to cheap practice
jerseys. Teal or not, the rink had designated us the ``green''
team, so we had to stick with shades in that family.
</P>
<P>
   We debated the merits of different NHL jerseys as if we were
discussing color swatches. In the locker room, you'd hear,
``Minnesota's getting a new team next year. Maybe the Wild will
wear green like the North Stars used to.'' My son, who closely
follows my team's fortunes despite my disinformation campaign,
suggested ``a shirt with an eagle on it that has a green nose.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of our players, Rob, works in professional sports,
unfortunately not as a left wing with a deadly slap shot but as a
lawyer. When he said he might be able to buy jerseys at a discount,
Charlie became fixated. Could he order black shadows around the
numbers? What about tackle twill? The lettering on nicer jerseys is
made from a shiny cloth called tackle twill. Rob said he'd find
out.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, we were no more capable of agreeing on a jersey than
deciding which player ought to be the shooter on a 3-on-1 break. So
Charlie declared that our new jersey would be the one worn by the
Phoenix Coyotes for away games. Except the Phoenix road jersey
doesn't happen to be green. It's black, with some green detailing,
as Rob pointed out. ``No, it's green,'' Charlie insisted. Black,
green; green, black. The back-and-forthing went on for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   We went online to study photos of the Coyotes. When Charlie saw
the Phoenix jersey on a player at the rink one night, he finally
conceded that those jerseys were pretty darned black. Maybe the
green shoulder patches would satisfy the league organizers? They
did, and that's what we're going to order.
</P>
<P>
   Basic black is usually a safe fashion haven, but I'm having some
misgivings. Countless pro and amateur sports teams have adopted
black in recent years: the Washington Capitals, the Calgary Flames,
The Tampa Bay Lightning. One of the Rangers' jerseys is so dark
blue that it looks black. Is black the new teal?
</P>
<P>
   I called ProJoy Sportswear, a hockey-jersey maker in Guelph,
Ontario. Dave Laughlin, the company's international sales
representative, confirmed that black is THE color in hockey. ``The
craze is kind of fading a little bit,'' he added, chillingly.
</P>
<P>
   What if a team of such startling charisma emerges from this
year's Stanley Cup finals that it ignites a new hockey-jersey fad
to replace black? Well, you can be sure that the Molly Wee Pub team
_ oops, we're the Manhattan Thunderbirds as soon as the new jerseys
arrive _ will change its uniform yet again, probably by the time my
son's old enough to play adult hockey.

IF THERE'S A BUG IN THE ETYMOLOGY, YOU MAY NEVER GET IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month Joe Trela became the third person to win $1 million
on the hit television show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' But
while Trela's final answer was correct, the question itself was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Trela was asked: ``What insect shorted out an early
supercomputer and inspired the term `computer bug?''' His answer: a
moth. And in 1947 a moth did find its way into the innards of the
Mark II, an early computer (then called a ``relay calculator'' and
hardly a ``supercomputer''), shorting it out.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not what inspired the term computer bug. Bug had
been used to refer to mechanical flaws for decades before 1947; in
fact, the IBM engineers who helped set up the Mark II's precursor,
the Mark I, in 1944 had used it with reference to computers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the wayward moth is a particularly stubborn example
of what is known as folk etymology. No matter what historians and
researchers do to snuff it out, the pesky moth tale keeps coming
back. ``This is THE misconception of our time in terms of word
origins,'' said Fred R. Shapiro, a librarian at Yale University and
editor of a new book tentatively titled ``The Yale Dictionary of
Quotations,'' who has been swatting the story on and off for more
than 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the Oxford English Dictionary includes a
reference to an interview with Thomas Edison in an 1889 edition of
the Pall Mall Gazette in which the inventor refers to finding a
``bug'' in his phonograph. The article went on to define the term
as ``an expression for solving a difficulty, and implying that some
imaginary insect has secreted itself inside and is causing all the
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That the moth story has become so well established is largely
due to the efforts of a pioneering computer scientist named Grace
Murray Hopper. Hopper, who died in 1992, was a brilliant
mathematician who helped invent the computer language Cobol and
rose to the rank of rear admiral in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   She worked on both the Mark I and II and for years afterward
liked to tell the story about the day _ Sept. 9, 1947 _ the moth
was pulled out of the machine with tweezers. ``From then on,'' she
told a group of public school administrators in a 1981 speech on
New York's Long Island, ``when anything went wrong with a computer,
we said it had bugs in it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the moth was plucked out of the Mark II, it was taped in a
logbook with the notation, ``First actual case of bug being
found.'' The logbook is now in the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History along with Hopper's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Aldrich Kidwell, curator of mathematics at the museum,
said that the Hopper papers and other documents showed that the
term had been used to describe computer problems by Hopper herself
and others for several years before the moth incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' Kidwell said. ``Dr. Hopper told a
good story.''
</P>
<P>
   So good, in fact, that the producers of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' who say they verify each question with three
sources, were reluctant to admit that they had made a mistake.
(Trela's million-dollar prize was never an issue because he gave
the answer that the show considered correct at the time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a popular belief based on a reality that a moth flew
into an early computer,'' said Michael P. Davies, the show's
executive producer, after being told of the mistake. ``In the world
of the television quiz show, this is not something we would reverse
ourselves on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed with the evidence that the moth incident did not
``inspire'' the term computer bug, Davies said he would look into
the matter and might consider making a correction on the show's Web
site or mentioning it on the air when Trela returns next month for
a special champions round of the game.
</P>
<P>
   His reluctance supports a theory about folk etymology suggested
by Kidwell. ``It is totally impossible to stamp out a false
derivation,'' she said, ``until people stop using the word.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY FORGE, Pa. _ The power for every street light, every
water pump, every computer, every television set, every television
studio _ in short, everything that hums or glows with electricity
for more than 23 million customers from Staten Island, N.Y., to
Ashtabula, Ohio, to the northern tip of Virginia, lay before Joan
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In front of her desk at the power control center here, Clark, a
system operator, surveyed a 20-foot-high wall map of all the
region's power plants, lines and substations. Computer screens
displayed data on transmission, her responsibility on this shift.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat and humidity of last summer, the lights went out in
parts of New York City, New Jersey, Chicago and the south-central
states when peak demand for power overwhelmed the system. Federal
officials and industry experts say it will probably happen again
this year. But Clark and her colleagues at the
Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, the largest control
center on the continent, try not to let the threat weigh on their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a giant video game,'' said Clark, an 11-year
veteran. She has various tools to fight off attackers, she said,
but ``you only have this one guy, and if the one guy dies, you're
done. The lights go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's ``one guy'' is in trouble. The strong American economy
demands ever more power, and the restructuring and partial
deregulation of the power industry mean that ever more of that
power is traded and transmitted between widely separated producers
and users. The strains on the grid are growing rapidly, and the
power system's reserve ratio _ the excess of generating capacity
over peak demand _ has narrowed in some areas to an uncomfortably
tight 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   But the restructuring has also created big disincentives for
anyone in the industry to invest in the grid, build new capacity or
even pay for research on how to transmit power more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these strains, the nation's power supply is becoming
less stable and reliable, even as reliability becomes more
important. Thirty years ago, when the lights flickered for a
moment, hardly anyone noticed. Today, that flicker can crash the
computers upon which the country depends for most everything from
control of complex manufacturing processes to the downloading of
middle-school homework. And no immediate solution is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, is scheduled to begin
a nationwide series of conferences on power issues with meetings in
Hartford, Conn., and Newark, N.J. ``While the demand for
electricity is soaring, the reliability of our electric grid is, at
times, faltering,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much work the grid does is hard to quantify. Total
consumption and production (always equal) can be measured, but not
how many megawatt-hours moved how many miles.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indirect ways to gauge the strains. One is how
many times utilities invoke an emergency procedure called
transmission line relief, or TLR, which freezes new transactions
between power generators and customers for a while when the grid
cannot handle any more volume. In a study last December, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission counted 400 such freezes in
the first 10 months of 1999; in all of 1998 there were only 300.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sign that the grid is often unable to support the main
goal of deregulation: to allow independent generators to compete in
an open marketplace. If the grid cannot handle a shipment from the
cheapest available generator, users must buy from a more expensive
source, while cheaper generating capacity lies idle.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, experts say, is that in most of the
country, transmission-line owners charge flat fees regardless of
distance or demand. So they have no means short of a TLR freeze to
ease the load when the system is straining. Almost alone among the
consortiums that operate regions of the grid,
Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland uses a sliding fee scale for some
transmission, allocating scarce capacity to those willing to pay
most, and seldom resorts to a freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Even if variable pricing were the norm everywhere, transmission
remains regulated, and the earnings of the line owners _ typically
utilities _ are capped at a set percentage of revenue. Variable
pricing cannot add to their profits, and they have little incentive
to invest in more capacity.
</P>
<P>
   And it shows. The construction pace for new transmission lines
fell by more than half from the late 1980s to the early 1990s,
according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility trade
group; experts say it has slowed further since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a market solution to the TLR problem,'' said Philip
Sharp, who spent 14 years as the chairman of a House subcommittee
on energy and power before joining the Harvard faculty in 1995. But
the market is doing nothing to solve capacity shortages, he said:
``That is the one people have to put their attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   The strains can also produce incredible spikes in the wholesale
price of electricity _ from the normal $20 to $30 for a
megawatt-hour up into the thousands. The spikes would not happen if
every area of the country had enough power plants, or if the grid
could always move power to where it was needed. Experts say they
could also be prevented if there was a system to reward more
customers for reducing power use when demand was unusually high,
the way airlines compensate people who volunteer to miss an
overbooked flight.
</P>
<P>
   The other two legs of the three-legged stool of electricity _
generation and distribution _ are faring much better. Entrepreneurs
are building conventional power plants while scientists make steady
advances on alternatives like windmills, fuel cells and solar
arrays. Distribution networks, which deliver power locally from
substations to customers, are using new technology to spot
developing problems and to introduce peak and off-peak billing.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two is the transmission grid _ once securely part of
an integrated industry, now looking increasingly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   In states where electric power has been deregulated _ 24 so far,
plus the District of Columbia _ most utilities were told to choose
between being generators or transmitters and distributors.
Separating the two has left the grid's needs in political limbo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When it was vertically integrated, it was much easier for
policy makers to see need,'' said Charles Gray, the executive
director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissions, whose members are state regulators. Formerly, a
utility went before regulators with a power plant here, customers
there and a clear case for a line in between, he said. Now the
utility would be asking to build lines to carry someone else's
power to someone else's customers, diffusing responsibility and
reducing the impetus for the project.
</P>
<P>
   James Hoecker, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, said some utilities are not eager to add transmission
capacity that would only let new competitors bring power into their
old monopoly territory. The system will not work well, he said,
until specialist transmission companies emerge, drawn by better
incentives. ``There's a need to make this an attractive
enterprise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is the nature of the grid _ more like a
network of canals than of roads. Power doesn't follow a preset
route; it flows along whatever path offers the least resistance.
Even before deregulation, utilities complained of having to handle
power wandering through from one far-off region to another. But new
technology that could ease this problem is languishing in labs.
</P>
<P>
   Little of this was of immediate concern to Clark, whose Friday
afternoon was going pretty well. Demand was running at about 29,000
megawatts, far below last summer's peak of 52,200.
</P>
<P>
   But her boss, Phillip Harris, president and chief executive of
the consortium, sees long-term structural problems in the industry
that promise difficult days ahead. He and others believe that
companies that want to make money in unregulated areas will look to
build power plants where demand is high. But little of that vigor
will spill over into the boring transmission sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a regulated business,'' Harris said, ``the way you improve
the bottom line is to decrease costs'' _ hardly a recipe for
increased investment. And in any case, transmission is a sideline
for the companies that provide it. ``It's typically less than 10
percent of their assets,'' he said. ``It's not going to get most of
the executive-level attention.''

   AVON ANSWERS A KNOCK ON ITS DOOR
</P>
<P>
   Springtime is proxy season, and if history is any guide, a fair
number of the shareholder proposals are raising the issue of the
paucity of women in management ranks and in boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that Avon Products wouldn't need to worry about
such things. After all, the New York-based marketer of lipstick and
other cosmetics has five women on its 11-member board. Moreover,
its chief executive, Andrea Jung, 41, is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   But you would not have taken into account Evelyn Davis, the
shareholder activist. According to Corporate Governance Highlights,
a newsletter published by the Investor Responsibility Research
Center in Washington, Davis notified Avon last November that she
planned to submit a proposal requesting that the company disclose
in its annual report the percentage of men in certain categories of
jobs that are traditionally held by women.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she wants the company to disclose the percentage
of men among Avon's sales representatives, telephone operators,
receptionists and secretaries. Davis said she was concerned that
Avon, which has called itself ``the company for women,'' may be
discriminating against men. ``They are not a private company,'' she
said. ``They are a public company.''
</P>
<P>
   Avon, for its part, saw no reason to do battle with Davis on the
proxy issue. It has agreed to disclose such information beginning
with the 2000 annual report, due early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the fact that women are well represented at all
levels of the company,'' said Brian Martin _ himself the senior
vice president for corporate communications _ who estimated that
more than 95 percent of sales representatives were women. But he
added, ``we have some very good men here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   FUNDS WATCH: DAMAGED FUNDS REOPEN
</P>
<P>
   As the bottom fell out of the Nasdaq market, some fund companies
responded with lightning speed _ not by repositioning their
portfolios or by buying buckets of discounted dot-com shares, but
by reopening funds that had previously been closed to new
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were pretty fast reactions,'' said Russel Kinnel,
director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc., the financial
publisher in Chicago. ``Usually it takes a lot longer for them to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   All the offerings had suffered particularly nasty losses.
</P>
<P>
   The select shares of the Barr Rosenberg U.S. Small
Capitalization fund, which reopened to new shareholders on March
27, lost 15.4 percent from March 10 through April 20. And Putnam
Investments reopened three of its funds on April 18: Capital
Appreciation, whose B shares lost 18.4 percent from March 10
through April 20, and New Century Growth and New Opportunities,
whose A shares lost 33.8 percent and 23.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hankering to get into other long-closed funds, stay
tuned. If the Nasdaq continues to show losses, Kinnel said, more

LOVE STORY BETWEEN MARIA AND CESAR  
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maria Rifo has a portrait of Cesar Chavez on her bookshelf and a
plaque from the United Farmworker's Union on her dining room wall.
She's all for a holiday celebrating the union leader's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Maria worked with in the 1970s when she was already in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Now 93, Maria continues to do what she can for farm workers and
other newcomers to the Latino community in Sonoma County, Calif.,
teaching catechism to children, helping families find housing. She
hopes a holiday named for Chavez, now being considered by the
California legislature, would focus on more than the man and honor
``the pain and effort of the people who put the food on our
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The holiday would grant time off for only a few people _ state
workers and a half day for school children. Ironically, Maria's
farm worker friends would go to work as usual, ``starting at 6 a.m.
and working until sunset, in sun, rain, dust and with pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria serves tea in her small apartment in Santa Rosa, squeezed
next to a fax machine and surrounded by papers and books. She is
one of those people who shows that life, if you dare, never stops
being a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the most important moment,'' she says, sounding just
like the gurus. She once thought her life would go on pretty much
as it had for her first 56 years in her native Chile where she
taught school and lived close to her parents. ``They told me they
didn't know what they'd do if I ever left.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't leave until after they died and then began to see the
world. First Europe, then New York, then at age 57 a career change
to work for Vista in New Mexico. There is where she first heard the
charismatic leader some call the Mexican-American Martin Luther
King speak about fairness and compassion for the workers _ ``people
who belong to the ground,'' she says. Back then they worked without
bathrooms or drinking water, hunched over short hoes, too afraid to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   Maria had seen similar conditions among peasants in her own
country and wanted to know more. She approached Chavez after his
talk and said, ``I want to work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that she shared a house with four others, lived on donated
food, earned $5 a week pay and slowly learned ``you can make a
difference to people.''
</P>
<P>
   She quit after 12 years when she was 72.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways working with Chavez was a transforming experience
which she recounted in a book on women's spiritual discoveries
called ``The Feminine Face of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in my work that I actually began to develop
spiritually. Cesar opened my eyes to what I could do. I was
blooming like a plant. Everybody has a lot of gifts they don't know
about.''
</P>
<P>
   She was smitten first by his voice. ``He spoke so soft and from
the heart. Another's way would be to yell and demand but his was to
speak slowly so that every word sunk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining was more important to him than directing, she says,
and she tries to pass on that skill. ``When you are working with
people you must encourage them to find their own way. You don't say
`do it my way. Yours is wrong.' You never say `don't be silly' or
`that's stupid.'`
</P>
<P>
   She was Chavez' secretary and sometimes they would sit in the
office and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a sponge, always learning.'' They'd argue
semantics. Part of her job was to translate the growers' contracts
into Spanish for the workers. Back then she was a stickler for the
proper grammar and rich vocabulary she was raised with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said why use a plain English word like field when we have
such a beautiful Spanish word as campo. He would say `Maria, are
you working for the farm workers or the Academy of Language?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Cesar helped me to begin to live at 60. He gave me another
life. I changed my total way of seeing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria still does not buy table grapes or head lettuce, boycotted
during contract struggles, and has been known at social events to
gather bottles of wine bearing certain worker unfriendly labels and
pour them down the drain. She sees a Cesar Chavez Day as a kind of
second Thanksgiving, when we celebrate real food _ which is not
genetically altered _ and tended by real people, not machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace a real strawberry with one that is big and
has no sweetness or a tomato that is so changed it feels like a
stone. Nor can you replace a human being with a machine.''
</P>

&HT;     NEW CADILLAC HELPS DRIVERS SEE IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN Antonio _ As the Cadillac DeVille cruised down a dark and
quiet stretch of two-lane road, its headlights didn't pick up the
man just starting to cross the road, right in the vehicle's path.
</P>
<P>
   But the driver knew he was there at least 10 seconds before the
man's face showed in the glare of the low-beam headlights. There
was plenty of time to react.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't an ordinary Cadillac; it was a 2000-model DeVille
with a high-tech innovation born of the military and the Gulf War:
the new night-vision system that General Motors and its partner,
Raytheon Corp., developed for the automotive market.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from its military heritage, made famous during Operation
Desert Storm, night-vision technology now goes consumer in the
world's first application in a production passenger car. Only the
DeVille has it, at least for now, and GM reports that the system
has been so popular with buyers that they can't fill all the orders
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a special camera that mounts in the vehicle's
grill, connected to a computer that processes what it sees and
projects the picture across the bottom of the windshield in front
of the driver.
</P>
<P>
   It can see up to five times farther than the range of the
vehicle's low-beam headlights, giving the driver plenty of time to
react to obstacles in the car's path _ such as a deer crossing a
highway.
</P>
<P>
   The device allows the driver to see stalled vehicles whose
lights are off, people and animals in the road or along the
roadside, and other dangers that lie ahead. It also allows the
driver to see past the glare of oncoming headlights, in itself a
significant safety feature, said Dave Whittaker, vehicle line
executive for Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   On the windshield, the display is about a foot wide and five
inches high, and it is projected low enough to keep it out of the
driver's main line of sight. But the driver can look at the
night-vision projection without taking his eyes off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Offered as an option on the DeVille, the unit costs $2,000,
about the same as a premium stereo system, Cadillac officials
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a usable and affordable night-vision system for
passenger cars will be a great enhancement to automotive safety, GM
and Raytheon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us remember Gen. Schwarzkopf's statement during Desert
Storm that `We own the night,''' said Pat Kemp, Cadillac brand
manager for the DeVille, who demonstrated the night-vision system
to reporters in a touring road show that crossed the country.
``Now, we'll give that option to drivers on America's highways.''
</P>
<P>
   Night driving is the most dangerous kind, highway safety
officials say. Statistics from the National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration show that although only 28 percent of driving
occurs at night, 55 percent of traffic fatalities occur during the
night hours, and 62 percent of pedestrian fatalities occur at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's often related to the lack of adequate vision to avoid
accidents at night,'' Whittaker said.
</P>
<P>
   With a vehicle traveling at 60 mph, a driver has about 3.5
seconds to react when a hazard comes within the range of the
average low-beam headlights, he said. ``With night vision, that
reaction time is increased to 17 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Night vision systems should help reduce the number of vehicle
collisions with deer, too, he said. More than 300,000 car-deer
collisions are recorded each year, and in many of those vehicles
are heavily damaged and the occupants seriously injured, Whittaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how effective night vision systems will be in reducing
accidents remains to be seen, officials of the highway safety
administration say.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all of us agree it looks good,'' said Kenneth Copeland of
the agency's office in Fort Worth, Texas. ``I have seen it
demonstrated on television, but I really don't know much about it
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of night vision on other cars won't be prevalent for
some time, however, because Cadillac has exclusive rights to use
the Raytheon system on the DeVille for at least the entire 2000
model year, and maybe even a year or two beyond that, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, GM probably will begin offering the system on some
of its other vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers are working to develop their own night-vision
systems, but they are two to three years away from bringing the
technology to market, according to industry reports.

 SOUTHERN PARTY STRUGGLES TO ASSERT ITSELF   
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Almost one year after
proudly introducing itself to voters, the Southern Party is
struggling for relevance and respect in American politics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striving to attract more followers and money, the party, which
advocates an independent Southern nation, is planning a late June
convention in Charleston, S.C., following last summer's kickoff in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Baxley, national chairman of the Southern Party, conceded
his party has not been particularly visible this past year and that
internal divisions have stymied growth at times. In fact, the Texas
businessman who served as the original chairman of the party is
already out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   But Baxley, a Virginia resident, said the party has been busy
organizing itself and drafting a constitution. He insisted the
group would ``be there for the duration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been in the news much,'' Baxley said. ``But we're
starting up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Party captured some headlines last August with a
colorful rally in Flat Rock, N.C., attended by approximately 140
white Southern nationalists. Most political analysts quickly
dismissed it as a fringe group. Party leaders have done little
since last summer to dispel that notion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the group has yet to pick up the interest or apparent
respect of any established political leaders. None of the
presidential candidates, for example, made even a token effort to
appeal to Southern Party members during their primary swings
through the South this past winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   Baxley said his party is not interested in appealing to
candidates for national office, but will focus on state and local
races. So far, the party is registered in just two states _ Florida
and Louisiana _ but has formed political action committees in other
Southern states. Baxley said the party has roughly 2,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ALIENS, NOT ELIAN
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it's politicians from border states who worry most
about the problem of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama believes his state has an
illegal immigration problem too, and he wants the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to crack down on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the case of one illegal alien who in March was charged
with the rape of a woman in Gulf Shores, Sessions wrote
Commissioner Doris Meissner that illegal immigrants ``have
committed a number of crimes'' in his state. He did not say how
many, but said local law enforcement agencies have contacted him
about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions called on Meissner to address the ``crime problem
caused by illegal aliens'' by assigning more special agents to
Alabama. There are 2,088 special agents for the INS nationwide, but
only one in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS INDIFFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   Southern states brought up the rear when the 2000 Census roll
was called, with South Carolina, Louisiana and Alabama failing to
crack the 60 percent return rate. At 56 percent response, South
Carolina beat only Alaska in participating in the decennial count.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, at 69 percent was the only Southern state to top or
reach the national response rate of 65 percent. Many even fell
short of their 1990 response though the country as a whole equaled
the previous count. Census officials anticipated a mail return of
61 percent before the door-to-door counters were dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   The South has stood out like a sore thumb for its lackadaisical
approach to the census, with officials speculating that its
minority population and historic antipathy to the federal
government played a role. The chickens may come home to roost
later, however. Federal dollars are parceled out on the basis of
the census and Southern states may find that the relatively poor
response will leave them, well, poorer.
</P>
<P>
   FOUNDING FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Comedians joke that Sen. Strom Thurmond, the oldest lawmaker to
serve in Congress, was around to sign the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, he wasn't. But Thurmond, 97, was in the Senate
in 1966 when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its legendary Miranda
ruling, mandating that police must tell suspects of their right to
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Thurmond helped write a federal law to allow
the use of voluntary confessions as evidence even when suspects
have not been read their rights. That federal law, which has long
been ignored, is now part of a case recently argued before the
Supreme Court that re-examines the Miranda ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond sat in on the proceedings. Afterwards, he chided the
Clinton administration for not enforcing the 1968 law. He called
his dealings with the Justice Department ``one extensive exercise
in frustration.''
</P>

STATE CASTOFFS GOING, GOING, GONE ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 23) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year and a half, Massachusetts officials tried and failed
to dispose of a 128-foot lightship, the Nantucket I, most recently
used as a floating museum. ``This was something we couldn't give
away,'' said Paul Guerino, coordinator of the state's surplus
property.
</P>
<P>
   So the state tried one more tack. It posted the lightship on
eBay, the online auction site more commonly used by consumers
emptying their attics of unwanted wedding gifts or Beanie Baby
collections.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the auction was over a few weeks ago, bidding on the
Nantucket I had reached $126,100, and the winning buyers, a former
state senator and his wife, were making plans to have the historic
boat refitted and moved to Boston Harbor, to be used as office
space.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other state governments have discovered what
Massachusetts did with its lightship: that surplus property fetches
a whole lot more online, where a world of enthusiastic amateurs are
ready to bid, than it does through traditional channels, which
rarely attract buyers beyond a small core of gimlet-eyed
professional bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Governments often have a lot of stuff to get rid of _ old office
equipment, overstocked supplies, abandoned property, items seized
from criminals or tax delinquents _ and are generally required by
law to offer it publicly to the highest bidder. Traditional
auctions tend to be lightly publicized, inconvenient and a bit
intimidating for ordinary people, so pennies-on-the-dollar prices
have long been the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of online auctions is changing all that,
commonly doubling and tripling the amounts that states receive for
auctioned property. ``I actually thought it was a brilliant
strategy,'' said the new co-owner of the Nantucket I, William
Golden.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure which state thought of it first, but Oregon is
considered a leader in online sales. The state, whose eBay identity
is oregontrail2000, started a year ago with one item, an engraved
commemorative Snap-On Tools socket set from the Portland Police
Department. Late last week, it had 70 single items or lots posted
for sale on eBay, including a seized 12.41-carat black opal, an
Everett &AMP; Jennings wheelchair, a ``bucket of miscellaneous tools''
and two pairs of women's Easy Spirit tennis shoes, size 7{.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do an auction, you've got 400 people in a room for
five hours in a single day,'' said Skip Morton, property
distribution center manager for Oregon's Department of
Administrative Services. ``With eBay, you're dealing with people 24
hours a day, seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials have been so pleased with the online results
that they have installed public computer terminals in a state
warehouse to allow any resident to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see electronic commerce, electronic marketing as the way
things are going to be in five years, 10 years most certainly,''
Morton said. ``We'd rather be in the forefront than eating dust in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 states are now active on eBay, according to Don Coy,
the eBay business manager _ and the federal government is working
on its own auction site for public property, which will eventually
be invited to join.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, states are climbing up the learning curve on
commercial sites like eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign that the lines between the government and private
sector are blurring,'' said Pete Williams, surplus property program
manager in the California Department of General Services, which
sells on eBay under the ID californiagold2000.
</P>
<P>
   The states are selective about what they post online; they find
that smaller, more valuable goods that can be shipped easily tend
to do best. An Olympus 35-millimeter camera that might have sold
for $25 in a warehouse auction fetched $91 online two weeks ago,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a state official will post something more
unwieldy, like a 1994 Chevrolet Camaro Z28, equipped for police
use, offered by Oregon last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one this afternoon; he had a Lear jet he was
possibly going to put on the site,'' said Coy of eBay. ``It didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerino of Massachusetts said that for some items, it was
difficult to find the appropriate product category. For the
lightship, he had to settle for sporting goods, because that was
where boats were listed.
</P>
<P>
   States like the prices they get from online buyers, but some
buyers also see an advantage in Internet auctions of government
property: officials don't always know what they have.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Heath of Las Vegas won the bidding for an old wooden
file cabinet from Oregon, paying $210 plus $127 for shipping. Only
after it arrived did she discover that it was actually a
sought-after Globe Wernicke cabinet from 1938. ``They could have
gotten probably five times what I paid for it,'' she said.

 &HT;    Cultural differences create legal problems
 &HT;    By Milo Ippolito
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Young Lee was arrested for beating her
stepdaughter black and blue with a cane, she said that's how Korean
families discipline their children.
</P>
<P>
   But a Gwinnett County jury decided last week that Lee was the
one who needed to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   The caning case was the latest clash of cultures to reach a
metro Atlanta courtroom. As tens of thousands of immigrants have
moved into metro Atlanta in the past decade, sometimes traditional
child-rearing methods, health remedies and marital roles have run
afoul of American law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an acute lack of awareness about cultural practices
that gets people in trouble,'' Julia Perilla, an advocate with the
Latino Families at Risk Project, which works to prevent domestic
violence among Hispanics. That lack of awareness applies to both
sides _ immigrants and the American legal system, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the caning case, Lee testified that she beat her teenage
stepdaughter, who has cerebral palsy, for wearing loose blouses and
torn jeans to school. Tried for child cruelty, part of Lee's
defense was that caning is a traditional discipline practiced by
conservative Koreans. Three Korean church pastors testified that
they saw nothing wrong with the beating. However, after viewing
photos of the dark bruises and red stripes covering the teen's
body, a jury convicted Lee. She faces five to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The stepmother took the traditional punishment to an extreme,
said Korean-born Gwinnett police officer Christopher In, who
assisted in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Korean culture, it is beyond reasonable,'' In said.
Still, In recalled being smacked on the hands and legs with a stick
by schoolteachers when he grew up in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia law gives parents the right to use reasonable
corporal punishment to discipline a child, many immigrants have
difficulty understanding the legal limits, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett Magistrate Judge Chung Lee said tensions can run high
in homes where parents insist on holding onto traditions while
their kids just want to be American teenagers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korean parents have to come to the United States and learn
American culture,'' he said. ``At the same time, Korean kids have
to learn about Korean culture and understand why the parents think
that way, and find a neutral ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cultural practices with no violent intent can be
perceived as child abuse. Such is the case with a Vietnamese home
remedy for chills and body aches. A coin or spoon is used to scrape
the skin to bring the bad blood to the surface, explained Binh Le,
an interpreter in Gwinnett County courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tradition handed down from generations,'' Le said. ``A
lot of the doctors who have never seen that, they freak out,
because it does look like whip marks.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem that several immigrant groups are trying to control is
domestic violence. Advocates from Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern,
African and Eastern European backgrounds have formed Atlanta
organizations to counsel and shelter battered women. Many of their
home countries have domestic violence laws, which are sometimes
ignored because of traditional gender roles, said Julia Perilla of
Latino Families at Risk Project.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences have the potential to end in an immigrant's
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal law requires the deportation of legal immigrants
sentenced to at least one year in jail or on probation. The goal
was to kick out immigrants convicted of crimes of drugs and
violence, but in metro Atlanta the law has led to deportation
proceedings against an Ethiopian who stole a sandwich and a
Nigerian who swiped two boxes of doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem is a simple neighborly dispute _ with a
cultural twist. In several metro Atlanta communities, immigrants
have been accused of animal cruelty by neighbors who saw them
slaughter livestock in their yards.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a Hispanic family tied a goat to a neighbor's fence
in Smyrna. The neighbor called the police. Officers told the
Hispanic family that they were not allowed to have livestock in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They resolved the problem by killing the goat,'' said Smyrna
police officer Tony Leonard. ``They invited me to have a piece.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar dispute erupted in Suwanee in 1998 when a couple tried
to barbecue a goat in a subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That usually tends to end up registering complaints from
neighbors,'' Gwinnett Planning and Zoning Director Mike Williams
said. ``They just don't know. Once they're informed they're usually
pretty cooperative about correcting the problems. Most of the
immigrant population wants to follow the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution writers Mark Bixler, Christopher
Quinn, Bill Montgomery and Ralph Ellis contributed to this story.

A PEEK AT THE FUTURE IN FILM TITLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (with sidebar, GREAT-FILM-TITLES)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new branch of history _ or is it merely a twig? _ has
sprouted: the history of film titles. In case you are someone who
talks through movie previews and credits, film titles generally
appear after the film quiz, after the dancing hot dogs and popcorn,
after the on-screen hushing and before the movie proper has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Film titles have certain responsibilities. They must display the
movie's title and the name of the director, establish the hierarchy
of actors and ease the audience into the movie. Some title
sequences, however, have outgrown their workaday functions. Because
they are physically and historically ``on the periphery of films,''
said David Peters, a graphic designer who studies title sequences,
they have often been more experimental, a peek into the future of
filmmaking. The best of them are movies within movies, with a
rhythm and mood of their own.
</P>
<P>
   If you compare a movie to a dream, said Ken Coupland, a design
writer, then ``the first few minutes of a film can be compared to
the curious stage of consciousness that marks the transition
between wakefulness and sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Now designers and design historians are looking back on the
history of film titles and even creating a canon of film title
classics. A new book, ``Type in Motion'' (Rizzoli, 1999), suggests
that film-title design is the mother of all moving typography _ now
the stuff of music and art videos. This month the Film Society of
Lincoln Center in New York even presented a weekend-long program of
film titles, organized by Wendy Keys of the Film Society with
Coupland and Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is champing at the bit for a history of titles.
``In cinema studies,'' said Annette Michelson, a film scholar at
New York University, ``people are always casting about for
previously unexplored areas of film. Someday, somebody will write a
dissertation on the popcorn stand in the movie lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the history of title design, a branch of graphic
design studies, is taking shape. Title designers can tell you who
among them introduced multiple screens, quick cuts, atonality,
jazz, government stock photographs and grunge design to the title
sequences of movies. And they have their own private pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   Their uncontested Zeus is Saul Bass, who designed the title
sequences for ``The Man With the Golden Arm,'' ``Vertigo,''
``Psycho,'' ``Walk on the Wild Side,'' and the end title for
``Around the World in 80 Days,'' which is a reprise of the whole
movie in eight minutes. Then there are the other gods: Pablo Ferro
(``Dr. Strangelove''), Wayne Fitzgerald (``Bonnie and Clyde''),
Friz Freleng (``The Pink Panther''), Stephen Frankfurt (``To Kill a
Mockingbird''), Maurice Binder (``Dr. No''), Richard Greenberg
(``The World According to Garp''), Juan Gatti (``Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown'') and Kyle Cooper (``Seven'').
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there were no film title sequences. The
earliest titles, for silent films, were presented on title cards _
cards with printed material on them that were photographed and
incorporated into the film. The cards gave the dialogue and set the
time, place and action of the scenes. They also issued polite
commands to the audience, like ``Would the ladies please remove
their hats?''
</P>
<P>
   As decades passed, titles got frillier. They were displayed on
silk, satin or wallpaper or on boxes that opened and on calendars
whose pages blew away one by one. There were some exceptions to the
rule _ notably, Peters said, the title for ``Double Indemnity,''
which featured the silhouette of a man on crutches, and the neon
credits that flashed on the skyscrapers in the opening of ``My Man
Godfrey.'' But fundamentally titles didn't change.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Saul Bass. Bass' title for Otto Preminger's 1955 movie
about drug addiction, ``The Man With the Golden Arm,'' broke the
mold. It was the first to use a jazz score, and it was graphically
gripping. Slim white bars on a black background jostle the actors'
names before twisting into a jagged arm. The arm, which Martin
Scorsese called ``a malignant force reaching down into the world
and the lives of the characters,'' became the center of the movie's
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 Bass teamed up with Hitchcock for ``Vertigo'' and again
broke new ground. To atonal music he foreshadowed the movie with
graphic puns and symbols. As Peters and Coupland observed, Bass'
close-up of a woman's face was a prelude to the movie's voyeurism;
his splashing the letters of James Stewart's name above her lips
formed a symbolic mustache (suggesting that he was an accessory to
the woman's crime); and a spinning spiral in the iris of her eye
was a preamble to the vertigo to come.
</P>
<P>
   Title designs took off in the late 1950s, but the second ``title
wave'' did not begin, Hall notes, until Stephen Frankfurt created
the opener for ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' in 1962. Frankfurt's
haunting sequence, accompanied by a flute, a piano and a child
humming, was the first ``opener in which a camera lovingly pans
across details,'' like scissors, crayons, dolls and pens _ small,
precious objects that, Hall writes, ``grow in significance later in
the film.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high renaissance of film titles was in the 1960s. As legend
has it, in 1962 Maurice Binder thought up the famous title for
``Dr. No'' in the 15 minutes before he met with the producers. In
the sequence, the audience looks down the barrel of a gun and then
sees Bond cross the screen, point his gun and shoot at them,
leaving a trickle of blood behind. This became the logo for years
of 007 movies. But it was Robert Brownjohn who carried the Bond
allure one step further in ``Goldfinger'' by projecting film from
the movie onto a nude woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   One other 1960s title became a logo for a series. In 1963 Blake
Edwards asked Friz Freleng of Bugs Bunny fame to make the titles
for ``The Pink Panther.'' The result is forever bonded to the
movie: a cartoon panther, prowling to Henry Mancini's score,
constantly inserts himself into the credits.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most subversive development in film title sequences
was the opening for Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film ``Dr.
Strangelove.'' According to Pablo Ferro, the designer, the U.S. Air
Force was so proud of its B-52s' in-flight refueling capabilities
that it had plenty of stock photographs of them. Little did the
military know that in Ferro's hands, the B-52s tethered to their
refueling ships, bouncing lightly up and down and paired with the
song ``Try a Little Tenderness,'' would come out as a comic sex
scene.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s the tiny design revolution was over. The recession
meant shrinking opportunities and a shrinking screen. As movies
were put on television, titles were squeezed and simplified so they
could fit on the screen and be used as labels for tie-in toys.
</P>
<P>
   Title collectors reverted to old tricks. When Dan Perri did the
titles for ``Star Wars,'' he created ``the Star Wars crawl'': a
typed message to the universe that rolls backward toward a
vanishing point. But that high-tech classic came from an old
western in which the credits rolled into the distance like railroad
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology revived the art of title design in the
1980s. As Steve Heller notes in ``Design Literacy (Continued)''
(Allworth, 1999), in 1982 ``Richard Greenberg landed in the annals
of design history'' by creating an airborne infant for the opening
of ``The World According to Garp'' with the aid of a programmable
camera.
</P>
<P>
   The latest trend, Hall writes, is grunge title design, the
descendant of the distressed typography of print graphics. And the
king of grunge is Greenberg's former associate, Kyle Cooper, whose
best known title is for ``Seven.'' Cooper used the tabletop shoot
pioneered in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' But emotionally the two
sequences are worlds apart. Cooper said that his fetishistic survey
was a view of a serial killer assembling a diary ``documenting the
murders he'll execute during the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The degraded typography, jittery jump cutting and ``twitching,
hand-hewn type'' ushered in a new era in film titles, Hall writes.
And it had a democratizing effect. Everyone with a computer began
thinking, hey, maybe I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   That could explain why title designers are now writing their
history. With desktop filmmaking on the horizon, the very notion of
auteur title designers seems quaint. The writing of history begins
when an era is ending.

MOSCOW HINTS AT PEACE TALKS WITH CHECHEN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a sign that Russia is looking for a political
solution to its war in Chechnya, President-elect Vladimir Putin
acknowledged Friday for the first time that Moscow had exchanged
peace plans with the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking to reporters, said he still regards Maskhadov as
a ``criminal'' but one who could be pardoned. And he indicated that
his government is ready to talk with a man who seven months ago, at
the start of the second Chechen war, it considered politically
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A glimmer of a political opening also came from the other side
Friday, as Maskhadov, in an interview published in the newspaper
Kommersant, said he had ordered Chechen guerrillas ``to suspend
combat operations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was part of the plan on a peaceful settlement I suggested
to Moscow,'' said Maskhadov, who said he maintains full control
over Chechnya's field commanders _ the rival war lords who are the
real rulers of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which had initially been very popular with the Russian
public and gave Putin his first political boost, has begun to prove
costly to the Kremlin financially, diplomatically and also
politically, as the number of Russian casualties this month topped
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, 20 Russian regional leaders spoke out in favor
of talks with Maskhadov, whom they referred to as the ``legitimate
president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1997 after Russia's first devastating war in
Chechnya, Maskhadov was a moderate secessionist who continued to
negotiate with Moscow over the terms of future independence. But
his control over the region, never very firm, slipped as warlords,
criminal gangs and Muslim militants took charge, turning Chechnya
into a virtual no-man's land avoided by Russians and foreigners,
journalists and aid workers who feared being robbed and kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, with Putin already leading the war effort, Moscow
effectively cut its last links to Maskhadov when he refused to
condemn Shamil Basayev and Khattab, two guerrilla leaders who
brandish a radical form of Islam, for raids last August into the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview published Friday, Maskhadov said he had
criticized the actions in Dagestan as ``a provocation against the
Chechen people.'' He also said he had ordered the release of all
hostages held by kidnappers on Chechen territory, which has long
been one of Moscow's conditions for the opening of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There have been hints in the past that Moscow has secretly
stayed in contact with Maskhadov through Ruslan Aushev, the
president of Ingushetia, who has acted as an intermediary. But
Putin has never spoken directly about such contacts until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In their respective comments, Putin and Maskhadov revealed the
gulf that still separates them, with Putin contemptuously
dismissing the Chechen leader as a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decides nothing and will never decide anything,'' Putin
said. ``He is being used to carry out tactical tasks, but those who
are using him will soon realize that he cannot do this, and their
attitude toward him will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov complained that his overtures to Moscow had gone
unanswered. But Putin said Maskhadov had let the exchange lapse
into silence. Putin stressed that Russia has other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to believe that we do have others we can
deal with apart from Maskhadov and the bandits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov applauded harsh criticisms by the Council of Europe of
Russia's conduct of the war, and called for observers from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to take part in
a peace settlement. Russia has consistently refused offers to
mediate the conflict, although this week it again opened the way
for European observers to travel to Chechnya.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether or not the dialogue between Moscow and Maskhadov
resumes, there seems to be new willingness on both sides to look
ahead to a peace settlement, even as military operations continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities this week began to allow residents back
into Grozny, the Chechen capital, which was reduced to dust and
rubble last winter as Russian troops fought to seize it. Now that
the Russian presidential campaign is over, pressure for military
success has eased even as the prospects for a long, drawn-out
partisan war increase.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the war has also begun to weigh on Russian
diplomacy. With a new president at the helm, the government is now
looking to deal with other issues, from arms control to foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential election was held on the crest of domestic
support for the Chechen campaign,'' the newspaper Izvestia wrote on
Thursday. ``Now is the time to think about the future of relations
with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the intransigence on both sides, it is difficult to
predict how peace talks might begin and where they might lead.
Hard-liners in Moscow object to any negotiations with Maskhadov.
They fear such talks would reproduce the false peace that lasted
between the two Chechen wars and also undercut the Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the army's point of view, talks with Maskhadov would be
seen only negatively _ but very negatively,'' said Vladimir
Grigoryev, the leader of a St. Petersburg veterans group.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Russian-held areas of Chechnya are being run
both by the Russian military and by Nikolai Koshman, a deputy prime
minister who is Moscow's chief administrator in the region. With
fighting continuing in scattered districts, not even the division
between Russian military and civilian authority, let alone the role
of Chechen politicians and administrators, has been determined.
</P>
<P>
   As some analysts point out, the main question is about the
future of a region administered by the same forces _ military and
political _ that organized its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not who should hold talks, and the problem is
not about legitimacy,'' said Boris Kagarlitsky, a Russian
historian, in a recent interview published on Vesti.ru, a Russian
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is what the talks should be about _ the subject
and goals of the talks,'' he said. ``Not with whom, but about what
_ that is the question.''

 &HT;    Pilot training crunch clips ASA's wings
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fast-growing Atlantic Southeast Airlines has had to
trim flight schedules slightly because pilot hiring and training
isn't keeping pace.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based ASA, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, this month
cut one frequency per day to 14 of its 69 destinations, spokesman
Sam Watts said. Though the schedule effect is minor, the move
reflects the feverish pace of pilot hiring in recent years as air
travel grows and Vietnam-era pilots retire.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines hired 15,747 pilots last year, the fifth straight
annual record, according to Air Inc., an Atlanta career counseling
firm. Demand is most acute at regional airlines such as ASA. They
not only need new pilots to fuel their own growth but also to
replace experienced ones being hired by major airlines losing
veteran pilots to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said the problem for ASA hasn't been a shortage of
qualified applicants. ``I wouldn't characterize it as a hiring
problem, but more of a training issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ASA is adding new Canadair Regional Jets at a rapid rate, which
means many turboprop pilots are being retrained on jets. That, in
turn, adds to demand for new turboprop pilots, who also must get
initial airline training. The training pipeline hasn't kept pace,
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Kit Darby of Air Inc. said the problem isn't unique to ASA. Some
smaller carriers have reduced hiring standards to widen the
applicant pool, although the average experience level of newly
hired airline pilots remains far above government minimums, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said ASA's schedule cuts are a minor, temporary step. He
cited as examples the Atlanta-Gulfport and Atlanta-Roanoke routes,
where daily flights have been cut from nine to eight. The flights
cut were flown by turboprops.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said so far the problem hasn't slowed the carrier's
deployment of jets.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which hired 225 pilots last year and projects
hiring 400 this year, is expanding its training capacity under a
contract with FlightSafety Inc., Watts added.
</P>
<P>
   ASA, which feeds Delta's hubs in Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth,
employs about 1,000 pilots, up from 825 a year or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market is forcing airlines to work harder to
fill other jobs as well. AirTran Airways is in talks with several
Atlanta-area school systems and colleges about programs to hire
students as ticket, reservations and ramp agents, hoping they'll
make it a career.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, meanwhile, has a program with high schools and technical
institutes in Atlanta and three other cities to encourage students
to become aircraft mechanics, who also are in increasingly high
demand.

&HT;     NEW SYPDER IS VERY IMPRESSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder,
and there are people who don't much care for the looks of the new
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count me among them, though. I think it's stunningly
beautiful, almost too gorgeous to be a Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   It looks more like a European luxury sports car to me, and if
that's a bad thing, I can't figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   As near as I can tell, the people who dislike the Eclipse's new
look are mostly owners of the previous generation, and to me that's
normal when a car or anything else, for that matter, is
significantly changed. People are resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the new Spyder looks more expensive than it is, and
there is a good reason for that. Mitsubishi has discontinued its
flagship 3000GT sports car, which sold for well over $30,000, but
has redesigned the Spyder to look something like the 3000GT. That
means consumers can buy an exciting, great-looking,
high-performance sports car for about $25,000-$28,000, and find
that it is comparable with other cars on the market selling for
$15,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda should take a cue from this and come out with a new RX 7
that is as affordable as the Eclipse Spyder. Mazda made a mistake
in taking the RX 7 upscale a few years ago, nearly doubling the
price and leaving a large body of loyal owners behind.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eclipse Spyder doesn't come with a rotary engine,
one of the big draws of the RX 7, the GT model offers a 3.0-liter
V-6 with 200 horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque. It might not
be as smooth an a rotary engine, and it might not offer the quick
rush that came from the previous Eclipse's turbocharged
four-cylinder engine (which has been discontinued), but it's mighty
fast and fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the styling, I was most impressed by the Spyder's
handling. This is a car that puts performance on par with styling,
something that you don't often see in an affordable sports car. The
previous-generation Spyder handled well enough, but not like this.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new Spyder's greatest attributes is its structural
rigidity, which enhances its road handling and driveability.
Somehow, Mitsubishi's engineers and their high-tech design
computers have eliminated the body flex that was noticeable in the
previous model. For those who care, the engineers say ``bending
rigidity'' has been improved by 65 percent over the prior model,
helped in part by a network of lower-body reinforcements that form
a boxed, rolled and corrugated steel perimeter around the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the body of a convertible rigid is quite a challenge.
Just think about it: The only part of the car that continues
uninterrupted from bumper to bumper is the floor. The top comes off
and the two doors open, so there is no continuity of the structure
there. My compliments go to the engineers for such a great job.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible top operates seamlessly. Just pop the two
catches on the top of the windshield and push a button and two
electric motors lower the top quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There are two models of the Spyder convertible. The base GS
version (starting at $23,347 plus $495 transportation) comes with a
2.4-liter, single-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine rated at 147
horsepower and 158 foot-pounds of torque. Standard is a five-speed
manual transmission; a four-speed automatic that allows for
clutchless manual shifting adds $1,000 to the sticker.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was the uplevel GT model, listing for $25,237 (plus
transportation) for the manual-gearbox version. Again, the
automatic costs $1,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   The one we got came with the manual transmission, which is more
fun in a car of this type. The manual lets the driver get a real
feel for the road and the engine. Unfortunately, no all-wheel-drive
version of the GT is available this year. The car comes with
front-wheel drive, which is not quite as much fun in a sports car
as rear-wheel or all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The list of standard equipment for our test car was long and
impressive. It included dual air bags, 5 mph front and rear
bumpers, variable-assist power rack-and-pinion steering,
sport-tuned four-wheel independent suspension, stainless-steel
exhaust, air-conditioning, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
210-watt premium AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with seven speakers,
10-way adjustable driver's seat, tilt steering wheel, remote
keyless entry, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel,
17-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, halogen headlights and fog lights,
rear spoiler and power front-disc/rear-drum brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Our vehicle came with the GT premium package ($2,370), the only
option, which added antilock brakes, four-disc in-dash CD player,
leather front seats, power driver's seat, and side air bags for the
front seat occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $28,102, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Seating up front was comfortable, but there isn't much leg room
in the rear even though that has been increased an inch over last
year's model, and the back seat really isn't intended to hold
adults. Fuel economy isn't bad for a car with this much zip. EPA
ratings are 20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the
highway. The tank holds 16.4 gallons of gasoline.

in our politics, they say. ``It is the rules of etiquette that
enable people to air controversy,'' Judith Martin, aka ``Miss
Manners,'' told a Washington forum this week. ``The bigger the
controversy the more rules you need.'' Meanwhile, an interfaith
group has drawn up a list of ``thou shalt nots'' and persuaded a
couple of dozen candidates to sign it. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   ALAMIN-HEARING _ MONTGOMERY, Ala, _ Al-Amin changed his mind and
waived extradition after the lunch break today. He is now on his
way back to Atlanta, probably to the ATlanta city jail's federal
wing. The cops won't say for sure. ``THere is a plan but it is
cloaked in a veil of secrecy,'' said Capt. Chadd of the Fulton
Sheriff's Department. Attorney J.L. Chestnut said this afternoon
that he doesn't think Al-Amin's life is in danger in Atlanta any
longer. But he wouldn't say what had changed. Before the lunch
break, Al-Amin read statement praising Allah. (Whitt, Atlanta

BROWSING FOR THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If timing is everything, what are we to make of the initial
release of Netscape 6, the long-awaited update to what used to be
the world's most important browser on the World Wide Web?
</P>
<P>
   The software, released with much hoopla by AOL CEO Steve Case at
the recent Spring Internet World conference in Los Angeles, came
out two days after a federal judge ruled that Microsoft had engaged
in illegal anti-competitive behavior against a little, formerly
independent company called ... Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, even if purposeful on AOL's part, is somewhat
ironic, mostly because it really doesn't matter much anymore: The
battle over browsers is largely finished.
</P>
<P>
   Where once, an independent Netscape provided the path to the
Internet for most people who knew what the Internet was, now its
newest version, from a smallish division of AOL's burgeoning
empire, is almost a curio, an anachronism, though a nicely done
one.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how fast a company can get old when it's living on
Internet time, even a pioneer like Netscape. And maybe that helps
explain why Bill Gates and the rest of Microsoft have always been
so nervous about the next upstart to come knock off a dominant
market leader, and why they've been so aggressive in making sure
those upstarts never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape release, by the way, is only an initial ``beta''
version of the renamed, once renowned browser and comes with some
things to recommend it: a !ital!much simpler interface of only a
few buttons; fairly impressive language translation capabilities; a
decidedly slimmed-down size.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with a nifty little ``My Sidebar'' feature that
helps you organize your bookmarks and other functions in a side
window that can be opened and closed easily.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape 6 still isn't faster than Internet Explorer and it
doesn't come as part of every computer sold, unlike its competitor.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be surprised, given Microsoft's past history of
modifying ``standards'' with custom code additions that run only on
its software, if many Web pages won't look quite right on Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   As for My Sidebar, a series of companies at Internet World
showed little programs, generally free, that provided many of the
same capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, so too does Earthlink's new version 5.0 of the
custom Net software package it gives to all its Internet service
customers. The moderately nifty Sidebar feature is a collapsible
window that can manage your favorites, link you to search sites and
more.
</P>
<P>
   AOL promises more improvements before Netscape 6's final
release. The product is a nice one, and users will like it. But
what's on display now is unlikely to be so compelling that droves
of people will switch from the browser that comes with their
computer. And that happens to be Internet Explorer. &QL;

!tag!l &QC; 
14!tag!Aside from AOL's big Netscape announcement, there weren't
tons of companies and sites at the huge Spring Internet World show
of interest to just regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an entire hall of the convention center was taken over
by a companion show focused on electronic ways to manage customer
relations, the very definition of things regular people don't care
about.
</P>
<P>
   I won't bore you with details, but increasingly, when you have a
complaint about a product, you'll be shuttled to some online help
center with chat, e-mail and other functions designed to help fix
your headache. No word, of course, about what you do when it's your
phone line or computer that isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable show-stopper I saw was Data Play, a very hip
little storage medium for every possible kind of electronic
entertainment device, from MP-3 players to computers to video and
still cameras to hand-held gaming machines.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically a postage-stamp-sized, 500-megabyte WORM drive
weighing perhaps an ounce, and about an inch square on a side. For
you folks lacking a technology dictionary, WORM stands for Write
Once, Read Many (times), and it's basically what you do with a
recordable CD drive, copy something to it and then repeatedly use,
but never change that file. Only in this case, the drive is little
bigger than the !ital!hole in the center of a CD-R.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Data Play's biggest problem may be that it's too
!ital!small. Retailers will have nightmares about theft prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But its size, capacity, low power usage, archival longevity and
likely price make it an extremely attractive alternative to all the
other compact storage media out on the market now _ like SanDisk,
Compact Flash and Memory Stick _ that are being used in an
increasing number of devices to move around digital photos, video,
music and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Data Play officials said one probable use will be to prerecord
music or books onto the disks, leaving room for either encrypted
versions of older works by the artist, or blank space so the buyer
can add related material like the band's photos and Web downloads.
</P>
<P>
   And the medium's small size and high capacity could
revolutionize the hand-held gaming market with a powerful new
generation of GameBoy-like devices.
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking execs with Toshiba and Universal Music Group gave
warm, but limited endorsements to Data Play at the introductory
press conference. Other electronics manufacturers are supposed to
debut their own Data Play-enabled devices at next winter's Consumer
Electronics Show, Data Play officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, put this technology under the Cool but
Unproven category. When all these devices roll out, then we'll see
whether this one is a keeper. &QL;

Take a gander at the finalists for top honors in next month's
Interactive Achievement Awards, overseen by the Academy of
Interactive Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The awards spotlight the best of the 1,900 or so titles released
last year by the $6 billion industry. Nominees for Game of the Year
are:
</P>
<P>
   Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (on PC; a particular
favorite of mine); Donkey Kong 64 (Nintendo 64; the big ape
continues to throw his weight around); Pokemon Yellow (Game Boy; a
nominee though it differs little from its powerhouse Red and Blue
predecessors); Soul Calibur (Dreamcast; the best-looking console
fighter title ever); The Sims (PC; a complex, involving simulation
of, well, you and me); and Unreal Tournament (PC; the year's best
first-person shooter).
</P>
<P>
   Age of Empires II had the most nominations overall _ seven _
fitting given its handsome and deep game play.
</P>
<P>
   In the Console Game of the Year category, add the great driving
games Crazy Taxi (Dreamcast) and Driver and Gran Turismo 2
(PlayStation), and the first really good extreme sports title, Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater (on PlayStation, but recently available on N64
and Game Boy) to the console Game of the Year finalists.
</P>
<P>
   In the Computer Game of the Year finalists, add the fabulous
space war simulation Homeworld; the involving theme-park simulation
Roller Coaster Tycoon; and Command &AMP; Conquer: Tiberian Sun, an
excellent sequel that nonetheless disappointed fans who wanted more
innovation in the latest from the ground-breaking real-time
strategy series.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony will be held at the Biltmore Hotel on May
11, the first night of the massive Electronic Entertainment Expo at
the Los Angeles Convention Center. Comedian Martin Short will
host. &QL;

</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box included in story; `tonight' refers to Sat. Apr.
22) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A music-oriented site for the rest of us, debuting with
tonight's live Webcast (it'll be replayed Sunday) of the Three
Tenors concert at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, all overseen by
storied entertainment impresario Tibor Rudas and his son Dean. &QL; 
Where: www.superstartheater.com &QL; 
What's cool: Free Web casts by opera stars for one thing;
involvement by prominent performers like Tenor No. 3 Luciano
Pavarotti in the site's dozen musical categories, overseeing
submissions by (in his case) up-and-coming classical and opera
performers for another; just having a music site that's not
completely dedicated to 16- to 24-year-old, testosterone-addled Gen
Y males for a very big third. &QL; 
Features: The biggest feature is the SuperStar Judges, those people
who rate performers' submissions at least once a month. The judges,
and those who submit performances, get access to discounts on
music, concert tickets, merchandise and more. The performers get a
shot at recording contracts, including compilations of the best
stuff, as voted by the judges. &QL; 
You'll like this if: You love those high notes, on the Web and
everywhere else. &QL;

NEW YORK AUTO SHOW OFFERS A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR EVERY MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 23) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as Fashion Week provides a New York stage for
many top clothing designers, the city's international auto show has
become a runway for the styles that will start appearing in
showrooms and on city streets in the fall and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   And when the doors to the New York International Auto Show
opened to the public April 22, those in attendance could be excused
for thinking that both the couture (concept vehicles that flaunt
designers' skills) and the pret-a-porter (new models that can be
bought, now or soon) have a decidedly outdoorsy look. The sport
utility wave that has been building for a decade seems to be
cresting: Of the 20-some vehicles making debuts, about two-thirds
are utilities, pickups or cars with all-wheel-drive systems aimed
at SUV shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   There are also autos at the auto show, of course, along with a
number of crossover vehicles that combine characteristics of autos,
trucks, sport utilities and almost anything else with wheels. But
manufacturers seem to have decided that one or two or even three
SUV's are not enough. Instead of serving as the equivalent of a
little black dress fit for any occasion, sport utilities can be
marketed like shoes, with a different model for every mood.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the significant sport utilities (and a few
cars) making their debuts at the New York show, which is
celebrating its 100th anniversary this year:
</P>
<P>
   ACURA MDX _ Honda's luxury division will go head-to-head against
the phenomenally successful Lexus RX 300 with this car-based
2001-model sport utility, which goes on sale this fall. The MDX is
Honda's first attempt to design a midsize or large SUV; it had
previously sold vehicles built by Isuzu. Unlike the Lexus, Acra's
entry has a third-row seat, though it is too small for adults.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 330i, 330xi and M3 _ BMW took the wraps off three new
compact models for 2001. The 330i and 330xi have a new 3-liter
six-cylinder engine rate at 225 horsepower, up from 193 for the
2.8-liter engine in current models. The 330xi will be the first
all-wheel-drive BMW car sold in the United States since 1991,
employing the drive system used in the X5 sport utility. The
company also introduced the next-generation M3 performance car,
which now has the body design of the latest 3-Series models and 300
horsepower, up from 240.
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER SEBRING _ DaimlerChrysler's Sebring line expands to
include a sedan, replacing the Cirrus, as well as a next-generation
coupe and convertible with somewhat more sleek styling. The
convertible's 2.7-liter V-6 now delivers 200 horsepower, up 32 from
the previous version.
</P>
<P>
   GMC YUKON DENALI and DENALI XL _ General Motors' GMC division
introduced two premium versions of its full-size sport utilities,
the Yukon Denali and the longer Yukon Denali XL (which used to be
called the GMC Suburban). Outfitted with GM's 6-liter,
325-horsepower V-8 engine and full-time all-wheel drive, both come
with a long list of amenities, including a Bose Acoustimass stereo,
a Homelink system to open garage doors and security gates and the
OnStar communications system.
</P>
<P>
   2001 GM MINIVANS _ The mildly restyled 2001 Chevrolet Venture,
Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Montana minivans, which go on
sale in the fall, have second- and third-row seats that fold flat
for a more usable cargo area. And an area behind the third row
provides compartments for groceries and hidden storage. An
entertainment system allows passengers to play movie videos and
video games; it has a larger screen and wireless, two-channel
headphones for rear passengers. GM further announced that its
minivans would be available with all-wheel drive in the 2002 model
year. Ford's 2001 Windstar van will also get wireless headphones.
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI Q45 _ This new flagship for Nissan's luxury division is
due next spring as a 2002 model. Larger and more imposing than the
current model, it has a 4.5-liter V-8 engine that promises a
whopping 340 horsepower. Nissan also made news at the show with a
vehicle that wasn't on display, announcing that it would build a
V-8-powered full-size pickup to challenge Detroit on its strongest
turf; Toyota's latest effort at a similar big truck, the Tundra,
has been selling briskly.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   LEXUS SC 430 _ This sporty but luxurious convertible _ Lexus'
first _ will arrive in showrooms in about a year. Details were not
released, but the production car will draw heavily on the Lexus
Sport Coupe Concept. This show car has a retracting hardtop and a
new 4.3-liter V-8 engine, which it will share with Lexus' biggest
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI MONTERO _ The 2001 version will still haul seven
people, but it will get a unit body like a car instead of its
current trucklike body-on-frame structure. Other upscale features
include four-wheel independent suspension and a five-speed
automatic transmission that can be manually shifted. A third-row
seat folds into a well in the floor.
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE BRAVADA _ This 2002 model will be the first of a line
of GM sport utilities that include replacements for the Chevrolet
Blazer and GMC Jimmy. Its new architecture will also serve as the
platform for a new line of midsize pickups and crossover vehicles.
A larger, roomier body pushes the Bravada into the midsize class;
it has a new 4.2-liter in-line six-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   PANOZ ESPERANTE _ Panoz Auto Development, a Georgia-based maker
of limited-production, high-performance automobiles, showed its
Esperante luxury sport convertible. Priced about $80,000, the
305-horsepower Esperante aims at the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB7 and
Mercedes-Benz SL500.
</P>
<P>
   SUBARU LEGACY OUTBACK _ The 2001 model will offer a six-cylinder
engine, Subaru's first since the SVX coupe went out of production
at the end of 1996. Horsepower will increase by 28 percent, to 212.
The vehicle will also get an antiskid stability system. Subaru
further announced a marketing agreement that will result in a
limited L.L. Bean Edition of the Outback.
</P>
<P>
   2001 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER _ There was a time when foreign-based
automakers were content to offer one or two sport utilities,
leaving Detroit with the bulk of he market by selling models in
small, medium and large. But Toyota is making it clear that it will
fight General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler in every market
segment. The 2001 Highlander will be the fifth sport utility in
Toyota's lineup, plus two Lexus luxury models. The Highlander,
which goes on sale in about a year, shares its underlying structure
with the Camry sedan _ the same design used for the Lexus RX 300.
The Highlander will be available with either front-drive or
full-time four-wheel drive and with either a four-cylinder or V-6.
In size and price, it fits between the compact RAV4 and the
truck-based 4Runner. (A slightly larger, second-generation RAV4 is
also on display.) Later this year, Toyota will market the full-size
Sequoia utility, which will be priced below the top-of-the-line
Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from vehicles that are in the production pipeline, the New
York show offers a glimpse of several design studies that first
appeared elsewhere, including a number of concepts from GM, which
has a particularly prolific and interesting crop of dream cars this
year. These include the Chevrolet SSR, a retro-style hot-rod pickup
that was a sensation at the Detroit auto show in January; the
Chevrolet Avalanche, a combination of SUV and short-bed pickup; the
Hummer H2, a bright-yellow design for a smaller, pickup-based
version of the military vehicle; and the Cadillac Imaj, a
sharp-edged ultra-luxury sedan with electronic gadgets including
Internet access.Two concept cars making their worldwide debuts in
New York come from both ends of the price spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW Z9 is an ice-blue sports car with gull-winged doors and
carbon-fiber body panels attached to a skeletal aluminum frame,
making the car very light but rigid. While the driver may get
inside through a traditional, hinged door, both that door and a
small rear panel open skyward in one piece to allow access to the
back seat. Inside, the Z9 is uncluttered. Only a starter button and
a control knob on the center console operate hundreds of functions.
</P>
<P>
   And Kia, of South Korea, is showcasing a concept version of its
next-generation Rio, which is destined to be one of the
least-expensive cars in America. That is an unusual move, since the
first-generation Rio has not yet reached the market, and will not
until August. The Rio SV concept has an on-board personal computer
that would, in theory, give passengers Internet access and
navigation help.
</P>
<P>
   The 100th New York International Auto Show runs through April 30
at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, 11th Avenue between 34th
and 39th Streets. Hours are 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. Admission is $9 for adults
and $3 for children under 12.

<P>
   Rain will fall for most of Saturday across much of New England
as a very sluggish low-pressure system, which will be virtually cut
off from steering winds aloft, persistently draws Atlantic moisture
inland. Rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are possible, particularly over
high ground, where the sloping terrain augments the lifting of
Atlantic air. A skiff of light snow will dust the very highest
elevations of the White Mountains in New Hampshire.

   Meanwhile, farther to the west, a plume of Atlantic moisture
coiling around the lethargic low will fuel steady,
light-to-moderate rains across eastern New York and eastern
Pennsylvania, where ridge tops in the Catskill and Pocono mountains
will be shrouded by low cloud ceilings. Drizzle and patches of
light rain will circulate southward along the Appalachian chain as
far as North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE DRY LINE
</P>
<P>
   The dry line that sets up across the western Plains during the
warm season is anything but linear. This long but narrow boundary
between humid air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the
Rockies can waver back and forth across western Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas and Nebraska, occasionally causing a local switch from
stifling to refreshingly dry humidity a few times a day. Because
contrasting air masses converge at the dry line, isolated
thunderstorms can form. When a potent jet stream disturbance
arrives overhead, a formidable outbreak of severe storms often
erupts. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A NEW GENERATION REINVENTS THE NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ideas)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty-one years ago, in a famous essay, Philip Rahv divided
American writers into two groups: ``palefaces,'' like Henry James
and T.S. Eliot, with high brows, oversize superegos and
self-conscious, philosophical sensibilities; and ``redskins,'' like
Whitman and Dreiser, with earthier styles and noisier, more
populist outlooks.
</P>
<P>
   The first group specialized in heady, cultivated works, rich in
symbolism and allegory; the second favored a blunter, more
emotional naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   At their worst, Rahv argued, ``palefaces'' were snobbish,
pedantic and effete, while ``redskins'' tended to fall prey to
conformity, sentimentality and a crude anti-intellectualism. It was
the view of Rahv _ the editor of Partisan Review and one of his
generation's most influential critics _ that ``the national
literature'' had been crippled by ``the ills of a split
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the dissociation of mind from experience has resulted in
truncated works of art,'' he wrote, works that on one hand were
naive, ``flat reproductions of life'' or that on the other were
overly cultivated and abstract, bereft of ``evidence drawn from the
sensuous and material world.'' The question, he went on, was
whether ``history will make whole again what it has rent asunder.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is an exuberant yes. It's clear now
that the most exciting writers at work today _ both in the United
States and abroad _ have transcended Rahv's great artistic schism
and done so with remarkable energy and elan.
</P>
<P>
   Such masters of the contemporary novel as Don DeLillo, Toni
Morrison, Thomas Pynchon and Salman Rushdie _ along with a new
generation of writers like Dave Eggers, David Foster Wallace and
Zadie Smith _ have discovered a myriad of ways to fuse the cerebral
and the visceral, the high and the low, the world of ideas and the
world of raw experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``redskins,'' these writers are hot-wired to the gritty
world around them, rendering it with uncommon spontaneity and
vigor. At the same time, their books boast a ``paleface''
fascination with complexity and philosophical nuance; they are
sophisticated, highly self-referential works of art, replete with
arcane references and complex literary games.
</P>
<P>
   These writers _ let's call them pale-reds _ have not only made
Rahv's dichotomy obsolete; they have also mothballed Cyril
Connolly's well-known taxonomy that divided writers into the
``mandarin'' camp (in the tradition of Addison, Carlyle and Proust)
and the ``vernacular'' camp (in the tradition of Hemingway and
Forster).
</P>
<P>
   At their best, writers like Eggers and Smith combine a mandarin
love of ornate, even byzantine prose with the vernacular energy of
the streets, tossing together the literary and the colloquial with
hyperventilated glee.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the pale-reds tend to be magpies, lifting bits and
pieces from virtually every recent literary school _ from the
French nouveau roman, from the magical realists, from Kafka and
Borges, from Barthes and Barthelme and Barth _ while putting the
chilly innovations of the avant-garde at the service of a more
capacious social vision.
</P>
<P>
   Their books are Big Tent Novels: huge, inclusive, often mythic
works that attempt to capture the chaos and cacophony of the world
through whatever means come to hand.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers' ``Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'' uses all the
latest postmodern hardware: His account of his parents' deaths and
his rearing of his 8-year old brother is prefaced with a coy
discussion of the major themes of the book, ``Rules and Suggestions
for Enjoyment of this Book'' and an emotional flow chart; it
demonstrates, however, that such devices can enhance, rather than
undermine, the emotional power of his story.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's 1,079-page novel ``Infinite Jest'' employs jokes,
soliloquies, run-on footnotes and a proliferating series of
subplots to give the reader a carnivalesque portrait of a toxic
postmillennial America.
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Z. Danielewski's new novel ``House of Leaves'' uses
poems, screenplay excerpts, playful typography, assorted
appendices, and a succession of stories within stories to create a
novelistic mosaic that simultaneously reads like a thriller and
like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Though both ``Infinite Jest'' and ``House of Leaves'' are fat,
self-indulgent books that would have benefited enormously from some
judicious editing, their flaws are ones of ambition, not omission.
In fact the most powerful pale-red novels take on big canvases and
even bigger themes.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's ``Midnight's Children'' and ``The Moor's Last Sigh''
address no less a subject than the history of the Indian
subcontinent over the last 50 years. DeLillo's ``Underworld'' does
the same for America in the second half of the 20th century.
Slavery and its dark legacy stand at the center of Morrison's
masterpiece ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   And the consequences of imperialism form the pivot of Zadie
Smith's ``White Teeth,'' a remarkable first novel that explores the
impact of public events on private lives with Dickensian energy and
skill.
</P>
<P>
   Even such seemingly self-contained forms as the memoir and the
bildungsroman are being reinvented by these writers. Eggers'
``Heartbreaking Work'' bears about as much resemblance to most
autobiographies as Laurence Sterne's ``Tristram Shandy'' does to
the traditional novel, and Moses Isegawa's new novel ``Abyssinian
Chronicles'' opens out from a fairly conventional coming-of-age
story into an alarming, multifaceted tableau of life in Idi Amin's
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   How far we have come from the Kmart regionalism of Bobbie Ann
Mason and the tightly controlled minimalism practiced by writers
like Ann Beattie, Raymond Carver and Mary Robison in the '70s and
'80s!
</P>
<P>
   Flummoxed by the surreality of history and the mind-boggling
changes unleashed by the '60s, many writers in that era became
minimalists, withdrawing, turtlelike, inside their own homes and
heads. Their characters tended to speak in grudging non sequiturs,
and their spiky, anorexic narratives _ concerning the mysteries of
identity and the difficulty of connection _ attested to a cautious
mood of alienation and numbness.
</P>
<P>
   As Philip Roth has observed, reality at the time seemed so
stupefying, so maddening that most novelists simply abandoned the
effort to grapple with ``the grander social and political phenomena
of our times,'' turning instead ``to the construction of wholly
imaginary worlds and to a celebration of the self.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, it might be noted, a similar retrenchment occurred
after World War II, giving rise to a host of small, gently ironic
works by writers as disparate as Barbara Pym, Margaret Drabble,
John Wain and Alan Sillitoe.
</P>
<P>
   So what changed? Certainly many of Britain's more inventive
writers today have multicultural roots _ Rushdie was born in
Bombay, India; Kazuo Ishiguro in Nagasaki, Japan; Smith has a
Jamaican mother and an English father _ and they've been a central
part of what Carlos Fuentes has called the ``new
internationalization of British fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   As exiles and outsiders, they easily partook of both English
literary traditions and innovations from abroad, just as other
British writers like Martin Amis and Julian Barnes were
experimenting with techniques imported from the Continent and the
States.

&HT;     SUPREME COURT WADES INTO BATTLE OVER LATE-TERM ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 23).   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cultural and legal war over abortion turns to
the U.S. Supreme Court this week when the justices hear arguments
on whether a state can ban a particular kind of late-term abortion
called ``partial-birth'' abortion by critics of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the Nebraska law, which will be heard Tuesday,
is the first abortion case before the court since 1992 when the
justices reaffirmed the right to abortion but allowed some state
restrictions. The question in the Nebraska case is how far states
can go to restrict abortion.``This case is at the heart of the
abortion debate in the United States and will impact people around
the country,'' said Teresa R. Wagner, an attorney and chief policy
analyst for the Family Research Council, a Washington-based
conservative group that opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Nebraska law banning late-term abortions is being
challenged by Dr. LeRoy Carhart, a physician who performs abortions
at a Bellevue, Neb., clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart, the only doctor in Nebraska who performs abortions
after 16 weeks of pregnancy, called the law ``an affront to medical
practice, putting the state in between the physician and the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the law was unconstitutionally vague and places an
undue burden on doctors and their patients, Carhart asserts that
the ban on partial-birth abortions could be used to prohibit a
common procedure used to end pregnancies after 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart contends that the politically charged label of
``partial-birth abortion'' actually covers two types of abortion
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The best known _ and most controversial _ is called dilation and
extraction (D&AMP;X), in which the fetus is pulled into the vagina,
where the skull is crushed and the brain is sucked out. After the
head has been crushed, the fetus is then removed. It was this type
of abortion that the Nebraska legislature wanted to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Carhart said the law also could be used to bar another type
of abortion known as an intact dilation and evacuation (D&AMP;E), in
which the fetus is pulled into the birth canal, dismembered and
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Considered by doctors to be the safest late-term abortion
method, D&AMP;E is the most common procedure in use today for abortions
conducted between 16 weeks and 32 weeks.The state of Nebraska
argues that its law doesn't violate abortion rights because the
women who seek partial-birth abortions could legally undergo other
types of abortion procedures in which the fetus is left intact.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a U.S. District judge in Omaha ruled in favor of
Carhart and struck down the law. A year later, the U.S. Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis agreed in a unanimous
decision, saying that the law placed an unconstitutional ``undue
burden'' on a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the law was ``too broad'' and would
result in banning a number of common abortion techniques used in
the second trimester.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states have enacted similar bans, but 20 of these have
been struck down in federal courts as unconstitutional. However, a
federal appeals court in Chicago upheld such bans in Illinois and
Wisconsin. The disparity in the federal rulings will be addressed
by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision, expected by June, is likely to
produce both political and legal shockwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has passed two federal laws banning partial-birth
abortion, both vetoed by President Clinton on grounds that they
lacked exceptions to protect women's health.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, abortion is one area where the two presumed
presidential nominees differ distinctly.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush supports the Republican platform
opposing abortion. Vice President Al Gore, an abortion-rights
backer, often reminds voters that the next president likely will
nominate three Supreme Court justices appointees who could help
overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nebraska ban is upheld, Georgetown University law
professor David Cole says, abortion-rights advocates could conclude
that abortion rights are moving down a ``slippery slope'' that
could end with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. If the ban is struck
down, he says, abortion opponents could fear that they might have
trouble enacting any kind of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Law and Reproductive
Policy, a New York-based legal advocacy group, said a law banning
the late-term abortion procedure would ``scare doctors out of the
profession'' by threatening criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been deceived into thinking this case is about
late-term abortions it is not,'' she said. ``At stake in this case
is the degree of constitutional protection for women's right to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion say the late-term abortion issue has been
a turning point in their movement. ``While the country remains
divided on abortion generally, it is not on partial-birth
abortion,'' said Wagner. ``The vast majority of Americans who learn
of this practice favor banning it, whether they call themselves
pro-life or pro-choice,'' she said.

 UNDATED: the States.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the United States, some of the country's
pre-eminent writers were beginning to throw off their old
inhibitions. With his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1997 novel, ``American
Pastoral,'' Roth grappled shrewdly with the big subjects he had
once spurned as unmanageable: the book renounced the solipsistic
mirror games that had distinguished so much of his earlier fiction
to create a resonant parable of American innocence and disillusion:
Through the prism of one man's life, it told the story of what
happened to the nation in the tumultuous decades between World War
II and Vietnam, and the aftermath of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1997, which can now be seen as a kind of
watershed year in American fiction, that two of our postmodern
masters brought out their finest novels to date, novels that
evinced a new emotionality and ardor.
</P>
<P>
   Pynchon's ``Mason &AMP; Dixon'' was a sprawling, darkly comic epic
that showed the novelist moving beyond his love of allegory and
cartoonish farce to create two wonderfully human heroes (based on
the surveyors who mapped the Mason-Dixon line, dividing the North
and South) and a richly detailed portrait of early America in all
its promise and menace.
</P>
<P>
   DeLillo's dazzling, virtuosic ``Underworld'' similarly revealed
a new sympathy and attention to character on the author's part: In
tracing the crisscrossing, tangential lives of dozens of people who
witnessed the famous Giants-Dodgers game that decided the 1951
pennant race, the novel conjured up a jazzy, synesthetic vision of
the United States in the waning decades of the last millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these books _ ``Underworld,'' ``Mason &AMP; Dixon'' and
``American Pastoral'' _ embodies the best of both the paleface and
the redskin traditions. They are brilliant, glittering productions,
attuned to the cultural, political and metaphysical ambiguities of
American life, and proud, even boastful of their arsenals of
modernist and postmodernist devices.
</P>
<P>
   They are also raucous, gutsy works that render with stark
verisimilitude the clang and clamor of people's everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Younger writers who grew up reading DeLillo, Pynchon and Roth
(along with novelists like Faulkner, Nabokov and Joyce) were at the
same time assimilating that earlier generation's innovations, and
developing distinctive voices of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Children of the '60s and '70s, such writers as Wallace, Eggers,
Danielewski, Dale Peck, Richard Powers and Alex Garland had grown
up with discontinuity and flux. Chaos was not intimidating to them;
it was simply how things were.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they've tackled the crazy, multifarious reality
they see around them head-on, trying to cram all its
information-age effluvia willy-nilly into the pages of their books.
This is why their books often flaunt a smorgasbord of techniques,
transforming the comic and the tragic, the hallucinatory and the
naturalistic from mutually exclusive genres into stylistic modes
that can be shrugged on and off at will.
</P>
<P>
   This is why their books often have an encyclopedic air to them:
``Infinite Jest'' boasts demented little riffs on everything from
feral hamsters to tongue scrapers to the use of Lemon Pledge as
sunscreen; ``House of Leaves'' bristles with lists of photographers
and girls, interpolated passages of gibberish, and collagelike
asides about architecture and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Members of what the social critic Douglas Rushkoff has called
the ``screen-age'' generation, these writers have been influenced
not only by their literary precursors, but also by television, the
Internet and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Channel surfing, Web browsing and the sort of cross-cutting
pioneered by filmmakers like Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino
have given them a decidedly nonlinear outlook on the world, and
it's helped them push the elliptical, modernist formulations of
their predecessors to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Time is fluid, even warped in many pale-red books; cause and
effect, blurred. Instead of conventional beginnings, middles and
ends, there are random convergences and eerie recapitulations. This
is a literature at home with relativity and the Heisenberg
principle of uncertainty, a literature that embraces subjectivity
and chance, and the blurring of lines between the real world and
the virtual.
</P>
<P>
   Powers frequently constructs his novels (``Galatea,'' ``The Gold
Bug Variations,'' ``Plowing the Dark'') around two separate plot
lines, two separate time frames, tying his characters' stories
together thematically to raise a series of philosophical questions.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Tesseract,'' Garland, the author of the cult novel
``The Beach,'' dovetails the stories of three groups of people who
would normally never meet but whose lives intersect through the
mercurial workings of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Music-inspired strategies surface in many pale-red works,
offering, perhaps, a structural form that's fluid enough to
accommodate these authors' nonlinear proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Martin and John,'' Peck uses the technique of theme and
variation to create a portrait of his hero: We hear John _ a
hustler turned author _ tell us his story directly, and then we
hear his story again, as refracted through the fictions he's
written.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Heartbreaking Work,'' Eggers reprises events in different
keys _ the hyperbolic, the deadpan, the earnest _ to try to convey
to the reader the emotional fallout of his parents' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Infinite Jest,'' Wallace juxtaposes three story lines
(concerning a tennis instructor's family, a former Demerol addict
and a group of radicals who want to get their hands on a movie
reputed to be so entertaining that it causes audiences to die of
pleasure) to build a musical echo chamber of shared motifs.
</P>
<P>
   In merging the paleface and redskin traditions, such writers are
creating a literature that's both brainy and potent, a literature
fecund with ideas and in sync with the invisible thrum of the
zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   The finest pale-red books not only capture our cultural vertigo
but they also attest to the vitality of literature today. They
prove that rumors of the novel's demise _ repeatedly promulgated by
scholars like Harold Bloom and Alvin Kernan _ are vastly
exaggerated, that literature has managed to survive deconstruction
and decanonized curriculums, the dot-com revolution and the siren
call of Hollywood, that young authors continue to revere the art of
writing even as they reinvent its form.

MUSIC REVIEW: REVIVIFYING THE DEAD BY STAYING ON THE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Phil Lesh was the Grateful Dead's self-effacing
bassist. He kept his bass lines tucked under the Dead's guitars,
keyboards and voices; he wrote only a few songs, usually sang
harmonies and didn't record with his own band on the side. As the
leader of Phil Lesh and Friends, whose concerts through Sunday at
the Beacon Theater are sold out, he's still an ensemble player,
ignoring the spotlight. But he's definitely doing something right.
On Wednesday night, Phil Lesh and Friends played Dead songs and
jams that rivaled the Grateful Dead in their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Lesh's Friends are drawn from bands who grew up on the Grateful
Dead. Jimmy Herring on guitar is from Aquarium Rescue Unit; Jeff
Pevar plays guitar with David Crosby's band CPR; Rob Barraco is the
Zen Tricksters' keyboardist and John Molo, on drums, is with Bruce
Hornsby's band. They played with music stands in front of them. Yet
despite their various allegiances, with Lesh they're a full-fledged
band, listening closely to one another as they share the happy
tangle that defines Dead-style jams. ( Lesh will not be touring
this summer with the Other Ones, the band formed by surviving
members of the Grateful Dead after Jerry Garcia died in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Where the latter-day Dead got in the habit of playing one set of
relatively straightforward songs followed by a more free-form set,
Phil Lesh and Friends started both sets in flux, taking their time
and changing keys before the first song began. They used familiar
Dead strategies: bluegrassy phrasing on lines far outside the
bluegrass idiom, group pauses with glimmering sustained notes,
fleet overlapping scales that unfurled like maypole ribbons and
transitions that layered the next rhythm atop the previous one,
lingering in a sonic moire pattern.
</P>
<P>
   They played Dead warhorses like ``Scarlet Begonias'' along with
songs from the back corners of the Dead's repertory, including
``Crazy Fingers'' (from ``Blues for Allah'') and ``New Potato
Caboose'' (from ``Anthem of the Sun''). There were well-rehearsed
moments when the group recreated a springy Dead riff or landed
unanimously on the jubilant major chords of ``Bertha.'' They showed
affection for the originals, but not deference; ``New Speedway
Boogie'' had its rhythm revamped toward gospel, while ``Dire Wolf''
was switched from neo-Appalachian string-band picking to honky-tonk
country.
</P>
<P>
   Both guitarists paid continual homage to Garcia's phrasing, but
added their own touches: Herring with lines that suddenly scurried
at top speed or veered into jazz harmony, Pevar using volume
controls to make notes hover like consonant apparitions. Barraco
sang what would have been Garcia's lead vocals, while his
articulate piano lines constantly engaged with the other musicians,
invoking blues and jazz and gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Lesh sang a few leads adequately, though with deserved modesty.
But his bass lines moved through all the music as a nonstop, limber
countermelody: tumbling in triplets to echo a guitar line, plunging
lightly into the hurly-burly of a rhythm change, humming along as a
second opinion on a solo or a vocal line, nudging the music toward
the next bend. Many of the songs had lyrics about rambling onward,
staying in motion regardless of the goal, and for Lesh, the Dead's
legacy means he can keep on moving.

<P>
   So what are technology stocks worth? The short answer _ more
today than a week ago, in the wake of their alarming slide _ is
unsatisfying. And if investors are reassured by the rebound last
week, the question of how to value technology companies is likely
to remain important for some time. These are the companies, after
all, that led the stock market's long climb and are responsible for
so much economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1998, the Nasdaq composite, dominated by
technology stocks, has more than doubled, driven by what is called
momentum investing _ the belief, simply put, that what went up
yesterday is likely to go higher today. That approach causes
conniptions among the intellectual heirs of Benjamin Graham, the
Columbia finance professor considered the founder of modern
securities analysis. Grahamite value investors like Warren E.
Buffett weigh share prices against fundamentals like assets, cash
flows and earnings, and seek bargains.

   No one really argues today that technology stocks are
undervalued, or ``special situations'' in Graham's phrase. On
average, the 72 technology companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index are trading at nearly 46 times their estimated
earnings this year; the price-to-earnings ratio for the index as a
whole is 25. Both figures are sky-high by historical standards. Yet
the yawning gap between them opened only in the last year and a
half: in October 1998, the P/E for the technology stocks was 26,
for the whole index a nearby 21.
</P>
<P>
   What created the chasm? A mindless stampede into technology
stocks? Perhaps. But the investment strategists and economists who
labor lucratively on Wall Street cringe at the notion that their
industry is governed merely by fads and frenzies.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Bank
Securities, has developed a rigorous analysis of the
technology-stock run-up. The conclusion at the end of his trail of
equations: ``The price-earnings ratios of technology stocks are
optimistic, but they may be realistic as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Yardeni is known as one of the ``new paradigm''
advocates, who believe that information technology is having
far-reaching effects on the economy. Still, he is not totally
starry-eyed about technology. He was also Wall Street's leading Y2K
hawk, warning _ mistakenly as it turned out _ that the difficulties
of dealing with Year 2000 computer problems might bring on a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   In the technology-stock analysis, Yardeni and a research
associate, Joseph Abbott, started with two sets of numbers for the
72 technology companies in the S&AMP;P. The first was corporate
earnings estimates for the next 12 months by securities analysts,
as compiled by IBES International, going back to the 1980s. The
second was the five-year earnings estimates made by analysts over
the same span.
</P>
<P>
   They found that from 1985 through the early 1990s, the long-term
(five-year) growth estimates tended to range from 10 percent to 15
percent a year, but as the 1990s wore on the projections started
rising, and are now at about 25 percent annually. Around 1998,
Yardeni, believes, investors apparently started taking those
long-term growth estimates more seriously as a basis for valuing
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In Yardeni's thinking, the higher growth estimates, plus a
slight increase in the multiplier attached to the long-term growth,
and assuming low inflation, translate to justifiable P/E ratios of
33 to 50. (The precise methodology is discussed in two papers,
``How to Value Earnings Growth'' and ``Reversal of Fortune,''
posted on the Web at www.yardeni.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The assumptions by analysts and investors make sense, Yardeni
said, ``if you believe we are in a quasi-new economy'' of fairly
robust growth with low inflation. ``Analysts have come to view
technology stocks as less cyclical than before,'' he said. It is
also worth noting that Yardeni's analysis focused on technology
blue chips _ Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems _
and not small dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Yardeni observed that ``valuation, like beauty, is in the
eye of the beholder.'' There is a place for sober calculation, but
also for art, instinct and luck.
</P>
<P>
   That investment truism, of course, has been around for
centuries. A classic example: In 1915, a young man named Benny
Grossbaum told his bosses at a Wall Street investment firm that he
thought a fledgling enterprise called the
Calculating-Tabulating-Recording Co. had bright prospects in an
emerging field of technology. No, came the reply, it looked dubious
compared with solid-asset industries like oil, railroads or even
automobiles, the hot industry of the future in Wall Street's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He heeded the advice of his elders. But before long he left the
firm, and later changed his name _ to Benjamin Graham. And the
technology start-up that had caught his young eye later changed its
name as well _ to International Business Machines.

   Candy molds come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials.
For years, collectors have prized tin candy molds.
</P>
<P>
   These may still be in use, but candy-making experts say that the
new lightweight, clear plastic molds leave a better shine on the
candy. Rubber molds and heavy-duty white plastic molds are used
mainly for making hard candy.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Fellows is a sales associate at Studio 6 in Clifton Park,
N.Y., a candy supply house featuring tools and molds to make candy,
and offers how-to demonstrations twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that plastic is the best material, and you can't beat
the price at $1.75 to $1.99 a sheet, which is the size of a piece
of paper,'' Fellows said. Plastic sheets have indentations to make
one large piece of candy or several smaller pieces. Sheets with
multiple indentations might be all the same design or themed for a
certain event.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for Easter it might be a series of small bunnies or
bunnies in various poses, a basket, an egg and a lily plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to make something like a large solid
chocolate rabbit, plan on spending about $20 for a mold. There are
literally thousands of candy molds to choose from, and if you can't
find what you want, it can usually be ordered.

   WHEN HOME IS NO SHELTER
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes a ``New York day''? For workers who live
outside New York State, but work for New York companies, sometimes
from home, the question has income tax consequences. And now that
returns have been filed, the state may be challenging some
taxpayers' version of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers get a credit in their home states for taxes paid to
New York, explained Jeffrey Kelson, New York tax partner at BDO
Seidman, but because of New York's higher rates, ``the individual
still pays extra taxes.'' For Connecticut, the difference is 2.75
percentage points, but ``New York and New Jersey might as well be
Estonia and Italy _ they're that different,'' he said, making
general comparisons impossible.
</P>
<P>
   People who live in one state and work in another are supposed to
keep track of the days they work in the employer's state and
generally pay taxes there only for those days. Say an employee who
lives in Connecticut and works in New York is temporarily assigned
to the company's Stamford office. She gets a small tax break as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   But New York contends that people must work in the other state
at the employer's request, not the employee's convenience, to avoid
New York tax. ``The only safe thing to do is never come into New
York at all,'' said Nicholas Nesi, multistate tax partner for BDO
Seidman, because if a telecommuter comes to the home office even a
day or two a year, New York is likely to argue he owes New York
taxes for the year. ``But that is almost impossible. You need
face-to-face contact.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 23)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thank heaven for rising earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from the mid-April meltdown in stock prices,
investors breathed that collective sigh of relief last week. As a
flood of quarterly earnings reports poured from U.S. corporations _
most of them showing enviable growth _ the major indexes bounced
back. The Nasdaq rose 9.7 percent for the week, while the Dow Jones
industrials jumped 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's strong earnings from bellwethers like Chase
Manhattan, Texas Instruments, Citigroup and America Online came as
much-needed comfort to investors reassessing their appetite for the
newly apparent risks in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   With many equity strategists reiterating their belief that the
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 will earn 20 percent more on
average this year than they did in 1999, investors regained some
confidence that stocks will once again produce the double-digit
gains they have come to love.
</P>
<P>
   While this seems an admirably sensible approach _ how quaint to
base an investment decision on something real, like a stock's
earnings! _ it may not produce the results that investors are
hoping for. Because market history teaches that when earnings
growth is hottest, gains in stocks are disappointingly cool.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians at Ned Davis Research, an investment firm in
Venice, Fla., have gone back to 1927, studying how stock prices
react to earnings increases and declines. Here are their findings:
</P>
<P>
   When earnings growth in the S&AMP;P 500 stocks exceeded 20 percent,
as is expected this year, the index has historically gained an
average of 1.2 percent. When earnings are rising 10 percent to 20
percent, the S&AMP;P typically rises 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The real gains for stocks come when corporate earnings growth is
slow or nonexistent. For example, the S&AMP;P 500 gained on average 9.7
percent during times when earnings growth was rising less than 10
percent or when overall profits actually registered as much as a 10
percent decline. And when S&AMP;P earnings fell steeply _ 10 percent to
25 percent _ the index gained an astonishing 28.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generally just shows that from a long-term perspective
strong earnings growth in and of itself is not that bullish,'' said
Tim Hayes, global equity strategist at Ned Davis Research. But that
finding is less counterintuitive than it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market tends to anticipate, to discount earnings growth
well in advance of it happening,'' Hayes said. ``So by the time you
get the peak earnings growth, the market tends to have discounted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This anticipatory characteristic of the market means that stocks
turn in their best performances when earnings are disappointing.
Only in hindsight does it become clear that stock prices had moved
higher because investors had perceived that earnings were bottoming
out and about to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Not that earnings growth is bad for stocks, of course. It's
simply that big jumps in profits cannot be expected to support
stock prices that have already been levitating for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really drives stocks is what people are expecting,''
Hayes said. ``If expectations are really high, you're setting
yourself up for disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does that mean for stocks? In the current market, where
many of the biggest and most popular stocks are still priced for
perfection, it just may be that perfection is not enough.

   A music-oriented site for the rest of us, debuting with
tonight's live Webcast (it'll be replayed Sunday) of the Three
Tenors concert at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, all overseen by
storied entertainment impresario Tibor Rudas and his son Dean. &QL; 
Where: www.superstartheater.com &QL; 
What's cool: Free Web casts by opera stars for one thing;
involvement by prominent performers like Tenor No. 3 Luciano
Pavarotti in the site's dozen musical categories, overseeing
submissions by (in his case) up-and-coming classical and opera
performers for another; just having a music site that's not
completely dedicated to 16- to 24-year-old, testosterone-addled Gen
Y males for a very big third. &QL; 
Features: The biggest feature is the SuperStar Judges, those people
who rate performers' submissions at least once a month. The judges,
and those who submit performances, get access to discounts on
music, concert tickets, merchandise and more. The performers get a
shot at recording contracts, including compilations of the best
stuff, as voted by the judges. &QL; 
You'll like this if: You love those high notes, on the Web and

EVAN PARKER'S MUSICAL LANGUAGE: ACCESSIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In describing Evan Parker's music, sooner or later
you're going to use a circle metaphor _ a wheel, a mandala, a
spiral. For 35 years he has been rigorously attached to a
particular kind of soprano saxophone language, one more or less of
his own devising.
</P>
<P>
   In it the normal jazz-improviser's code of conversational broken
phrases is discarded in favor of long, continuous statements;
Parker uses the technique of circular breathing and can blow
without pausing for 20 minutes or more. But rather than droning, he
gives you bunches of notes that come stippled with ornament, making
low tones and high overtones collide, trilling them and rolling
them together so closely into line that he sounds as if he is
playing two instruments at once.
</P>
<P>
   He lights upon distinct patterns, generates a fairly small range
of harmony and uses a handful of favorite polyrhythms that he taps
out on the keys. It's a system and instantly easy to follow, but it
is mysterious, too. His performances are such a complex barrage on
the ears, such an original use of wind and stamina, that they seem
polymorphous: they start as coldly as math and then turn into sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker is also a generous player who listens to his
collaborators. Beginning a four-night stand at the Knitting Factory
on Thursday night, he played two duet sets that proceeded
differently by virtue of his partners.
</P>
<P>
   The first was with Ned Rothenberg, and it came close to an ideal
partnership. Rothenberg spent much of the set as accompanist,
interjecting notes and chords on the bass clarinet that guided the
listener harmonically through the gnarled rush of Parker's playing.
You could see the melody and the logic in it, and it was an
illumination, like reading Joyce with clear explanatory footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   But then he came out of his secondary role and took the
spotlight himself for a short while; instead of Parker's leonine
serenity, he played with a thicker, more athletic sound.
Rothenberg's rhythms were different, too, shorter and more
aggressive, and when he used overtones he made little tunes out of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Teitelbaum played live electronics against Parker in the
second set, and it was a more speculative venture. Parker is
working a lot with electronics these days, but it is mostly of a
sort in which his own saxophone sounds are digitally processed, fed
back to him in scrambled form, which initiates (naturally) a
circular process.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum operated differently, using his own samples and
sounds, many of them referring to real things in the physical
world: monkey cries, violins, drums, saxophone choirs, African
singing. There was a philosophical disjunction going on here, since
Parker's work is completely unmoored from references to the world
outside his own playing; also, Teitelbaum's sounds were funny,
whereas Parker's were anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Teitelbaum gave a performance that was more or less
complete in itself, rather than looking for the gaps to be filled;
it forced Parker into a secondary role for most of the set, playing
broken phrases and long tones. (He further acquiesced by playing
the tenor saxophone, which makes him sound mellow and phlegmatic.)
</P>
<P>
   But the set ended with a territorial gesture: changing back to
soprano, Parker ripped off a powerful, 10-minute solo _ reasserting
that his was a music of almost religious conviction, not tinkering
humor.

<P>
   George W. Bush is looking outside his Texas circle for advice
from supporters of his ex-president father and John McCain in
response to talk that his White House bid is directed by aides
untested by national politics. But the Bush campaign apparently
will remain Austin-based, steered by top aides Karl Rove, Karen
Hughes and Joe Allbaugh. Among new faces expected to be brought in
are three key members of McCain's unsuccessful run: Rick Davis,
Kenneth Duberstein and Vin Weber. The group also includes Mary
Matalin, deputy manager of Bush's father's 1992 campaign;
strategists Charles Black and Ed Gillespie; former GOP Chairman
Haley Barbour and former Rep. Bill Paxon of New York. Former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney reportedly will head the search for a
running mate. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich went public with
the criticism this week, saying Bush's team ``still has a little
bit of Austin in their style'' and is ``not quite up to speed yet''
in running a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   SOME CHANGES FOR GORE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Like his Republican rival, Al Gore is adding new faces to his
presidential campaign and stocking the Democratic National
Committee with loyal aides. Some reported changes: Mark Fabiani,
who helped the president handle his high-profile controversies will
be deputy campaign manager for communications, the most visible
aide in the campaign. Other top-level changes: Lisa Berg,
scheduling and advance; Chip Smith, chief of staff; Heather
Marabeti, deputy chief of staff; Janet Murguia, public liaison;
Elaine Kamarck, policy consultant; Sarah Bianchi, policy and
communications; Michael Whouley and Donnie Fowler Jr., political
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN COMING UNDER THE BIG TENT
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will be the keynote speaker at the annual Prescott
Bush dinner May 22 in Stamford, Conn. The Republican fund-raising
event is named for George W. Bush's grandfather, who was a U.S.
senator from Connecticut. State GOP Chairman Chris DePino said that
he was ``extremely pleased that Senator McCain has agreed to play a
major role for Connecticut Republicans,'' and that ``McCain will
appear under the banner of Governor Bush.'' McCain's candidacy was
Bush's only serious threat during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   EMPHASIS ON `GREEN' OTHER THAN MONEY
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Earth Day, Al Gore used a half-government,
half-campaign trip to the Detroit area Friday to promote new
government fuel-efficiency research and buff the ``green''
credentials he is counting on to give him an edge over George W.
Bush. Gore surrounded himself with environmental, labor and
trucking industry leaders at the Alvan Motor Freight yard in
Romulus, Mich., to underscore his argument for projects like the
government's new agreement with truck manufacturers to develop
``super fuel-efficient'' pickups, buses, and 18-wheelers within the
next decade to cut greenhouse gas pollutants beyond current
emission standards. Because he was there on behalf of the
administration, he did not mention Bush. But he did criticize
unnamed people who ``always argue that pollution is the inevitable
price we pay for our prosperity.'' According to The Associated
Press, Gore mixed one hour of vice presidential duty in with six
hours of political business.
</P>
<P>
   EMPHASIS ON `GREEN' INCLUDES MONEY
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like to take on big guys,'' consumer advocate
Ralph Nader said as he spoke to several hundred people at the
University of Kentucky's Singletary Center for the Arts. ``I like
to take on big guys. Big guys invigorate me. And they should
invigorate you.'' His message was simple: Corporations and their
lobbyists have taken over the political system and it is up to
citizens to return the process to its grass-roots origin. Nader's
goal is to get the Green Party on the ballot in every state and
pull more than 5 percent of the vote, which would qualify him for
millions of dollars in federal campaign funds. He currently polls
in single digits, about even with the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   STANCE FIRM AS THE FLAGPOLE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain notwithstanding, George W. Bush is sticking to his
stance on South Carolinians making up their own minds on the
Confederate battle flag. McCain, who took a similar position during
his campaign, reversed field and said the flag should come down
from atop the South Carolina Statehouse. Questioned a day later,
Bush said anew: ``It's the right of the state of South Carolina to
make the decision on the flag.'' McCain said he took that similar
position in February because ``I feared that if I answered honestly
I could not win the South Carolina primary.'' Bush, of course, won
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   3-WAY DEBATES? GORE DOESN'T COMMIT HIMSELF
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said on the Larry King TV show that he's open to
including the Reform Party presidential nominee in the fall
debates. Reform Pat Buchanan has filed a complaint with the Federal
Election Commission arguing for a spot in the nationally televised
forums. The Commission on Presidential Debates has set a 15 percent
threshhold in five national polls to get into the debates.
Buchanan's in single digits. ``I have a mixed feeling about that,''
Gore said. ``It depends on the level of support that they have,
whether it would enhance or impede the debate. I have an open mind
about it. But I think that we need to know more before a decision
like that is made.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY MONEY STILL COMING IN ...
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush accelerated his already formidable fund-raising
effort in March. Cox News Service's Ken Foskett reported that Bush
raised $6.4 million in March, up from the $3.1 million he raised in
February, for a total topping $80 million. But Bush also continued
to spend money at record paces _ another $10.1 million in March. In
all, Bush has spent $73.4 million, a presidential primary campaign
record. Al Gore, meanwhile, raised $1.9 million in March and spent
$4.7 million. Gore has raised a total of just under $38 million and
spent $36.4 million. In the crucial category of cash on hand, Bush
listed $6.8 million to Gore's $3.8 million. The Gore campaign said
it anticipates an additional $6 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ... WITH GORE $9 MILLION FROM LIMIT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is wrapping up his fund-raising with about $9 million
remaining to carry his Democratic presidential campaign through the
convention this summer. Gore faces a spending limit because he
accepted federal matching funds. George W. Bush, who didn't take
the taxpayer money, can spend whatever he can raise through the
national convention this summer. Gore is limited to spending $40.5
million. Because some of Gore's spending was exempt from the legal
limit, he can spend $9 million more before bumping the ceiling,
said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   QUICKIE INTERVIEWS, NOT NEWS CONFERENCES
</P>
<P>
   At last count, Al Gore has not held a news conference in
slightly more than two months, but he ``will have a lot of news
conferences; don't worry about it,'' Gore said in Fort Lee, N.J.
The question was raised by Jay DeDapper of WNBC, as a line of New
York City TV journalists shuttled in and out for a few minutes with
the vice president. Gore has shown a preference for quick,
back-to-back television interviews, with two questions squeezed
into 60 seconds. He did seven of them. A hint about the reason for
Gore's reticence came when a Washington Post reporter pressed him
on Elian Gonzalez. Gore gave a halting answer before his press
secretary, Chris Lehane, cut in to announce that this was not a
news conference.

   Call it a bit of political theater or merely some inspired
casting, but Donna Hanover's latest New York part might raise some
eyebrows at City Hall. Beginning May 30, Hanover, Rudy Giuliani's
wife, takes over a lead role in ``The Vagina Monologues,'' the
off-Broadway hit featuring a dozen or so monologues on topics like
orgasm and childbirth. Hanover, who has appeared in several movies
and hosts ``In Food Today'' on the Television Food Network, will
perform for two weeks, sharing the monologues with two other women.
Interestingly, the playwright is Eve Ensler, a personal friend and
political supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's Senate
opponent.

   The Boston Herald reports that Massachusetts Sens. Ted Kennedy
and John Kerry will keep checks from Vivian Mannerud, a Democratic
donor linked to cocaine trafficker Jorge Cabrera. The
Mannerud-Cabrera connection prompted Hillary Rodham Clinton to
return Mannerud's $22,000 contribution to her Senate campaign
recently. Though Kennedy accepted $1,000 from Mannerud, Kerry had
closer ties: Mannerud hosted an $18,000 Kerry fund-raiser, gave
$1,000 in donations and arranged foreign travel for Kerry's staff
as recently as this month. Though Kerry's advisers warned him that
Mannerud's drug connection could prove troublesome, Kerry wasn't
swayed. ``We accept her word she had no knowledge of Mr. Cabrera's
illicit activities,'' the Herald quoted Kerry spokesman David Wade
as saying.

   TAKE THAT! I'LL SHOW YOU
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif., has abandoned the Democrats on
virtually every party vote since losing the primary last month to
an opponent supported by a number of fellow California Democrats.
Democrats are aware of what's been happening and attribute it to
bitterness about the defeat, Roll Call said, and if the situation
has left some Democrats frustrated, ``they are nevertheless
resigned to fate.'' The publication quoted an anonymous ``top
leadership aide'' as saying: ``That's the problem with an early
primary. You have to live with the dead body for six months.''

   HEY, PEOPLE, THERE'S AN ELECTION HERE

   Less than two weeks before North Carolina's gubernatorial
primary, the five major candidates hoping to succeed Democratic
Gov. James Hunt are having trouble garnering attention, The
Associated Press reports. Even Attorney General Mike Easley, vying
with Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker on the Democratic side, admits as much:
``Nobody is paying any attention.'' Battling on the GOP side in the
May 2 primary are former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot, state
Rep. Leo Daughtry and former state Rep. Chuck Neely. Recent polls
show Easley and Vinroot leading.

 By DAVID SHIELDS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Halfway through the first quarter of the Feb. 29 game between
the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers, with
Portland having just gone up, 8-6, Phil Jackson, the coach of the
Lakers, called timeout. Before the teams met, Jackson said he had
never seen ``a bigger game in my 33 years'' in the NBA, which,
coming from such an exponent of understatement and indirection,
seemed improbable hyperbole.
 &HT;    True, the game did involve two teams with identical records _
45-11, the best in the National Basketball Association _ and
identical 11-game winning streaks. And Los Angeles had lost the
last seven games in Portland. But it still seemed a rather abrupt
and alarming timeout.
 &HT;    Lakers guard Brian Shaw, who had inbounded the ball, said: ``We
were just bringing the ball in and he called a timeout. Everybody
looked at him and was surprised. I thought, 'Uh-oh, he must have
called something in the huddle and we didn't run it the right way.'
So I said, 'Did we do something?' And he said: 'No. I'm just
messing around.' We just went over and had some water and sat down.
And then he said: 'OK. Get ready to go.''' The Rose Garden was
absolutely collegiate in its cacophonous Blazermania, and Jackson's
brinkmanship reminded his players that it's finally just a game
they're playing and that they, too, are supposed to be messing
around having fun.
 &HT;    But it also communicated unmistakably that he was in control _
not only of the team, of course, but of the building. We're running
the show, not them. When the Lakers returned to the court, Shaw
scored on a driving layup. Watch the NBA sometime on NBC or TNT or
TBS; watch how the camera cuts back and forth between the two head
coaches pacing the sidelines and the 10 players running up and down
the court, as if to imply that the coaches are omnipotent
puppeteers and the players their particularly lithe marionettes.
 &HT;    Watch college basketball sometime on ESPN; listen to Dick Vitale
refer constantly to the coach as ``the orchestrator.'' Thus does
race myth get reified: maybe black men can walk on the moon, but
white men still man Mission Control.
 &HT;    One principal reason that Phil Jackson has been such a
successful coach is that he has the ability to function as a subtly
paternal rather than sadistically paternalistic leader of a group
of young black men (many of whom grew up without fathers) who might
have use for a mentor but have none for a tyrant. In Chicago,
Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, he has transformed the Lakers _ who the previous
three years had failed to fuse the talents of Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant into anything resembling a cohesive force _ into a
genuine team, one that, with guaranteed home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs, is now the strong favorite to win this
year's NBA championship. In the words of Lakers forward-center John
Salley, who rarely plays in games but who appears to function as a
sort of ex-cathedra assistant coach and team spokesman: ``With
Phil, it's: 'You're a man. I'm a man. I'm going to help you be a
better man.''' Players seem stunned and grateful that Jackson
neither panders to their wishes nor preys on their insecurities.
 &HT;    Most NBA coaches are naggers; players call them ``little
bitches,'' according to Charley Rosen, a novelist who is writing a
book with Jackson about their basketball-based friendship. Black
players, especially, get tired of, especially, white coaches
yipping at them. Most coaches can't fathom how their tirades can
carry racial connotations to players; the P.J. Carlesimo-Latrell
Sprewell incident of a few years ago is the benchmark example of
this dynamic.
 &HT;    There were also the recent and continuing flareups between
Boston Coach Rick Pitino and the Celtics star Antoine Walker;
between Philadelphia's Larry Brown and Sixers guard Allen Iverson;
between New York's Jeff Van Gundy and Sprewell. Jackson seems to
grasp that in the white-managed, black-content-provided NBA, the
dialectic between coaches and players shouldn't replicate the
punitive patriarchy of the 400-year-old American racewar; the
conversation has to find a new groove.
 &HT;    Pretending to praise Coach Pat Riley before the Lakers faced the
Miami Heat on March 5, Jackson said: ``I have great admiration for
his attention to detail, his driving kind of authoritarian kind of
dictatorship that he runs his teams with. And his motivational work
that he does, it keeps people very busy and very driven.'' Jackson
uses instead what he calls the I Know That You Know That I Know
method of coaching. ``Why are you looking at me? You already know
you made a mistake,'' he'll say when a player looks to the sideline
after a miscue. ``I'm no savior,'' he said when he arrived in Los
Angeles this summer. ``They have to be the savior of themselves.''
 &HT;    Off the court, though, Jackson appears to want to be their
savior and doesn't seem to hear how condescending his
high-handedness can sound. At the beginning of the season, he said
that the Lakers ``are all autistic in some form or fashion. I don't
mean to say that as a snide remark toward a certain population in
our society. But they'' _ the Lakers _ ``have a limitation of their
attention span. A lot of it is probably due to too much rap music
going in their ears or coming out of their being.''
 &HT;    Kobe Bryant, who spent part of his childhood in Italy, said he
found Jackson's giving him ``White Boy Shuffle,'' a novel about a
black child raised in a privileged white community, a bit
presumptuous. Jackson gave Shaquille O'Neal a copy of Nietzsche's
``Ecce Homo'' _ doesn't that smack of noblesse oblige? On the
court, on the other hand, Jackson almost never calls plays; he
thinks play-calling makes players feel as if they're on a string _
his.
 &HT;    This abnegating impulse comes from his practice of Zen Buddhism,
with its strong emphasis on egolessness, but also from his innate
temperament, which he once described as ``low-key _ not comatose
but close to it.'' His wife, June Jackson, has said: ``It's
comfortable to be with him. He's quiet inside.'' And it's so loud
over there in all those other huddles.
 &HT;    When I bumped into Jackson in the elevator at the Benson Hotel
in Portland, he had the least hegemonic presence of any coach of
any sport at any level I have ever encountered. Asked what
distinguished him from other coaches they'd played for, more than
one Laker said, ``During the game, he sits down.'' Players thrill
to this non-Bobby Knight-ness.
 &HT;    Son of two Pentecostal ministers, role player on the
championship New York Knicks teams of the 1970s coached by Red
Holzman, who preached team basketball, idealist whose social values
were formed in the '60s, longtime student of Zen and admirer of the
Lakota Sioux, Jackson was destined to be the anticoach coach. When
he was 4, his mother hung a sign over his bed with a quotation from
John 3:16: ``For God so loved the world that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have eternal life.''
 &HT;    Jackson has contrived a way to rebel against and yet not
entirely reject his pastor parents by becoming a Wizard of Oz who
insists on stepping out from behind the curtain to let the whole
group play with the control switches. He is an authority figure
whose authority derives from his strategic willingness to
deconstruct that authority.
 &HT;    The night after the Portland game, the Lakers played the lowly
Vancouver Grizzlies in Los Angeles, and ``lethargy'' doesn't begin
to describe the absence of energy in the Staples Center that
evening. ``We were somnambulant out there,'' Jackson said
afterward. ``We were the walking wounded in their sleep.'' Most
coaches would have been calling timeouts, hollering at players,
madly making substitutions.
 &HT;    Perversely, hilariously, Jackson did very nearly nothing for the
entire game. He just sat on the bench, a kind of mirror, reflecting
back to the players their own quiescence, daring them to find a way
out of their torpor. He even let Shaquille O'Neal stay on the floor
after picking up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter;
O'Neal picked up his fifth shortly after, and Jackson removed him
with the game tied. Immediately after O'Neal went to the bench, the
Lakers hit three consecutive 3-pointers, and the Grizzlies never
truly threatened the rest of the way.
 &HT;    ``That's natural, a letdown after last night,'' Jackson said
afterward. ``You have to measure it out and find a way to win. It's
good for them to adjust to that. I think they're really learning
and growing.''
 &HT;    June Jackson once said: ``Sometimes he keeps things moving by
not doing anything. With Phil, there's a flowing rather than a
forcing.'' Jackson's most famous flowing occurred when Chicago's
Scottie Pippen refused to enter a 1994 playoff game with 1.8
seconds left against New York. After the game, Jackson walked into
the Bulls' locker room and said: ``What happened has hurt us. Now
you have to work this out. You've got two minutes to get together,
to talk softly among yourselves.''
 &HT;    Nearly every other NBA coach would have used the occasion as an
opportunity to solidify his own power base; instead Jackson, in his
own words, stepped back and ``let the team come up with its own
solution.'' In the locker room, Bill Cartwright made an unusually
emotional appeal to his teammates; the incident brought the team
closer together. Jackson's goal is to yield control at a
superficial level in order to regain it at a more profound level by
creating an environment in which, he says, the players ``become
policemen of themselves, and that's really more fun for a coach to
watch happen than anything else.''
 &HT;    Of course, in the end, he's still watching them. Jackson is
chief of police. He maintains a chilly margin of mystery around
himself (he agreed to be interviewed for this article only via
e-mail) partly, I think, as a quite consciously crafted technique
to get his players to stay tuned through the grind of an 82-game
season and, perhaps, weeks of playoffs. By being interestingly
paradoxical (gentle but not warm, relaxed yet in charge), he
doesn't bore the team to death; he keeps people alertly off guard.
He's a freaky control freak who sees and seizes the benefits of
granting to his charges a kind of semi-demi-freedom. Jackson's
friend Charley Rosen describes Coach Jackson as a ``benevolent
dictator.''
 &HT;    When I asked Jackson if he saw any relationship between his
apparently emancipated coaching style and the racial demographics
of the NBA, he characteristically slipped the noose of any
too-tight definition by saying: ``I don't think black or white
makes a difference to coaches. I think control is the issue: if I'm
responsible for this team, I'll be damned if I let some kids take
me down. It's my job attitude.''
 &HT;    Jackson's blessing and his curse _ what makes him both an
effective coach and a rather enigmatic person (the qualities are
related) _ is his extraordinary detachment. His wife, who hasn't
moved with him from Woodstock to Los Angeles, gets frustrated by
how little emotion he displays after big victories. She once
suggested that he wave to her in the stands after games to let her
know how happy he is about winning.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I wish we could play in a gym without any people in
the stands,'' he once said, ``and try to play the perfect game
where you don't make any mistakes, and maybe if there's a mistake
it's of omission, not commission, and everything is done at the
right moment, at the right time, and each decision is the right one
and everyone can ride that decision-making wave.'' In an e-mail
message, I asked him, ``Many players seem to view their role as
being not only to compete but to entertain; is there anything you
like about the performance aspects of being a coach?'' His response
was, ``The performance aspect of basketball enhances some players'
ability and hinders others.'' If Buddhism and a fundamentalist
childhood and political idealism are the building blocks of his
remarkably effective leadership style, they're also the ingredients
of a spooky sort of hyperrational perfectionism.
 &HT;    ``The greatness of Michael Jordan is his competitive drive,''
Jackson once said. ``The weakness of Michael Jordan is his
competitive drive.'' When I asked Jackson what his equivalent
tragic flaw might be, he replied, ``My weakness is also
competitiveness to excess.'' June, for instance, refuses to play
board games with him anymore.
 &HT;    The day before the April 8 game in Los Angeles between the
Lakers and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs _ a possible
preview of this year's Western Conference finals _ Jackson said:
``This is a team we not only want to beat, we want to beat soundly.
They showed their moxie last year in an abbreviated season,'' he
added, referring to last year's NBA lockout.
 &HT;    ``But you don't know what a team has until it has played an
82-game season and you come out in the end.'' After the
anticlimactic game _ which the Spurs won by 18 when Shaquille
O'Neal sat out with a sprained ankle, rendering the game
meaningless as a gauge of how the teams match up against each other
_ San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich said about Jackson's disparaging
remarks: ``He's a great coach who has won a lot of championships.
It's just hard to figure what his motivation would be for the
comments he's made. I'm chalking it up to being childish.''
 &HT;    Luckily for Jackson and for the Lakers, whatever tendency he
might have toward petulance is balanced by his whimsicality. At the
Lakers' first meeting this year, they reportedly practiced without
a ball. Other practices have been conducted in complete silence.
What other NBA coach would have been unable to keep a smile off his
face when in 1996 his player, the Bulls' Dennis Rodman, head-butted
a referee? ``Don't you think it's interesting having Dennis
around?'' Jackson later asked. On the way to a Bulls practice
during the 1994 playoff series against the Knicks, Jackson
redirected the team bus to the Statue of Liberty for an impromptu
group tour. During a midseason slump, he advised the Bulls to order
some pizzas and beer up to their hotel rooms and just relax.
 &HT;    With 24 seconds remaining in the February game in Portland and
the Lakers leading by 3, the Trail Blazers called timeout. Jackson
spent much of the break talking to guard Brian Shaw. ``Questions
were coming up on how we were going to defend certain plays,'' Shaw
said. ``I was just giving him our perspective: 'This is what
they're doing. We feel more comfortable doing it like this.' I play
that role all the time. He said to us from the beginning of the
year: 'You guys are out on the floor. You have a feel for what's
going on. Don't be afraid to come to me and tell me what you
see.''' By contrast, Mike Donleavy, the Portland coach, ran onto
the court at the end of the timeout, yelling last-second
instructions to Greg Anthony, who turned his back on him and walked
away.
 &HT;    The Lakers prevented the Blazers from executing the play they
wanted to run. With eight seconds left, Portland's Scottie Pippen
was forced to toss up a jumper from 25 feet away; the ball bounced
off the rim into the corner. The Blazers' Steve Smith caught the
ball and, panicking a bit, threw up a desperation shot with five
seconds still left on the clock. The Lakers rebounded, and the game
was over. According to Jackson, the Lakers read the play perfectly,
``made the switches correctly and chased them into the spaces they
couldn't operate from.'' He credited his players, in particular
guard Ron Harper, ``who saw and read what was coming up.'' It was a
duel between two very good bands. The Lakers were the tighter band.
 &HT;    They won.
 &HT;    When Jackson says, ``The most effective way to forge a winning
team is to call on the players' need to connect with something
larger than themselves,'' you want to retain your skepticism; you
know how bottomless the selfishness of human nature is, how fragile
the bonds of any (especially artificially constructed) community
are; how calculated and in some ways contradictory Jackson's
persona is. There's a certain ``Stepford Wives'' quality to the
unanimity of players' encomiums about Jackson, a certain aspect of
black athletes returning to white reporters, in an endless feedback
loop, the same media cliches the newspapers printed last week:
``Phil's at peace with himself; that's what he's trying to bring to
us, that peace and that harmony and that resolve that he has within
himself,'' and so on.
 &HT;    And yet when I asked Ron Harper, who played for Jackson in
Chicago for several years before joining him this season in Los
Angeles, whether I could talk to him for a few minutes about
Jackson, he responded with an expletive that referred to his coach.
If a player had uttered this expletive about nearly any other coach
in the NBA, it would have been difficult to take it as anything
besides straightforward venom.
 &HT;    However, in this locker room (in which Shaquille O'Neal was
leading the Los Angeles Times beat reporter in a dance), with this
team (which in a certain sense was still only mimicking secondhand
notions about coming together, but in so doing was taking the first
steps toward actually coming together, in the same way that saying
``I love you'' is the first step toward falling in love), from this
player (whose reputation had always been that of a one-dimensional
shooter until joining up with Jackson in Chicago, where he became a
defensive specialist and floor leader), about this coach (who on
media day in Los Angeles made certain that the first people the
press met were the rookies, followed by role players, then the
starters, then the stars, then lastly himself _ yielding the stage
to his players or underlining that he's in charge, or both; that's
the question he's so good at lodging in players' minds; that's the
ace of his magical coaching trick), it was, I think, a joke, and as
such, pure praise.

 (PART II OF A 2-PART SERIES.)  
 By MIRTA OJITO  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As night fell my mother and sister found a thin mattress and
went to sleep on the floor. My father and I sat in plastic beach
chairs in front of them. All night names of vessels were called
over the loudspeakers _ a sign that the boat was ready and the
group needed to assemble fast. We did not speak much that night, my
father and I, but we observed. And what we saw was pitiful.
 &HT;    A chemistry professor from Santiago de Cuba, on his knees,
begging an officer to let him join his wife and children, who were
already on the bus to Mariel. His wife's name had been called,
while his, inexplicably, had been omitted. An old woman who cried
inconsolably because her only son was forbidden to leave with her
because his name had been misspelled in some document. She wanted
to stay, but her son pushed her into the arms of an officer, who
took her away as she kicked and screamed for her son. The son left
quickly, while the chemistry teacher lingered, still sobbing on his
knees.
 &HT;    Dawn found us in the same chairs. About 8 a.m., our boat was
called. We went through the process without any problems and soon
were sitting in a bus without glass in the windows, leaving us
exposed to the fury of the mob outside. We were pelted with
tomatoes and eggs. Some people in the bus cried. Others cursed
under their breath. An old lady prayed.
 &HT;    After a short ride, we arrived in El Mosquito, a barren, dusty
field that served as a holding area for people waiting to board
boats at the port of Mariel. We formed a long line outside, in the
midst of a woodsy, rocky area, and waited our turn. What we were
waiting for, we did not know. But because Cubans were trained to
wait in line everywhere, we obeyed.
 &HT;    Sometime in the afternoon our turn came. We were asked to walk
into what looked like a small house with a green roof. An officer
asked my name and wanted to know what I was carrying. He took my
two pens and sent me to a curtained booth for a search. A woman
asked me to lift my blouse, unhook my bra and take off my pants and
panties. Midway through she took pity on me and let me go. My
father turned in the last of his possessions, 200 pesos, about a
month's salary. He protested but was told that where he was going
he would not need Cuban pesos.
 &HT;    We emerged from the house, without money or identity, into what
looked like a sun-scorched military camp. We were assigned to one
of the dozens of olive green tents that dotted a barren field
looking out on a pretty stretch of beach that was fenced off and
patrolled by security guards. The word was that this was the last
stop before Mariel. We were shocked to meet people who had been
waiting 10 days. We could not fathom spending a day there, let
alone a week. We had not taken a shower or brushed our teeth since
leaving the house the day before. We had no towels, sheets, clean
underwear or even an extra set of clothes. We had not slept on a
bed or taken off our shoes or had a minute alone. We also had not
gone to the bathroom.
 &HT;    Someone pointed us to the showers and toilets, a cluster of
tents in the distance. The stench was unbearable. Flies swarmed. My
mother felt ill. We decided, instead, to take a bath in the ocean.
Salt water, we thought, would be better than no water at all. But
when we tried to get to the beach, a guard told us that swimming
was not allowed. We went back to the tent.
 &HT;    The camp was divided into three sections. One large area was
reserved for people like us who had been claimed by relatives who
had come from Miami. Another area, fenced by barbed wire, was for
people who had been in the Peruvian Embassy. They had no tents or
cots. Yet another section, closer to the water, was reserved for
people who had walked into police stations across the country and
applied for permits to leave, declaring themselves escoria. This
term covered anyone from a homosexual to an independent thinker to
a thief. They were also fenced in and guarded by dogs.
 &HT;    Dusk was fast approaching. We had been told that the
loudspeakers would blare through the night. If you missed your
name, you had to wait for space on another boat, if and when space
became available. I don't think anybody in our group slept that
night. An ocean breeze cooled the tent, the loudspeakers droned on
and a spotlight canvassed the entire camp.
 &HT;    In the morning, about 10 a.m., our boat was called. ``Valley
Chief, Valley Chief, Valley Chief.'' Three times. We rushed to an
area where again we were ordered to form a line and board a bus.
After a short ride, we arrived at Mariel. From the bus we could see
the masts of the vessels. There were recreational yachts, shrimp
boats and little two-person speedboats with people who, seemingly,
had buzzed over from Florida just to see what was going on. Good
Samaritans were throwing apples and shiny little bags. I later
learned that the bags contained potato chips. I remember thinking
that it was the first time I had seen apples, but, somehow, I knew
what they were.
 &HT;    There was an atmosphere of energy and optimism around the boats:
people coming and going; men in uniform carrying bottles of water;
reporters interviewing refugees and boat owners. From the window, I
suddenly caught a glimpse of Uncle Oswaldo standing on the dock,
tanned and dirty, and with a beard from 17 days out in the sea. He
was wearing jeans and a white T-shirt that contrasted sharply with
his sunburned skin. Smiling through his tears, he waved at us.
Behind him, white and motionless, lay the Valley Chief, the boat
that we thought would take us to the United States.
 &HT;    Not too long after our group boarded the boat, a bus stopped a
few feet from the dock and people began pouring out. Some were
shoeless; others wore orange uniforms that retained the creases of
clothes that had been folded for too long; most had their heads
shaved. A few were crying. They boarded the Valley Chief, and the
captain was instructed by Cuban immigration officers to take them
to the United States. We did not know it then, but they were people
that the Cuban government wanted to get rid of.
 &HT;    Some were prisoners, doing time for crimes that ranged from
theft to manslaughter. Others were simply nuisances, troubled
people who took up space and resources and did not contribute
anything to Castro's grand plans for a Socialist utopia. By sending
them abroad, the government was not only ridding itself of problems
but also turning the Mariel crisis into Washington's problem.
 &HT;    ``Sector by sector, the police identified the problem types and
told them, plain and simple, 'If you don't leave now, you go to
jail for four years,''' says Carlos Cajaraville, a former
counterintelligence captain who spent six months working at the
harbor. ``Most people, given the choice, would opt to leave.''
 &HT;    Filiberto Casti$eira, who was a colonel in the Ministry of the
Interior, the internal security apparatus in Cuba, and now sells
food from a lunch cart in Miami, worked at the command post that
managed the Mariel operation. He says that Castro would call every
night on a special line to ask how many boats had arrived, what
capacity they had, how many boats had left and with how many
people. He then gave the order concerning which groups of people
should leave the next day.
 &HT;    If too many homosexuals left, then their percentage was lowered
and the percentage of families increased. If too many criminals
left, which could provoke a response from American authorities in
Key West, then that figure was lowered and the percentage of, say,
political prisoners was increased. There were seven categories in
all. Washington was not blind to what was happening, but Carter had
his hands tied. In a meeting at the White House, the high command
of the Coast Guard informed the administration that there was no
way to stop the boat lift without using force, which would lead to
a significant loss of life.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine Mr. Human Rights killing innocent refugees
seeking freedom from a repressive regimes in Cuba?'' says Robert
Pastor, who was the Carter administration's point man on Latin
America and the Caribbean. ``We were caught in a dilemma for which
we had no answer.''
 &HT;    To make matters worse, in early May, Carter urged Americans to
open their arms and hearts to arriving refugees. His statement was
interpreted as a sign that all Cuban refugees were welcome, but the
administration insisted that the president had been misunderstood.
 &HT;    Five days after the president's remarks the captain of the
Valley Chief received the order to leave Mariel. By then the boat's
blue waterline was no longer visible. There were 210 people on
board, only 17 of whom were related to the Cuban-Americans who had
made the trip from Miami. One of the strange men who came on board
without shoes asked my father for his nail clipper. When my father
asked him what he wanted it for, he said he wanted to cut his veins
open. We stayed away from him as much as we could.
 &HT;    The Valley Chief, creaking under the extraordinary weight,
refused to move. The captain said that the motor was damaged and
that we weren't going anywhere. My uncle went looking for help. He
returned with a tanned and muscled American sailor who spoke with
what I now think was a Texas drawl. I can hear his voice, but not
the words, because at the time I did not understand any English.
 &HT;    He had sailed his yacht, Ma$ana, to the port of Mariel as a Red
Cross volunteer. As my uncle explained the situation to the man, I
sat on the hard cement floor of the docks, trying in vain to
understand. From below, I noticed that the man's right arm was
fake, but so real-looking that it was almost impossible to detect.
The nails were perfectly shaped, and the curves of the forearm
imitated the muscles on his left arm. The man agreed to take the
women and children on his yacht and to tow the Valley Chief to
international waters. When he tried to throw a rope from the docks
to keep the Valley Chief from drifting, his fake arm got tangled up
in the ropes and fell into the water.
 &HT;    Everybody gasped. My mother fainted and hit the cement floor
with a thud. A man dove into the murky waters of the port and,
after a few seconds, came out triumphantly holding up the arm. The
American, who turned out to be a Vietnam vet, simply took the arm,
put it on and continued working. My mother came about. An explosion
of applause followed.
 &HT;    The event is etched in my memory because I remember thinking how
courageous the man was to lead a full life with only one arm and
how great technology must be in the United States to produce such a
fake arm. It was a sign, I thought then, of good things to come.
 &HT;    My father and uncle stayed behind on the damaged Valley Chief
while my mother, my sister and I boarded the Ma$ana. I tried to
help in the kitchen making sandwiches, but someone called me up to
the deck so I would not miss the last views of Cuba _ the faint
edge of a low green hill and the masts of the boats swaying in the
breeze. It was a little after 6 p.m., four days after we had left
home.
 &HT;    Before Cuba had completely disappeared from my view, I began to
throw up. There is little I remember after that. I was sick the
entire night, curled up on the wet floor next to my sister, who was
also sick. While everyone slept, strewn about the boat, my mother
kept a vigil over my sister and me. She was 40 years old and, for
the first time in her life, alone with her daughters. She had never
been on a boat before, feared the water and didn't know how to
swim. Both her daughters were seasick practically to the point of
unconsciousness and she was silenced by her lack of English.
 &HT;    At about 3 a.m., I awoke with a violent stomach spasm. I was
totally disoriented. I did not know where my head was or in what
direction my feet were pointing. I wondered if someone had moved my
bed. Then I realized I was not in my bed.
 &HT;    ``What's wrong?'' my mother asked. I thought for a minute what
to say. I was cold and hungry. I had an intense pain in my bladder
from not going to the bathroom for so long. I could not feel my
legs. My head hurt, as did my throat and stomach, from retching all
night long. My clothes were dirty; my hair was matted. I had not
changed or washed in five days. I felt like crying, but I was so
dizzy that I could not even cry. And of course, pain of all pains,
I had left Cuba.
 &HT;    ``Nothing,'' I told my mother. ``I'm OK.''
 &HT;    It was already Sunday, May 11, Mother's Day. I remember thinking
that my mother was not going to get a card. I had mailed her one
the day before we left our house. It was probably already under the
door. I reminded my mother that it was her day and went back to my
stupor. In a few hours we reached the United States.
 &HT;    So thick was the fog of seasickness that I don't remember seeing
land until I actually stepped on the docks at Key West. I don't
remember feeling anxious, hopeful or expectant. I only remember the
nausea that tortured my empty, pained stomach. The moment I stepped
on land, though, the queasiness disappeared and I started to think
of ways to find my father and uncle.
 &HT;    In the day and one night we had spent on the Valley Chief, my
uncle had taught me his phone number in Florida and I had memorized
it. I still remember it, although he moved from that house years
ago. I gave a volunteer the number and asked her to call my aunt
Tere. We formed yet another line and from there boarded buses to
what looked like a giant warehouse, outfitted for thousands of
people. The floor was lined with cots, row after row of them. There
was a lot of food, soda and gum. And there were clean bathrooms.
 &HT;    On my way to one of the yellow portables, someone called my
name. It was my high school literature professor, a blond woman
with blue eyes and delicate features who had always been highly
critical of people who did not support the regime. I turned my head
the other way. I think I was embarrassed that I had left Cuba and
someone had caught me in the act. Never mind that she, too, had
left. At that point my departure still seemed like an act of
treason. Against what? I didn't know.
 &HT;    We huddled in one cot and waited. At about 8 p.m. we heard our
names called through a bullhorn. As we moved toward the voice, we
saw Tere and her children, jumping for joy. ``There they are!! They
are here!'' Tere kept yelling as she hugged the three of us.
 &HT;    Sometime that night my father and my uncle found us. The Coast
Guard had rescued them from the foundering Valley Chief, and my
father had arrived in the United States in style, after all. A
helicopter had picked them up from the deck of a huge Navy ship and
taken them to a landing strip in Key West. The Valley Chief had
been towed back to the Keys. Together, at last, we arrived the next
morning at my uncle's house in Hialeah.
 &HT;    To me, accustomed to seeing photographs of my relatives in New
York, Hialeah was a major disappointment. There were no tall
buildings, no interesting architecture, no sense of a city, really.
And of course, there was no snow. I remember the summer of 1980 as
the longest and the hottest I have ever lived through, despite the
constant humming of air-conditioning in every house.
 &HT;    A couple of days after we arrived we had to go to an office to
register our presence in the United States. Our lungs were X-rayed
and we went through a series of interviews. At the first table, a
bald man who spoke Spanish asked our names individually. Before I
could tell him, though, he said I could choose any name I wanted. I
did not have to give him my real name. ``You are in America now,''
he said. ``You can forget the past and begin anew.'' I took his
advice and began a new life. But I kept my name and I have never
forgotten.
 &HT;    On Sept. 25, 1980, Cuba ended the boat lift. Even Castro became
embarrassed by the spectacle of so many people clamoring to leave
the island. In all, 125,266 Cubans came to America on 2,011 vessels
and one aircraft. I went on to graduate from Florida Atlantic
University and started a career in journalism that took me from The
Miami Herald to The New York Times.
 &HT;    Today Mariel is just a town lying perpetually under a cloud of
dust spewed by a cement factory nearby. At the port itself, there
is a geothermal power plant, situated inside a military compound,
off limits to civilians. The former Peruvian Embassy is now the
parking lot of a nondescript five-story hotel for businesspeople
and tourists. No Cubans are allowed. Twenty years later most Mariel
refugees are successful men and women who blend in with other
Cuban-Americans in Miami and elsewhere. Among them are writers,
television anchormen, entrepreneurs, public relations experts,
Disney World executives, restaurant owners, engineers, retirees,
homemakers.
 &HT;    But 1,750 ``Marielitos'' remain under the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for crimes committed in the
United States; 1,425 have been sent back to Cuba. When, in 1994,
the Cuban government seemed on the verge of playing its Mariel card
once again, President Bill Clinton, in his first term, did what
Carter had been unable or unwilling to do 14 years before. He
ordered the Navy to intercept all refugees and take them to
Guant namo Bay, the American military base in Cuba, and announced
that they would never come to America.
 &HT;    Eventually, most of the 30,000 rafters held at the base did make
it here. But by denying them immediate entry, Clinton reversed
decades of immigration policy toward Cuba. Since then, Cubans
intercepted in the water are routinely returned to the island. This
remarkable policy shift went practically unnoticed. No protests in
the streets of Miami. No outcry from the pro-immigration lobby. No
matter how much the boat lift has done for thousands of people like
me, it was clear that no one else _ not Washington, not Havana, not
even the Cuban exiles _ wanted another Mariel.

 (PART I OF A 3-PART SERIES.)  
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Early on the evening of Nov. 22, Juan Miguel Gonzalez came home
from work to find his family in a panic. His mother was trying to
tell him something, but couldn't seem to get it out. Finally, she
took him into the kitchen and gave him the news: his former wife,
Elisabeth, and their 5-year-old son, Elian, were nowhere to be
found. The boy had been unaccountably absent from school that day,
and one of Elisabeth's friends had told the family there were
rumors that she had taken the child on a boat and left for la Yuma,
the United States.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel grabbed his younger brother, Tony, and took off
across Cardenas, the town on Cuba's north coast where they have
lived all their lives. When they arrived at the apartment Elisabeth
and Elian shared with her boyfriend, the door was locked; no one
was home. They went on to the apartment where the boyfriend's
parents lived, but no one was there either, and neighbors said the
family had sold its furniture and disappeared. Everyone assumed
that like so many Cubans before them, they had headed for the
Florida coast.
 &HT;    At 9:01 that night, Juan Miguel's father, Juan, called collect
to relatives in Miami. In the elaborate case put forward by the
lawyers and politicians who sought to keep the boy in the United
States, the phone bill for the call has been waved about as
evidence that Juan Miguel, 31, might have known in advance of plans
for the furtive crossing _ that he might actually have given his
approval so that his son could live in freedom. But even the
relatives who would later fight him for the custody of Elian recall
the conversation differently. ``They were worried,'' said Lazaro
Gonzalez, one of Juan Miguel's uncles. ``The mother had left with
the boy in some sort of boat.''
 &HT;    What is, in fact, clear about that first call, and the flurry of
others that followed it, is something that was easily lost in the
ensuing controversy: Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not hesitate to turn
to his aunts and uncles in Miami for help in the crisis, and they
did not hesitate to help him. The next day, Lazaro said, he bought
a $10 telephone card and called to reassure the family that such
trips often took a few days and that he would look out for the boy.
Finally, on Thanksgiving, the Miami relatives phoned Cuba with the
news that Elian had been pulled from the sea by a couple of
fishermen. Later, after visiting him at a hospital near Fort
Lauderdale, Lazaro called again to tell them that the boy's mother
had perished but that Elian had survived the ordeal astonishingly
well.
 &HT;    On Friday, Nov. 26, Juan Miguel's father spoke to his eldest
sister, Caridad, in Miami. Television news crews had already turned
up at the hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American
politicians offering their support. With all the attention, Caridad
had begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's
rescue: that her brother and his family might finally have a reason
to leave Cuba and join the rest of the Gonzalezes in the United
States.
 &HT;    ``I told him he should grab a visa and one for his wife and
another for Juan Miguel and come here right away,'' said Caridad, a
slender, elegant looking woman in her late 60s. ``It seemed like
they wanted to come; he said he would give an answer. I think they
started preparing their papers. But then they called back later and
said some functionary of the government would be coming to get the
boy.'' From the moment Caridad hung up the phone, her brother and
nephew began to slip from their relatives' view, leaving nothing
between Miami and Fidel Castro but a skinny little boy, now 6.
 &HT;    Yet even among the quiet minority of Gonzalezes in Miami who
tried again and again to persuade their family members to give the
boy back to his father, there has always been a charitable
explanation for what happened next. They say that starting with
Caridad and her brother Delfin, Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles
first thought of keeping Elian in the United States partly as a way
to pull the family together.
 &HT;    ``The obsession of her life has been to have the whole family
here,'' one of Caridad's nephews in Miami told me last month.
``That has been her reason for living. The idea was to use the boy
to bring the others here.'' However difficult it may be to think of
the struggle over Elian as the product of a misguided effort at
family reunification, it might once have been no easier to imagine
what it would take to break the Gonzalezes apart.
 &HT;    In the 41 years since Castro came to power, the family has held
together through political differences and personal tragedies,
long, painful separations and assorted family spats. Even now, it
is hard to have a conversation in either country without hearing
one of the Gonzalezes talk about how things used to be. ``Eramos
siempre tan unidos,'' they say. ``We were always close.''
 &HT;    The Gonzalezes have not been generous with their past. On either
side of the fight, they have surrendered only the simplest pieces
of their history, sometimes adopting the accounts of their new
allies rather than expose something more personal. In Miami as in
Cardenas, there have been party lines. And in the absence of any
real change in Cuba, or in Cuba's relationship with the United
States, they have been easy proxies for political adversaries that
know each other well.
 &HT;    Yet before the men started wearing suits and the women got
makeovers and everyone began speaking from prepared texts, the
Gonzalezes were like countless other Cuban families, divided by
geography and politics but also struggling in endless small ways to
bridge the Straits of Florida. Their choices _ even about whether
to stay in Cuba or leave _ have often been more personal than
ideological. Brothers and cousins a few years apart have seen the
country through different eyes, and their loyalties have been
shaped as much by their personalities as their ideals.
 &HT;    Before Elian, the faults that ran through the Gonzalez family
had less to do with political history than with telephone calls and
care packages and things said in anger that were never quite
forgotten. Now, however, the cold war has come to this: in the last
bitter days of the struggle over Elian, Juan Miguel's uncle Delfin,
62, stands behind a police line in Bethesda, Md., with one of Juan
Miguel's cousins, Alfredo Martell, who is 28. Speaking through a
translator, they tell one television news crew after another that
they just want a chance to talk to Juan Miguel, to work things out.
 &HT;    Delfin mentions that he is Juan Miguel's godfather; Alfredo and
Juan Miguel grew up together in the same house. Juan Miguel may be
within earshot of where they stand. But if so, he is somewhere in
the residence of the Cuban government's chief envoy to Washington,
and if he is watching on television, he is surrounded by Cuban
officials who would hurry to point out the man from the Cuban
American National Foundation, the most powerful anti-Castro
political group in the United States. He is the heavyset guy
standing directly behind Delf!n and Alfredo, the one translating
what they say.
 &HT;    Cardenas, where the story begins, is in some ways a logical
setting: it sits due south of the Florida Keys, in the path of
currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate migrants to
the United States. Though it is only two and a half hours east of
Havana, the town feels more distant. At rush hour, if it can be
called that, the main streets are a tangle of horse carts and
bicycles and vintage American sedans.
 &HT;    When most of its elegant colonial facades were built in the 19th
century, Cardenas was a thriving sugar town, a well-heeled neighbor
to the sophisticated port city of Matanzas. But the boom ended
before the century was over, a victim of the long fight to evict
Spain. By the time Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio
Batista in 1959, the most strategic thing about Cardenas was
probably its rum distillery.
 &HT;    For the most part, Cardenas was remote from the centers of the
uprising. But it was by no means removed from the upheaval that
followed. Juan Miguel's grandparents, Luis and Georgina, weathered
the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a stevedore at
the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children _ Juan Miguel's
father, aunts and uncles _ had a tougher time. Their eldest son,
Jose Luis, bought into the best cafeteria in town, the Cosmopolita,
only to have it confiscated by the new government. Others struggled
to find any work at all.
 &HT;    Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20s, was among those in
the family with great hopes for the revolution. ``I think I
supported them for about a month,'' he said of the Communists.
``When I saw the injustices that were being committed, I knew that
it wasn't going to be the right thing for Cuba.'' Though many of
his friends had joined the new government, he did not hesitate to
attack it in their presence. Eventually, he began conspiring
against the new regime.
 &HT;    On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with
subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and his mother,
especially, was devastated. Pina, as everyone called her, took down
the large framed photograph of Castro that she had put up on the
living-room wall. She also tried her best to banish politics from
the family's crowded home at No. 170 Cossio St.
 &HT;    ``When something would happen in politics, my uncles would
always want to discuss it,'' the eldest of Juan Miguel's cousins,
Jose Antonio, recalled. ``But anytime things got a little hot, my
grandmother intervened. She would say: 'You are brothers. You are a
family. Stay away from politics.''' Later, several of Juan Miguel's
aunts and uncles would remember 1962 as the year they began
thinking about a new life outside of Cuba.
 &HT;    One aunt saw her husband hauled off to prison with Delfin.
Another uncle, Manuel, or Manolo, as he is known, married and
resolved to try to raise his family in the United States. For
Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat for
Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and requited
love. In September 1965, Castro announced that Cubans with
relatives in the United States would be free to leave. By
Christmas, chartered American planes were flying twice a day out of
an airport 16 miles from the Gonzalez home, near the beach resort
of Varadero. In April, Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress,
boarded one of the so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami by
herself, crying the whole way. She was among more than 17,000
Cubans to make the trip that year, one of almost 300,000 who left
before Castro halted the flights in 1973.
 &HT;    Although Caridad promised Pina that she would eventually send
for everyone, the others had little choice but to make do. ``It's
like a chain,'' said the youngest of Juan Miguel's aunts, Haydee,
56, as she sat in the small home in Cardenas where she has lived
alone since the death of her husband and the departure of two of
her three children to Miami. ``Your husband has his family. You
have children, and then they have their families. You can't leave
just like that.''
 &HT;    Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria. Manolo trained as a
mechanic and found work repairing boat motors for a fishing
cooperative _ thinking every day, he said, about how easy it might
be to gather his family and disappear in the night. Lazaro emerged
as a talented young gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources
into its sports program; early on, he was in some ways the
luckiest. Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela, eventually became a clerk
in the local courts, and his father, Juan, took a job as a police
investigator in the interior ministry. It was a career choice that
not all his siblings appreciated.
 &HT;    ``Think about it,'' said Delfin, who had at the time just been
freed from a nightmarish series of prisons. ``I criticized him a
lot. I'd ask: 'Why are you doing that? There is other work around.
Leave that alone.''' Unable to find a decent job and unwilling to
stifle his complaints, Delfin grew rice in the mangrove swamps and
waged a long, low-intensity conflict with the state. In 1979, with
Caridad's help, he got a visa and came to the United States just
months before his mother's death.
 &HT;    Not long after, Castro opened the doors again, and thousands of
Cubans left for the United States in the Mariel boat lift. Some of
the Gonzalezes bought new suitcases and packed up their belongings.
But in the chaos, they hesitated and were ultimately unable to
leave. Shortly thereafter, Caridad received U.S. citzenship, and
members of the family got ready again. Even with money sent by
Delfin, the passage wasn't easy. One of Juan Miguel's aunts brought
her family in 1983, and Luis, the family patriarch, followed her
the next spring.
 &HT;    Manolo and Lazaro took their families to Costa Rica in August
1984 and applied for American visas there. It was an agonizing trip
in which the two brothers had to leave their wives and children
behind for months while they went to the United States to establish
residency. Almost all of the Gonzalezes moved at first into the
insular world of Little Havana. Speaking almost no English, they
shopped at Latin-owned stores, gossiped at Cuban coffee stands and
got their news from Spanish-language radio and television stations
that mirrored the zealous politics they had left behind in Cuba.
The emigre culture that received them had begun to grow more
diverse with the influx of the younger, more liberal Marielitos.
But at the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were coming into
their own as an American political force.
 &HT;    In Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing the
country differently. Although the oldest of Juan Miguel's cousins
was only seven years younger than his uncle Lazaro, none of them
knew a world before Fidel. In the late 1960s and '70s, when some of
Juan Miguel's uncles were growing bitter, when his aunts felt like
outcasts for going to church, some of their children seem to have
thrived. What they remember now, more than the uniforms they wore
or the revolutionary songs they were made to learn in school, is
their life in the crowded house on Cossio Street.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't just on birthdays and Christmas _ it was every
night,'' Juan Miguel's cousin Lourdes Martell said. ``All of us,
the cousins, were together all the time.''
 &HT;    The opportunities they had varied. Like thousands of other young
Cubans of his generation, Juan Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose
Antonio, became the first member of his family to attend college,
earning a degree from the University of Matanzas that led him to a
job with the ministry of agriculture. His sister Milagros had a
less successful experience with the educational bureaucracy.
Considered for a coveted scholarship to art school, she was
rejected after an official came to her home for an interview and
saw a picture of Christ displayed on the wall.
 &HT;    But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion
his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel.
Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of
Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it
presented: attending political rallies, volunteering to work on the
agricultural harvest, keeping an eye on the ``revolutionary
morale'' of his comrades. He became a full member of the Cuban
Communist Party at the tender age of 24, an achievement he called
``the proudest thing that can happen to you.''
 &HT;    Like his father, Juan Miguel also fell in love with a woman who
seemed to share his commitment to the revolution. In September
1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at her friend Ismary Pruneda's
quincea$era, the Latin equivalent of a sweet 16 party, and they
soon fell in love. Juan Miguel's friends remember him then as a
funny, gregarious kid of 15. Elisa, as everyone called her, was 14:
a pretty, diffident girl with black hair and a nice smile. ``She
talked so softly that you always had to tell her to speak up,''
Ismary said.
 &HT;    In a town that even now feels more country than city, and in a
country where sex and love are often the most available freedoms,
no one seems to have worried much that the novios might be too
young. ``They were little kids, but it was different,'' Elisa's
mother, Raquel Rodriguez, said, not quite explaining the
difference. ``Today, two kids get married that young and it lasts a
few months. That didn't happen with them.''
 &HT;    When they did marry, Elisa was just shy of 16, Juan Miguel not
yet 17. She rented a white dress from the Palace of Brides on the
Calle Real, the main drag in Cardenas, and they borrowed an elegant
old car to drive to the ceremony. In the fading black-and-white
photographs that Raquel Rodriguez now keeps in a plain cardboard
box, they toast each other with Champagne _ Elisa with a shy smile
and feathered, Farrah Fawcett hair; Juan Miguel in a dark suit with
both buttons buttoned and a wispy teen-age mustache.

 (PART II OF A 3-PART SERIES.)  
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    After Elisabeth Brotons and Juan Miguel Gonzalez were married,
they lived first with Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez, and her
second husband, Rolando, in an airy three-bedroom apartment above a
pharmacy in the center of town. Elisa, an only child, seemed to
thrive among the Gonzalezes. Juan Miguel left school after 10th
grade and went to work in a paper factory, training to become an
electrician. Before their marriage, Elisa had started a secretarial
program at a live-in vocational school in a town an hour away, but
she had become homesick and quit. Eventually, Elisa and Juan Miguel
went to night school to earn their high school degrees.
 &HT;    While he completed his three years of military service with an
army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational
school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and
restaurants. Her timing couldn't have been better. Varadero, a long
ribbon of white-sand beach that extends out from the coast 10 miles
west of Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Fidel Castro's
reluctant effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of
the Soviet Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned
by foreign companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the
country.
 &HT;    Soon, the resort was providing enough dollars to make Cardenas
one of the most prosperous towns in Cuba. By the time Elisa
finished hotel school, the classes were filling up with Cuba's best
and brightest, those who could have chosen medicine or physics but
realized that the country's most lucrative jobs would be tending
bar and carrying tourists' bags. Like the scratchy signals of AM
radio stations and the television broadcasts that people in
Cardenas pull down from Miami on homemade antennas, Varadero was
also a window on the outside world. Kids from Cardenas would
hitchhike just to watch the tourists play Pac-Man or use Coke
machines.
 &HT;    ``You knew there were places called Canada and Spain and New
York because you learned about them in geography class,'' Juan
Miguel's cousin, Jose Antonio, 42, said. ``But when the tourists
started coming, we would go and stand next to them and just sniff.
And after all those years of the same soap, they smelled
different.''
 &HT;    In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest
Varadero hotel, the Paradiso-Punta Arenas. The job wasn't
glamorous, and there was a catch: the all-inclusive resort
discouraged tipping and it attracted mostly low-budget tourists on
package trips. But the wages were excellent by Cuban standards, and
they were augmented by a steady flow of precious gifts from the
guests _ half-empty bottles of rum, shampoo and cosmetics and
not-so-old clothes.
 &HT;    ``She said that job was her salvation,'' said Ismary Pruneda,
who finished the secretarial program they had started together and
ended up hawking pork sandwiches at a farmer's market. ``She would
say to me, 'Do you think I like cleaning floors?' She did it
because she could live decently from that. I had struggled so much
to finish, and there I was, 9 or 10 hours a day, yelling, 'Pork
meat!'''
 &HT;    Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, at Josone Park, the
co estate of a Basque immigrant who ran the Havana Club
distillery in Cardenas before the revolution. Starting on the
maintenance crew, Juan Miguel worked his way up to the admission
booth, and he shared in the tips that the waiters and bartenders
pooled. Eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky
1956 Nash Rambler and to build a home for themselves beside the
house on Cossio Street. They watched videos on a hard-earned VCR
and drove to the beach in Varadero on weekends.
 &HT;    On the surface, at least, the couple remained steadfast
fidelistas. Elisa was by all accounts a diligent maid, and although
she was more muted about her politics than Juan Miguel, she, too,
became a party member and the secretary of the Communist Party
committee at her job. It was not coincidental that those working in
Varadero (who now include perhaps a fifth of the Cardenas labor
force) tended to be loyal revolutionaries. They showed a proud face
to foreign visitors and could be trusted to cope with the new
economy's darker side: rampant prostitution, petty theft by hotel
employees and a kind of tourism apartheid in which ordinary Cubans
were often barred from the restaurants and nightclubs where they
themselves worked.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel's cousin, Alfredo, became a hotel security guard and
earned much of his income from older foreign men who tipped him to
let them sneak young Cuban women into their rooms. They were women
whose faces he says he cannot forget. ``They would come to you
sometimes and say, 'Hey, look, I'm only doing this because I have
kids to feed or because my mother is sick,''' he said. ``That kind
of stuff hits you and hits you until you finally say, 'I am getting
out of here or I am going to die in the ocean trying.'''
 &HT;    After years of growing prosperity in the 1980s, Castro had
announced the ``Special Period in Time of Peace,'' an official
euphemism for economic disaster. Even with the cushion of their
Varadero jobs, the Gonzalezes had to make charcoal or scavenge for
crude oil in order to cook their meals. Alfredo, who did his
military service in the Cardenas police, saw the turmoil there
through the eyes of his uncle Juan, 54, a proud, easygoing man who
had always got along with the regime as he had with his brothers
and sisters.
 &HT;    ``Anybody who tried to sell things to get by, the cops took it
away,'' Alfredo said. ``When the lights went out, people would
throw bottles at us. Once upon a time, Juan was one of them. But
after the special period, he saw that things were not the way Fidel
said they were.'' Alfredo recalled one day when there was nothing
to eat and his uncle scrounged up a piece of bread, cut some grass
from the yard with a knife and made a sandwich of it. He ate it and
then threw up. Without telling his family, Juan Miguel's younger
brother, Tony, 25, applied for an American visa. When it was
granted, Juan Miguel and his mother talked him out of going, Juan
Miguel told me.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel and Elisa had other problems as well. From the time
she was 16 or 17, they struggled to have a child, losing four
pregnancies in succession. In 1989, she was found to have a
bacterial parasite that was thought to have caused her recurrent
miscarriages. Even after she was treated, she lost three more
pregnancies _ one of them at seven months. Under the rationing
system that governs the allocation of everything from children's
milk to gifts for newlyweds, expectant Cuban women could buy a crib
and a mattress in state stores. Elisa bought the items again and
again, her friend Ismary said. ``Later, she would have to sell them
because she couldn't handle the memories.''
 &HT;    After several years of marriage, Elisa and Juan Miguel had also
begun to drift apart. Friends saw them as having less and less in
common: she loved clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked
hanging out with friends. ``When they met, it was all dreamy, but
at that age, the same things don't matter that matter later on,''
said Marta Elena Hidalgo, the wife of one of Juan Miguel's closest
friends. ``Years later, they weren't alike at all. He is this
playful, outgoing guy, and she was a girl who was very low key,
very reserved.''
 &HT;    Juan Miguel, who liked to spend some of his comfortable salary
at bars and discotheques, began to go with other women. Sitting
around the dining-room table recently with his parents, his second
wife, Nersy, 23, and their infant son, Hianny, Juan Miguel spoke
uneasily about the breakup of his first marriage, mentioning the
long, stressful effort to have a child. His mother reminded him of
another issue. ``Yeah, it was mostly because of the way I was,'' he
said. ``How to put it? It was probably my fooling around with other
women, being on the street.''
 &HT;    Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later,
they were living together again. ``We had always wanted to have a
child,'' Juan Miguel said. ``We got together again to see if we
could do it. And finally we did.'' After months of bed rest and
prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993. The couple had
known from the sonograms that they were expecting a boy, and they
made up their own name for him, using the first three letters of
Elisa and the last two of Juan.
 &HT;    In his excitement, Juan Miguel couldn't wait for Elisa to return
from the hospital to start celebrating. ``I told them to wait,''
her mother, Raquel, 51, said. ``But he couldn't stop himself.
Elisa's half-brother had gotten this pig, and he slaughtered it
right then, and they started frying pork rinds and drinking beer
and rum with their friends. They had the party without us.''
 &HT;    Now, at least, it is impossible to find anyone who knew the
couple well who does not describe both young parents as having
cherished Elian. The games and toys that fill his rooms at Raquel's
apartment and on Cossio Street might not look like much to a kid
now hooked on Nintendo, but they must have looked extravagant to
his playmates.
 &HT;    ``Other kids around here may be in a difficult situation,'' said
Juan Miguel's cousin, Lourdes, who is Elian's godmother. ``But
there was nothing that boy wanted that he didn't have.'' For a
while, some of their friends said, the little boy with his father's
eyes and his mother's nose seemed to hold the couple together. But
after a while, the relationship buckled again.
 &HT;    As much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she told her
girlfriends, she was tired of his running around. Juan Miguel, for
his part, said he felt different, too. ``She was like a sister to
me,'' he said. In February 1997, 11 years after they were married
and two months after Elian's third birthday, they separated for
good.
 &HT;    ``It was the same as before,'' Juan Miguel's mother, Mariela,
51, said, looking sadly at her son. ``The same motive.''
 &HT;    Elisa moved back in with her mother and Rolando, in the
apartment above the pharmacy, a short walk from Cossio Street.
According to several of her friends and several of Juan Miguel's,
she not only shared custody of the boy but also remained close to
her former in-laws. And she had a significant example: her mother,
Raquel, had remained on such good terms with Elisa's father that
she would go to parties with her husband and ex-husband on either
arm. Elisa's close friend Lisbeth Garcia said that Elisa and Juan
Miguel sometimes fought over Elian but that they generally did an
admirable job of remaining friends after the split.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I told her that they got along better as friends
than they did at the end of their marriage,'' she said. Still,
Lisbeth and others remember the months after the divorce as a
deeply lonely time for Elisa. She and Lisbeth worked long hours at
the hotel, often arriving home after 8 p.m., and Elisa seemed to
miss the bustle and warmth of Cossio Street. It made it worse that
Juan Miguel seemed to meet lots of other women and that his job
gave him a little more time to spend with Elian.
 &HT;    On Saturdays and school holidays, Juan Miguel would take the boy
with him to the park, and on the mornings after Elian stayed over
at Cossio Street, they had a long ritual of ``little hugs'' to mark
their goodbyes. ``There were times we almost missed the bus because
Juan Miguel would spend 10 minutes saying goodbye, doing those
little hugs,'' said his friend Fidel Ramirez, who has worked with
him at the park for a decade.
 &HT;    Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, her
friend Lisbeth said. They had gone out after work to a Varadero
nightspot, the Havana Club. As they danced, several women together,
a young man approached them and asked if he could join. Lisbeth
agreed; she recognized him as El Loco, a guy she had seen around in
Cardenas. After a while, Lisbeth and another friend went to the
bathroom, leaving Elisa and the man, Lazaro Rafael Munero, on the
dance floor. By the time they got back, Lisbeth said, Elisa had
found a new friend.
 &HT;    Rafa, as they called him, showed no sign of the temper that
apparently earned him his nickname. When the group decided to
continue on to a second nightclub, he offered to pay for a taxi.
Then he drove them home in his own car, first dropping off Lisbeth,
her sister and her cousin and then leaving Elisa at the apartment
above the pharmacy. ``I don't think a week went by before they got
together,'' Lisbeth said. ``Within about two months, he went to
live with her at Raquel's house.''
 &HT;    To her mother and some of her friends, that seemed too fast. But
Elisa insisted that she had found a good man. The son of an oil
worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18,
he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel
room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When
he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft
drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the
Varadero hotels.
 &HT;    Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver, shuttling between
Cardenas and Varadero without a license in a country that makes a
very big thing of licenses. But Munero was also a master in the
Cuban art of resolviendo, or getting hold of things, and he had
little trouble winning Elisa's heart. ``He knew how to work her,''
Lisbeth recalled. ``He was always very close to her, very
affectionate, very attentive. And little by little, she fell for
him.''
 &HT;    In the storm of propaganda that began soon after Elian's rescue,
no one has been hit harder than Munero, who also died in the
crossing. Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist
Party, described him this way: Munero was a bad kid. When he
dropped out of school, after picking fights with all sorts of
classmates, it was ``to undertake a criminal career.'' When he was
with Elisa, the paper quotes a friend of hers, she would turn up
with a black eye one day, a swollen wrist the next. ``Munero,'' the
report says, ``with his dominating and violent personality, exerted
a strange and fatal influence over Elisabeth.''
 &HT;    But as with much of the story, some of the same people cited in
the official account later described Munero in softer, more complex
terms. Dayana Oceguera, his jilted former girlfriend and another
bright Young Communist in excellent standing, described him as a
guy who came on strong and was very sure about things, like his
desire for her to quit her studies (which she refused to do) and
have his child (which she did). He was a lousy father, she said,
but could be helpful in emergencies.
 &HT;    ``He wasn't such a terrible person,'' she said. ``He had a
strong character and a lot of complexes. If somebody looked at him
crosswise, he got mad about it.'' But she added: ``He was a very
family-oriented guy. If I got sick, he would take care of me. He
could `resolver' anything _ things that were possible and things
that were impossible.'' Even Juan Miguel seemed reluctant to pile
on. ``He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop
him off,'' he said of Munero. ``We got along with him all right.''

 (PART III OF A 3-PART SERIES.)  
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Less than a year after Lazaro Rafael Munero had moved in with
Elisabeth Brotons, he left Cuba in a small boat with three friends.
Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go with him
but that she refused.
 &HT;    In Miami, Munero lived with an aunt and worked 12-hour days at a
car wash for $5 an hour. He passed again and again on invitations
to go out after work, to the movies to meet girls, and no one seems
to have been impressed by his enthusiasm for America. Milagros
Garcia, the aunt with whom he stayed, thought it was the
loneliness, more than the hard work, that Munero couldn't take.
 &HT;    She recalled the day when Munero received a letter from Elisa
with three photographs. On the back of one, she wrote in a loopy,
girlish script: ``My Love: Keep this photo which is sent to you
with all of the affection that you deserve. From your Little One.''
On another, in which Elian stares out at the camera with his eyes
still wide, she wrote, ``For Munero, with all the affection of his
little boy, Elian.'' Munero was thrilled, his aunt said, but she
kidded him mercilessly. ``I said, 'Ay, Rafa, she's so ugly!' But he
couldn't hear that. He told me: 'Auntie, don't say that! I'm in
love!' I think he was obsessed with her.''
 &HT;    Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero asked his aunt
to hold some of his clothes and most of the $3,000 he had saved and
used the remainder to buy a motorized rubber raft. His relatives
tried repeatedly to dissuade him but could not. On Oct. 26, 1998,
he and another man were picked up by the Cuban Coast Guard as they
made their way into a bay in the central province of Villa Clara.
 &HT;    Munero spent the next two months there in prison, and Elisa's
friends said she visited him at least five times. Munero was
released on New Year's Eve, and he appears to have spent the
following weeks telling anyone who would listen that his trip north
had been a terrible mistake. Several people who saw him then said
they believed him; in Miami, his aunt would later say she had heard
that he was badly beaten by his jailers. For a time, Munero moved
back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment, but the arrangement
did not last.
 &HT;    Raquel Rodriguez says now that he was abusive to her daughter
and she would not stand for it. But while her views could be tinted
by both the loss of her daughter and pressure from the government,
she seems to have been clear, long before her daughter's death, of
her distaste for Elisa's young boyfriend. Not long after Munero's
return, the couple rented an apartment of their own and took Elian
with them.
 &HT;    Months later, they set off before dawn in a homemade boat with a
balky 50-horsepower motor: Elisa and Elian; Munero, his two
brothers and their parents; a friend of Elisa's, her husband and
his family; and a young couple with a 5-year-old girl. When engine
trouble forced the group back to shore for repairs, the young
couple had second thoughts and left the girl behind. Elisa kept
Elian aboard.
 &HT;    Five months later, there is nothing about Elisa's decision to
leave that is not contested in some way. In Miami, lawyers for the
Gonzalez family claim that she and Munero had been hounded by the
authorities because of his troubles with the law. In Cuba,
officials insist that Munero must have coerced Elisa into making
the trip. But if Elisa confided her thoughts to anyone who is still
alive, they have kept them to themselves.
 &HT;    In her silence, it didn't take long for Cubans on either side of
the Straits to seize on Elian as a metaphor for the country's
future. Juan Miguel remembers how quickly Cuban-American
politicians seemed to appear at his uncle's modest stucco home,
picking the boy up and holding him like a trophy. Only in their
first conversation after Elian was released from the hospital did
the boy ever speak about what had happened.
 &HT;    '''Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: 'Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: 'With all this, your life is set
here. With him having come on Thanksgiving and all that, they have
all kinds of money collected. They'll give you a house; they'll
give you a car. You won't have to work another day in your life.
The whole family can come with you.''' None of it was very
specific, Juan Miguel said, but several of his other aunts and
uncles called with similar pleas.
 &HT;    ``Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend
me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me how bad the
government here is, all that. And me _ I have my ideals. I told
them, 'There's nothing to talk about with you guys,' and I hung up
on them. They never said a thing about the boy staying there _ they
were just insisting that we should go there.'' Caridad called back
again and again, Juan Miguel said, and he hung up on her every
time. Delfin said he was the first of the Gonzalezes in Miami to
insist that Elian should not be sent home and that Lazaro and his
21-year-old daughter, Marisleysis, were the first to back him up.
 &HT;    ``At the beginning, the father and the family there probably
thought about coming here and meeting up with the child in a free
country,'' Delfin said. ``But then things got out of their hands.
We saw that the government was getting mixed up in something that
is none of its business.'' Caridad told her nephew, ``I came to
this country to bring Cubans here, not to send them back.''
 &HT;    Whatever their politics, none of the Gonzalezes were wrong to
suspect that their relatives were being swept up by forces bigger
than themselves. On Nov. 24, the day before Elian was found, Juan
Miguel's mother, Mariela, had already gone for help to her boss at
the city tribunals. He, in turn, had spoken to the first secretary
of the Communist Party in Cardenas, Ricardo Chapelin, who called
Juan Miguel in the next day.
 &HT;    ``He was desperate,'' Chapelin said. ``He said the mother had
taken the boy, and he was completely against it.'' By the time
Elian was rescued on the 25th, Juan Miguel had been put in touch
with the foreign ministry in Havana, which two days later sent the
United States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return.
 &HT;    Soon after that, Juan Miguel Gonzalez of No. 170 Cossio St.,
Cardenas, found himself face to face with the Comandante en Jefe.
Fidel Castro asked him how he felt about the situation and what he
wanted to do. ``He told me I could do what I pleased,'' Juan Miguel
said. ``If I wanted to leave, I could leave. Nonetheless, I told
him no. My decision was clear.''
 &HT;    Having taken the measure of his man, Castro was quick to
recognize the episode's political potential. Only two weeks before,
he had been embarrassed by criticism of his human rights record
from some of the Latin American leaders who attended a regional
summit in Havana. Now, he had an issue with the power to galvanize
not only the party faithful but also every Cuban parent and child
and millions of people abroad. It was an issue, as Cuban officials
were soon noting privately, that also had the potential to isolate
Miami's Cuban exiles from other Americans.
 &HT;    It is probably fair to assume that Juan Miguel would have been
willing to swim to Miami to pick up his son. Still, he may have
been stopped from going right away not so much to prevent his
defection (whatever the strength of his principles, his family
could always have been kept behind) but also because the Cuban
government was in no great hurry for the drama to end. Castro told
visitors as early as December that he expected the case to drag on
in American courts for months, and he has managed it accordingly,
ordering up protest rallies, television programs and ``Free Elian''
T-shirts on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Within weeks of his rescue, Elian had become the biggest
revolutionary symbol since Che. Castro's enemies were just as quick
to recognize a poster child when they saw one. Elian was not yet
out of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital before the first
Cuban-American politicos were on the scene, led by a Sharpton-esque
political strategist and public-relations man named Armando
Gutierrez.
 &HT;    ``We met with the family, and I told them, 'You're going to need
help,''' said Gutierrez, who rushed over with a couple of local
Cuban-American politicians. ``I didn't want to make it into a
political thing. When I saw Elian's face, I knew it was something
special.''
 &HT;    As in Cuba, it has grown steadily more difficult in Miami to
untangle the thoughts of Elian's relatives from those of their
advisers, lawyers and political hangers-on. The $600-a-month rental
where Lazaro lives with his wife and two grown children has been a
magnet for politicians of various anti-Castro stripes, and it has
been infused from the beginning with their mixed feelings of
victimization and entitlement.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities, advised them
on strategy and helped arrange what has thus far been a largely
no-show job for Lazaro, who had been unemployed, at the Ford
dealership of one of its directors. The foundation, with a team of
lawyers, also helped to assemble its own narrative of Elian's
flight to freedom. Their method was not entirely unlike that of
Castro's state-security operatives, who, according to several
Cubans, moved systematically through the Gonzalez family's world,
interviewing people, sifting their stories and picking out the
parts that might be most useful.
 &HT;    Lazaro, who brought Elian home from the hospital, became the
most ardent crusader for the boy's continued stay. But while he has
worked closely with the politicians in Miami and Washington, his
own politics have remained vague. Many of his relatives say they
had thought of him as one of the least politically minded of his
brothers, and his life in Cuba was not marked by open conflict with
the government. In 1977, he followed his brother Juan into the
Cuban National Police and then resigned suddenly four months later,
returning to his previous work as an athletic coach.
 &HT;    Officials of the Cuban government _ which has a clear interest
in maligning Lazaro's reputation _ said he had been forced out
after an investigation found him to have associated with
``homosexual elements,'' and they provided copies of police files
purportedly documenting the inquiry. Lazaro denied the assertions
as libelous propaganda. The television crews have also gravitated
to Lazaro's daughter, Marisleysis, an assistant bank-loan processor
with a remarkable capacity to summon her anguish for the cameras.
(She has been hospitalized eight times since November for what have
been vaguely described as anxiety and stress-related illnesses.)
But while Marisleysis quickly stepped forward as a surrogate mother
for Elian, her own mother, Angela, has kept almost entirely out of
sight. Nor has the media seen much of Jose and Luis Cid, another
set of Juan Miguel's cousins, who both have long records of
problems with the law. (Luis Cid is awaiting trial in the
strong-arm robbery of a tourist in Little Havana last year.)
 &HT;    Among the Gonzalez cousins who have been most important to the
story told in Miami is one who came from Cuba little more than a
year ago, Alfredo Martell. As a latter-day emigre, Alfredo might
have been expected to take a more nuanced view of the events
surrounding Elian. His mother and sister, who remain in Cardenas,
cannot understand why their own family in Miami has put Juan Miguel
through such agony. Instead, Alfredo has been a font of assertions
meant to undermine Juan Miguel: that Elian's father wanted to move
to America himself; that he sometimes beat up Elisa; that he, too,
felt betrayed by what has happened to Cuba over the last decade.
 &HT;    A little more than a year after Alfredo arrived in Florida on
his own small boat, he views the case with the clarity of a
convert. ``Sometimes, you think it would be better for the boy to
be with his father,'' said Alfredo, whose own son, Lazaro, 5, has
once again been playing with his cousin Elian. ``But his father
knows he is probably better off here. And the kid tells you
constantly that he doesn't want to go. You also have to think _ the
boy would not be sent back to Juan Miguel; he would go back to
Fidel.''
 &HT;    Senior Cuban officials deny this, of course. They have always
maintained that as soon as Elian arrived in Cardenas, they would
stop the demonstrations, take down the posters and end the daily
two-hour television blocks devoted to the case. The houses on Juan
Miguel's block, which the government painted over in bright colors,
would be allowed to fade; the little shrine in Elian's classroom
would go back to being a desk.
 &HT;    ``He needs to recover his privacy,'' said Ricardo Alarcon, the
Cuban official who has managed the case for Castro. ``We are going
to have to work on that, but with time, it will happen.''
 &HT;    But if Elian will be missed by ``Nightline'' and ``Crossfire,''
his resonance in Cuba will be more lasting. ``What is clear is that
he is going to continue to be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said
Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist Party chief in Cardenas. ``This
battle did not begin with Elian. Our struggle has been one of
challenging the government of the United States for its attacks
against our country. And we will continue with this struggle, which
is one that strengthens us in every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill. Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to
be weighing movie and book deals of various sorts. It is hard to
see most of the other Gonzalezes as anything but traumatized.
 &HT;    And but for Elian and Juan Miguel, none seem to have suffered
more than Juan Miguel's uncle Manolo and aunt America, who happened
to be in Spain on a long-planned trip in the days after Elian was
found. Of all the family members in the United States, they are the
ones who have remained closest to their relatives in Cuba, and they
are the ones who have tried hardest to persuade the others to give
Elian back to Juan Miguel.
 &HT;    Manolo says he cannot think about the boy now without
remembering the loss of his own son, Manuel Antonio, who died of
cancer 10 years ago at the age of 14. He has been hurt by the
shouts of ``Communist'' that he sometimes hears when he is
recognized on the street. But he said the worst of it came last
month on the last of his several trips to Lazaro's house, when his
brothers would not speak to him, Elian would not kiss him and no
one even tried to help him when he had to be rushed to the hospital
with chest pains.
 &HT;    ``What has happened, here I don't know,'' he said tearfully. ``I
never wanted that boy to go back to Cuba. I only wanted him to be
with his father.'' Manolo's wife, who sat beside him, started to
try to explain what he meant, but she, too, found herself at a
loss. ``From the beginning, this has been a family problem,'' she
said. ``Why could it not be resolved within the family?''

CHILDREN'S SHOW INCORPORATES LESSONS IN SIGN LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>

   On Monday ``Blue's Clues,'' the Nickelodeon TV series for
preschoolers, will focus the adventures of its puzzle-solving puppy
on a young girl who is deaf and in the process will teach its young
viewers how to say a handful of words in American Sign Language.
The episode will be the first of many episodes to use sign language
in a way that allows young viewers to learn some signing basics.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's episode, ``Signs,'' the host, Steve Burns, and the
bubbly girl puppy, Blue, discover clues around the house to
determine where Blue wants to have a snack. They visit a school for
deaf children and become part of a storybook where they meet a
young girl who is deaf. Burns and Blue are told a story in sign
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to teach kids sign language and show how relevant it
is to their world,'' said Angela Santomero, the show's chief writer
and one of its creators. ``We introduce an animated character who
is deaf, Carly. She'll do something like make the sign for
elephant, and we show an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a one-time diversity issue,'' Santomero said. ``Our
approach to education is mostly through repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Blue's Clues'' is structured as an interactive search
for clues in each episode, with pauses for the young audience to
figure out what Blue is doing, it differs from other educational
shows for preschoolers like ``Sesame Street,'' which for more than
20 years has featured a deaf character who uses sign language with
the muppets.
</P>
<P>
   Burns learned American Sign Language at the Lexington Center
School for the Deaf in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The actress Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, recorded a series of
public service announcements with Burns to promote the show's use
of sign language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ASL is incorporated naturally into the show, with all the
signs and gestures that Steve uses,'' said Adele Agin, the
executive director of vocational and mental health centers at
Lexington. ``It's a natural language for children because children
are so visually stimulated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous message out there,'' Agin added. ``The
message to deaf children is `you're valuable; you are part of this
society.' The message to hearing children is to be open-minded, to
be accepting, to be respectful to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other population it impacts is deaf children of hearing
parents and the hearing children of deaf parents. There is a
tremendous validation of the language, the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In each new episode of ``Blue Clues,'' five to 10 new signs will
be incorporated, said Stacey Levin, a spokeswoman for the show.
About seven signs will appear consistently in each episode, like
the signs for ``Blue'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing use of sign language and the interactive quality of
``Blues Clues'' _ Burns talks directly to the audience _ make it
different from other children's programs that have featured people
with physical challenges, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bravin, the associate director of development at
Lexington, watched ``Signs'' with his son, who is 2 and a half.
Bravin is deaf. His son can hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see his eyes pop out of his head,'' Bravin said in
American Sign Language as Agin translated. ``He said, `Daddy, I
must watch it again.'''

JUST ANOTHER JOB?

<P>
   The drive to unionize higher education is coming to a boil. The
United Auto Workers last week called a day-long strike at eight
campuses in California despite on-going contract negotiations. And
on Tuesday an election at New York University will determine
whether the UAW will represent graduate assistants there.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first-ever union election at a private university
_ and perhaps the starting gun for many more organizing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Union representation of graduate students has become common
enough at public universities in the United States. It exists in at
least ten state systems, including California, New York and
Massachusetts -- but state statutes considerably limit the scope of
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU election is the first to proceed under federal law,
which could insert the UAW as a third party into every potential
issue of academic judgement that exists between students and their
professors _ from grades to assignments to recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens next, the NYU episode will be a big testing
point for the US system of higher education. Research universities
are not just powerful engines of growth, as competitive as any
American industry. They are an important source of domestic values
and self-imagery as well.
</P>
<P>
   The basic facts are simple. NYU is a big, prosperous second- or
third-tier research university, organized into 13 different
schools, including a law school, a medical school, a business
school and a school of the arts. Of NYU's 35,000 students, some
16,000 are undergraduates, another 16,000 are seeking masters and
professional degrees and roughly 3,000 are PH.D candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1,600 graduate students serve as graduate assistants,
helping faculty members teach, grade papers and perform research.
These favored few receive cash (up to $20,000 a year), free tuition
(worth $20,000), and a discount at the university book store. If
they are headed for a Ph.D. (about half the total), they typically
spend two years taking courses, then must pass a qualifying exam
and spend three or more years to write a dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   The nub of the matter is this: Are they students? Or employees?
</P>
<P>
   The university says assistanceships are a vital part of
students' training, for teaching and doing research are what the
doctorate is about (though of course increasing numbers of PH.D.s
go into industry or government work.) Thus an research assistant
becomes a better researcher by doing research for her or his
professor; a teaching assistant learns to teach by teaching. The
deeper skills are acquired through one-on-one interaction with a
professor. They can be learned well no other way.
</P>
<P>
   The students, at least those who organized the affiliation
campaign, see it differently. They view themselves as cogs in a
system, a captive pool of cheap labor, easily exploited, ignored
and neglected. They want smaller workloads, bigger stipends, paid
health care and subsidized housing. A small cadre are canvassing
eligible voters department-to-department, dorm-to-dorm.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW agrees _ and has quickly sought to link the graduate
student election to attempts to force NYU to use union labor in the
construction of a new dorm, as well as to negotiate a new contract
for the university's clerical workers. Lisa Jessup, the UAW
organizer for student elections, told a rally the other day, ``They
need to understand the word `rat.' They're not a `private
university in the public service.' They're a rat corporation in the
service of scabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The regional director of the National Labor Relations Board
sided with the students who petitioned for an election. Reversing
25 years of precedent, Daniel Silverman ruled earlier this month
that NYU students in fact were employees and therefore entitled to
vote on whether to join the Autoworkers. He cited an NLRB decision
last year that permitted interns and residents at the Boston
Medical Center to organize.
</P>
<P>
   NYU quickly appealed the case to the full Labor Board. For one
thing, the university argued, the precedent was ill-applied. The
situations were reversed. Boston Medical house staff spend 80
percent of their time caring for patients and just 20 percent in
lectures, conferences and classes, whereas NYU assistants spend
just 15 percent of their time on their assistanceships and the
other 85 percent on their own work.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the regional director's willingness to exclude 225
science students from the prospective bargaining unit on grounds
that their support comes from the government instead of the
university smacks, at worst, of gerrymandering, university
officials said. The NLRB refused to stay the election, but it yet
decide to count the ballots only after deciding the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The unionization of higher education is the latest wrinkle in
the great enthusiasm for market metaphors that has swept through
the industrial democracies like a religious revival in the last 25
years. The campaign to act on similiarities and to ignore
differences among social istitutions took American medicine by
storm in the 1990s in the great swing to ``managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   The market revolution's central claim _ that the provision of
health care is just like any other form of consumption and ought to
be treated as such _ today is being re-examined in many quarters.
Physicians are asking themselves whether they surrendered too
easily their unique professional authority and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that graduate students have been
ill-treated in recent years. The Yale ``grade strike'' in 1995 _
when undergraduates' grades were withheld _ established that. The
group at Yale never sought an election, and since then a cornucopia
of benefits has been made available to all graduate students, not
just paid assistants. New York University and most other private
universities have pursued similiar reforms in due course, creating
training programs and beefing up graduate student councils.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unionization has proceeded steadily in the public
universities, where state laws ordinarily stop short of granting
academic unions the same sweeping powers to bargain they would
enjoy under federal law. When UAW representation was won last year
in California after sixteen years of trying, some 10,000 graduate
assistants on eight campuses were added to the union rolls. That
brought union membership to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000
graduate assistants nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it is always easy. The California unions have
yet to sign their first contract, and last week's walkout had
little effect. In New York, a group of graduate student dissidents
in a unit of the Communications Workers of America is leading an
insurrection against statewide president Monazir Khan, who
retailiated by cancelling elections. In Massachusetts. Members of
the graduate employee organanization have petitioned the UAW for
permission to to separate from their current local and set up shop
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to imagine all sorts of unforseen consequences if
the unionization of private universities proceeds _ or if it
doesn't. For instance, students suddenly classified as employees
could find their tuition benefits subject to taxation, which is not
the case so long as it is described as financial aid. Then again,
universities could dispense with graduate assistants altogether,
preferring to hire out-of-work graduate students and post-docs as
``adjuct faculty'' instead, therefy dramatically restructuring the
Ph.D. Perhaps non-unionized universities' advantages in the
competition for the best students could be heightened _ and
unionized, mostly public universities could fall back.
</P>
<P>
   There are larger ramifications. Eight years of labor-friendly
appointments by the Clinton administration have made a difference
in the way the labor laws are administered. There is the prospect
of more change if Al Gore is elected president. The man behind the
attempt to organize the universities is John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO. The role of labor can safely be said to be a side
issue in nearly every Congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   That's why everyone concerned with higher education _ with
political economy generally _ will be watching on Tuesday, even if
we don't find out immediately what has happened that day.

   Satellite signals critical to military operations can be jammed
using cheap equipment from home improvement stores and electronics
fairs, a U.S. Air Force team has found. Instructions on how to
build the jammers were found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The team, known as the Space Aggressor Squadron, was set up to
look for weak spots in satellite communications and navigation
systems by playing the part of a potential enemy. By rummaging
around Web sites, books and magazines, the squadron, which is based
near Colorado Springs, Colo., monitors sensitive information in the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran a search on the Net and found there's quite a lot of
information out there on how to build and operate satellites but
also, unfortunately, on how to jam them,'' said Tim Marceau, head
of the squadron. ``Just type in 'satellite communications jamming,'
and you'll be surprised how many hits you get.''
</P>
<P>
   To test the accuracy of the information, Marceau ordered two
rookie engineers from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to
build a jamming system using only an Internet connection and
whatever they could buy for cash. The result was alarming: For
$7,500, the engineers lashed together a mobile ultrahigh-frequency,
high-power noise source that they could use to jam satellite
antennas or military UHF receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like turning your radio up louder than someone
else's,'' Marceau said.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers built their homemade jammer using a
gasoline-driven electricity generator, wood, plastic piping and
copper tubing. The amplification and noise-generation electronics
were obtained at an electronics enthusiasts' swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   Copper coils wrapped around the plastic pipes formed the
jammer's antenna, while the amplifier and generator sat beneath.
Loaded onto a pickup truck, the device makes an effective mobile
jammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For very little money and very little sophistication, we found
you could muck up communications,'' Marceau said.
</P>
<P>
   Different components could be used to jam other frequencies,
such as that of the Global Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of
American Scientists, agrees there's a lot of information on jamming
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's still a lot more available in hard copy if you
know where to look,'' Pike said. ``GPS is a very low-power signal,
so to jam reception of that is simple. It would take just a couple
of hours to work out how to make a bubble in which GPS receivers
won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pike doubts that similar home-built equipment could pose any
threat to modern extra-high-frequency global communications
satellite clusters, which he says are ``heroically resistant to
jamming.'' &QL;

   A hummingbird could soon be visiting the heavens _ in a manner
of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   NASA engineers want to build a space probe that behaves like a
hummingbird approaching a flower. It will use a touch-and-go
landing technique to capture and analyze samples from a comet's
central core for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Glenn Carle of the NASA Ames Research Center in
Moffett Field, Calif., is hoping to persuade NASA chiefs to press
ahead with its Hummingbird Comet Nucleus Analysis Mission. The Ames
team hopes to launch the probe sometime around 2005, to complement
three other NASA comet missions.
</P>
<P>
   Comets are at approximately 100 degress Kelvin, and scientists
believe they contain deep-frozen material from shortly after the
big bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is the most interesting question to answer is the
relationships of comets to material that ended up on the early
Earth and took part in the origin of life,'' Carle said. ``We just
don't know what we started with.''
</P>
<P>
   The space probe would be powered by an ion engine. Once it
reached the comet, it would orbit for up to a year taking samples
of the dust, ice and gases in the comet's atmosphere and analyzing
their composition and isotope ratios. During that period, the craft
would take detailed images to help the ground team choose a safe
touchdown spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the next phase of the mission, the craft would advance slowly
toward the comet's solid core, or nucleus, stopping frequently for
safety checks. But the craft would not land in the conventional
sense. Only two dangling tethers would make contact with the comet.
One tether, equipped with temperature, hardness and contact
sensors, would use electronics to sense certain conditions and
trigger a new type of sampling mechanism attached to the second
tether.
</P>
<P>
   The sampler has two counter-rotating carbide wheels with
sharpened blades that would grind up the surface of the comets and
kick chunks of the material into collection funnels on the
spacecraft. A prototype sampler is being built at Honeybee Robotics
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The hummingbird sampling cycle would take less than two seconds.
Then gas thrusters would fire and send the craft back to analyze
its samples as it orbits the comet. Ideally, the craft would repeat
this hummingbird maneuver as many as six times.
</P>
<P>
   As well as taking samples at many points on a comet nucleus, the
concept has several advantages. Comets have a tiny gravitational
field because their nuclei are only tens of kilometers across, so a
normal probe would have to latch onto the comet.
</P>
<P>
   The hummingbird probe's bump sampling would circumvent this
problem. Cutting down the time at the surface would also be safer,
since it means the probe would spend less time without sunlight and
channels of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the questions we have from 20 years ago still
exist,'' said William Boynton, an astronomer at the University of
Arizona in Tucson. ``We've flown by comets and taken a peek at
them, but we really have not even scratched the surface. It sounds
like this mission would scratch the surface, literally as well as
figuratively.'' &QL;

   Astronauts may one day be able to use their spacecraft's septic
tank to keep in touch with ground control _ as long as they have
plenty of sugar. Scientists in Michigan have developed a biofuel
cell that creates a constant, low-power electricity supply by
feeding glucose to common bacteria such as E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   Biochemists Gregory Zeikus and Doo Hyun Park at Michigan State
University in East Lansing have manipulated the bugs' metabolisms
to convert them into tiny powerhouses. They have built a 0.6-volt
biofuel cell that can deliver currents of as much as 17
milliamperes.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria normally break down glucose to generate adenosine
triphosphate _ the main energy source for cells. This involves a
flow of electrons, which the researchers have tapped into by adding
a chemical called neutral red.
</P>
<P>
   Molecules of neutral red insert themselves into the bacterial
membrane, where they hijack the reaction's electron-transport
process and shuttle electrons onto an electrode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an electric plug,'' Zeikus said. ``You put it in the
cell membrane and put the cells in a cathode to make electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   The method isn't likely to be powering your CD player any time
soon, but Zeikus said it could be used as a backup method of
maintaining communications in remote areas such as space. There is
a bonus: Because some of the bacteria's energy is diverted to
producing electricity, they don't multiply as fast as usual,
leaving less sludge for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Zeikus and Park are not the only researchers exploring the
electrical potential of sugar-fed biofuel cells. Itamar Willner and
his colleagues in the chemistry department at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem are using enzymes rather than bacteria to make
batteries that could be implanted in people's bodies. Powered by
blood sugar, the batteries might one day power pacemakers, insulin
pumps and prostheses. &QL;

   Most mammals are lousy fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Those that don't eat their young do little to help in the birth
apart from making encouraging noises. Djungarian hamsters, though,
are paws-on dads.
</P>
<P>
   In the first published case of its kind, Canadian scientists
have watched Djungarian fathers help pull their babies from the
birth canal, lick off the birth membranes, open the baby's airways
and share a snack of afterbirth with the mother.
</P>
<P>
   There have been similar behavior observations in other species,
but Katherine Wynne-Edwards and her colleagues at Queen's
University in Kingston, Ontario, are the first to explore why it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djungarian fathers have hormonal fluctuations similar to the
mother's around the time of birth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oestrogen and cortisol levels rise before the birth, then fall
away afterward as testosterone rises. This doesn't happen in the
closely related Siberian hamster.
</P>
<P>
   Although fathers in both species care for their young, Siberian
hamsters appear on the scene well after the birth. Djungarians are
also from Siberia, but live in a harsher desert environment.
Djungarian fathers remain in the burrow at the time of birth, and
help keep mother and young warm enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hypothesized that because of the early hormonal changes,
Djungarians would show the full range of paternal behavior,''
Wynne-Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   They did. Not only were they exemplary midwives, she said, ``we
saw the mother and father both holding the afterbirth with four
little paws, sharing it 50/50. There are probably lots of species
that do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But few researchers have tried to find out as it is difficult to
measure hormones without stressing animals. &QL;

REINVENTING THE PAY PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla., Texas)   By DENNIS BLANK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pay phone is an endangered species. With cell phones
seemingly in every pocket or briefcase, fewer and fewer people must
rely on phones that are attached, quaintly, to a wall or booth.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 2 million pay phones across the United States,
but that is down by 300,000 in the last two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the companies that make or operate pay phones are
rushing to reinvent themselves, working to change the perception
that pay phones are nothing but black boxes for making calls. New
technology will transform them into tools to provide communications
access to the Internet, find local news and weather and even offer
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, economic reality is forcing the removal
of many existing phones. ``For every five telephones we installed
in North Carolina today, we're taking out six,'' said Glenn
Lancaster, president of Triangle Telephone in Cary, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   This shift hurts poor people the most. In New York and many
other urban areas, at least 25 percent of low-income residents have
no telephone _ cellular or otherwise. The pay phone can be their
lifeline, providing the only way to get help in an emergency, hunt
for a job or call friends.
</P>
<P>
   But when phones do not pay, they may be removed. Nationwide, the
average number of calls for each phone has declined from 712 a
year, to 588. And once a given phone does not yield a profit, phone
companies often eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of operating pay phones is going up faster than
revenue, Lancaster said. He and other operators in North Carolina
want the price of a call raised from 35 to 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coin-based revenue model is dying fast as pay phone
operators see their coin revenue model drop 20 to 30 percent,''
said Michael J. Boyle, president and chief executive of Elcotel in
Sarasota, Fla., one of the leading pay phone manufacturers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to find a way to reinvent themselves,'' said John
Bain, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Elcotel is already breaking new ground with 27 software patents
that would transformed the black box into a snappy unit with a
five-inch video screen that provides ads, restaurant listings and
access to ``800'' numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is move our industry from coins to content,''
Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $8 million on research, Elcotel sold 45,000 of
its new Grapevine models for $125 million to Canada Payphone, which
began installing them in March.
</P>
<P>
   In June, new software will be installed to make them
Internet-friendly. Boyle said new revenue would be generated from
advertisers, transaction fees and revenue-sharing agreements. The
new phones can be used with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers are also introducing new units. Intellicall
of Dallas introduced units that play audible spots of six seconds
to eight seconds before a call is made.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Suzuka, president and chief executive of Key Factors
Advertising in New York, which is teaming up with Intellicall,
estimates that revenue from the average pay phone will rise $15 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is installing 80
new touch-screen units with full Internet access at Kennedy
Airport, said Dennis Novick, president of TCC Teleplex, an
independent pay telephone supplier.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the old-fashioned pay phone will not die. ``There is
a place for the public pay phone,'' he said _ for those unwilling,
or unable, to join the cellular revolution.

&HT;     LAWYERS NEGOTIATING FOR RELEASE OF LAST WORLD BANK PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense lawyers on Friday reached a plea-bargain
agreement with authorities to release most of the remaining
protesters arrested earlier this week in demonstrations outside the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``An agreement has been reached and we expect (the jailed
demonstrators) should be released early this evening,'' said Elena
Temple, spokeswoman for Mayor Anthony Williams. The deal covers
approximately 125 protesters still in jail here.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in jail have declined on principle to tell
authorities their real names, identifying themselves only by
monikers such as ``defender'' or ``chalice.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement worked out between the protesters'
lawyers _ the Midnight Special Law Collective _ the protesters
themselves and lawyers for the District of Columbia, demonstrators
would plead guilty to minor violations. Natalie Sperry, a paralegal
with the Midnight Special legal team, said the charges were
comparable to ``jaywalking.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators would pay a $5 flat fee and would be free to go,
Sperry said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, would not cover about 25 other demonstrators
facing more serious charges. Among these are individuals arrested
last week for possession of ``implements of crime`` such as PVC
pipes, heavy chains, bolt cutters, gas masks, and rolls of chicken
wire and duct tape. Individuals in this category would still face
federal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in jail is Joan Norman, 66, of Sunnyvale, Calif., a
long-time activist who marched for civil rights in Selma, Ala. in
1965 along with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people with lacerated heads, (and people who were
exposed to) lots of pepper spray, lots of teargas,'' she told her
companion, Bob Youden, 73, of Sunnyvale, who taped the telephone
conversation and played it back for a reporter. ``There are people
with broken ribs and this is not getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recording, Norman blamed the mistreatment on the U.S.
Marshals Service, which transports prisoners here and guards them
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dillard, the U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia, did
not return a phone call seeking comment. ``Thus far we've had no
formal complaints lodged here,'' said Mavis Dezulovich, a
spokeswoman at the Marshals' national office in the Northern
Virginia suburbs of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators converged on Washington with the aim of disrupting
the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. Protesters rallied for a laundry list of aims
involving world trade and the environment, but the crux was a
demand that the institutions freeze debt collection from
underdeveloped nations.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 were arrested, mostly for acts of civil disobedience
in front the World Bank and IMF headquarters buildings where the
meetings were taking place. The vast majority of these were
released on bond or their own recognizance.

&HT;     RECONCILIATION IN THE PASSOVER-EASTER SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN P. SCHLEGEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Celebrations of Passover and Easter coincide
this weekend, as they frequently do. Yet something is different;
for many Catholics and Jews, there is a new awareness of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Pope John Paul II asked for forgiveness of sins
committed by Catholics across the last two millennia, he included
Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   That confession, followed by the papal visit to the Holy Land _
to Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan _ spoke
eloquently to a collective hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   And as John Paul prayed at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem, he illustrated a major theme of his long years as pope:
building healthy relations between Catholics and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   This is a hopeful start to a much-desired journey.
</P>
<P>
   In the high holidays of both religions, we find symbols and
themes that motivate people of faith to look towards the future
with hope.
</P>
<P>
   And these messages come at a time when many are bored with the
national political scene, tired of the victim culture, concerned
about the new intolerance among us and weary of unsolved social
problems from education to homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   It is in such an age as ours that the timeless and hope-filled
messages of Passover and Easter should resonate.
</P>
<P>
   On Passover, Jews commemorate the exodus from Egypt; on Good
Friday and Easter Sunday, Christians commemorate the death and
celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. These are central moments in
each of our histories. They speak of the hope for continuing
redemption and the coming of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Passover is a celebration of freedom and new opportunities. It
commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. It is
the charter event of Jewish history, the striking proof of God's
intervention on behalf of his people, and the foundation of their
hope that he would one day do so again.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, the mystery of redemption is a mosaic of saving
events. While all pieces are important, Easter, not Good Friday,
holds the center. A healthy Christian faith affirms and celebrates
life. While recognizing the place of suffering and death,
Christians should be animated by joy and hope.
</P>
<P>
   When understood this way, these celebrations compel us to
confront life in the face of the great commandment of love, to look
into the faces of the victims of prejudice, abuse and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   They compel us to adopt the spirit of the prophet Isaiah to
bring good news to the homeless, the alienated and the marginalized
(and those on death row); to release the captives of poverty,
discrimination and drug dependency; to restore sight to the blind
and give comfort to those living with HIV, AIDS, or breast cancer,
and to lead to freedom those oppressed by racism, ignorance and
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the celebrations in the Jewish and Christian calendars,
Easter and Passover hold the power to make a difference. Faith
empowers the believer to make a difference just as hope motivates
such actions.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jews of old fled the Egyptian armies, they hoped for help
from their God of the covenant, and the Red Sea divided. As the
followers of Jesus wept at his death, they hoped it was not the end
of the story, and the resurrection occurred.
</P>
<P>
   So today, to women and men of hope, God can do great things, can
empower the faithful to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   When this hope is energized, one's personal celebrations take on
a public significance. These holiday rituals unite individuals with
their respective faith community and urge them to go beyond the
security of our front door, synagogue or church to the communities
and neighborhoods in need of Easter hope and Passover renewal.
</P>
<P>
   These were my thoughts as I shared the Seder meal with Jewish
friends and they'll be with me as I celebrate Easter Sunday Mass.
These are sentiments rooted in John Paul's efforts of
reconciliation between Catholics and Jews and so many other groups.

   RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS (Moscow) _ In a display of unity that seeks to
put the United States on the diplomatic defensive, the Russian
Parliament on Friday handed President-elect Vladimir Putin his
third overwhelming vote in a week endorsing a major arms control
accord. At the same time, Russia's military and civilian leaders
warned of a serious confrontation and a resumption of the nuclear
arms race should Washington go ahead with plans to build a national
antimissile defense shield in violation of the 1972 treaty that
prohibits the development or deployment of such defenses. By

   CUBAN-BOY (Washington) _ Fast running out of options, Attorney
General Janet Reno awaited word Friday from her law enforcement
agents in Miami on the best time for them to remove Elian Gonzalez
from his Florida relatives. But she could not give even his father
a timetable for their reunion. While Reno clung to hope for a
last-minute negotiated turnover, she held a surprisingly short,
15-minute meeting at the Justice Department with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, father of the 6-year-old Cuban boy whom Miami relatives
have refused to relinquish. ``I assured him that I would continue
working toward the goal of reuniting him with his child, but I also
told him that I could not commit to a particular course of action
or timetable,'' Reno said. Justice Department officials said that
key federal marshals and immigration agents were being positioned
in Miami outside the home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.

   INTERNET-THERAPY (Undated) _ Now people are even turning to the
Internet for counseling: They plug in a credit card number and
begin engaging in e-mail counseling with a psychologist or other
therapist. To the excitement, and alarm, of experts in the field,
new mental-health sites are beginning to pop up on the Web almost
daily, and many are offering the type of counseling once offered
only in the intimacy of a psychiatrist's office. By Ellen Almer.

   BUSH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ In an extraordinary retreat
from traditional Republican tenets, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
has in recent weeks advocated an expansion of the federal role on
programs ranging from education to low-income housing to health
care. And he has made overtures to constituencies, like gays and
gun-control proponents, that have never been mainstays of his own
party. Yet what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the
nine weeks since the South Carolina primary, when he presented
himself as an unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal
and social conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about
past nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative
organization has aggressively spoken out against Bush. By Richard
L. Berke.

   ATLANTA _ Negotiators in the rancorous water war between
Georgia, Alabama and Florida should seek a mediator to help them
iron out differences that have stalled the talks for more than two
years, a federal representative said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Thomas, President Clinton's appointee to the group
negotiating the water dispute, said gaping differences still
remaining indicate that the states are unlikely to come to an
understanding without mediation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion, based on what I heard from this committee today,
is that I don't think you will ever get an agreement,'' Thomas told
negotiators meeting in Atlanta Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly urge you to consider a mediator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The states have little more than a week remaining to meet a
self-imposed May 1 deadline for a settlement. Negotiators indicated
Friday they were receptive to extending the talks beyond the
deadline and bringing in a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   But final decisions on both those points, they said, will have
to come from the governors of the three states at two other
meetings scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session produced heated exchanges among the
arbitrators, but made no progress in developing a formula to share
the waters of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basin. A
similar session in Montgomery on Thursday also failed to make
headway in allocating the waters of the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa
river basin.
</P>
<P>
   If the states fail to extend the deadline for reaching a
settlement in their 10-year squabble, the two interstate water
compacts under which they are conducting the talks will dissolve,
and the bitter feud likely will be tossed into the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who represents the interest of more than 10 federal
agencies at the negotiating table, said there is still hope for a
settlement if an outside mediator can help negotiators resolve
remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
   One such issue, he noted, is insufficient information about
agricultural irrigation practices in southwest Georgia, which could
affect the flow of the Flint River and the entire ACF basin.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said environmentalists, city and county governments and
citizens who rely on the rivers for drinking water and recreation
need resolution of the long-running conflict.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's session, Alabama negotiator Richard Hanan said a
proposal his state placed on the table Feb. 23 for an ACF agreement
was his state's final offer. Georgia's chief negotiator Bob Kerr,
saying that proposal would take too much water from Georgia,
rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan, however, asked Kerr and his staff to look at the numbers
in the proposal and explain why Georgia would not accept them. Kerr
agreed, but also asked Hanan and his staff to explain how Alabama
would be harmed if Georgia rejects their offer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiators for all three states say that instead of
the originally proposed 50-year agreements, they might lean toward
short-term agreements of 10 or 15 years in the ACF and the ACT.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and Alabama want enough water to fuel projected growth
through the next 30 to 50 years. Florida wants adequate water to
protect its thriving oyster industry in Apalachicola Bay, where the
Chattahoochee's waters flow into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Several observers of Friday's meeting pleaded with the
negotiators to keep the water squabble out of the courts. Fred
Aiken, representative of U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said a court
battle would be expensive and drag the issue out for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes to court, whatever decision is rendered will be
unsatisfactory for all concerned,'' he said.

GYPSIES AS OUTSIDERS   OSTRACIZE THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There he sits, Jimmy Marks, two rows of diamonds on
the bridge of his glasses, diamond cuff links, gold and diamond
rings. He won't give up his fight, this Don Quixote, this deposed
prince of the Gypsies of Spokane, Wash. Most of Spokane's Gypsies
would just like Marks to shut up. He has brought too much exposure
to their secretive world, they say, and he plays into Gypsy
stereotypes. Now he is ``marime'' _ ``unclean'' in Romany, the
Gypsy language _ an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refuse to invite me to a funeral, or a wedding,'' he
said. Recently, he went to a Gypsy gathering, and he was
ostracized. ``They didn't offer me food,'' he said. ``Do you
understand? They didn't give me coffee or cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks was sitting in a Greek coffee shop in the Chelsea section
of Manhattan, in town to promote ``American Gypsy,'' a documentary
film by Jasmine Dellal that tells the story of how Marks came to be
an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   The film describes the police raid in 1986 on the houses of
Marks and his father, Grover, a ``baro,'' ``big man,'' a patriarch
of Spokane Gypsies. The Markses were fortunetellers and used-car
dealers in Spokane. The police said they were searching for stolen
goods. They tore gold-plated false fingernails from the women,
snatched earrings from a girl, searched a baby's diapers. They
found $1.6 million in cash, some sewn into quilts, and $160,000 in
jewelry. There were items from 35 different burglaries, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later a Superior Court judge ruled the search
illegal because it had taken place before a warrant was issued. The
Gypsies, who do not trust banks, often keep money at home.
Eventually, four charges were dropped; the cash and jewelry were
ordered returned. Marks and his mother, Lippie, pleaded guilty to
misdemeanors, saying they had unwittingly bought a few items from
an informer for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Marks family then sued the city of Spokane in federal court
for $40 million, claiming their civil rights had been violated.
Marks was now considered unclean because his home had been
``polluted'': the careful boundaries of Gypsy custom between men
and women, between the upper and lower body, had been violated by
the police in their search. He had also committed another crime in
the Gypsy world: he had brought unwelcome attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   During the 11 years the legal dispute lasted, ``I entertained
myself with the city and county of Spokane,'' Marks said. He
presented a set of deer horns to Spokane's late mayor, Jack
Geraghty. ``I told them, `I gave you horns because you're all
devils.''' He left hundreds of telephone messages for city
officials and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 the case was settled, and the city and county
awarded $1.4 million to the Markses, without admitting wrongdoing.
Marks took only a dollar. His brothers split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal, who produced the film, is from a Jewish-English
background. She said she began making ``American Gypsy'' because of
the almost casual prejudice against Gypsies in the United States
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Her film opens a door onto a culture long hidden from
``gadje''(non-Gypsies in Romany). (Gypsies usually prefer to be
called ``Rom,'' or ``Roma.'') The exact number of Gypsies worldwide
is unknown because they distrust outsiders and often do not
identify themselves. ``If I were asked where I was from,'' Marks
said, ``I'd say I was Greek because this is a Greek coffee shop.''
</P>
<P>
   There are estimated to be about 12 million Gypsies worldwide, 1
million in the United States. They have always been nomadic _ and
persecuted. Between 500,000 and 1.5 million Gypsies were
slaughtered during the Holocaust, which is known in Romany as the
``Porrajmos'' or ``the devouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for Gypsies in Eastern Europe continue to be
precarious, according to journalists and Gypsy organizations. They
were targeted during and after the war in Kosovo, with 100,000
reportedly driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The film addresses some of the myths about Gypsies. It was once
thought that they originated in Egypt, hence the word ``Gypsy.''
But, ``evidence points to their having been a multi-ethnic military
body assembled to fight off the spread of Islam,'' said Ian
Hancock, a professor of Romany Studies at the University of Texas
in Austin, who appears in the film. Hancock is a Romanichal Gypsy,
descended from British Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The Romany term ``gadjo,'' ``outsider,'' is related to the
Sanskrit ``gajjha,'' or ``civilian,'' Hancock said. The Rom began
migrating from India in the 11th century; until 1864 they were
slaves in the area that eventually became Romania. Today, Romanian
Gypsies, or ``Vlax,'' the group to which the Marks family belongs,
form the largest population of Gypsies in the United States and are
the least assimilated. Rom are divided into groups and subgroups by
country of origin and profession. Among the Vlax are the Kalderash
and Machwaya. The Kalderash, once coppersmiths, often work in auto
body shops; Machwaya women are usually fortunetellers. Marks comes
from both groups.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who believes he is about 52, was born in a tent near
Boise, Idaho. His parents were migrant laborers. ``They washed my
diapers in cold winter in the river,'' he said. ``I decided to do
my birthday Feb. 14,'' Valentine's Day, he said, to make it easier
to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal's film describes the powerful sanctions against
``pollution'' that govern Gypsy life. The lower part of a woman's
body is considered unclean because of menstruation and is
traditionally covered by a long skirt. Separate towels are used by
both sexes for the upper and lower bodies. Scholars think the
taboos arose because the Rom were forbidden by the local people to
use their public wells, and the customs helped maintain hygiene. A
woman can deliberately ``pollute'' a man by flicking him with the
end of her skirt, causing him to be ostracized. Gypsy marriages are
arranged; a married woman wears a head scarf in public. Among the
Vlax, violations of taboos are judged by a ``kris,'' a court. And
the ultimate punishment, like that imposed on Marks, is
``marimos.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies have long been identified with petty crime. But their
advocates argue that they have been driven to crime because of
discrimination and their inability to get jobs. Still, there are
Gypsy physicians and lawyers. Gypsies are reluctant to send their
children to school, partly because it could provoke interference by
outsiders, and because, they say, they are afraid their children
will learn about ``outside'' ways like drugs and sex. Thus many
Gypsies are illiterate or semiliterate, like Marks, who had only a
second-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marks technically won his case against the city of
Spokane, he is still crying for justice. He said that his fellow
Gypsies continue to ostracize him ``because I'm still talking to
the media and to city hall, opening our culture to the world,'' he
said. ``The settlement was just money. I know I'm a victim of a
vicious rape.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that his family is still being harassed by the
police. Over the Labor Day weekend last year, family members,
including his son, David, were arrested at the grave of his father,
where they said they were following the Gypsy custom of ``sharing''
food and alcohol with the dead. ``They want us to leave our dead,''
Marks said. But the Spokane police have denied harassing the
Gypsies. Sheriff Mark Sterk defended the actions of the deputy who
arrested the Markses. ``He asked them to do certain things to
comply with the law and was violently assaulted instead,'' Sterk
told The Spokesman-Review.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal, sitting in the coffee shop with Marks, said that he had
become obsessed. ``That's what's allowed him to triumph,'' she
said. ``But it's also his downfall. He's a loudmouth. It
perpetuates the way he's ostracized.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marks sees himself as a hero, ``your Daniel Boone.'' Marks
asked, ``why didn't he keep his mouth shut?''

 &HT;    Armstrong's amazing ride
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could have forgiven Lance Armstrong if he had chosen a
different, more dramatic title for his book _ something like
``Miracle on the Champs Elysees.''
</P>
<P>
   But that might have put undue emphasis on Armstrong's 1999 Tour
de France win, an accomplishment that put an exclamation point on
an already thrilling and highly improbable tale of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about the bike, as Armstrong first began to
understand in October 1996, when he was diagnosed with testicular
cancer, which soon spread to his lungs and brain. Only three months
earlier, the 25-year-old had entered the 1996 Summer Olympics (his
second) as one of the world's top-ranked cyclists. Many even
considered him the logical successor to Greg LeMond, the only
American ever to win the incredibly grueling and prestigious Tour
de France.
</P>
<P>
   Quicker than a cyclist takes a spill, however, Armstrong's focus
changed _ to staying alive, and ultimately, discovering new joy in
life.
</P>
<P>
   This book is about the bike and the perfect, storybook ending of
Armstrong's tour victory. It's also an Everyman's tale of beating
back cancer while finding inner strength and reveling in the love
of family and friends.

   Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond. By Michael Ignatieff. Holt. $23.
Today's warfare is high-tech, low-risk and seems somehow divorced
from bloody reality. Ignatieff writes that the 1999 bombings in the

 &HT;    Spotlight: Raising boys
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising young males, with all the special rewards and challenges
that entails, is a hot topic in publishing. These are a few of the
more intriguing titles coming up:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boys Into Men: Raising Our African American Teenage Sons. By
Nancy Boyd-Franklin and A.J. Franklin (Dutton, $23.95). The
husband-and-wife psychologists, parents themselves, offer tips on
how to discipline a child, monitor education and recognize
substance-abuse problems or gang involvement, as well as find a
support group and the emotional strength to be a good parent. (May)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Real Boys' Voices. By William S. Pollack (Random House,
$22.95). The clinical psychologist's follow-up to last year's
best-selling ``Real Boys'' lets youngsters speak for themselves
about life's pressures and expectations. It's enlightening,
sometimes frightening, reading. (June)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The War Against Boys. By Christina Hoff Sommers (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25). The former philosophy professor and author of ``Who
Stole Feminism'' counters the popular idea that girls are society's
greatest victims, arguing that young males' weaknesses are being
aggravated by a widespread ``anti-boy'' prejudice. Boys need love,
guidance and discipline, she writes, but they do not need to be
``rescued'' from their masculinity. (July)

 &HT;    Robbins, in fine form
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the thin wedge of an era between George McGovern's fall
and disco's rise, when the '70s were still clinging to what we now
call the '60s, no college student's two-by-fours-on-cinder-blocks
bookshelf was complete without dogeared paperbacks by Carlos
Castaneda, Hunter S. Thompson and Tom Robbins, authors who put the
cult in counterculture with their druggy, wiggy fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years later, Castaneda is dead, Thompson just recycles
his oldies and might as well be, and Tom Robbins is 63 going on 17.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the author of ``Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' is
13 years past the threshold for membership in AARP, and in the
autumn of his years has written a new novel that pops like a
dogwood in springtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates'' is, like Robbins'
previous six novels, a cassoulet of wacky folks, rococo plot,
outrageous puns and metaphors (a lie is ``harder to swallow than a
cat fur omelet'') and now-and-Zen philosophizing, all spread with a
tangy glaze of lubriciousness. It will do nothing to dissuade
nose-in-the-air literati who think Robbins is the perfect author
for readers who plan their futures with tarot cards, and it will do
everything to delight those who realize they need a jolt from his
cosmic jumper cables every so often.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero-slash-Robbins-stand-in is Switters, a renegade CIA
agent who's sent to the jungles of Peru to return his grandmother's
dying parrot to the wild. There he encounters a shaman who puts a
curse on Switters so that if his feet ever touch the ground, he
will die, thus confining him to a wheelchair for the remainder of
the novel, with occasional forays on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   While slowing him down somewhat, the curse doesn't dampen
Switters' ardor for the two women in his life: Suzy, his
16-year-old stepsister, whom he aches to seduce, and Sister Domino
Thirry (get it? huh? get it?), a nun in her 40s. Both are slightly
impure virgins, and wildly inappropriate for him, and yet both
relationships have a certain cockeyed sweetness, once you view the
world through Robbins' kaleidoscope eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Notions of virginity (physical and meta-) tie in to Our Lady of
Fatima's last prophecy, which plays a crucial role in ``Fierce
Invalids,'' as does the importance of laughter in quantum
mechanics, a yacht named the Banality of Evil, the Internet and a
convent of excommunicated nuns in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Among the random bumper-thoughts that Robbins flips his pinball
against is the idea that six attributes separate humans from other
animals: humor, imagination, eroticism, spirituality,
rebelliousness and aesthetics. Robbins has most of them nailed.
Switters, he writes, joined the CIA because it offered ``an
unparalleled world-class opportunity for corrective mischief:
subverting subversion.'' He could be, and probably is, describing
his own career as a novelist.

 &HT;    Digging for treasure
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would Carol Shields be if not an acclaimed writer? An
archaeologist, perhaps? It's easy to picture her painstakingly
tilling the earth for bits of ancient buildings or crockery and
then lovingly turning these treasures over and over, imagining what
they might have meant to others across time.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Shields the writer works. In her best novels, such as
``Small Ceremonies'' and the 1995 Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The
Stone Diaries'' (where _ excavation alert! _ the female
protagonist's father is a stonecutter), seemingly ordinary objects
take on ever-deepening levels of meaning that continually reveal
themselves through characters or, more often, through Shields'
skillful manipulation of time elements and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing Up for the Carnival'' is a dazzling collection of
small gems with such wholly unremarkable titles as ``Keys,'' ``A
Scarf'' or ``Reportage.'' Each story has a richness of theme and
structure that may not hit the reader until the last sentence has
been read and reread.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in ``Windows,'' what starts out as the seemingly
unemotional tale of a communist era-esque tax on windows gradually
expands into the sensory story of two artists who romantically
reconnect and recharge by painting a glorious fake window atop the
real one they had long ago boarded-up. ``Edith-Esther'' concerns a
comically cranky octogenarian writer whose biographer consistently
misreads big themes in her life, when at the end the only things
that ever really mattered were smaller and obvious mostly to her.
</P>
<P>
   Like most archaeologists, Shields often goes back over the same
ground. Sometimes it's a matter of plot: Four stories in ``Dressing
Up for the Carnival'' are about writers or the tools of writing,
while two feature meteorologists on strike or dismissed from their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More often the repetition is thematic: the never-ending struggle
to connect with and understand other people, not to mention one's
own self.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Scarf'' tells of a woman who can't quite picture the perfect
scarf until she finds it, and then, almost without realizing it,
gives it away to a friend she's no longer close to. ``We are too
kind, too willing, too unwilling too, reaching out blindly with a
grasping hand but not knowing how to ask for what we don't even
know we want,'' the story concludes.
</P>
<P>
   It's wearying at times trying to keep up with Shields as she
does all this digging. Much better, then, to sample ``Dressing Up
for the Carnival'' two or three stories at a time, and then sit
back and savor _ over and over _ the treasures unearthed.

 &HT;    Literary respectability, all thanks to Chandler
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was about 11 o'clock in the morning, mid-October, with the
sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the
foothills. I was wearing my powder blue suit, with dark blue shirt,
tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with
dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and
I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed
private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   If writers can be identified by their distinctive voice, it
would be hard to mistake the ownership of those words. They are
pure Raymond Chandler. ``The Big Sleep,'' published in 1939, did
more than introduce Chandler and his hero, Philip Marlowe. It
created a tone and a style that have been imitated, emulated and
parodied ever since, but never copied with exact fidelity.
Chandler's style was his own, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Library of America series inducted
Chandler into what amounts to a hall of fame of the native tongue,
it was acknowledgment that the detective novel had achieved a
certain respectability. ``A certain,'' Chandler would have sneered.
He was the first mystery writer anointed by the Library of America,
and he would have been suspicious of airs unbecoming to a writer
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back on my own stories,'' he wrote in ``The Simple
Art of Murder,'' ``it would be absurd if I did not wish they had
been better. But if they had been much better they would not have
been published.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler wrote pulp fiction, and he neither apologized for it
nor thought it literary. And yet literary it was _ in the creation
of a believable character and a psychological world, in the cadence
of his sentences, in the concrete images (surely some editor must
have tried to excise that ``wet'' in ``hard wet rain,'' but the
writer in Chandler knew why it should stay).
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Spillane would unashamedly boast, ``I don't have readers;
I got customers.'' But the distinction _ crude in the hands of a
Mickey Spillane _ bothered Chandler more than he cared to admit. He
had been classically educated in England, but in middle age, living
in California, fired from his job as a manager for an oil company,
he knew he was better than a genre that respectable magazines
thought too seedy for their tasteful pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the fact that I was raised on Latin and Greek and
once wrote essays and book reviews for a very highbrow English
weekly,'' he wrote once to Erle Stanley Gardner, ``the story of how
I became a multiple murderer may have a certain piquancy, but
there's not time to go into it now.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Raymond Chandler had all the time in the world in 1946.
In the same year he called himself ``an out-of-work pulp writer,''
but it was his manner to hint at a question and then wave it away,
as if he couldn't be bothered with it. It was part of his mask of
sardonic indifference. To the contrary, he cared passionately, even
as he discounted the worth of what he was doing:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no `classics' of crime and detection,'' he wrote in
1950. ``Not one. Within its frame of reference, which is the only
way it should be judged, a classic is a piece of writing that
exhausts the possibilities of its form and can hardly be surpassed.
No story or novel of mystery has done that yet. Few have come
close. Which is one of the principal reasons why otherwise
reasonable people continue to assault the citadel.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there have not been many. But Chandler wrote two _
``The Big Sleep'' and ``The Long Goodbye'' _ and perhaps a third,
``Farewell, My Lovely.'' More than that, though, he had broken the
hold of the English mystery _ amateur detectives taking time from
tending their begonias to solve crimes Scotland Yard somehow can't
_ and planted the sturdy roots of a native form.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's mysteries were not puzzles in deduction and logic,
but realistic stories of murder, betrayal, greed and the corruption
of honor. They have been going on forever, which is why Chandler
thought the detective mystery too familiar to claim too much for
itself. But neither was he one to genuflect before the altar of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know what the loftiest level of literary achievement
is,'' he wrote. ``Other things being equal, which they never are, a
more powerful theme will provoke a more powerful performance. Yet
some very dull books have been written about God, and some very
fine ones about how to make a living and stay fairly honest. It is
always a matter of who writes the stuff, and what he has in him to
write it with.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another way of saying that whatever else art might be,
it is a powerful feeling for a particular subject and a
recognizable style. Many can have the feeling. It's the style
that's remembered.

 &HT;    In praise of friendships
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between them, they had written 11 books, but never one together.
Best friends for a quarter-century, they had actually only lived in
the same city once. Now they'd be living in the same house to
finish the book.
</P>
<P>
   What sounds like the basis for a wacky TV sitcom is the
real-life story behind ``I Know Just What You Mean'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25), a new book that turns the spotlight on women's
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   If each is as unique and sustaining in its own way as theirs,
authors Ellen Goodman and Patricia O'Brien contend, that's because
women's friendship in general is special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we women lead lives that go through so many phases,
that friendship may be the one thing you maintain all the way
through,'' Goodman explained recently by telephone from Boston,
where she is an associate editor and Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist for the Boston Globe. ``You will have times in your life
where you will be single, maybe married and maybe single again. Not
every friendship is going to make it for the long run. But the
really strong ones that go right down to the bone, you can retain
and it will make a tremendous difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting it it off right away as Neiman Fellows at Harvard
University in 1973, Goodman and O'Brien saw each other through
numerous life changes. But even they didn't know how strong their
friendship was until a long walk several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking about how much our friendship meant to us,
and then we really started talking about friendship itself,''
recalled O'Brien from Washington, where she is a journalist and
novelist. ``I guess one of us at some point said, `Maybe we ought
to write about that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither expected the amount of openness they got from
duos famous (Oprah Winfrey and former TV talk-show host Gayle King)
and less so (Atlanta legal headhunters Melba Hughes and Linda
Sloan-Young).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say those interviews, in all the time I've been a
journalist, were the most revealing and free of any that I've ever
done,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   To O'Brien, many were taking the same ``walk'' they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be asked about your friendship is to be asked about
something absolutely central to women's lives,'' O'Brien said. ``I
think a lot of times women have taken that for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   All those stories are woven into chapters with titles like ``We
Talk, Therefore We Are ... Friends'' and ``Are We Traveling in
Different Directions.'' So, too, is the saga of the Goodman-O'Brien
friendship, something the duo initially resisted doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to talk about (writing) the nice little
Hallmark card type of book,'' Goodman said.``We felt that in order
to talk honestly about friendship, we had to talk honestly about
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant covering the good and the bad, the funny and the
painful. But not dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't writing a how-to book,'' Goodman said firmly. ``We
were exploring something important we thought hadn't been explored
before.''

 &HT;    In memory of Willie Morris
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many elegant eulogies to Willie Morris in
``Remembering Willie'' (University Press of Mississippi, $12), a
collection of tributes from the author's funeral Aug. 5 in Yazoo
City, Miss., as well as appreciations from newspapers and magazines
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   All paint a portrait of a gifted, generous writer who retained a
boyish love of practical jokes. Former Washington Post columnist
Edwin Yoder recalls the author of ``North Toward Home'' telling him
that the man who imported kudzu to the South was living in Oxford,
Miss. When Yoder asked to interview the man, Morris insisted the
poor soul felt so guilty about what he had done that he had become
a recluse. The story, of course, was apocryphal.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' practical jokes belied the serious side of one who loved
the South with all its faults. There are many moving passages in
this book, but none as touching as the essay Morris wrote for
Parade about cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been lonely in a cemetery,'' he wrote. ``They are
perfect places to observe the slow changing of the seasons, and to
absorb human history _ the tragedies and anguishes, the violences
and treacheries, and always the guilts and sorrows of vanished
people.''

 &HT;    The High's big-game hunter
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 23.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Shapiro is an optimist. But to him life isn't
a bowl of cherries, it's a bottomless pit of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new director of the High Museum of Art is sitting in his
spacious corner office taking phone calls before the press of
back-to-back meetings begins. A half-full cup of coffee, one of the
many that fuels his energetic pace, is at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   American landscapes and an intimate interior by French artist
Jean-Edouard Vuillard replace the modern canvases that hung there
during Ned Rifkin's tenure. A cluster of small vessels by Atlanta
wood-turner Ed Moulthrop sits atop the desk. A dogeared red address
book containing a careerful of contacts and the red upholstery of
the chairs are exclamation points punctuating the muted modern
decor.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's cheery demeanor enlivens the room as well, even on the
phone. Good humor notwithstanding, this is business: Each phone
call is a potential exhibition, acquisition, contact.
</P>
<P>
   The acting director of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in
Hartford, Conn., is looking for exhibitions to fill a gap. During
their conversation, Shapiro, 50, learns about shows on the museum's
roster that interest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trade of information that might lead to something,''
explains the director, whose Brooks Brothers dignity balances an
impish face.
</P>
<P>
   Executive assistant Amanda Kingery pops her head in the door.
Robin Vousden, director of London's prestigious Anthony d'Offay
Gallery, is on the line. He and Shapiro make plans to fly to the
south of France to visit the studio of renowned German artist
Anselm Kiefer to scout for paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Later, curator David Brenneman sits down at the table. A dealer
has offered a complete collection of portrait medallions by the
19th-century French sculptor Pierre-Jean David d'Angers. Does the
museum want that many? At what price?
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro barely pauses. What about buying the lot and auctioning
off the ones they don't want? What about getting together a
syndicate of American museums to buy the lot and divide them?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got me thinking,'' Shapiro says.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't content just to field what comes his way. He likes
to create opportunities. Like the rare loan of Vincent van Gogh's
signature ``The Starry Night'' from the Museum of Modern Art. While
working with MOMA on a series of exhibitions at the High, Shapiro,
then deputy director and chief curator, would bring up his idea for
a small van Gogh show at every opportunity. Persistence pays: It is
coming, along with two others by the Dutch master, in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started laughing when I heard Michael got `Starry Night,'''
says his
</P>
<P>
   older sister Nancy Kosowski, a teacher in Pennsylvania. ``He
used to have a poster of that painting on his wall in his
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Art was always part of their Manhattan childhood. Their parents
took them to museums regularly, and an uncle, James Shapiro, was a
serious art collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took art classes at the Met,'' Kosowski recalls. ``When you
walked through the entrance, there was a carousel playing a Sousa
march on one side and a Demuth painting on the other. All of us
would go to the merry-go-round. He'd look at the Demuth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosowski remembers always waiting for her brother when the
family went to museums. ``We went to the Accademia in Venice, and
my mother and I finished in a normal person's amount of time. We
watched the gondolas, got a cup of cappuccino. Michael came out 1
1/2 hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   The young connoisseur's interests deepened over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I was curious about how works of art stimulated my
mind to make associations,'' he says. ``In a painting, say of a
portrait, I thought, `Who was the subject? Why did the artist
choose to paint that person? What was their relationship?' Later my
academic training in art history allowed me to explore those types
of questions in depth and prompted me to formulate my own responses
in articles, books and exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   After college, he began to buy inexpensive works of art that
bespoke catholic interests. A print by pop artist Tom Wesselmann.
An Imogen Cunningham photograph. A 19th-century French drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has what great museum directors have: a real passion
about art,'' says Emily Rauch Pulitzer, a trustee of the Saint
Louis Art Museum, where Shapiro was curator from 1984 to 1992.
``Everything pulls directors away from it _ the budget, education,
the PR, the social. But the ones who are really great don't lose
their focus on the art.''
</P>
<P>
   A young sleuth
</P>
<P>
   As a budding scholar during undergraduate years at Hamilton
College in upstate New York, Shapiro researched two family
paintings inherited from his grandparents. On a hunch that the
painting of a lute player attributed to 17th-century Dutch artist
Gerrit van Honthorst was really by Hendrick Terbrugghen, a peer, he
had his mother X-ray and clean it, which uncovered a figure that
had been painted over. He wrote to the author of Terbrugghen's
catalogue raisonne _ the document of his complete works _ in
England, inviting him to examine the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro describes the painting, mimicking the musician's pose,
replete with mouth open in an ``O'' to sing. He plays the eccentric
scholar, standing in front of the painting hung over the sofa,
exclaiming, ``It's the hand of the master!''
</P>
<P>
   He had less luck with a painting his grandparents had thought
was a Whistler. The Terbrugghen was sold. The non-Whistler hangs in
his home.
</P>
<P>
   While a college student, Shapiro also tried to advise his mother
on art purchases, encouraging her, to no avail, to buy a Jackson
Pollock. He had more success with acquisitions at the Saint Louis
Art Museum. Although he has a reputation as a scholar and is
remembered for exhibitions of 19th-century American artists George
Caleb Bingham and Frederic Remington, building the museum's
collection is, according to Pulitzer, Shapiro's greatest legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to take risks,'' Pulitzer says, ``and he
acquired extraordinary works of art. The museum has great holdings
of Max Beckmann and the German expressionists. He extended German
art into the second half of the 20th century and made the
collection of national and international significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro bought works by Gerhard Richter, an internationally
known artist who works in both abstraction and photo-realism, and
neo-expressionist Anselm Kiefer, including a sculpture of lead and
glass shards weighing 15,000 pounds that required reinforcing the
floor and raising the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro also raised the funds. When no single donor came forth,
he formed a syndicate to pool smaller donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good fund-raiser,'' Pulitzer says. ``That takes
commitment, no fear of rejection and an ability to communicate your
passion effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is generally enthusiastic. ``Fantastic'' is a favorite
word. But he gets a special glint in his eye when he talks about
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to go to galleries to test my radar for important
paintings,'' he says. ``I used to do that at the Whitney
Biennial.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1974 biennial inspired him to buy a figurative Pat Steir
painting and a watercolor that he gave to the High last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquiring art is like big-game hunting,'' he explains. ``Fun,
challenging and stimulating but also serious. It requires judgment,
intuition and a leap of faith. There's risk, drama, excitement.
Lisa (his wife of 22 years) tells me acquisitions get me going.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently visited the Robert Motherwell Foundation in New
York, which sells paintings by the late abstract expressionist to
museums at a discount, to talk about the type of paintings that
would ``make a difference'' at the High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two `A' pictures, and that's what we want,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``An `A' painting should stop you in your tracks. It should
elicit a response like, `Wow! I didn't know that was here!' We want
to amaze our public with our ability to acquire great works of art
for their collection.''
</P>
<P>
   `The staff adores him'
</P>
<P>
   The curators love his reach-for-the-sky boldness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes anything is possible,'' says Brenneman. ``He
encourages us to set our sights very high. That results in great
things. We are organizing a Degas show,'' he says with a bit of
wonderment about the bluest-chip artist for which the High has ever
organized a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff adores him,'' says Rhonda Matheison, director of
finance and operations. ``They'll do anything because they know
he'll work just as hard to get it done. He makes you think out of
the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a fan. He challenges everybody. When Ned
left, we didn't miss a beat. In fact, we've picked up a few beats.
Every time you think you're going to slow down, he's got you going,
and we all love it. If he's not coming up with a new idea, we're
saying, `What's happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro shows no signs of abandoning the personal, informal
approach he established while deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll go off for a cup a coffee and come back an hour and half
later from visiting everyone,'' executive assistant Kingery says.
``And Michael is a funny guy. You hear bursts of laughter coming
from his office.''
</P>
<P>
   After the blockbuster ``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by
European Museums'' exhibition closed in May, he organized an
Oscar-type ceremony that honored the museum team, from security
guards to curators. The recipients still have their trophies and
refrigerator magnets on their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro may have to apply his charm toward mending fences with
local artists, galleries and academics who think relations soured
during Rifkin's eight-year tenure, and by extension, Shapiro's
watch. Some galleries have felt a lack of respect. Some artists
feel ignored. And the early members of the Twentieth Century Art
Society (now known as the Contemporary Art Society) are galled that
the museum reduced the group's programming and intellectual level
to make it more of a fund-raising arm of the museum. These members
of the art community, who did not want to be quoted, would like the
museum, and Shapiro, to be more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to heal some wounds,'' Shapiro says. ``To that
end, I would like to try to get around to more openings and events
and be a good listener. I'd like to come up with effective ways of
working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any family, there are inevitable pushes and pulls. But we
have so much more in common than what separates us that we should
get together and talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro certainly did well with a personal approach when he and
Renaissance specialist Gary Radke began exploring exhibition
possibilities in Italy last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ignored the conventional wisdom about shopping for
exhibitions there,'' says the Syracuse University professor. ``This
is the land of introductions, but he wanted to knock on doors. When
I protested, he said, `If they want to see us, they will.' Much to
my delight, they wanted to see us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that the Casa Buonarroti (which is lending an
exhibition of Michelangelo drawings in 2001) was waiting to be
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke and Shapiro, who have been friends since they were
research fellows at the National Gallery in Washington in 1979,
mixed business and pleasure during the weeklong trip. They dined at
Radke's favorite Florence trattorias and pondered such questions as
which Renaissance artists would make good dinner partners. Not
Michelangelo, according to Radke: too crabby.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro collects friends like he collects art. Hence, the many
entries in the well-thumbed address book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was inundated with calls when he was appointed,'' says
former assistant Julia Gomez. ``He knows everyone everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   MOMA director Glenn Lowry is a big admirer. The two met at a
Cezanne seminar at Williams College in Massachusetts in the '70s
and have been friends ever since. Lowry attributes his decision to
attend Harvard, where both received doctorates, to the fact that
Shapiro went there after earning his master of arts at Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extraordinarily funny, intelligent, warm person,''
Lowry says.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the van Gogh loan, Lowry says, ``We would consider
anything the High asked, but the fact that it was Michael made it
easier to accommodate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry was among a chorus of museum directors to applaud
Shapiro's appointment. The sentiment was particularly heartfelt,
perhaps, because of the rough time Shapiro had during his 10 months
as director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Shapiro says he feels he walked into a difficult
situation unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't research the history and status of the museum,'' he
says. ``I thought I was going to a place with a solid economic
base. When I arrived, there had been an economic earthquake, caused
by the riots. The county cut funding. There were layoffs and
program cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper accounts of his resignation, trustees praised his
performance but suggested that he did not have sufficient
administrative experience to deal with the museum's complex fiscal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was hired to connect with the community and
reinvigorate the curatorial (area), but virtually as soon as he
arrived, we got a bad financial report,'' says trustee Stanley
Grinstein. ``Administration was not his strength. It was his first
director's job. He was the wrong person at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do a great job in Atlanta. He's in the right
place at the right time. He's truly ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's memory of the experience sounds like something out of
a Coen brothers' movie. On his first day there, he had to keep away
from the windows because there was a gunman on the plaza, and the
sprinklers went off in the Japanese pavilion during a visit of the
pavilion's patron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `You're not in Kansas anymore.' It was not like
anything I had experienced before or since,'' he recalls,
describing the experience as ``deeply maturing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot about myself, about human dynamics, the
dynamics of change, healthy and unhealthy,'' Shapiro says. ``I
realized the importance of building a solid foundation of trust
with the staff and the board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has seen every awful thing, and he's wiser,'' says Nancy
Nichols of his Los Angeles difficulties. The practice managing
partner at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the executive search firm that ran
the High's hunt for director, Nichols is also an old friend. ``I
don't think any crisis would be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from the L.A. museum, Shapiro returned to St.
Louis. He spent two years teaching and writing until Rifkin chose
him as deputy director and chief curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost embarrassed to call,'' the former High director
says from his new job at Houston's Menil Foundation. ``I could as
easily have been his deputy director as the other way around, but I
thought it was such an opportunity for
</P>
<P>
   the High.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here, the contrast was so amazing,'' Shapiro recalls.
``Where nothing could happen in L.A., here everything seemed
possible. People were aspiring to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and his family _ Lisa, who teaches American history at
the Galloway School, Kate, 16, and Nick, 14 _ have embraced
Atlanta. A longtime runner and veteran of the New York Marathon,
Shapiro jogs regularly in Ansley Park, where he lives in a
comfortable home filled with art and art books.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys a good meal as much as a good run. The museum
director, who used to whip up dinner in the wok in graduate school,
takes advantage of ethnic cuisine on Buford Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy the sense of being a visitor among different
cultures,'' he says. ``Mostly we go to the Panda Inn, but we want
to try them all.''
</P>
<P>
   He celebrated his appointment with his family at Midtown's Pasta
da Pulcinella. The excitement of that moment has not abated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have high hopes for this place,'' he says of the High.
``With Atlanta's energy, ambition and openness, we will do great
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny _ he could as easily be talking about himself.

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men.

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

IS THE REBEL FLAG A RACIST EMBLEM? JUST ASK THE CONFEDERATES

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men. &HT;

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

IS THE REBEL FLAG A RACIST EMBLEM? JUST ASK THE CONFEDERATES

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

`SHYLOCK': A FRESH LOOK AT A COMPLEX CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does the modern world have a place in it for Shakespeare's
``Merchant of Venice''? The question is raised but not resolved by
a film being shown on TV on Saturday in New York, which inquires
into the life and times of the character whom Shakespeare called
Shylock.
</P>
<P>
   With the memory of millions of murdered Jews burned into the
West's consciousness by the Holocaust, how are audiences supposed
to react to the reappearance on stages of literature's most famous
murderous Jew?
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Lasry's documentary, ``Shylock,'' recalls 2,000 years of
European hatred of the Jew, as Christ-killer, ritual murderer,
usurer, perpetual outsider and all-around object of Christian
detestation.
</P>
<P>
   It is against this background that Shakespeare created a more
complicated image of the malignant Jew (``If you prick us, do we
not bleed?'') that has long unsettled audiences.
</P>
<P>
   In the few scenes in which he appears, the character of Shylock
casts a large, dark shadow on what is otherwise a romantic comedy.
Only when the moneylender demands his pound of flesh does the play
justify its reputation as a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   (If you are looking for Oedipal significance, historians report
that John Shakespeare, William's father, was himself a moneylender;
on the other hand, there weren't enough Jews in Elizabethan England
to account for the practice of usury, and it seems unlikely that
the playwright ever met one.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, Shakespeare's Shylock has been portrayed as
a model of cruelty and as a comic caricature of greed, an avatar of
Old Testament justice set against New Testament mercy and a victim
of a vindictive society.
</P>
<P>
   The program offers scenes from a few of this century's
performances, beginning with a powerful few moments from Orson
Welles' unfinished film version, along with various actors' and
directors' explanations of how they tried to make the character
something more than the monster displayed in the scores of
productions of ``Merchant'' staged during the Nazis' ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   John Gross, the British critic and author of the illuminating
1992 history, ``Shylock,'' who serves as the film's main guide,
describes 20th-century efforts to humanize Shylock by emphasizing
his better side, like his love for his daughter, and belittling the
behavior of the society that ostracizes him and provokes his lethal
inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Gross is not impressed; in the effort to clean up
Shylock's reputation, he finds, postwar versions have strayed from
the text of what, however disquieting, is a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   A lineup of theatrical luminaries has given the role a try in
recent decades, among them Peter O'Toole, George C. Scott, Emlyn
Williams, Michael Redgrave, Dustin Hoffman, and perhaps most
notably Laurence Olivier in a 1970 production, directed by Jonathan
Miller, that gave us a Shylock dressed up as a late Victorian
banker.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's point was that except for his Jewishness Shylock was
like all the other upper-class Venetians, perhaps better, since
they are portrayed as corrupt and coldhearted when they are not
merely ridiculous. (Miller tells his television interviewer that he
now regrets cutting Shylock's opening speech about Antonio _ ``I
hate him for he is a Christian'' _ in an effort to soften the
Shakespearean portrait.)
</P>
<P>
   But in his book Gross dismisses the combination of assimilation
and rejection in the Miller-Olivier version and other efforts to
contrast Shylock's dignity with Venetian foppishness as yielding a
``high degree of incoherence.''
</P>
<P>
   He finds such works typical of a tendency over the past 30 or 40
years to present the play as an exercise in irony, ``which cannot
possibly mean what it appears to say, a play that constantly
subverts its own surface values and throws doubt on the purported
motives of its characters.'' He adds: ``Where the key words were
once `justice' and `mercy', `gold' and `love,' they are now
`skeptical,' `tension,' `discrepancy' `distancing,' and
`demystify.'''
</P>
<P>
   While crediting Shakespeare for equipping Shylock with ``senses,
affections, passions'' that make him a big character ``who bursts
the bounds of the play in which he appears,'' Gross does not smooth
over the fact that Shakespeare himself was bound by centuries-old
vicious Jewish stereotypes with which today's directors continue to
grapple.
</P>
<P>
   Granting Shakespeare's effort ``to imagine, within the confines
of his plot and within the limits that his culture set him, what it
would be like to be a Jew,'' Gross takes a poke at efforts to
invest Shakespeare with Brotherhood Week sentiments. He writes:
``One thing we can be sure of: he was not a secret 20th-century
liberal, animated by programmatic opposition to racial prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion, one that theater lovers and Shakespeare lovers
have to live with, is that Shylock ``belongs, inescapably, to the
history of anti-Semitism.''

LETTER SHEDS LIGHT ON MARK TWAIN'S DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Calif., Texas)   By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Twain died 90 years ago this week, the machinery that
would spin his posthumous image was already oiled and running. At
the controls was his daughter Clara, who would spend the next
half-century transforming her difficult, depressive father into the
genial, doting patriarch that endures in the American mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a newly rediscovered letter, written by Clara Clemens and
long presumed destroyed, may explain what drove her relentless spin
doctoring, a Twain scholar says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clara was very determined that a certain kind of father, a
certain kind of Mark Twain, be remembered,'' said Laura Skandera
Trombley, a vice president and professor of English at Coe College,
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who made a copy of the letter available to
The New York Times. ``And what I think this letter does is to help
chip away at this edifice she constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Postmarked Feb. 5, 1904, the letter was mailed from Florence,
Italy, where the Clemenses had gone in an attempt to shore up the
health of Twain's ailing wife, Olivia. Writing in obvious anguish
to a friend, Clara, then 29, describes a raging confrontation with
her father the previous day:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seized by something &AMP; began to scream &AMP; curse &AMP; knocked
down the furniture.... In my father's presence I said I hated him,
hated my mother, hoped they would all die &AMP; if they didn't succeed
soon I would kill them.'' Hearing the altercation, Olivia Clemens
suffered a heart attack. She died four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Clara, who had a nervous breakdown after her mother's death and
spent much of the following year in a sanitarium, asked her friend,
Dorothea Gilder, to destroy the letter. But it recently surfaced
intact as part of a collection of correspondence between the
Clemens and Gilder families (Dorothea's father, Richard Watson
Gilder, was the editor of Century magazine).
</P>
<P>
   Trombley, the author of ``Mark Twain in the Company of Women''
(University of Pennsylvania, 1994), received a copy of the letter
in February from a dealer in Twain memorabilia who was acquainted
with her work; the entire Gilder-Clemens correspondence is now in
the collection of the James S. Copley Library in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While scholars may never know what provoked Clara's outburst,
they have long been aware of tensions in Twain's household _ and
have laid the blame for them squarely on an autocratic Twain. The
discovery of the letter, Trombley said, may point to the frustrated
Clara as an additional locus of tension.
</P>
<P>
   The middle of three daughters of Samuel Langhorne and Olivia
Clemens and the only one to survive both parents, Clara had set
aside her ambition to be a concert singer to help care for her
mother. In the letter, she describes ``controlling, controlling,
controlling oneself, till one just bursts at last in despair.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also expresses deep remorse over the outburst: ``The
shame on me today is indescribable,'' she writes, adding, ``It
seems I don't belong in good society anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   This intense guilt may have laid the foundation for Clara's
public mythologizing. After her father died in 1910, she fought
vigorously to suppress writings by or about him that she deemed
inconsistent with his wholesome image.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Twain's literary executors, Bernard DeVoto, resigned
after Clara suppressed his edition of Twain's bitter 1909 polemic,
``Letters From the Earth,'' which dealt bluntly with questions of
religion and human sexuality. (The work was eventually published
shortly before Clara's death in 1962).
</P>
<P>
   And for ``Mark Twain and the Happy Island,'' a 1913 book about
Twain's visits to Bermuda, she forbade the author, Elizabeth
Wallace, to publish any photos depicting Twain with his Angelfish
Club, a group of pretty young girls with whom he corresponded in
the last years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Clara, who married the pianist and conductor Ossip
Gabrilowitsch, published her own affectionate memoir, ``My Father,
Mark Twain,'' in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a reason why propriety was so important to
her,'' said Shelley Fisher Fishkin, editor of the Oxford Mark Twain
series, and a professor of American studies and English at the
University of Texas at Austin, when asked to comment on Clara's
letter. ``Her regret for having been out of control herself may
have helped prompt her to maintain the rigid control that she tried
to retain over her father's posthumous image.''

   Fashion Victims
</P>
<P>
   Jails everywhere have long tried to make successful escape
harder by dressing inmates in clothes that no one could mistake for
ordinary civilian garb. In chain-gang and Keystone Kops days, broad
black and white stripes were most common; today the standard is
head-to-toe fluorescent orange.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of that tactic is being simultaneously proved
and eroded by two stores in Jonesboro, Ark., that have begun
selling close copies of Craighead County inmates' clothing to
fashion-forward teen-agers. The outfits are even stenciled with
phrases like ``County Inmate'' and ``Correctional Facility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the outfits began to catch on, the police in
Jonesboro have been receiving calls about escaped prisoners roaming
the city. They even searched a neighborhood for an ``inmate'' seen
jumping a fence. ``Apparently, the person was wearing one of the
shirts sold at the mall,'' Eric Erwin, a county deputy, told The
Associated Press. A jail headcount confirmed that no one was
missing. ``We wasted about 30 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that wearing the look-alike clothing was unwise, and
not just because it was less durable than the real thing. ``It
might be the `in' thing to do,'' he said, ``but it's not a good
`in' thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange clothing once led New Jersey prison guards to mistake
Department of Environmental Protection scientists for escaped
inmates. Shots were fired, but no one was hurt. The orange slickers
the scientists wore when gathering water samples in marshes, as
they were doing that day near the prison, were meant to reduce the
chances of being accidentally shot by hunters.

   Not Really a Stretch
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which dot-coms and biotechnology start-ups attract
attention from investors and the media must be frustrating to many
an old-economy eager beaver. How else to account for a news release
with this headline: ``Niche-Product Slipcovers Grew Like High-Techs
During 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the issuer, Sure Fit, which says it is the leader in
ready-made slipcovers,  &UR; did &LR;  post 40 percent revenue growth last
year.

COMMENTARY: THE CORRUPTION OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twenty years ago this week the country that had been
Rhodesia, ruled by a tiny white minority, became Zimbabwe. After a
brutal civil war, the handover of power was remarkably calm. Units
of the white army and of the black guerrillas marched together in a
stadium. A few hours earlier Robert Mugabe had reassured whites in
a radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ``If yesterday I fought you as an enemy,'' Mugabe said, ``today
you have become a friend and ally with the same national interests,
loyalty, rights and duties as myself. ... Our majority rule could
easily turn into inhuman rule if we oppressed, persecuted or
harassed those of us who do not look or think like the majority of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   How strange, how sad it is to read those words today. For Mugabe
has become what he said he must not be: an oppressor. He has sent
black mobs to occupy white farms and terrorize their owners and
workers. He has called white farmers ``enemies of Zimbabwe.'' He
contemptuously ignores the law.
</P>
<P>
   What has gone wrong? One thing is sure: Mugabe has been in power
too long. After 20 years he is a living exemplar of Lord Acton's
warning, a cliche by now but still so often true: ``Power tends to
corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   I first met Robert Mugabe in 1979, during the Rhodesian war, at
his headquarters in Maputo, Mozambique. I was impressed by what
seemed to be his cool, practical rationality. Others saw him as the
best hope for a successful Zimbabwe _ among them Lord Carrington,
the tough-minded British foreign secretary who presided over the
negotiations for a transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   How wrong we were, at least over time. At first Mugabe's
leadership was impressive. He dramatically improved schools for the
majority. He left a productive economy largely alone, forgetting
his socialist rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But soon things began to go wrong. A brigade of his army,
trained by North Korean soldiers, abused and murdered thousands of
people in the western part of the country. The population there was
Ndebele-speaking; Mugabe and his followers were mostly Shona.
</P>
<P>
   Then it became clear that the best jobs were going to friends
and relatives of those in power. Mugabe, who had seemed so ascetic,
presided over an increasingly corrupt system.
</P>
<P>
   There were two dangerous consequences. Young people finished
school and could not get work for which they were qualified unless
they knew someone. And the economy ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Today Zimbabwe, a country blessed with superb farmland and
mineral resources, is an economic disaster. Unemployment is
estimated at 50 percent. The inflation rate last year was 60
percent. Gasoline and diesel oil are scarce because there is no
foreign exchange to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The economic distress underlies the occupation of white-owned
farms. They constitute most of the best land in the country, and
there is obviously a good argument that that is unjust. But the way
the issue has been brought to a boil reflects not the moral claim
so much as cynical politics: an effort by President Mugabe to
distract people from his government's appalling record.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and other countries agreed years ago to help buy out
white farmers if the Mugabe government produced a plan to turn the
land over to blacks who could work it effectively. But most of the
land that has been bought has gone not to needy peasant farmers but
to government cronies, unable to use it productively.
</P>
<P>
   With a serious opposition movement mobilizing for the first
time, and elections due next month, Mugabe sent thugs on a rampage
against white farmers and their black workers. He called them ``war
veterans.'' Actually, they are a paid rent-a-mob used otherwise to
break up opposition political meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For most poor Zimbabweans, the real issue is not farmland but
jobs. As in the rest of the world, young people who have gone
through school want urban lives. Their outlook is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Does Robert Mugabe care? I doubt it. He cares about holding onto
power. The inevitable comparison, one he bitterly resents, is with
Nelson Mandela. President Mandela meant it when he said that South
Africa was for all its people, of whatever race; and he gave up
power. He cared for his country.

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next month, if she's not busy power-lunching with her new
business partner, Richard Dreyfuss, or fielding e-mails from London
and Tokyo, Ashley Power may pause to celebrate her 15th year on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   But probably not for long. When you're an aspiring Internet
mover and shaker employing 30 adults, including your own mother and
stepfather, lots of people want a piece of your time.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name Hollywood actors. MTV development honchos. Venture
capitalists with eyes locked like heat-seeking missiles on the next
big thing. And, of course, newspaper and television reporters
panting over a killer combination of smarts, ambition, great teeth
and runway-model poise, all wrapped up in one wholesomely
suburbanized Southern California package.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention your high school teachers, your two-year-old
brother, Josh, who sometimes needs babysitting, a pair of sweet but
labor-intensive Labradors, and a cadre of caring friends who can't
always understand why you're no longer able to drop everything and
grab a mocha or hit the malls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are those thousands of other teens, the
hormonally dazed and confused masses you set out to comfort, amuse
and commiserate with, via your swiftly rising Internet Web site,
Goosehead.com.
</P>
<P>
   Er, better make that Goosehead.com Inc., the privately held
Studio City- based startup that Ashley and her parents are hoping
to turn into a multi-media New Economy pacesetter.
</P>
<P>
   In the scant 18 months since Ashley founded her interactive
brainchild, the Toluca Lake teen has watched Goosehead.com grow
into one of the World Wide Web's biggest and most popular pubescent
hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   For Ashley, the project began simply enough as a do-it-yourself
hobby, as well as a kind of one-person protest against the
cluelessness of most existing ``teen'' Web sites _ much of whose
content is blatantly fabricated by adults.
</P>
<P>
   But with technical help from her mom, Michelle Schilder, 33, her
step-dad, Mark Schilder, 38, and a small team of risk-taking
financial investors, the site has quickly blossomed into a bustling
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Named for a cement goose statue that was accidentally
decapitated when the family moved into its current home,
Goosehead.com is the Y2K equivalent of the old-fashioned,
multi-generational corner grocery store. Or perhaps a post-nuclear
version of ``The Brady Bunch'' in which Marcia is CEO of Mike's
architecture firm, and Carol is her executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends think my parents are like the coolest,'' enthuses
Ashley, who has kept her biological father's surname, ``because
they're young and stuff, so they totally get it, for the most part.
I don't get away with as much as I probably could if my parents
were old. They know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Schilders seem better equipped than most American
parents to handle the vicissitudes of the information age, and its
capacity for turning several million years of parent-child
relations upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   After overcoming their initial skepticism when Ashley first
proposed expanding her then- four-month-old Web site, the Schilders
helped their daughter assemble financial backers. They then formed
a corporation, purchased the necessary equipment, rustled up office
space and hired a staff _ all within the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, a successful painter and graphics designer, now serves as
Goosehead's co-chair, helping Ashley supervise creative
``content.'' Michelle, also an artist and designer, handles the
company's business-development end. Ashley is listed as
``president, co-chair and founder,'' a pretty heady title for a
high school freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes, because we spend a lot of time
together,'' says Michelle, an upbeat, direct woman. ``We get on
each others' nerves a lot. I think we've learned over the last year
that the most effective way to make it work is to communicate, and
not let things eat at you and bug you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just always had a really open relationship with
Ashley,'' Mark chimes in. ``We've always just had the attitude of
talking about everything. If she comes to you with a subject, don't
try and milquetoast it.''
</P>
<P>
   With her parents firmly in her corner, Ashley has worked to make
Goosehead.com steadily bigger and better. When the site was
overhauled, redesigned and relaunched Feb. 28, it boasted
cutting-edge graphics, free e-mail accounts, access to
teen-oriented World Wide Web search engines, chat rooms, message
boards and savvy, un-patronizing advice on dating, sex and
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it's been drawing about 100,000 electronic visitors
every day, an impressive number considering that its principal
audience is probably preoccupied with mowing lawns and studying
algebra.
</P>
<P>
   But the site's most significant calling card is ``Whatever,'' an
amiably outspoken live-action cyber serial that stars Ashley as her
Valley Girl alter-ego, Skye Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skye's kind of like me,'' says Ashley, flashing a knowing
grin. ``Some of the stuff she goes through is stuff that I go
through, like being grounded or having her parents take her phone
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with such age-old adolescent sturm und drang as geeky
classmates, pesky younger siblings and nosy (if well-meaning)
parents, the free Netcast program can be easily downloaded and
viewed in the privacy of one's own bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Whatever,'' which Ashley developed and co-wrote with her
stepfather, may soon be getting streamed in a few Hollywood
executive suites as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two weeks ago, after meeting to brainstorm with Ashley
and her parents, actor Richard Dreyfuss announced that he was
signing on as a Goosehead.com partner. He'll also provide future
interactive content for the site, and hopes to develop programming
for multi-media syndication.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss' older brother Lorin also is a partner with the
company, and Lorin's 13-year-old daughter, Natalie has acted in
previous ``Whatever'' episodes, which helped turn uncle Richard on
to Gooshead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Ashley is going to have a helluva lot of fun with
this thing, as is everyone visiting it, which is already a lot,''
Richard Dreyfuss says, ``and I wanted to have some of that fun, so
here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Since news of Dreyfuss' involvement with Goosehead broke in the
trade papers, dozens of e-mail requests, business proposals and
solicitations from other celebrities have flooded the company's
sparsely furnished Studio City offices.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes this level-headed adolescent feel excited but
slightly unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest,'' says Ashley, leaning her 5'9''-inch frame
onto a kitchen counter at her parents' spic-and-span country-modern
home. ``Sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I'm on the verge of
having, like, a nervous breakdown. Because a normal teenager, a
normal person who's my age, their job is to go to school. And for
me it's different. I have two jobs. I have a job to be a student
and a daughter, and a president of a company.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Ashley is roughly the same age as the cyber revolution.
She remembers getting her first computer, ``a little tiny Mac,''
when she was eight. She has virtually never known a world without
gigabytes or e-mail. As she expresses it on her homepage: ``My
computer is a life line. I live on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up amid virtual environments, Ashley has no trouble
fingering what bugs her about conventional ``teen'' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little, like, messy or a little like Yahoo!-ish.
Too much stuff,'' she says. ``I just couldn't really relate to it,
the writing and the way they talked. I was like, `That doesn't
sound like me and my friends.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for those relentlessly ``with-it'' TV shows like
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved 'Dawson's Creek' the first season. After that it was
just like a flippin' soap opera. It wasn't real, it wasn't true.
Like, my mom would let me go crawl into some boy's window and spend
the night in his bed?!''
</P>
<P>
   Too old for Pokemon, too young to day-trade, Ashley wanted her
site to appeal to the middle- school crowd, a notoriously slippery
demographic.
</P>
<P>
   By studying web-page design books and getting writing tips from
Mark and design help from her mother, she began constructing her
site in earnest in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``She focused on things she liked, as opposed to focusing on
things she thought people would like, or what adults might think a
teenager would like,'' Mark says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although her name sounds as if it might've been dreamed
up at a Warner Bros. story meeting, a few blocks away from her
home, Ashley Power is, as she herself claims, a pretty typical
upper-middle-class Valley teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair is its natural color. Apart from a double piercing on
her left ear, she doesn't sport any fashionable body impalings or
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the office, the company president does her homework,
takes out the trash, washes her dishes and cleans up after the
dogs. Between snowboarding engagements and learning to play guitar,
she finds time to attend a local church with her mother and
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mastering the new religion of high technology at first proved
tricky for Ashley. So she started firing off e-mails to various
Internet servers and site designers, seeking advice.
</P>
<P>
   One of her early contacts was Pat Galvin, 44, a Net
entrepreneur. Eventually, he became one of five Goosehead.com
partners who ponied up a total of $250,000 for the startup's
first-round of funding, plus untold hours of expertise and sweat
equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a sweetheart,'' Galvin says of Ashley. ``She's really
intelligent and didn't treat me any different than anyone else.
Just asks questions and gives her thoughts. And I never anticipated
it being where it's at right now. I was just happy to help. Still
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with snapshots of family, friends and pets, the initial
Goosehead site also offered pointers on coping with the
peer-pressured living hell otherwise known as eighth grade _ a
subject about which Ashley claims a hard-won expertise. When she
transferred schools between seventh and eighth grades, she says,
many of her new classmates were less than welcoming. (She has since
moved on to a Valley parochial high school.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she wanted to help, in some way, somebody who was
going through what she went through,'' says Michelle.
</P>
<P>
   More than other family units, Ashley, Michelle and Mark seem to
have grown up together, an experience that has helped cement their
new business partnership.

   Raised as an only child until Josh was born, Ashley _ whose high
school basketball coach nicknamed her ``Mom'' because she was
always ministering to teammates _ was exposed to adults from an
early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``She literally was hanging out with me and my friends,'' says
Michelle, who was just 18 when Ashley was born.
</P>
<P>
   Mark likes to tell a story about an incident that occurred
shortly after he and Michelle first got together. One day when
Michelle was at work and Mark was home, Ashley, then about 4, came
down with a bug and began vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never dealt with a child on that,'' Mark recalls. ``I
call Michelle like, 'What do I do?!' And she's like, 'Ashley will
walk you through it.' She (Ashley) had this really high fever. And
it was more like Ashley was the adult, telling me how to (take care
of her).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end of the workday, it's clear who the real
parents are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I sit here and, like, boss people around,''
Ashley says. ``We all work together and make decisions together. So
I really don't have a problem going home and just being the kid and
listening to my parents. Because I always listen to them. I just
have never been very rebellious.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Michelle and Mark sound more concerned about their
daughter's perfectionist streak _ what Michelle describes as
Ashley's tendency to ``beat up on herself'' if something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of weight on my shoulders,'' Ashley says of her
potentially brilliant new career. ``And I've been trying now to
kind of take those weights off, just by accepting the fact that
other people are helping me, and they're willing to help and I need
to let them help and not do everything myself.''

for Sunday, April 23, will move Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. Cell phones are required for professionals
from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the
first CD players, gadget freaks have often seemed to exist in a
jargon-filled matrix of their own, oblivious to the mundanities of
civil society. By Amy Harmon. (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped
the modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose initial
public offering in January zoomed from an initial price of $2 a
share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder
and chief executive officer, Ethan Proctor, 17, the youngest
dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off in
technology stocks, however, PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4. An
interview with Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel
naked. Private companies are launching increasingly sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites, and governments are finding it harder to
restrict what snapshots they distribute to anyone willing to pay
the price. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam war, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox BUtterfield.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
Parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By
Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: the way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

RENAULT AGREES TO ACQUIRE SAMSUNG MOTORS OF SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PARIS _ Renault SA, the French automaker, reached an agreement
Friday to acquire the ailing Samsung Motors of South Korea,
concluding its second major acquisition in Asia in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Renault, which last year acquired 37 percent of the troubled
Japanese car maker, Nissan, said last month it hoped the takeover
of Samsung would enable it to challenge the market leader, Hyundai,
by securing 10 percent to 15 percent of the South Korean automobile
market.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the Samsung acquisition were not announced,
but Renault is believed to have agreed to pay $340 million to $350
million. Of that price, Renault is expected to pay about $100
million in cash, with the remainder to be paid over a 10-year
period. Renault will also assume about $200 million in Samsung
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was reached after four months of negotiations
when Samsung's South Korean creditors, led by Hanvit Bank Group,
agreed to settle $262 million in debt that the French car maker had
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest entry by a Western automaker into the
Asian market, which was shaken badly by the economic crisis there
in 1998. Last month, DaimlerChrysler AG agreed to pay $2.1 billion
for a 33 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Over the last two
years, seven of Japan's 11 car makers have linked up in various
degrees with foreign partners. Another South Korean car maker,
Daewoo, is up for sale, and Western car makers, including General
Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Fiat of Italy, are bidding for
control.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung's principal creditors, who effectively took over the
company last July after it foundered under a debt burden of $3.9
billion, are expected to meet Monday to confirm the acquisition,
which would be sealed in a signing ceremony later next week. A
Renault spokesman said further details of the deal would be
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had been expected for weeks, after negotiators
gradually narrowed the differences between what Samsung's creditors
wanted and what Renault was willing to pay. But it hit a snag
recently after Renault discovered $262 million in debt that Samsung
Motors owed its parent company, Samsung Corp. By Friday, the price
of Samsung shares had fallen to almost one-quarter of their value
last year, before the debt crisis engulfed the company.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition means Samsung will survive as a company, which
was started with the help of Nissan in 1998 but was essentially
taken over by the banks last year after its debt overtook its
assets by about $1 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Samsung basically consists of the company's factory in Pusan,
which can make 240,000 cars annually, largely using Nissan
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the final ownership breakdown, Renault will have 70 percent
of Samsung, Samsung Corp. will hold 20 percent and the creditor
banks will hold 10 percent through a debt-for-equity swap.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest entry by a Western automaker into the
Asian market, which was shaken badly by the economic crisis there
in 1998. Last month, DaimlerChrysler AG agreed to pay $2.1 billion
for a 33 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Over the last two
years, seven of Japan's 11 car makers have linked up in various
degrees with foreign partners. Another South Korean automaker,
Daewoo, is up for sale, and Western car makers, including General
Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Fiat of Italy, are bidding for
control.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the economy in Japan, South Korea's economy has been
mending rapidly. In 1999, about 910,000 new cars were sold there,
and the number is expected to rise to about 1.5 million this year.
But Hyundai and its partners control about 70 percent of the
market, which remains tightly closed to foreign car makers, who
last year sold only about 2,400 cars in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For Renault, the stake in Nissan should be an asset in resolving
Samsung's problems, given the traditional links between the
Japanese and South Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ghosn, a senior executive of Renault who was named
Nissan's chief operating officer, said last week he expected Nissan
to return to profitability in fiscal 2000, which ends March 31 of
next year. Ghosn, a former executive of Michelin, the French tire
maker, has been subjecting Nissan to a rigorous regime of slashing
purchasing costs, shutting factories and reducing the number of
employees. Renault is expected to apply similar rigorous
cost-cutting methods at Samsung.
</P>
<P>
   Renault, which is 44 percent owned by the French government, has
been using its purchases in Asia to extend the market for its cars,
about 85 percent of which are sold in Europe. It has little
presence in the United States, and until the Nissan acquisition,
virtually none in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Samsung has been wrought with political sensitivity.
The South Korean automobile industry was a powerful symbol of
ambitious South Korean industrialization in recent years, and labor
unions and other critics of the deal with Renault attacked it as a
sellout to foreign interests. But the South Korean government had
no alternative, given the absence of suitors other than Renault.

   ALMEIDA-THEATER (London) _ If we discount the much-hyped London

Peter Shaffer (``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').

French painting that in 1868 Rodolphe Julian, a former wrestler,

DANCE WORKSHOP OFFERS CASES OF THE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too bad ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''
is already the name of a movie. It would have been a fine title for
the Fresh Tracks program on Wednesday night at Dance Theater
Workshop. Jittery women filled all the offerings of this latest
event in a series featuring new choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jitters held the attention: for instance, the
uncertain steps forward and backward that Monica Bill Barnes took
in ``She's Snapped, She Left,'' a solo in which she appeared to be
trying to survive in the rat race of daily life. And the
deliberately awkward way in which Ivy Baldwin had four women slip
and slide in ``One Flew Sideways'' made this piece a study of
desperate attempts to preserve physical and mental balance.

   Several dances emphasized eye-catching costumes or props.
Portraying a woman desperate for attention in ``If I Were a Beauty
Queen,'' Michel Yang posed and preened while trying on various
articles of clothing. Then, apparently realizing that glamour does
not necessarily guarantee peace of mind, she doused herself with
water.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes props were more interesting than movement. In her
``Secret History of Water,'' Tessa Nebrida bathed her feet in a
bowl as if performing a mysterious purification ritual. The women
with apples on their heads in Carmelita Naval's ``Tell'' could have
been William Tell's children, but they moved for no apparent
reason. And ``Coldblooded Was the Bird,'' choreographed by Despina
Stamos and Wen-Shuan Yang, was little more than a display of
objects like a drawing of a rooster, a toy cat on wheels, a serving
dish and a cardboard pitcher paired with a real glass. There were
also a few dance steps _ nervous ones, of course _ to help get the
props in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be repeated on Wednesday night at Dance Theater
Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea.

CHOREOGRAPHER BRINGS INTELLIGENCE TO A BARE-BONES PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The production values were simple and the theater a
bare-bones affair. An air of youngsters' getting together to put on
a show hung over ``Lil' This, Lil' That,'' a program presented by
Earl Mosley's Diversity of Dance company on Thursday night at the
Chernuchin Theater. But out of those homemade materials came an
evening of crackling imagination, hilarity and terrific performing.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, a teacher at the Alvin Ailey school, makes dances that
are comfortably rooted in the jazz and modern-dance idioms, though
he has a fondness for the occasional extraneous-looking gesture or
move. He knows how to make his dancers look good. What stands out
most about his work, however, is its fresh intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In two duets from the new ``Pass It On,'' Mosley suggests
complex relationships through movement alone. Brian Brooks and
Alenka Flanders are the elegantly taut first couple, circling and
passing each other, then fleetingly clinching in odd and unexpected
ways. Laura Rossini and Matthew Rushing are lovers whose moodiness
fills the air with sultry electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Words,'' a new suite of five solos set to music by
Charlie Coleman, inhabits an entirely different universe. The
dances are preceded by short, vivid poems by five authors, read on
tape. The solos embody rather than illustrate the poems, again
through physical acting made even more vibrant here by Mosley's
sense of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Leonides D. Arpon is an agile, ground-hugging creature with a
flicking tongue in ``Lizard People.'' Djassi Johnson's clawing
bundle of energy picks up its bowl, tilts it back and drinks in
``Cat in the Can.'' Frightened and meditative in turn, Ilana
Shtayer seems impelled by the danger described in her poem in
``Restless.'' Flanders reaches out to a sun that she fears in
``Frozen Tears.'' And Brooks is a vain dancer who gives new meaning
to vamping in ``Red.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Archibald, one of three guest choreographers,
contributed ``Sweet Signs,'' a simple trio for three young women
finding themselves to music by Terrence Blanchard, danced
powerfully by Maya Stewart, Rayven Ramijo and Cari Lynn Orr. Kanji
Segawa was a sleek, earthly angel in Arpon's ``Near My God to
Thee.'' And five men wound through a mysterious ritual in Sharon
Wong's ``Uncommon Dialogue,'' danced to music by Abdullah Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be repeated through April 30 at the Chernuchin
(314 West 54th Street, Clinton).

(For release Sun., April 23) 
 By JOEL KOTKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Maguire gazes out from the 45th floor of
his downtown building, at a corporate center that is no more.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's development company, Maguire Partners, owns more prime
real estate in downtown Los Angeles and other parts of the region
than almost any other private landlord. And he has watched as one
major corporation after another _ including flagship tenants for
his properties _ has been acquired or moved its headquarters out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   The latest high-profile loss is the Times Mirror Corp.,
publisher of The Los Angeles Times. When, after more than a century
of control by the powerful Chandler family, the company is acquired
by the Tribune Co. of Chicago, it will join a list of former
linchpins like the Security Pacific and First Interstate banks,
Great Western Financial, Atlantic-Richfield, Lockheed and Carter
Hawley Hale, the retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the big companies here have taken a pill that
makes them go away,'' said Maguire, who is 65. ``The city can
survive without them, but not as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other entrepreneurs in Los Angeles, though, Maguire is less
interested in talking about the past than about the great
opportunities he sees in the region's sprawling, now largely
pillarless economy. After a sharp drop-off in the early 1990s, Los
Angeles has rebounded smartly: unemployment has fallen by nearly
half, to 5.5 percent, thanks to growth in technology, media, trade
and even industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   This revived economy barely resembles the big-company city of 20
or 30 years ago, which was built around titanic military
contractors, movie studios and land development interests that
arose after World War II to create one of the world's largest urban
agglomerations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nation's biggest cities, Los Angeles has one of the
highest percentages of private sector employment in companies with
fewer than 100 workers, according to Cognetics, a research firm.
The city is now home to fewer Fortune 500 companies than San
Francisco, never mind New York or Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has become an anomaly,'' said Lloyd Greif, a
native Angeleno whose specialty investment bank, Greif &AMP;  &UR; Co. &LR; ,
caters to smaller local companies. ``It has always had an
entrepreneurial undercurrent to it, a Wild West kind of
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the new grass-roots vitality of the city: Although
the giant commercial banks have been leaving, venture capital has
been pouring in. Southern California now attracts more new venture
capital investment than any region of the country except the Boston
area and Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With aerospace still in decline, software and information
industry employment has surged, particularly in a plethora of
smaller e-commerce and digital entertainment companies in Los
Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the city's other industries are also increasingly
characterized not by a few large companies, but by sprawling
networks of smaller ones. Such companies account for most
employment in the city's apparel industry, now the nation's
largest, and its resurgent furniture industry.
</P>
<P>
   The decentralized pattern parallels geographical and ethnic
changes in the city's business structure. Once a prospective
``capital of the Pacific Rim'' that aspired to rival Manhattan,
downtown Los Angeles no longer has even the thinnest of claims to
being the business center of its own region. The Westside district
has eclipsed it, not only in total office space but also in rental
and occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even the San Fernando Valley, partly inside and partly outside
the city limits, has a stronger claim to primacy than downtown: it
is home to three Fortune 500 companies, including Walt Disney, now
arguably the region's most important company. According to a recent
survey by Manpower, the staffing agency, companies in the valley
expect to add workers this year at twice the rate of their
center-city counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the business leadership in the central business
district was almost entirely white and largely from the Midwest.
Today, the city's emerging leaders are mainly immigrants _ mostly
from Asia, the Middle East and Latin America _ who dominate the
apparel business and play important roles in international trade
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles immigrants are almost twice as likely to start their
own businesses as their counterparts in New York, Chicago and
similar large cities, according to a recent study by the Center for
Immigration Studies in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the technology sector is coming to be dominated by
immigrants. Rohit Shukla, the Bombay-born president of the Los
Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, estimates that as many as
half of the region's high-technology companies are now run by
immigrants, particularly in heavily Asian areas like the San
Gabriel Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Shukla believes that on balance, the city is better off without
mandarins like the Chandlers, who for decades shaped the city, its
politics and cultural life. ``The Chandlers were dissociated from
reality for a long time,'' Shukla said. ``They didn't notice that
in the 1990's a whole new bunch of people had come to replace them,
people with little baggage of the past who have been reviving our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see a downside in the evaporation of the old-school
business establishment. Steven Koltai, president of Event.411, an
Internet company in Marina del Rey with 100 employees, points to
dwindling corporate support for the arts and charities, which must
increasingly depend on the whims of the region's large supply of
wealthy individuals from Hollywood or other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of large institutions like banks makes it hard to
develop a center of gravity for the city,'' said Koltai, who was an
executive vice president at Warner Brothers before starting
Event.411 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the relative absence of an entrenched elite, and the
wide dispersal of potential business locations, allowed smaller
companies to grow unfettered by hierarchies or overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a lack of central control and authority
here,'' he said. ``But the freewheeling, open kind of `let's go for
it' spirit remains this city's major advantage.''

   America's famous ``new economy'' promised rapid growth without
inflation. Yet its inflation rate is now the highest of any big
rich economy. No wonder share prices tumbled when the latest
figures were published on April 14. Those who have, over the past
few years, made much of America's Goldilocks economy (neither too
hot, nor too cold) should have remembered that the tale ends with
Goldilocks being chased away by the bears. &QL;

   As the Elian Gonzalez soap opera drags on daily, Miami's Cuban
exiles are increasingly, utterly immovable on one point: they will
not deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil,
and six-year-old Elian their saint. How misguided they are. The
Economist yields to nobody when it comes to contempt for Castro,
but to use Elian for propaganda purposes, as the exiles now are, is
exactly the tactic Castro would choose. He is getting enormous
mileage out of this case. It shows, even better than the trade
embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the United States can be. &QL;

   Is the western world's concern about the deteriorating turn of

is no other honest answer. Yet outsiders are right to be concerned
about Zimbabwe, not least because what happens there will have a
profound effect upon what happens in other parts of Africa, and
therefore upon all Africans, black and white. &QL;

   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little to Brazil. Its discovery
by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April 22, 1500, and by
accident, when a fleet bound for India was blown off course.
Brazilians mark that event this weekend, amid much soul-searching
about what makes them unique. After 500 years, it is now high time
for South America's giant to shake off its lingering inferiority
complex. &QL;

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet
Central Asian republics. It dispatched a series of senior
government officials _ including CIA head George Tennet, FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully
clear that the Saudi regime cannot keep itself and all of its
citizens solvent without a major economic overhaul. &QL;

hot, nor too cold) should have remembered that the tale ends with
Goldilocks being chased away by the bears. &QL;

   As the Elian Gonzalez soap opera drags on daily, Miami's Cuban
exiles are increasingly, utterly immovable on one point: they will
not deal with Cuba while Fidel Castro is in power. He is the devil,
and six-year-old Elian their saint. How misguided they are. The
Economist yields to nobody when it comes to contempt for Castro,
but to use Elian for propaganda purposes, as the exiles now are, is
exactly the tactic Castro would choose. He is getting enormous
mileage out of this case. It shows, even better than the trade
embargo can, how vindictive and inhumane the United States can be. &QL;

   Is the western world's concern about the deteriorating turn of

people being beaten and shot there are white? Frankly, yes. There
is no other honest answer. Yet outsiders are right to be concerned
about Zimbabwe, not least because what happens there will have a
profound effect upon what happens in other parts of Africa, and
therefore upon all Africans, black and white. &QL;

   The rest of the Americas celebrated, or mourned, their
``discovery'' by Europeans back in 1992, the quincentenary of
Columbus's landfall. But that meant little to Brazil. Its discovery
by the Portuguese came eight years later, on April 22, 1500, and by
accident, when a fleet bound for India was blown off course.
Brazilians mark that event this weekend, amid much soul-searching
about what makes them unique. After 500 years, it is now high time
for South America's giant to shake off its lingering inferiority
complex. &QL;

   One of the issues on which Al Gore expects to trounce George W.
Bush this election year is the environment. Understandably so. The
vice president's reputation as somebody who cares deeply, really
deeply, about the planet is well known. On the evidence of his 1992
book-manifesto, ``Earth in the Balance,'' whose second edition
arrives in bookstores this weekend to coincide with ``Earth Day
2000,'' Gore is, in fact, a hypocrite of heroic proportions. His
description of the environmental ``crisis,'' and his way of
thinking about it, could not be more extreme. Is Gore's expounded
hot air contributing to global warming? &QL;

   Fresh on the heels of Vladimir Putin's election last month as
Russia's new president, the American government has wasted no time
in asserting its interests in the oil-rich region of the ex-Soviet

Director Louis Freeh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ to
the region immediately following the Russian election. &QL;

dear-oil 1981 to $6,526 in cheap-oil 1998, it is becoming painfully

PEPSI SHAREHOLDER TELLS OF ANNUAL-MEETING ODYSSEY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Practically no one bothers to go to annual meetings these days
except company executives and retired shareholders. And that, it
seems, is pretty much the way corporate America likes it,
considering that most companies have done away with perks like free
food for those who do show up.
</P>
<P>
   So it was all the more remarkable that Steve Hindi took the
trouble to travel from his home near Chicago to suburban New York
last May for PepsiCo's annual gathering. Far from getting the
red-carpet treatment, though _ or a free lunch, or even a free
Pepsi _ Hindi became enmeshed in a Kafka-esque adventure that
puzzles him to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Hindi, who owns about $5,000 worth of Pepsi stock, heads an
animal-rights organization called SHARK, short for Showing Animals
Respect and Kindness. A one-time hunter and deep-sea fisherman, he
became repelled, he said, by both pastimes after attending a
particularly gory pigeon shoot. Since then, he has devoted his
spare time to defending animals against onslaughts of various
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   When Hindi, who by day is president of Allied Tubular Rivet, a
maker of industrial fasteners in Geneva, Ill., discovered that
PepsiCo advertised in bullfighting rings in Mexico and Spain, he
was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is a certain mystique in bullfighting, with the
costumes and everything,'' he said. ``But the nerve of the
bullfighter is really more about having the nerve to walk in front
of anybody after what he's done to the bull. These people are among
the worst animal abusers on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote to Pepsi, asking it to pull its ads, and started a Web
site (www.pepsibloodbath.com), on which he posted photographs and
video clips showing blood-covered bulls beneath bright-blue Pepsi
banners. And he prepared a statement asking the company to cuts its
ties to bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find any association with bullfighting to be in stark
contrast to the public image and supposed ideals of Pepsi,'' the
statement read in part.
</P>
<P>
   He faxed a copy to Pepsi's shareholder-relations department and
was told he could read it at last year's meeting. ``I asked them:
Is there any problem with this? And they said: No, we're looking
forward to seeing you.''
</P>
<P>
   A PepsiCo representative, Rosemary O'Brien, suggested that he
get to the meeting an hour before it was scheduled to start ``so
she could find seating for my two companions and me,'' Hindi
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But when he and two other SHARK volunteers drove into PepsiCo's
tree-lined, sculpture-studded campus in Purchase, N.Y., he said,
they were greeted by security guards asking for identification and
were directed to a separate parking lot. There Hindi was told he
would not be allowed into the meeting. When he asked why, ``They
said, `Well, we received a bomb threat from Illinois.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hindi insisted to the guard and to a PepsiCo lawyer, Lawrence
Dickie, who had been summoned to the parking lot, that his
organization was not violent and that no one had made a bomb
threat. ``I've always said that's not how you get the issue
resolved,'' he said of tactics like spattering paint on fur coats.
``If we're right, that this is cruelty to animals, then that's what
you have to bring to people, not all this extraneous nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi officials apparently did not believe him. ``They said,
`Well, we have an audiotape, and we've already contacted the FBI,
the state and county police and local police,''' Hindi said.
</P>
<P>
   He was kept out of the meeting, but the building was not
evacuated, he noted, and no one else was stopped from going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, I understand why you are concerned about what I
have to say,'' Hindi said. ``But let's not be making bomb-threat
claims. I offered to let them search me, but they didn't. So if I'm
not the guy carrying the bomb, I must have some other method. But I
am the only guy they kept out. Why weren't they worried about
anyone else's safety?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Detwiler, a spokesman for PepsiCo, confirmed that
Hindi was met in the parking lot and prevented from attending the
May 5 meeting. But he insisted that no one had received a bomb
threat, only a general threat, and said the company had a tape of
the telephone call that he had personally listened to _ though he
would not make the tape available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who identified himself as a terrorist and as an
opponent of bullfighting called and made some kind of general
threat of bodily harm,'' Detwiler said. ``We brought this to the
attention of the FBI and New York State Police. We had some state
police anti-terrorist experts present at our meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began as scheduled and ended without incident,
Detwiler said. Hindi flew back to Chicago that afternoon, with the
bullfighting statement still tucked in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Now shareholder-meeting season has rolled around again. Most
large companies schedule their meetings between the beginning of
March and the end of May, meaning that the gadflies and proxy cards
start appearing about the same time as crocuses and daffodils.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual began as a legal requirement for a meeting at least
once a year and has had its moments as a marketing ploy, with
product giveaways, free lunches and the screening of coming
television ads.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, attendance has often waned, partly
because companies _ not wanting to spend too much time on voting,
or to have executives subjected to tirades from audience members _
have tried to make meetings less attractive by offering few perks
and holding them in some undesirable or hard-to-get-to place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been moving more and more in the direction of having your
meeting in the basement of the Hotel Dupont,'' said Patrick McGurn,
director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder
Services, a Rockville, Md., company that tracks the trend. He was
referring to a hotel in Wilmington, Del., where many companies are
incorporated. ``The trend is toward shorter and shorter meetings,
and a lot of companies have dropped the goody bag and offered
nothing but coffee, literally to discourage people from coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the companies that still try to pamper investors get a
minimal turnout. A spokeswoman for CSX, which gives shareholders
discounts on rooms at the deluxe Greenbrier resort in West Virginia
and holds an elaborate lunch for them as part of the annual
meeting, said only about 4 percent of shareholders attended.
</P>
<P>
   And when stockholders do show up, Hindi's story suggests,
companies want nothing to rock the boat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No charges were ever filed against him or anyone from his
organization. But a few weeks after the meeting, he asked various
local police agencies, as well as the New York State Police and the
Illinois State Police, whether anyone had reported a bomb threat at
Pepsi around the time he was there. He also called the FBI and made
a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief was that no one had made the call,'' he said. ``It
was all just way too coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   The local and state police agencies all told him in writing that
they had no record of such a call. But a few weeks ago, 10 months
after the meeting, he received a report from the FBI that centered
on a call made on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caller claimed to be a terrorist and that he wanted to
stop the blood bath even if it may hurt many people,'' the report
said. ``The concern is for an upcoming stockholders' meeting this
week in Purchase, N.Y.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents in Chicago said they tracked down the telephone
number from which the call is said to have come, but the report
indicates that the person who owned the telephone had nothing to do
with any call. On Oct. 6, the agent assigned to the matter wrote,
``Due to the lack of positive leads regarding this matter, New York
requests that this case be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindi also got a letter from O'Brien at PepsiCo after he wrote
to the chairman, Roger Enrico, to complain about his treatment.
``The difficulty arose when, shortly before the meeting, an
Illinois caller threatened that people were going to get hurt
unless we acted as demanded regarding bullfighting,'' O'Brien
wrote. ``It was determined that the situation constituted a genuine
threat to the safety of the more than 500 attendees at the
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hindi may have lost the battle but won the war. In
recent weeks, PepsiCo has withdrawn its bullfighting ads in Mexico,
Detwiler said, and Hindi has posted a notice to that effect on his
Web site. Detwiler said, ``Mr. Hindi's was among a number of
consumer voices we heard on this issue. We do not support
bullfighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindi also organized a letter-writing campaign, which included
protests from a senior official in the Indian government, a culture
that preaches compassion for animals and a particular reverence for
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hindi is now focusing his efforts on the makers of Corona beer,
Grupo Modelo, which also has ads in bullfighting rings. Anheuser
Busch is the major shareholder in Grupo Modelo.
</P>
<P>
   But Hindi is still wondering about the incident last May, and is
convinced that there was never any threat made by anyone. ``It is
amazing to me,'' he said, ``that a company the size and the stature
of Pepsi would stoop to that level.''

QUAKE III'S TIMEDEMO FEATURE ACCESSED IN COMMAND CONSOLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a couple of reviews of video cards and computers you've
written, you mention running something called timedemo in Quake III
Arena to test the speed of the card and the computer. How do you do
this? I don't see it in the manual.
</P>
<P>
   A: While id Software makes great games, it doesn't do a very
good job of documenting them. Fortunately, the game community on
the Web takes up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   And actually, this is true of many games. If you are interested
in tweaking any PC game's look and performance, you usually can do
so through a series of arcane commands.
</P>
<P>
   In the games that use id's various Quake engines, the commands
usually are entered by hitting the tilde key, which brings down a
command-line console. From here you can type in the commands. A
good place to find lists of these commands is at PlanetQuake,
www.planetquake.com.
</P>
<P>
   The timedemo feature removes a kind of software governor from
Quake III so that it runs at an unrestricted speed. The only things
slowing the game down are the limitations of your computer's
hardware. Because Quake III Arena requires a fairly powerful
computer and graphics card, it's a good test of a modern PC's
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Before you run it, set the graphics settings in the game. You
can choose any of several pre-set configurations in the setup area,
ranging from Fastest to High Quality. You also can mix and match
settings in a custom configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Next, bring down the console by hitting the tilde key and type
this: /set timedemo 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the tilde key again to raise the console. Go to the main
menu of the game and click on Demos, and click on either Demo001 or
Demo002 and click Play.
</P>
<P>
   The demo, which shows a recorded battle, will play very quickly.
When it's done, bring down the console again and you'll see the
average frames-per-second count. You can then tweak the graphics
settings for a good balance of speed and visuals. The more eye
candy you turn on in a game like this, the slower your frame rate
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The timedemo feature also will work in the shareware version of
the game, which you can download for Windows, Macintosh and Linux
computers at www.quake3arena.com/demo/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an older, ISA-based sound card in my computer. I'd
like to replace it with a better one that fits in a PCI slot. What
are the steps in uninstalling and installing sound cards?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's pretty simple, as these things go. Of course, when
adding and removing hardware, simple is relative.
</P>
<P>
   First, you'll uninstall the current drivers. Check in the
Add/Remove Programs module in the Control Panel to see if there is
a listing for the sound card drivers, and if so, use it to remove
them. If not, check for a folder for the card's software in the
Program groups and see if there is an uninstall module in there.
</P>
<P>
   If not, then right-click on My Computer, choose Properties, then
Device Manager. Click on Sound, Video &AMP; Game Controllers, find the
sound card in the list. Click on it and click the Remove button. If
you are asked to restart, say NO. Instead, manually shut down the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Open the case, remove the old card and install the new. Then,
follow the instructions for installing the new card's software.

<P>
   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. Cell phones are required for professionals
from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the
first CD players, gadget freaks have often seemed to exist in a
jargon-filled matrix of their own, oblivious to the mundanities of
civil society. By Amy Harmon. (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped
the modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose initial
public offering in January zoomed from an initial price of $2 a
share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder
and chief executive officer, Ethan Proctor, 17, the youngest
dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off in
technology stocks, however, PipeDream plummeted to 2 1/4. An
interview with Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel
naked. Private companies are launching increasingly sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites, and governments are finding it harder to
restrict what snapshots they distribute to anyone willing to pay
the price. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam war, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox BUtterfield.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
Parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By
Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: the way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

KEEPING THE FAITH
</HEADLINE>
  Exploring the bonds between love and spirituality 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BERNADETTE MURPHY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books reviewed: ``The Ladies Auxiliary'' by Tova Mirvis &QL; 
(311 pages, Norton; $23.95) &QL; 
``Chosen by God: A Brother's Journey'' by Joshua Hammer &QL; 
(241 pages, Hyperion; $22.95) &QL; 
``Love Is Stronger Than Death: The Mystical Union of Two Souls''by
Cynthia Bourgeault &QL; 
(218 pages, Bell Tower; $21) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
How we view spirituality and religious tenets is a huge factor in
how we see the rest of life. Three newly released books _ a novel
and two works of non-fiction _ explore the shadings of these views,
from the rigid lines of Orthodox Judaism found in closed
communities to the more esoteric, touchy-feeling realm of mystical
Christianity explored via an erotic love story.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the books traverse the road between religion as
an expression of obedience and conformity, an allegiance to things
past _ through to a spiritual realm where faith is never static,
but still evolving and, often, quite vague.
</P>
<P>
   In a compelling first novel by Tova Mirvis, ``The Ladies
Auxiliary'' gives us the Jerusalem of the South: a closed Orthodox
Jewish community in Memphis set in the current day where ``Shalom,
y'all'' might be a typical greeting. The tightly woven group of
women who compose the auxiliary hope to raise their children in the
protected world they've painstakingly created.
</P>
<P>
   When a convert, Batsheva, the widow of a young man originally
from the neighborhood, and the couple's young daughter, Ayala, move
in and try to penetrate the established ranks, all that has been so
carefully constructed comes under fire. As difficulties of the
world-at-large impede on the community, a few wise characters
recognize that ``divorce, drugs, and the rest didn't stay at bay''
because they were religious. Maybe religion was a buffer, but
eventually these things found their way in.
</P>
<P>
   The women of the auxiliary refuse to believe this is the true
nature of things. Rather, they look for someone to blame. Batsheva,
whose unbridled joy in her adopted faith calls attention to itself,
whose creativity in celebrating the holidays makes the other women
look less than perfect, is the obvious scapegoat. Though these
devout women of Memphis have always prided themselves on being part
of the friendliest community possible, their faith in the whole
system of belief begins to crumble as the women close ranks in an
effort to protect their children.
</P>
<P>
   To Mirvis' credit, the book skates a fine and exquisite line,
never degenerating into a finger-pointing rant on either the pros
or cons of strict religious observance. Neither camp is demonized.
Rather, she paints a picture in which there's a little good and a
little bad in everyone.
</P>
<P>
   One can easily identify with the auxiliary women's desire to
protect their children from the outside problems, even as they act
in a spiteful manner. The outsider, Batsheva, though portrayed
initially as someone too good to be true, develops into a full
character with an ``improper'' past, a woman who is trying in her
own halting way to find a new home in an imperfect world.
</P>
<P>
   The truth portrayed in this novel is vast and timeless. Those
very things that are meant to bring people closer to each other _
religion, holidays and communal gatherings _ are often the times in
which we feel more alienated than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Woven into the story in a low-key manner is also the issue of
women's equality, especially when it comes to preparing for
holidays, issues that apply to almost every religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we thought about it, there was no reason why the men
shouldn't help get ready for Pesach; they too had been taken out of
Egypt,'' the women mutter as the chores for Passover pile up. As a
first novelist, Mirvis has a keen eye, a sharp intellect and a
kindness that is uncommon in books dealing with touchy subjects
like religion. In reading this novel, one never gets the sense that
Mirvis is being disrespectful or poking fun, nor that she is toeing
some hard-and-fast line. The heartfelt nature of her story comes
through in every sentence, every struggle, every character. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking on the issue of religion and how its practice can cause
separation rather than coherence is the bittersweet memoir ``Chosen
by God: A Brother's Journey'' by Newsweek writer Joshua Hammer. In
this keenly crafted work, Hammer examines his relationship with his
younger brother Tony, who is essentially lost to his family when,
in his early 20s, he enters a closed Hassidic community in upstate
New York. Hammer, like Tony, was raised nominally Jewish and views
his brothers ``embrace of fundamentalism'' as a ``total rejection
of who our family was: secular, liberal agnostics.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially Hammer waits for his brother _ who'd been known to
pick up and drop myriad interests _ to get over it. The years tick
by, and Hammer must finally acknowledge what he has feared. ``I
watch my brother, transfixed,'' he writes of observing his brother
in prayer after a five-year separation, ``repelled by his act of
self-surrender, and amazed at the depth of his emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyelids pressed together, lips pulled back, straining to
concentrate every part of his being on the Creator, the little
brother I grew up with has been transported to a distant place, and
I realize I will never get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of this memoir, in addition to its crisp writing, is
the raw honesty Hammer employs, narrating the conflicted emotions
he feels for his brother. When he decides to re-establish contact
with Tony, for example, Hammer finds he must do so as an objective
journalist in order to skirt ``the full-blooded visceral aversion''
he feels as a brother. ``It was only by approaching him though the
cold eyes of (an author) that I could find a way to repair a rift
and restore a semblance of completeness to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer spends a great deal of time with his brother and his
burgeoning family within their closed community in Monsey, follows
the strict tenets of his brother's faith during those visits, and
tries to understand what has become of the easygoing, goofy brother
he once knew. His journey, which never fully restores his brother
to his life, is filled with head-shaking moments. Asking his
brother why he considers certain leaders to be extraordinarily
holy, for instance, Hammer is baffled by his brother's answers.
Tony reveres one man who ``oversalted his food intentionally just
to spoil the taste,'' and another who had never had a haircut
because it required taking off his yarmulke. ``My brother, who once
idolized such people as Al Pacino and Teddy Kennedy, had developed
some odd new role models.'' When Tony makes a huge exception to
allow his children to go ice skating and enjoy a gypsy carnival,
Hammer's description is filled with the commingled joy and pain of
the children's sheltered life and what he sees as his brother's
limited one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed,'' Hammer writes of Tony ``like any father on an
outing with his children as he sent one ring after another spinning
toward the peg board ... It was the first time in 18 years that I
had seen my brother at play.'' Rather than being cold or
disparaging, the work glimmers with love and insight; it is a
reflection of the brother dance that has been enacted for
generations, regardless of religious differences.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to understand his brother's choices, Hammer comes
to a kind of bruised acceptance, and in some ways, an appreciation
for what his brother has found. When he re-establishes fraternal
ties, Hammer joins Tony in his daily rituals and finds himself
wistfully hoping that he might gain a spark of what his brother
has. Ultimately, he knows that any relationship he builds with Tony
will have to be on Tony's limited terms and sees in the rituals
themselves ``a continual reminder to me of the abyss of perception
that would forever divide us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Something more than perception is the abyss that divides Cynthia
Bourgeault, author of the non-fiction book ``Love Is Stronger Than
Death: The Mystical Union of Two Souls,'' from her beloved, Rafe.
That something is death.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeault, an Episcopal priest, wrote this work to tell the
unconventional love story of her powerful bond with Brother Rafael
Robin, a Catholic monk, with whom she claims to have shared a
mystical, erotic love that has continued to grow and challenge them
both even after his death.
</P>
<P>
   This book takes whatever one believes about the nature of love,
death and static theology and stretches it to its outermost limits.
According to Bourgeault, the path she's sharing with Rafe _ an
active love that continues its dynamism through the opaque curtain
of death _ is largely unrecognized. She suspects that the
invitation to this kind of radical love is frequently declined
because of a ``cultural distrust of erotic love as the true path to
God,'' combined with a ``sloppy theology of death,'' and our
culture's insistence on having ``clear boundaries in
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is Stronger Than Death'' is filled with great chunks of
theology and esoteric learning, but at its core is the story of how
the two came to recognize each other and why they had been drawn
together, if not as soul-mates (a term Bourgeault doesn't care
for), then as parts of an ``ablersoul,'' which she defines as ``a
relationship marked by a particularly intense conviction of
belonging to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Far
more than a partnership, it is a kinship that is intuitively
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the esoteric and theological arguments Bourgeault lays
down seem well-documented, it's the story of the relationship
between herself and Rafe when he was still alive that is most
compelling and the least described. As a person with limited
theological training, this reader wished for more love story and
less theology.
</P>
<P>
   That the line between skepticism and belief jumps frequently in
reading this work points to the hazy outlines Bourgeault is trying
to fill in, using theology and philosophy to make solid an
experience that is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Calling upon mystical Christian traditions to bolster her
arguments, she finds models of death-impervious love in the
relationships of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, St. Francis and St.
Clare, people ``whom our hearts instinctively recognize as couples
despite all efforts to spiritualize or explain away their
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book doesn't move much beyond the conceptual. The
examples from her own life are helpful, but in the long run, too
meager to fully convince. ``Stronger Than Death'' treads the space
where black-and-white leaves off and the enigmatic shades of gray
begin, reminding us of the abstract, intuitive nature of faith and
its opposite, doubt. Prior to Rafe's death, when he was having
trouble understanding and accepting the nature of the relationship,
he told Bourgeault how he came to view their bond: ``I tried to
protect myself by giving it a shape,'' he told her, ``but it has no
shape. All I can do is open my heart more and more deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his devotion to her, the premise of this book seems
amorphous, requiring a type of faith and open-heartedness that,
even with esoteric assurances, is hard to come by. But then again,
if one could see how it all worked, faith wouldn't be
required.!end! &QL;

THESE THREE MICE DEFINITELY NOT BLIND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As much as I hate to write this, I have come to believe it's
true: Microsoft has kicked the legs out from under the business of
designing and selling computer mice.
</P>
<P>
   This is not because the gang in Redmond, Wash., have bullied
competitors, acted in a monopolistic fashion or put horses' heads
in anyone's bed. It's simply because the company has made a better
mouse, instantly rendering almost all other designs obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, I reviewed Microsoft's IntelliMouse Explorer, a
breakthrough product that uses a tiny camera and a red LED to sense
movement instead of a ball. At the time, I was a die-hard Logitech
mouse user, and I figured I'd go back to the Logitech Cordless
MouseMan Wheel once the review was over.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen, much to my horror. I liked the Microsoft
mouse so much that I've stuck with it. Every now and then I'll take
my Cordless MouseMan out of its box, cradle it nostalgically, and
then put it away. I can't bring myself to go back.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliMouse Explorer has three great advantages. You never
have to clean the ball and rollers, there are no moving parts to
wear out or break (except for the buttons and mouse wheel) and it
is very precise. It's excellent for both work and play. Its only
downsides are that it may be too large for some hands, is designed
only for right-handers and is a bit pricey.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of this revelation, I decided to check out three new
mice to see if my newfound belief could be challenged. One of them
is a different Microsoft mouse that uses the same optical
technology, but in a different package.
</P>
<P>
   _ Razer Boomslang 2000, $100, Karna: Among hardcore gamers, the
subject of mice is a passionate one. Gamers feel about their mice
the way guys in the 1950s felt about their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Razer Boomslang debuted last year to mixed reviews. Some
loved its low, sleek design and oversized mouse buttons, while
others complained that it was awkward to use.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no argument that this was one of the most precise
mice around. This latest version is supposed to be five times as
sensitive as standard mice. The drivers even allow you to adjust
the sensitivity of the mouse on the fly, to give you an added boost
in the midst of a virtual firefight.
</P>
<P>
   The Razer Boomslang's design is certainly unique. If the back
end that fits into your palm is insect-like, then the front where
the mouse buttons are located looks like a bug that's been
squashed. The left and right buttons are huge hemispheres with a
wheel in the middle. There are two more buttons on the side of the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a solid heft to it and is slightly textured. The
oversize mouse buttons are a big plus when playing quick-action
games. Overall, the mouse felt good in my hand _ at least
initially.
</P>
<P>
   But after using it for a few hours, I found that it was too low
and caused my hand to cramp a bit. I wanted the back to be higher
and fill my palm better. I also didn't like using it for work _ the
extra sensitivity that helps in games becomes irritating in
productivity applications. Fortunately, the sensitivity-on-the-fly
feature lets you adjust this at will.
</P>
<P>
   I also could not find a way to program the side mouse buttons to
page back and forth in a Web browser, a very useful feature of both
the newest Microsoft and Logitech mouse drivers.
</P>
<P>
   With a USB connection, it was nearly as precise the IntelliMouse
Explorer. The Boomslang driver also has a slick feature that lets
you update the driver painlessly _ just click Update and the new
components are downloaded and installed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   _ ScrollPoint Pro, $39, IBM: The folks at Big Blue had such a
hit on their ThinkPad notebooks with the TrackPoint pointing device
that they put it into a series of mice. But what worked well jammed
into the keyboard on a laptop doesn't necessarily translate when
plunked between the left and right buttons on a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   So IBM has tried again, this time with a variation that replaces
the familiar eraser-style tip with an ergonomic bar where most
mouse makers would place a wheel. It's a much better
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   With the original ScrollPoint mouse, I found my finger tired
when using the tiny TrackPoint head to scroll through Web pages.
Having a wider surface on which to push makes a big difference, and
the drivers that IBM provides also let you fine-tune the
sensitivity of the bar, but I still prefer a wheel for page
scrolling.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse has a blocky design, with a hard edge on the left
side. It looks like a block of clay that's been given a slight
twist, and it's very comfortable to use. Those who like a larger
mouse may love it; those with smaller hands may find it ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Only three buttons are on this mouse _ the traditional left and
right buttons, along with a third button on the left side that's
meant to be used with a thumb. It, too, can't be programmed for use
in paging through a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   _ IntelliMouse Optical, $55, Microsoft: Here's Microsoft's
answer to complaints that lefties and those with small hands were
ignored in the design of the IntelliMouse Explorer. Unfortunately,
in making the changes, some flaws were added to the design.
</P>
<P>
   The IntelliMouse Optical is a simple curve that rises to fill
your palm. It goes straight back, lacking the twist that made the
Explorer comfortable only to right-handers. Long, curved, single
thumb buttons are located on each side.
</P>
<P>
   The Optical model is about 80 percent of the size of the
Explorer and is about $20 cheaper. Children and others with small
hands will like how it feels.
</P>
<P>
   But what I found frustrating was the placement of the thumb
buttons. On the larger Explorer, two thumb buttons are on the left
side _ one at least twice as large as the other. These are
programmed by default as back and forward buttons for Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   At times it was difficult to click the button on the right side
of the mouse using my fingertip. I found myself trying to place the
inside of my ring finger along the button to push it. At other
times, I would hit it without meaning to, which would cause me to
jump forward in my Web browser. It became annoying enough that I
eventually de-activated the extra button.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in using a mouse the employs Microsoft's
optical technology but don't want something as large as the
Explorer, another choice would be the IntelliMouse with IntelliEye,
which uses the original Microsoft Mouse soap-bar shape.

   This week's stories:
</P>
<P>
   CNS-ONLINE-BILLS (New York) _ The idea of paying bills online
has been around for while, but now there's a new wrinkle _ instead
of telling a bank when to pay the bills, consumers can sign up with
an online service. That, of course, raises other issues, like just
how safe is it? By Andrea McDaniels. (1250 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-LONDON-COFFEESHOPS (London) _ England, where a cup of tea is
supposed to solve everything, is under assault from, of all things,
coffee stores. In fact, there are more Starbucks stores in London
than in Seattle. And the British are drinking it up. By Rebecca
Webber. (750 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-FITNESS-CRAZES (New York) _ First came aerobics, then step,
then spinning, and now Pilates and kick-boxing. But every fitness
trend must start somewhere, and every gym must decide what to offer
and what to dump. It's a workout for the fitness directors who have
to decide. By Abby Tegnelia. (950 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-COMEDY-CLASSES (New York) _ When comedians step up to the
microphone, they reveal much about themselves. Would-be comics have
to learn not just timing, but how to plumb their inner souls for
material, and how to develop it into laughs. By William Siss. (1000
words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-NY-SMOKING-TAX (New York) _ When New York nearly doubled its
cigarette tax to $1.11 a pack, its intended purpose was twofold:
discourage people from smoking and take the extra revenue for
health insurance for those too poor to afford it. But critics say
those same people are the ones hit disproportionately by the tax,
and a few die-hard unemployed smokers say it will take more than a
tax to make them stop. By C.M. Lanzillotti. (1100 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-TRAPEZE-DANCERS (New York) _ They float through the air with
the greatest of ease, but these trapeze artists aren't in
performers in the circus. They're dancers, performing what amounts
to ballet high in the air. By Jocelyn Anderson. (950 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-JAIL-CENSUS (Undated) _ Minnesota wants to make sure that
everyone is counted in the census. So it's paying its prisoners $1
each to fill out the forms. That's making at least one lawmaker
very unhappy. By Kate Dawson. (725 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-MILLIONAIRE-PAUPERS (New York) _ These days, what with
Internet and stock market windfalls, being a millionaire doesn't
count for much. Even those who have a few million say they're not
really rich. They're comfortable, maybe, but they say it takes a
lot more than a few million dollars to allow one to feel special.
By Michael Goldman. (950 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-BLIND-GOALBALL (New York) _ The game is a lot like soccer,
with a heavier ball, played indoors, by people who can't see. But
goalball players say the game gives them an opportunity to be
athletes, not merely blind people. By Daisy Nguyen. (850 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-ADOPTING-MINEFIELD (Kusonje, Croatia) _ Not even the
graveyards and churchyards are havens from the legacy of wars.
Minefields are everywhere, in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Mozambique and
other places where the wars have ended but the danger has not. Now
there are efforts in the United States to raise money to pay
professionals to clear away the fear. By Nathan Hegedus. (925
words.)

IS ONLINE BILL-PAYING THE ANSWER FOR BUSY PEOPLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

School of Journalism at Columbia University.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel Isaacs was tired of seeing the stack of bills
looming over his desk every month. The 29-year-old advertising
agent hated having to keep up with what was due when, and paying
late fees for bills that had come in while he was often away from
his home in Austin, Texas. And, frankly, he had had enough of all
that ``licking and sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   So he signed up with Paytrust, one of the three companies online
that offer to organize clients' bill-paying. All his bills now go
directly to Paytrust, which alerts him via e-mail when a bill is
due. At the push of a button _ the company has all his bank-account
information _ he can have Paytrust cut a check or authorize a
credit-card payment. Isaacs doesn't have to keep track of a thing.
And he's reduced the time he spends paying bills from a couple of
hours a month to about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have signed up for one of these online
services, and industry experts expect the field to grow to a
billion-dollar business within a few years. Web portals such as
America Online and Yahoo are expected to offer online bill-payment
under their brands and heavily promote it to their millions of
users.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the technology has to overcome a few hurdles _
people's reluctance to change old habits and their fears about
handing over so much personal information to a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey O'Brien, a senior editor at Wired Magazine in San
Francisco, has been paying his bills online for years through his
bank, Wells Fargo. And yes, he has privacy concerns. ``Consumers
have to think about it. They have to realize the power and depth of
the information'' these companies have.
</P>
<P>
   Is abuse of the information likely? ``Clearly it could happen
somewhere down the road,'' O'Brien says. ``It could be a computer
glitch, an error, or unscrupulous, shady people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Isaacs says the convenience is worth the risk of someone
misusing his financial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier for someone to get hold of my financial
information off my credit card at a gas station or by going through
my garbage than hacking into a secure server,'' he says. ``I'm not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   International Data Group, a California-based technology research
firm, predicts that the electronic bill-paying business will grow
to $1 billion by 2004 with 25 million customers. The segment took
in $32 million in revenues last year, a number that includes online
billing services offered by banks and direct checking companies
such as Checkfree, which allow clients to write checks online.
</P>
<P>
   Online bill payment ``is still in its infancy,'' says research
manager Albert Pang. Part of it is a chicken-and-egg problem.
Companies stand to save big with electronic billing _ an electronic
bill costs 40 cents to send, versus $1.80 to $2.50 for a bill by
mail. But first companies want customers to show more interest in
paying online. On the other hand, customers want more billers to
issue electronic statements. That's on top of people's fear about
sending sensitive financial information online, Pang says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he says, customers may all pay their own bills
online without needing third parties to receive and process paper
bills because everything will be delivered electronically. But he
says this future is still a ways away, since 60 percent of the
population doesn't do anything online. ``This will change as
electronic bill presentment and payment products become more
sophisticated with the inclusion of features such as secure e-mail
delivery,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Paytrust, the oldest of the online bill-paying
companies, has 10,000 customers paying $7.95 a month for the
service (the first three months are free). Paytrust chief executive
Ed McLaughlin says those most open to the idea of using the service
are Internet junkies, people already very comfortable with shopping
online. Also, those who travel a lot, such as military personnel
and business people, use the service because it allows them to keep
up with their bills when they're not there to physically receive
them, companies say. In fact, the founders of Paymybills.com got
the idea after a two-month-long trip to Guatemala that left them
stuck with late credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   But for globe-trotters and homemakers alike, the appeal is
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different from trading stocks online or online
shopping,'' says McLaughlin, who started the company with partner
Flint Lane in September 1998 with $200,000 of their own money. ``In
most households, paying bills is the task that sucks the most.
We're fundamentally compelling people to change their ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Online bill payment isn't a new idea. For years, major banks
allowed customers to check their bank balances, shift funds between
accounts, and issue checks online, and although most consumers
trusted these services, few signed up because they were poorly
promoted and cost money. Now these third-party companies _
Paytrust, Paymybills.com and Cyberbills Inc._ are hoping to
convince consumers that they're equally trustworthy with sensitive
financial information.
</P>
<P>
   Paytrust's guarantee is based on patent-pending technology that
doesn't need humans to operate. The processing center runs bills
through a high-speed scanner, lifts the information, puts it into
computerized form and sends out an e-mail notice to the customer
alerting him as to the arrival of the bill and the due date for
payment. Other companies have employees scan the bill ``blindly'' _
dividing up the task for security reasons so that no one employee
has access to all of the information at once. When the bill is
processed, the company sends an e-mail with a link to the company's
secure server where the customer can view the bill, download it and
make decisions about payment.
</P>
<P>
   Bill paying services can't afford to make a single mistake, says
O'Brien of Wired Magazine. At even ``the germ of impropriety,'' he
says, ``the company will be dismantled,'' possibly bringing down
the entire online bill-paying industry through word-of-mouth panic.
</P>
<P>
   Paymybills.com is the only company that sells insurance to its
clients against the possible misuse of their personal financial
information, offering up to $100,000 in damages. The company says
that's one of the reasons it has been cited by PC World and Forbes
magazine as being among the best on the Web. But to some consumers,
the sales offer itself raises a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing if they gave you the insurance, because
that would mean they stand by their privacy policy,` says Jean Ann
Fox, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of
America. ``But if they sell it to you, that looks like they don't
really believe in what they're doing.'' comments
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lazaroff, director of marketing for Paymybills.com, says the
company offers the policy because it's ``adamant about security.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, it may not be technological insecurity that's the
biggest challenge to the spread of bill paying services _ it's
overcoming the status quo, says Lazaroff, whose firm sprang up last
July and garnered $30 million in its most recent round of funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have to get over the idea that writing checks and
licking stamps is the best way to pay bills,'' he says.  &QL;

COFFEE TAKES ON A TEA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   LONDON  &UR; _ &LR;  To many Americans, a dainty saucer bearing a steaming
teacup, with sweet biscuits on the side, is the stereotypical
vision of British culture. So what does one make of the familiar
round green logo that has popped up on the twisting streets and
historic avenues of England's city on the Thames?
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks coffee, it seems, is posing a challenge to English
tea. The coffee maker from Seattle has installed 124 thriving
coffee shops in the United Kingdom. London alone boasts 67.
Seattle, by comparison, has 66.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have predicted the success of the American coffee
chain in the land where tea has reigned supreme for four centuries.
But from Glasgow to Bath, lattes and Frappuccinos, espressos and
mochaccinos are selling like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has had a great reception in the UK and is excited
about its growth opportunities, according to Helen Benedict, the UK
director of marketing. The company plans to open 50 new stores this
year and establish at least 300 in the UK by 2003, said the chief
executive, Howard Schultz, during a recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain this success? Perhaps the British perceive the
coffee chain, like all things American, as a sort of adorable
grandchild descended from colonial forebears. Or, as some suggest,
it could be because they have never mastered a potable cup of brew,
relying on instant grounds since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee was always drunk, but it was always pretty bad
coffee,'' said London native Daniel Guthrie, explaining why he and
friends welcomed Starbucks with open wallets. ``Now, between 8:30
and 9 every morning, you see everyone clutching their little white
cup on their way between the tube and the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the fad aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee is sort of a new thing, so it's trendy,'' said Jo
Walsh, a 25-year-old Londoner. She visits Starbucks to grab a
coffee and sweet ``to takeaway,'' or to meet up with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks is not the only coffee chain invading London's
streets. A British chain called Coffee Republic has 40 stores.
Costa Coffee, another local company, has 70 shops. And the
ubiquitous Pret a Manger snack shop sports a hip coffee bar,
serving up cappuccinos along with its packaged sandwiches at 78
London locations.
</P>
<P>
   But while the English have embraced the coffee chains with
enthusiasm, they sniff at some undesirable side effects. ``It's a
bit ugly having chains all over the place,'' said Walsh. Guthrie
says the British quietly wonder, ``Is it something that's here to
stay or will it go away?''
</P>
<P>
   The newfound success of coffee may also reveal a yawning
generation gap, according to Edward Bramah, founder and curator of
London's Tea and Coffee Museum. There was a time when tea-taking
was second nature to all subjects of the queen.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``Fifty percent of university students wouldn't know
what to do with a teapot if you put it in front of them,'' he
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their enthusiasm for coffee, even university
students aren't ready to predict the demise of tea. ``All my
friends drink tea, not coffee,'' said Nathaniel Roberts, 23, of
Liverpool. For convenience, they may well go to the coffee shop to
do it, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just nip in and get one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee stores offer a selection of teas to placate the likes
of Roberts, but they still make their money off frothier _ and
costlier _ coffee drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do offer a large range of tea beverages but our tea sales
only make up around 5 percent of sales,'' said Graham Norton, a
Coffee Republic sales analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture supports Norton's data. Tea consumption by the
British has gradually declined over the past two decades according
to the Tea Council of London. Still, the council's most recent
national survey, in 1997, revealed the English consumed an average
of 3.39 cups of tea each day, and only 1.65 cups of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tea industry should look forward to tea's continued
domination of the total drinks market,'' the Tea Council boasts,
perhaps somewhat hopefully, on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Britain continues to import more tea than coffee. And many
believe that the UK need only withstand the American invasion
today, because the pendulum will swing back tomorrow with world
domination by tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Seattle in 50 years,'' Bramah deadpanned, ``they'll be
drinking tea.''  &QL;
</P>

FINDING THE LATEST FITNESS CRAZE IS A REAL WORKOUT

<P>
   NEW YORK  &UR; _ &LR;  David Rosenbaum, a dancer and aerobics teacher in
Manhattan for more than 20 years, said he grew tired of coming home
from the gym with aching, tense muscles from high impact exercise.
Without intending to put together a class, he started to create
exercises to heal his body, starting with static stretching then
progressing to rib and hip isolations. Then he approached the
fitness director about adding his creation to the aerobics
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd figured something out,'' he said. ``And I wanted
to share this with my students.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: ``hot stretch,'' a flexibility and movement class
that combines modern dance, yoga and ballet to create a ``sensual,
erotic'' workout. Rosenbaum now teaches the class at all of the
Manhattan Equinox health clubs, and the concept has spread to other
gyms as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness crazes such as these come and go, and it's up to
aerobics directors to decide which ones to offer. National
conventions, home fitness videos and infomercials hawk the latest
fitness crazes, and pop culture contributes music and style
direction. Often, aerobics directors look to their clients, who
know what competing gyms are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each gym has its own personality,'' said Johnny Hunt, a
fitness instructor at Bulldog Gym of Hollywood, a Los Angeles gym
known for its nightly DJs who spin pumping techno and hip-hop
music. ``You have to choose workouts for your particular type of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said Bulldog changes the aerobics schedule about every six
weeks to allow new classes to be added. Classes, most of which have
30-50 students, are dropped from the schedule when attendance fails
to reach half the capacity. That happened with onetime crazes such
as double-step and slide classes.
</P>
<P>
   Most new workouts start in either Los Angeles or New York, and
every workout must be tailored to the specific gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher of the new workout has to convince the owner that
people are interested,'' said Hunt, who has blended kick boxing
with exercises from several other types of martial arts to create
his own workout at Bulldog. ``The facility has to be geared to it,
and there has to be that type of people in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Krauss, group fitness manager at Equinox &UR; ,  &LR; said there is
also a list of fitness criteria that must be met. She often
auditions new instructors one-on-one, or goes to another gym to
watch them teach. She sometimes offers a one-time class with the
instructor, to see if the people at Equinox like the workout style.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, it needs to be safe,'' she said. ``And it
needs to have an actual purpose. We're looking to find a special
gain,'' like cardiovascular enhancement, muscle strength, or
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want to be entertained and need to feel they've
accomplished something,'' said Krauss, who oversaw the addition of
Pilates classes, a workout for flexibility and postural alignment.
``They want to look better and feel better, and the workout needs
to answer all those little prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayers of the instructors, too. ``Instructors work hard to
develop something that's their own,'' said Krauss. . ``People like
to stand out.'' Many instructors seek to market their workouts on
home video, but first he or she must sell a concept to a gym and
develop a local following.
</P>
<P>
   Once a new workout is sold, Hunt said, teachers often pass out
flyers to advertise their class and create posters for the gym's
bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instructors have to sell themselves,'' Hunt said. ``It's like
they're running their own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum, the instructor at Equinox, often does TV and magazine
interviews, as well as fitness fashion shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to get the word out,'' he said. ``New instructors
often come up with a clever name for their class or trademark their
workout. Anything to create some hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Although instructors often come to the gyms to widen their
workout audience, fitness directors must actively seek out trends
to make sure they've got the latest craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our trends follow music and fashion,'' Krauss said. ``Latin is
huge right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Equinox is trying out a salsa class that will teach moves that
students can use at clubs that play music by Latin sensations Ricky
Martin and Enrique Inglesias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always reading magazines or watching TV to see what's
going on in the real world,'' said Donna Cyrus, national group
fitness director for Crunch, which has gyms in Manhattan, L.A. and
Miami. ``I watch to see where trends seem to be going.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus said she stays tuned to pop culture to cater to Crunch's
young, urban crowd. She has drag queens teach aerobics, for
example, and she recently added karaoke machines to some of the
spinning classes. She also attends national aerobics conventions,
which bring acclaimed aerobics instructors to teach the latest
fitness trends. Most conventions survey gym owners and aerobics
teachers, then offer seminars based on the most popular trends in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attend conventions to see what everyone else is
doing,'' said David Gilroy, director of communications for IDEA, a
membership fitness organization that will run a convention in
Anaheim in August. ``Then they take the exercises and adapt it to
their gyms. Then things start to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We follow the beat of the city,'' Hunt said. ``That much
research doesn't need to be done. It's not like we're looking for a
new way to purify water.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stepping up to the microphone stand, under the glare
of the spotlight, budding comic Buz Whalen opens up a vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first wife really put an exclamation point at the end of
our marriage,'' Whalen tells the small crowd. ``She stabbed me in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience pauses, wondering what to do. Then Whalen giggles
in a way that says, it's OK: you can laugh at this, too. He doesn't
tell them that it really happened.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen works out his new material in a virtual nightclub, a
cozy, dark rehearsal stage at Raw Space on 42nd Street in
Manhattan, where he's a student at the Comic Studio. The new series
of classes, taught by comic veteran Tommy Koenig, 46, allows
students from a variety of professions to develop and hone their
acts, and learn what it takes to succeed in the competitive world
of stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first wife really did stab me in the back,'' Whalen says
off stage. ``I went to the hospital and almost died. But it's not a
sensitive point with me anymore. I never brought it up in classes
before, so one night I just decided to use it. Now I think I'll be
using it quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whalen did not press charges in the stabbing incident, and the
case was ruled an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Along with six others on a Thursday night, Whalen demonstrates,
quite literally, that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And
funnier. Whalen, a video store owner from New Jersey, started
developing his material at night classes as a psychology professor
at Rutgers and Kean universities. Dressed in black, with white hair
flowing to his shoulders, the round-faced Whalen looks like a
taller version of diminutive actor Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   At the Comics Studio, students dig deep to mine for material.
Kind of like psychoanalysis with punchlines. While some members of
the psychoanalytic community sense potential harm in this
technique, they also say its benefits can be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up comedy is a form of therapy for comics to get up and
talk about themselves,'' says Koenig, a thin, curly-haired comedian
whose expressions shift from intensity to wide-eyed goofiness. ``I
have a joke in my act: `I'm going to tell you people because I
can't afford therapy.''' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Koenig, whose own stand-up career spans from opening for Jerry
Seinfeld in the early 1980s to packing houses at Caroline's comedy
club in New York, charges $349 for his six weekly workshop classes.
He breaks them up into three experience levels: from unpolished to
slick and ready to get paid. He launched the Comics Studio in March
after years of private coaching, and currently works with 35
students, some of whom will display their talent at clubs like
Stand-Up New York and the Comedy Cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I create a safe environment,'' Koenig says. ``This is a place
where you will be nurtured and loved and allowed to open up
yourself, and not get put down or criticized. And people take to it
in a therapy kind of way. I want them to express themselves. From
there, we can turn that into comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first few weeks, students share their life stories.
Some, like Whalen, delve into marriages gone sour. Others explore
the experience of coming out of the closet or difficulties in
meeting the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   When actress Karen Sklaire told her story, instead of funny, she
was fretful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started talking about how I wasn't going to make it, how I
need a job,'' recalls Sklaire, who now works at a gym. ``The next
thing I know I'm practically in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Sklaire, who takes the class to help her television career, sees
the temptation of confusing professional training with therapy.
``You have to be careful and remember that it's still a
classroom,'' she says. ``I know this from years of acting class. A
lot of people will use a class to unload their problems. Tommy's
very responsible about that. He sort of takes the rope and pulls it
on in.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenig says he is careful with new comics who open up closed
chapters of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not abandon them,'' Koenig emphasizes. ``But I have to
learn how to establish boundaries, just as a psychiatrist would.
Except I don't give them a 45-minute hour. I actually give more.''
</P>
<P>
   While stand-up comedy is a nerve-wracking pursuit, creating
one's stage persona can be therapeutic, says Stephen Rosenfield,
director of the American Comedy Institute, which offers training to
comics in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know your life and experiences are part of your
comedy, it can be reassuring in a way,'' he says. ``You're able to
use your sense of humor in a really productive way, if you're
comfortable about talking about your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Sterling, a New York psychologist, shares Rosenfield's
belief, but warns that one can take a joke too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface it sounds like a very fine opportunity, and a
way to turn painful aspects of one's life into shared stories,''
Sterling says of stand-up comedy classes. ``But it's important for
the teacher to know when to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Manhattan-based Actors, Writers, and Performers
Psychotherapy Center, Dr. Eric Riss works with a number of stand-up
comedians. ``They come to us because they can only go so far,'' the
psychologist explains. ``They might talk about their life in their
comedy, but not actually deal with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Riss says that comics hold onto the myth that their anxiety
makes them better comics. ``They're mistaken,'' he says. ``They can
actually perform better when they overcome their anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   In using the truth in their acts, Koenig says, comics display
unique bravery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we become comics is that we feel so
deeply,'' he says. ``They say that one of the reasons why people
sing is because their feelings are so deep, they couldn't possibly
be expressed in words. Some thoughts are so painful that the comic
has to turn everything into humor to make it easier to swallow.''

NEW YORK SMOKERS RILED BY NEW TAX

<P>
   NEW YORK  &UR; _ &LR;  When Sheilam Brooks, 46, an unemployed smoker who
lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, received her Social
Security check in early March, she went to the local grocery store
to indulge in a pack of cigarettes. Handing the clerk a $5 bill,
she waited for her cigarettes and her change. But this time she got
just the cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was ripping me off,'' she says, sitting on a
wooden bench in front of a donut shop where she begs for money.
``He explained to me that the price went up because of a new tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New York State nearly doubled its sales tax _ adding
55 cents to each pack _ making its $1.11 tax the highest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The tax is expected to raise about $400 million per year, $150
million more than in previous years, and allow financing of a
program to provide health insurance coverage to more than a million
uninsured state residents.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the tax is unfair, because with higher smoking
rates, the poor are getting hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeff Schaler, psychologist and professor of justice, law and
society at American University, and author of ``Addiction is a
Choice,'' says poor people smoke in higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is likely more stressful and smoking is an easier and
cheaper way to reduce their anxiety and depression, which is more
due to their environment and mindset than a physiological
addiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealthier people can afford better health insurance policies,
which cover either psychotherapy, anxiety-reducing drugs or
anti-depressive medications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Hansen, a spokesman for state Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno (R-Brunswick), who is a proponent of the plan, said
the tax itself lends toward smoking cessation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax is also intended to deter young people from taking up
smoking,'' he said, under the premise that teen-agers have less
money to splurge on cigarettes. ``Primarily, if we can convince the
young not to start smoking, then that'll be a big help,'' toward
reducing cancer rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the smoking rate among adults is almost half of what
it was in 1964, the rate for teen-agers has been growing steadily
since 1990, despite a national trend of higher taxes on cigarettes.
According to the commission for a Healthy New York, at least
one-third of teen-agers in the United States smoke.
</P>
<P>
   As for the charge that the tax is unfairly affecting low-income
residents who smoke, Hansen says, ``There are high incidents of
cancer among them as well,'' and that they'll ultimately benefit
from quitting.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase was hailed by Gov. George Pataki as both a
social and public health initiative, discouraging residents from
smoking and providing some with health care. But others see the tax
as an opportunity for the government to make money at the expense
of the poor, while only marginally affecting smoking rates.
</P>
<P>
   The tariff is not intended to directly pay for treating
illnesses related to smoking. Instead, the new program is aimed at
helping the approximately one million state residents who are not
poor enough to qualify for Medicaid and those whose employers don't
offer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Another $37 million will go toward tobacco prevention programs,
up from $8.2 million in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   New York State is already relying on tax dollars from
cigarettes, an amount built into the state budget, said Jeff Stier,
spokesman for the American Council on Science and Health, a public
health organization. The organization believes taxing cigarettes
misses the point of educating the public about the dangers of
smoking, and is largely ineffective toward reducing the purchase of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that the money is not going toward educating
the public'' about the harm smoking can cause, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the money allocated toward tobacco prevention programs, more
than half will go toward community programs designed to encourage
adults to quit, and almost a half will go toward school programs to
discourage teen-agers from starting.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that politicians in the United States have spent $246
billion in the last year on public health initiatives, including
smoking cessation, but that this really masks their true intentions
of funding ``pet projects,'' like schools and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has become a beneficiary of the sale of cigarettes,
and the government has become just as addicted as the smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the recent tax increase on cigarettes is a ``regressive
tax,'' that won't make poor people stop smoking, but instead make
their addiction more painful as they fork over more and more of
their small income to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey of 695 randomly selected adults in central Harlem
found that 61 percent of people without working telephones smoke,
while the national average for adults is 25 percent, according to
the Commission for a Healthy New York, an anti-smoking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicotine is a highly addictive drug,'' Stier says. ``If people
are addicted to it, they'll find a way to get their fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvillo Johnson, a 58-year-old homeless man, is doing just
that. He says he can buy cigarettes for as little as $2 a pack in a
booming black market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are doing it. They're driving out of state, and
selling 'em here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ryan, a spokesman for the cigarette manufacturer Philip
Morris, acknowledges that the sale of ``taxed'' cigarettes in New
York State has declined, but says there are many other transactions
that cannot be gauged. He cites low-tax cigarettes imported from
other states, and those sold on Indian reservations, where there is
no tax.
</P>
<P>
   Of the idea of using cigarette money to provide for health
insurance, he says, ``It's very risky to tax a small minority of
the population to pay for something as important as health care.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says the tax places an unfair burden on the poor. He
cites a 1996 study conducted by the Citizens for Tax Justice that
found that the poorest 20 percent of American families pay 16.7
times more of their income on ``pleasure'' taxes than the richest
one percent of families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax burden is equal and consequently accounts for a higher
percentage of a poorer family's income,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, the unemployed women, has cut back on her generosity.
Now, when a passing stranger sometimes asks her for a cigarette,
she pretends she doesn't have any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I used to just hand them out to anyone,''
she says.

 &HT;    REMOVING ELIAN BY FORCE PRESENTS DAUNTING CHALLENGES TO
AUTHORITIES
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The house where Elian Gonzalez lives is on a two-lane
street in the middle of a modest neighborhood. There's no place
nearby to land a helicopter _ powerlines crisscross the area _ and
while there is an expressway about a mile away, getting to it might
prove a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Should Attorney General Janet Reno decide it's time to send
federal officers to take the 6-year-old Cuban rafter to be reunited
with his father, it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of protesters may jam the neighborhood, with many
locking arms in front of the house or sitting down in the street,
waiting to be arrested and dragged away. Others may offer more
active resistance, although Cuban exile leaders have pleaded with
the crowds to remain nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   A caravan of huge dump trucks may appear, drivers intent on
blocking access to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews from around the world have cameras trained on
the front door, and news helicopters would likely appear within
seconds, hovering overhead and broadcasting everything on live
television.
</P>
<P>
   Reno spent Friday meeting with top Justice Department officials
_ and briefly with the boy's father _ saying she still hopes for a
peaceful resolution to the long-running standoff. A spokeswoman
said late Friday that Reno had been working with unnamed
intermediaries in Miami on a possible agreement to transfer custody
of the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But her deputies have been preparing plans for an enforcement
action, and the pressure has grown for Reno to move.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges she faces are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exiles don't want the boy to go, and he's living
in the middle of their turf. It's a cramped, urban neighborhood
with narrow streets. Most houses are surrounded by fences. There's
no open space, no secret way in or out.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuban activists have trained for years in the nearby
Everglades, waiting for the day when they might mount an invasion
to win back their island. While no one believes they would use arms
to keep Elian in Little Havana, some are bent on a determined
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   There are unconfirmed reports that sentinels for the protestors
are posted with hand-held radios on all the streets around the
house, relaying word of any moves by law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   And communications in Cuban Miami are instantaneous. The city's
ubiquitous Spanish-language radio stations crackle with every new
development. People in the crowd carry transistor radios, and
radios blare all day in Little Havana's shops, businesses and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of attempts to take the boy during the past weeks have
prompted the crowds near the house to swell quickly. They have even
grown after unmarked helicopters hovered over the area. Twice,
lines of giant dump trucks have jammed the neighborhood, horns
blaring, drivers waving Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   Most people say they will put up no active resistance, but warn
they can't be sure about others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be here around the clock,'' said Frankie Perez,
23, a salesman who took off work to be at the house Friday. ``I
really don't know what to expect if they come for Elian. I don't
think it will be as bad as the media says, but the Cuban people are
passionate. They get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds outside the house wax and wan, from a few dozen in
the middle of the night and early morning to hundreds in the
evenings after work. On weekends, hundreds come to the house to
sing, chant, pray or just mill around. Vendors sell cold drinks,
hot dogs and ice cream from carts stationed on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters include old men and women, sharply dressed
businessmen with cell phones, parents with toddlers and babies in
strollers and teenagers wearing earrings and rock-band T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, some in the crowd seemed resigned to losing the
boy, but a favorable court ruling and the Miami family's successful
defiance of a deadline set by Reno have spurred a new sense of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and Reno have made people more determined,'' said
Michele Reyes, 24, who has come to the house for weeks. ``I think
they've miscalculated Cubans.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have erected barricades at either end of the block of
Northwest Second Street where Elian lives, with more barricades on
other nearby streets. The media are allowed in at one end of the
street, and they have erected a permanent camp under tents across
the street from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are allowed in at the other end of the street, and
gather at a barricade that cuts across the street about 50 feet
from the house. The barricade is attached to fences in yards on
either side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Once previously protesters overturned the barricade and rushed
the house when a rumor surfaced that the boy was about to be taken,
but police have since reinforced the metal fence.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago when Reno issued a deadline for the Miami relatives
to turn Elian over, police expanded their perimeter. Officers
closed portions of two nearby arteries, Flagler St. and NW 22nd
Ave.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of protesters still poured into the area on foot,
and presumably would again, alerted by Spanish language radio.
</P>
<P>
   The protests that day were peaceful, and tensions evaporated
after a surprise court ruling negated Reno's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But protests in January triggered by Reno's initial decision to
send Elian back to his father boiled over into scuffles with
police, with more than 100 people arrested. Demonstrators blocked
the entrance to Miami's bustling seaport and tied up traffic with
slow-moving caravans on several major roads.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, any plan to take Elian will be fraught with
imponderables.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have been understandably vague about
specifics, but reportedly would send plain-clothes immigration
officers and federal marshals to the house. They would rely on
local police to keep public order.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago questions arose about just how helpful local
police would be. Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas angrily vowed
police would do nothing to help take the boy out of the home. He
backtracked after critics said he came close to inviting a
disturbance, and has since called for calm.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Miami Police Lt. Bill Schwartz said police will
maintain order, but he hoped there would be no confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crowd is decent, law-abiding citizens,'' he said. ``They
are our brothers and sisters. My fear is that if the mob mentality
comes out, people could get hurt. There are people in the crowd who
might want to incite things. We'd rather have cooler heads
prevail.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When dancers come to Julie Ludwick's class, the first
thing she does is instruct them to go to the playground and hang
upside down on the monkey bars. They should stay there for at least
30 minutes, she says.
</P>
<P>
   After a few visits, the dancers are ready for Ludwick's intense
two-hour classes _ in trapeze dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to hold on,'' said Ludwick, who teaches at
Soundance Studio in Manhattan and heads a trapeze dance company,
Fly-By-Night Dance Theater. ``You may be strong at lifting weights,
but maybe you can't hang upside down because you don't have the
grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Trapeze dance, a form of what is known as aerial dance, attracts
both professional dancers and everyday fitness buffs. But, despite
the image its name conjures, trapeze dance bears little resemblance
to circus performing.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent class, Ludwick led six students through a graceful
series of exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers experimented with twirling on trapezes that hung from
three to five feet above the ground. They swung sitting on the
bars, dangled by their arms, dropped to the ground in somersaults
and hooked their elbows around the ropes to spin. They pulled their
bodies over the bar and slid slowly down. They threw the bar to
dodge the trapeze as it swayed back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistically, it's about finding the utmost control,'' Ludwick
said. ``But at times you have to allow the trapeze to take you.
It's your partner with its own momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who make the movements look smooth can put their talent to
work performing for audiences. Ludwick's dance theater troupe drew
packed crowds for six shows in March at a small theater on
Manhattan's Lower East Side. And other aerial dance companies are
springing up across the country as traditional dance companies
incorporate aerial elements into their programs.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were only about 12 professional aerial dance
companies, according to Nancy Smith of Frequent Flyer Productions
in Boulder, Colo. That number has more than doubled, with new
companies as far away as Europe, Australia and South America. Some
dancers have enlarged the genre by use of hanging strips of fabric
or swinging hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next step in dance,'' said Terry Sendgraff, of
Oakland, Calif., who is credited with inventing low-flying trapeze
dance in Colorado in &UR;  &LR; the early 1970s. ``I think it is the
avant-garde form. If you want to be a dancer these days, you had
better learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although trapeze dance was well accepted in Colorado, it has
taken years for the genre to gain wider acceptance as a legitimate
dance form. Sendgraff said that when she moved to California, she
had to persuade skeptics that it was not a circus act with
performers flinging their bodies 30 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics said it wasn't dance, and someone else called it
therapy,'' said the 67-year-old Sendgraff.
</P>
<P>
   While circus trapezes are supported by two parallel ropes
attached to the ceiling, the dance trapezes have two ropes attached
to the ceiling in a triangular fashion. Trapeze dancers also keep
low to the ground and don't leap between swings like circus
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of trapeze dancing is the weightless
sensation, dancers say. There are also psychological benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you dance the salsa, you are not afraid for your life,''
said Smith. ``Here, you have to overcome fear of something terrible
happening. As you gain trust in your own body and other people, you
do something you didn't think you could do. It's a different kind
of thing than any other dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwick's students also talked about their enhanced strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am challenging my arm muscles,'' said Cassandra
Marshall, who was a dance major in college. ``I feel ripped, and I
never felt that way before.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Ludwick's dance theater say their rock-hard legs and
muscularly defined arms were built by trapeze practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to do it you have to make it look easy,'' said
Despina Stamos, a member of Fly-By-Night. ``It's hard to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, dancers say this is an accessible art form that
anyone can pick up. Stamos started performing with Ludwick after
only six months of class. And strength should not be a barrier
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who are lovely on the trapeze who can't do a
pull-up,'' because trapeze requires different muscle use, said
Cathy Gauch, of Aircat Aerial Arts, which is now performing in
Gaum.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers who have been using the trapeze for years say they are
not surprised it has taken off in popularity. Pop star Ricky Martin
has an aerial dancer on stage during his concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping it's not a fad but something beautiful that catches
on,'' said Maria Carrillo, director of the Flying Trapeze
Association of Roseville, Calif. ``I want people to take hold of
this, not as a cheesy circus act, but as a beautiful art.''  &QL;

<P>
   To get prison inmates to fill out their census forms, Minnesota
corrections officials are paying them each a dollar, in what is the
first effort of its kind in any state prison system.
</P>
<P>
   One dollar may not seem like much, but Minnesota's 5,900 inmates
earn an average of a quarter an hour for chores. In hopes of
getting everyone to comply, officials plan to shut down the state's
eight prisons for one day in the middle of April. Prisoners will
remain in their cells while corrections officers help them
individually fill out the form.
</P>
<P>
   Though all adults living in the United States are supposed to
fill out census forms, including the 1.4 million men and women
behind bars, the law requiring them to do so is rarely enforced.
But Shari Burt, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of
Corrections, said prisoners will not be forced to complete the
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where officers can tell prisoners when to sleep, when
to get up and when to eat, it may seem curious that officers do not
fill out the forms themselves, as if they were heads of households.
</P>
<P>
   But Burt said that prisoners are more likely to cooperate and
provide accurate answers if they do not feel coerced.
</P>
<P>
   Though the corrections system has personal information on
inmates, she said, it is not always comprehensive. For example,
Burt said, ``the warden doesn't know which tribe an American Indian
came from. We just don't keep those kinds of records.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee that they'll be any more honest than anyone
else,'' she said. ``But we don't believe in using force to fill out
a form and this is just a simple way to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the state's lawmakers, State Representative Phil
Krinkie, called the plan ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it our institution has to lead the way in bribing
inmates for their census forms?'' he said. ``These people are not
homeless _ those are the ones who could really use it. These people
are incarcerated.'' The money is coming from surcharges on phone
calls and items at the canteen.
</P>
<P>
   Krinkie said he understands why the Department of Corrections
would resort to paying inmates to fill out the forms. Census counts
help determine federal funding for everything from schools to parks
to prisons. And Minnesota, he said, always seems to pay out more
federal money than it gets it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are always the net loser when it comes to funding, of
course they'll do anything they can for more money,'' Krinkie said.
``But this is bribery. We have to be the only state to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. Texas, which has the second highest number of prisoners
in the country, simply gives its 149,500 inmates the census forms
to fill out. Department of Criminal Justice officials there said
that if a prisoner does not speak English or is illiterate, a
census official or an officer trained by the Census Bureau will
assist him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at New York's Department of Corrections in Albany said
they use a similar system. With 71,730 prisoners, the state has the
second-highest inmate population nationwide _ too many inmates for
wardens to fill out their forms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in Florida, which has the country's
fourth-highest inmate population. Correction officials there said
the biggest incentive their 70,100 inmates receive for filling out
a form is a baseball cap with a census slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Census Bureau said that though they had never
heard of another state paying prisoners to fill out census forms,
Minnesota's effort did not surprise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help the state tremendously with federal and special
funding,'' said Bill Wallin, a spokesman for the Census Bureau in
Minneapolis. ``We're interested in accuracy and as long as it's
legal and legitimate, we're all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Krinkie said the payments simply make his state look stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if I don't fill out my form, some census guy comes over
to my house and asks me to do it, or I could get a fine,'' Krinkie
said. ``Give the inmates additional phone time if they're desperate
to get a big head count, but these guys don't deserve cash.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mohesh Kalita is a millionaire, a multimillionaire,
in fact. But this 57-year-old, who recently retired from his post
as a vice president at Citibank, doesn't consider himself rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``One million dollars is not a lot of money,'' he said. ``It's
enough so I don't have to worry about day-to-day things,'' said
Kalita, talking on the phone from his four-bedroom colonial in
Princeton, N.J.. ``But then again I can't afford to buy a townhouse
in Manhattan. Even a big apartment might be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to today's American economy.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet company IPOs creating wealth quicker than you can
say dot-com and the Dow soaring to dizzying new heights, affluence
has trickled down to more and more Americans. But with that wealth
has come a certain nonchalance about what in sparer times was
considered a lot of money. It appears as if having a net worth of
$1 million, the benchmark that once separated the truly rich from
those just doing very, very well, no longer has much cachet.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that a million doesn't command any respect at
all. The ABC game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' after
all, is the most-watched show on television. That said, the
short-lived Fox spinoff ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire''
suggested that a mere million isn't even enough to attract the kind
of woman willing to get hitched on air to a complete stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason $1 million isn't getting the respect it once
did is because in this booming economy, so many people are loaded.
In 1962, only 922,000 American households were worth $1 million or
more, just 2 percent of the total population, according to Edward
Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. Today, Wolff
said, that figure is 4.5 million, or 4.5 percent of the total
population. ``It's probably at an all-time high.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a better sense of the number of millionaires in America
today, think of Ireland, population 3.6 million. Now imagine every
single Irish citizen as a millionaire. Even if that were the case,
Ireland would still need an influx of about a million additional
millionaires to equal the number of millionaires in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of millionaires in the U.S. is at an all-time
high, then so, too, seems to be the ease with which one can become
one. There are, of course, charter members of the Microsoft team
and others similarly blessed by being in the right place at the
right time. But more conventional routes to a million exist.
Financial advisers say that if a 25-year-old earning $30,000
invests 10 percent of that salary a year and realizes a modest
annual return of 6 percent, that person can accumulate about $1.1
million by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   One million, is not, quite literally, what it used to be.
Because of inflation, to equal the buying power of someone with $1
million in 1960, a person today would need $5 million, according to
Wolff, the economics professor.
</P>
<P>
   If statistics don't drive the point home, consider the lifestyle
of the modern-day millionaire. Jennifer Barnum, a 25-year-old
student at Shasta College, a community college in Redding, Calif.,
inherited her money from the family newspaper business. She says
investments yield her a $2,500 pre-tax monthly income, enough to go
to school full time without working, but hardly enough to afford a
yacht or any of the other trappings of wealth commonly associated
with millionairedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive a 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback Station Wagon that I paid
$21,500 for,'' she said, ``and a good half of my clothes are either
hand-me-downs from my sisters or left over from high school.''
Barnum added that although she considers herself fortunate, ``I
would like to have more money. There are lots of people with more
money than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnum's attitude is typical, according to David Krueger, a
Houston psychiatrist who is the author of numerous books on the
psychology of money. Krueger said that with news reports and
cocktail party discussions turning more and more to the subject of
money, it's easy even for the relatively affluent to feel insecure.
``Freud,'' Krueger said, ``said that money was the last taboo.
Well, money in our current society is much more open and talked
about. The last taboo has come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Barbanel, a psychotherapist in New York who has also
written about the psychology of money, agreed. But Barbanel said
the reason people aren't happy with $1 million isn't purely
psychological. Referring to New York, she said, ``In this city,
that's just not enough to take advantage of the shows, the
restaurants, the location where you live, the vacations, the
taxis.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is enough money to command the respect that $1 million
once did? Wolff, the economics professor, said $5 million would be
sufficient to ``make heads turn.'' After calculating that there are
currently many American households (670,000) worth that amount or
more, he adjusted the number upward. ``Probably to be rich today,
you need $10 million or more.'' he said. ``There are only 230,000
households worth that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kalita, the former Citibank vice president, said he's
content with the approximately $3.5 million he's acquired since
emigrating from India in 1971 with no more than an undergraduate
education and $400 in his pocket. ``I came from a poor country,''
said Kalita. ``What I have right now is good enough for me.''

BLIND ATHLETES FIND FUN AND CHALLENGE ON GOALBALL COURT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patty Ashbury, wearing a blindfold and pads on her
knees and hips, stands by a wall and waits for her husband, Andre,
to throw a two-pound rubber ball towards her. As the bell inside
the rolling ball signals its position, she lunges to the ground.
The ball hits her chest. Success! Patty has blocked the ball from
hitting the wall and prevented her opponent from making a score.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashburys are playing goalball, a soccer-like game specially
developed for blind or visually impaired people. The Ashburys,
considered legally blind, have been ardent players of goalball for
over 10 years. ``It's a bloody game but we're addicted to it,''
said Patty, 38, a special education teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Goalball is popular among blind athletes because it is the only
team sport available to them. ``It allows the blind to compete
without visual limitations,'' said Andre, 35, a student in computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Eason, 33, a member of the New York Association of Blind
Athletes' goalball team, said: ``It's physical, it's challenging,
you've got to have skills to play. I love it when I hear the ball
hit people's faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalball players compete year-round and meet for regional,
national and international competitions. Seven regional teams,
encompassing men's and women's divisions, belong to the United
States Association of Blind Athletes. Patty Ashbury and Eason are
part of the American women's team, which is ranked third out of 14
teams that competes in international tournaments. They will head to
Sydney, Australia, this October to compete in the international
Paralympic. ``We've got a good chance of winning the gold medal,''
Patty said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Ashburys regularly practice with eight other
athletes in a high school gym. The three-person teams play on
hardwood floors the size of a volleyball court, with string
defining the boundaries. Blindfolds on the eyes of every player
ensure that even those with limited vision cannot see. One person
has eight seconds to toss the ball, hoping to roll it past the
opposition to the goal. The opposition can block it and throw it
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine playing soccer with hands, completely in the dark,''
Andre explained.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one can see the ball, players must use their sense of
hearing and intuition. So the game requires silence for players to
``listen'' to the direction of the ball. As a result, the coach and
the spectators cannot speak or cheer during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange to play a game to a quiet crowd,'' Patty added.
``But it's incredibly rewarding when you score the final goal and
hear people holler from the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Brown, 19, was first introduced to the sport when he was
studying at the New York Institute for Special Education. ``It's a
stress releaser,'' he said. ``I like the competitive nature of the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dan Parisi, the team's coach, goalball teams
receives little public or private funding, though the New York
association gets some money from fundraising efforts and private
donations. The members of Local 1104 of the Communications Workers
of America, of which Parisi is vice president, donates some money.
``The donation is helpful, but they're not enough to cover all
expenses,'' said Parisi, 54, who volunteers his time to coach and
drive the team to tournaments. ``But the athletes make do with what
they have and they haven't missed a tournament yet.'' The team
members pay for their own uniforms and travel expenses when they
have to.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi, who has his sight but became involved after seeing a
goalball tournament in 1984, said that the lack of support,
particularly from large corporations, prevents many blind athletes
from competing. ``A lot of big companies would rather fund an
able-bodied athlete so that they could put that person in front of
a Wheaties box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop people like Dawn Davids, who is 37. ``Goalball
is so fun that we pay to play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the monetary hurdles, the athletes say they manage to
travel and play in every regional or national competition. ``We
work too hard to miss any games,'' said Eason.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they enjoy developing relationships with
teammates and opponents on the court, forming a national network of
goalball players. Patty and Andre met in a Paralympic event 12
years ago and have been married for the past six years. They are
close with the coterie of blind athletes all over the nation,
thanks to the year-round competitions. ``You see these people more
often than your family members in a year,'' Patty says with a
laugh. They also exchange correspondence through e-mail and meet in
Internet chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the court, everyone is the same,'' Davids said. ``Goalball
is predictable, you know what to do with the ball. In the real
world, there are barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Parisi added: ``The sanctuary is within the court.''

<P>
   KUSONJE, CROATIA _ A small tree grows from the shattered roof of
the Serbian Orthodox Church in this eerily tranquil village. Bombed
houses settle into the mud, and elderly caretakers tread cautiously
among the graves of a dilapidated cemetery. Neither the dead nor
anyone else finds peace in Kusonje where hidden land mines are a
constant menace.
</P>
<P>
   Some four miles down the road, another Orthodox cemetery, in
Pakrac, holds the same dangers, its centuries-old gravestones
standing sentry over a terror that makes homage to the deceased a
deadly risk.
</P>
<P>
   The two cemeteries laden with land mines are ominous reminders
of the four-year &UR;  &LR; war that virtually destroyed this rural area of
eastern Croatia and left villagers fearing for the lives of
children at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is constant fear they will go to a minefield,'' said
Obrad Ivanovic, who heads a local nonprofit group providing
services to ethnic Serbs. ``We feel trapped as if we were captured
and put in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a New York church group is determined to erase the
danger of those church sites. The Hudson Valley Presbytery,
consisting of 95 Presbyterian churches in seven New York counties,
this year raised $27,600 to remove the mines in Pakrac and Kusonje.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could deal with an overwhelming problem and feel like we
were actually doing something,'' said Jennifer Watts, the volunteer
who organized the Presbytery's fundraising. Thirty-four of the
Presbytery's 95 churches contributed money, working through the
``Adopt-a-Minefield'' program of the nonprofit United Nations
Association-USA. It matches donors with minefields in Croatia,
Bosnia, Afghanistan, Mozambique and Cambodia _ a few of the 70
countries worldwide where 26,000 people lose their lives to mines
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching the program last March, UNA-USA has managed to
have 50 minefields ``adopted'' at costs ranging from $20,000 to
$40,000 each, according Oren Schlein, the New York-based director.
The United Nations Development Program coordinates the mine
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Huguenot Memorial Church in Pelham Manor, N.Y., Sunday
school teachers showed a UNA-USA video of children whose legs were
blown off in a mine blast.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Virginia Lunt said she fled the room in horror when
the video showed mine-clearing equipment exploding the mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think where or who we help matters,'' she said. ``We
are all created by God and God's children should help each other.''
The Sunday school students raised $357 for the cause with a bake
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one young father at the bake sale say, `We have to buy
something. This is important. This is significant,''' said Jean
Tischler, the church's director of Christian education. ``Another
parent told me that because of the video her children realized the
real impact violence has on families and individual lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At other churches, parishioners took up special collections or
donated money from parish funds. The youth group at the Hitchcock
Presbyterian Church in Scarsdale sought sponsors by cleaning a
local park.
</P>
<P>
   All of the funds are designated to pay professional companies to
``de-mine'' roughly 42,600 square feet in Pakrac and Kusonje, where
Croat and Serb forces battled between 1991 and 1995, according to
Per Kvarsnik, the regional adviser to the UN Mine Action Center in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The professionals use metal detectors, explosive-sniffing dogs
and spades, knives and scissors. They poke the ground at one-inch
intervals with metal rods to detect mines that range in size from
that of a hockey puck to cylinders the size of car tires. Officials
said the Pakrac and Kusonje sites could be cleared within weeks
once the contractor was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside those sites, an estimated 12,000 mines remain around
Pakrac, a fraction of the 400,000 mines laid in Croatia during the
war. Military maps of the mines around Kusonje have been lost so no
one really knows the extent of hidden danger there, said Kvarsnik.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the Pakrac and Kusonje sites may encourage the return
of Serbian villagers, more than 80 percent of whom fled the war in
1995, said Schlein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a little contribution to a larger effort in which
people return and reclaim their lives,'' he said, noting that many
returning Serbs have no place to live or work.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, who worries still about land mines hidden beyond the
church sites being cleared, said he would like a chance to thank
the New York churches for helping.
</P>
<P>
   But few other local people seem to know about their American
benefactors. In Kusonje, four elderly returnees sit in the one
heated room of a brick house and drink thick Turkish coffee. They
don't care who clears the mines. They just want to live without
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never find a man brave enough to say he is not afraid
of mines,'' said Marinko Radojcic, 60, a sturdy, round ex-factory
worker wearing a thick sweater and a black Nike hat. ``But with no
church or graveyard, the culture of our nation would be lost. There
would be no history of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Jacqui Buchanan at Huguenot Sunday school in New
York, sees it in terms a little less global. ``It doesn't matter
how big or small the place is _ just that there is one more safe
place and one less family in danger.''  &QL;

coffee stores. In fact, there are more Starbucks stores in London
than in Seattle. And the British are drinking it up. By Rebecca
Webber. (750 words.)

   CNS-FITNESS-CRAZES (New York) _ First came aerobics, then step,
then spinning, and now Pilates and kick-boxing. But every fitness
trend must start somewhere, and every gym must decide what to offer
and what to dump. It's a workout for the fitness directors who have
to decide. By Abby Tegnelia. (950 words.)

   CNS-COMEDY-CLASSES (New York) _ When comedians step up to the
microphone, they reveal much about themselves. Would-be comics have
to learn not just timing, but how to plumb their inner souls for
material, and how to develop it into laughs. By William Siss. (1000
words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-NY-SMOKING-TAX (New York) _ When New York nearly doubled its
cigarette tax to $1.11 a pack, its intended purpose was twofold:
discourage people from smoking and take the extra revenue for
health insurance for those too poor to afford it. But critics say
those same people are the ones hit disproportionately by the tax,
and a few die-hard unemployed smokers say it will take more than a
tax to make them stop. By C.M. Lanzillotti. (1100 words.)

<P>
   CNS-MILLIONAIRE-PAUPERS (New York) _ These days, what with
Internet and stock market windfalls, being a millionaire doesn't
count for much. Even those who have a few million say they're not

lot more than a few million dollars to allow one to feel special.

   CNS-BLIND-GOALBALL (New York) _ The game is a lot like soccer,

</P>
<P>
   CNS-ADOPTING-MINEFIELD (Kusonje, Croatia) _ Not even the
graveyards and churchyards are havens from the legacy of wars.
Minefields are everywhere, in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Mozambique and

there are efforts in the United States to raise money to pay
professionals to clear away the fear. By Nathan Hegedus. (925

EX-PRISON OFFICIAL PONDERS A LEGACY HE DOESN'T WANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ No one told Charles T. Terrell that his name would
adorn death row. He heard whispers, but no one called. Maybe no one
realized he was still alive. After all, many prisons in Texas are
named for a crime fighter or lawmaker gone to his great reward.
Maybe no one thought a man who once ran the prison system would
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Although Charlie Terrell, now 61, has made a bad habit of facing
death, he remains very much above ground. And with the relocation
of death row earlier this year to the Terrell Unit in East Texas,
yes, he does mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cringed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell is sitting in the office of his Dallas insurance
company, where he mailed out an eight-paragraph letter to The
Dallas Morning News in March. He has written more letters to the
editor than he can count, he said, but this one, in response to an
editorial about the death penalty, resonated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been thinking and praying a lot lately about the death
penalty,'' the letter began, ``particularly after the Texas
Criminal Justice Department started moving death row inmates to a
prison with my name on it. This was a decision that did not thrill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, nearly everyone had forgotten about Terrell. State
prison officials had not notified him when they transferred the 454
male death row inmates from the Ellis Unit in Huntsville to the
newer Terrell Unit about 50 miles away. For four years, Terrell was
chairman of the board that ran the state prisons, retiring in 1990
after overseeing sweeping reforms and a huge construction program.
</P>
<P>
   He rejoined his insurance company full time, and the prison
bearing his name opened in 1993, a small piece of posterity.
Instead of a gold watch, he was given a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   But death row is not the monument he envisioned. Executions are
still performed in Huntsville, as required by law, but officials
say they moved death row to the Terrell Unit because it is larger,
more secure and close to Huntsville. Prison officials say it is the
toughest death row in America. It is by far the busiest.
</P>
<P>
   Friends from around the country now call Terrell to tease him
after reading articles about inmates ``on death row at the Terrell
Unit.'' Hah, hah. They probably do not realize he no longer regards
the death penalty with the certitude he once did. ``There are
certain aspects that I think need to be re-examined,'' he says
carefully. ``I have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell admits his thinking is not consistent. He still supports
the death penalty and still considers himself a champion for
victims' rights. But he questions whether lethal injection is truly
a deterrent to crime. He suggests instead the option of life
without the possibility of parole, a sentence not available in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He believes minorities are often treated unfairly by the
criminal justice system, and he says every inmate on death row
should be able to use DNA testing, if doing so could unequivocally
establish their innocence or guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can use DNA to determine whether Thomas Jefferson
fathered racially mixed children over 200 years ago, we should use
such testing to make sure innocent people are not mistakenly put to
death,'' Terrell wrote in his letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   He is wary of injecting himself into death penalty politics,
particularly since he supports the presidential ambitions of his
governor, George W. Bush, a staunch defender of the system. Terrell
also says he understands why the proximity to Huntsville made his
prison an obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   Since his letter was published, one friend on the prison board
has called, and Terrell hopes something will happen.
</P>
<P>
   But every morning he sits in a chair in his bedroom and prays
for friends and family. He counts his blessings, and he asks for
guidance on several questions, including this one: What should he
do about his name being on death row?
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when he was trying to expand his insurance
business into California, Terrell dabbled in screenwriting. His own
life could have provided rich material.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1938, grew up in the West Texas town of San
Angelo and overcame a childhood case of polio to become a star
football player at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He
later won a seat on the Dallas City Council, earned a reputation as
a comer with an interest in race relations and fighting crime. He
spent more than a decade serving on almost every commission and
task force in town.
</P>
<P>
   But he also suffered a bout with lymphoma and three near-fatal
food poisoning attacks from his allergy to nuts. Then, on July 4,
1995, he woke up with double vision. His wife of 41 years, Beverly,
took him to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed a rare
neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   For months, he could not walk or swallow or close his eyes. He
wore special goggles so his corneas would not dry out. His friend
Pettis Norman, a former tight end for the Dallas Cowboys, brought
the Rev. Jesse Jackson to pray over his semi-conscious body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in prison, only you're in your own body,''
Terrell said. ``It was like being in solitary.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he was finally able to regain his health and resume
working, he says he began to see life and death _ and the death
penalty _ differently. Guillain-Barre, he said, showed him how bad
life in prison without parole can be. The death penalty, he says,
is a necessary evil, and he will not crusade against it.
</P>
<P>
   But neither does he want it to be his legacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ Postcards from this desert resort town
often feature a golfer in full swing on a lush course, driving
toward a dramatic mountain range in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two make picturesque partners, federal officials are
weighing how best to secure the future of the pristine mountainous
backdrop as the demands of development and tourism increasingly
encroach on the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has put the mountains on the short list of
areas that he would consider designating as national monuments, a
move that would make them off-limits for any purposes that would
change their character.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility alarms some landowners worried about property
rights and developers concerned that it would have an impact on
projects around the base of the mountains, many of which command
top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to protect local interests as well as the
mountains, Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., has introduced a bill that
would confer monument status through Congress instead.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, now in the subcommittee on national parks and public
lands, tries to address local concerns by assuring, for example,
that no protective perimeters with restrictions on use would be
created around the monument and that management of the monument
would not change as the federal government developed a
comprehensive plan for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very encouraged,'' Molly McUsic, a counselor to
Bruce Babbitt, secretary of the interior, said of the congressional
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope the legislation will be more palatable than a
presidential declaration. Private landowners hold about 55,000
acres within the 272,000 acres in the proposed monument area, and
developers, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and state
and local officials all have stakes to protect. The monument
designation directly applies only to federal lands, about 150,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning at the grass-roots rather than the
administration coming in and saying we know what's right for you,''
said Rusty Payne, a spokesman for Bono. ``Monument is a dirty word
sometimes with Western Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Clinton officially designated 328,000 acres in
California as a national monument to protect sequoias. It was the
fifth time that Clinton had created a monument using the
Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows a president to change the
status of federal lands that have scientific, historical or
architectural significance. He has also expanded an existing
monument.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has now protected more land in the lower 48 states using
the act than any other president. All the designations have been in
the West. But some lawmakers and local people have accused the
president of misusing the act, which they say was intended to set
aside much smaller areas, and they see his actions as heavy-handed
and detrimental to local interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the steepness of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto
Mountains makes them nearly impossible to develop in many areas,
development now reaches right up to the toe in several areas and
extends into the mountains in some places. Pressure to build in the
area is expected to increase as the Coachella Valley, which
includes the desert towns of the region, grows to an estimated
475,000 residents from about 317,000 in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The mountains are used in a variety of ways, including cattle
grazing, sightseeing and recreation. They are also home to
endangered bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Private property owners are said to be evenly divided over the
designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are against the monument or are worried about
it are concerned about intrusion on property rights,'' said Ruth
Watling, who is chairwoman of the Pinyon Community Council, an
advisory group for the property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting it are worried about intrusion from the
increasing number of day-trippers and tourists who visit for
hiking, hunting, horseback riding or off-road vehicle use.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat in the area is quite fragile. Watling noted that it
dated back as far as 12,000 years, when it was tall pines. Now it
is home to shorter pinyons and junipers, which will not regenerate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really rare to see a seedling pine,'' she said. ``Kind of
horrifying and intriguing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the land is already held by state and federal
governments, traditionally there has been little financing for
management and conservation. Bill Havert, executive director of the
Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy, which has pushed for
monument status, said such a designation would not only raise the
mountains' profile, but would help to secure increased federal
financing to buy private land in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ultimately looking for the national monument
designation to protect all lands from development,'' Havert said.
``We're looking for the designation to at least maintain, if not
enhance, Congress' willingness to fund acquisitions from willing
sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   But private landowners and others who have interests at stake
say they do not believe there is any need for the designation.
Instead, they see it as a federal land grab that will result in
access restrictions and loss of property tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have protective measures,'' said Larry Paul,
president of the Mountain Coalition, which represents private
interests opposed to the designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for protecting the environment,'' Paul said, ``but we
have everything to lose, and I don't see anything to gain. All
that's going to happen is the limiting of uses we already enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing such concerns was the purpose of Bono's bill, said
Payne, her spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic development is very important,'' he said, ``but so is
reasonable land management and environmental policy that preserves
and protects. We are running out of land in America and Southern
California, and we are leaving nothing behind for future
generations.''

AFTER PRUNING, A CHANCE TO PICK IN BIOTECHNOLOGY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boom and bust.
</P>
<P>
   After a staggering cycle, the biotechnology sector is back to
just about where it was at the beginning of the year. And some
longtime investors, who could only watch in awe as money poured
into the sector and then rushed out again, now say there are some
buying opportunities. The key is to prune away the most speculative
stocks and concentrate on those with the stronger growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   A review of recent history may be in order. After languishing
for nearly five years, biotechnology stocks took off last August as
a new set of investors piled in. The market warmed earliest to
mature companies like Amgen and Genentech, but the boom was really
prompted by the genomics players, companies that have piggybacked
on the multinational effort to identify all the genes in the human
body. Momentum investors entered the game, and soon most any
company with a gene, a protein or an antibody attached to its name
was bid through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   But then comments by President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain _ who together suggested after a meeting that
genetic discoveries might not be subject to patent protection _
sent the stocks skidding. President Clinton later qualified the
statement, but the damage had been done, and the very buyers who
had sent genomics stocks up tenfold could not sell them fast
enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the Celera Genomics Group announced in January that it had
finished mapping 90 percent of the human genome, its shares
bounced, and so did those of most of its rivals. But then academic
researchers heaped doubt on the company's announcement, and the
shares retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the Nasdaq composite tumbled in the week beginning
April 10, biotechnology stocks, whether in the genomics companies
or long-established concerns with successful drugs, collapsed, too.
The Amex Biotech index lost 25 percent that week. And last week,
while the Nasdaq composite rose 9.7 percent, the biotechnology
index was up just 4.9 percent. It closed at 428.31 on Thursday,
still down 46 percent from its high.
</P>
<P>
   But what has changed? Longtime biotechnology investors _ people
who have been buying these stocks for 15 years or more, say not
much. At the end of the day, biotechnology is all about producing
successful drugs, among the few products on earth that can be sold
at a premium for many years. The industry has produced about 75
successful drugs in its first 20 years; with more than 300 drugs
now in trials, there will be many more in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech has a lot of products in late-stage trials, some of
which will be coming to market very soon,'' said Jim McCamant,
editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter and manager of a
small biotechnology fund for wealthy investors. He notes that more
than 25 percent of the drugs in trials are new cancer therapies,
and that data on several of them will be presented on May 20 at the
American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in New Orleans That
will likely give certain stocks a bounce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant's top picks include Imclone Systems, which expects to
be granted an expedited review of a new drug for head and neck
cancer. ``This is a company with a drug that could be one of the
biggest-selling cancer drugs,'' he said. ``It went from 50 to 172
and back to 60; you couldn't recommend it at 172, but you can
now.'' He rates Imclone a buy under $110, with a 12-month target of
$200. It closed on Thursday at $75.50.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock on his recommended list is Isis Pharmaceuticals.
The company withdrew plans in December to seek approval for a key
drug for Crohn's disease, but will be presenting data on a new
gene-based drug for a form of lung cancer. McCamant says that Isis
is a buy under $20, and that his 12-month target price is $50. The
stock closed at $10.625 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Maxim Pharmaceuticals, which has a histamine-based
drug, Maxamine, that appears to increase the potency of antiviral
and anticancer drugs. He said Maxim is a buy under $55, with a
12-month target of $100. It closed at $47.9375 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks ``got back to basically even for the year,
but I think they will be back to old highs by the end of the
year,'' McCamant said. Viren Mehta, a money manager with Mehta
Partners, advocates a flight to quality, but that does not
necessarily mean buying only mature biotechnology companies,
several of which have obvious problems, he said. Amgen's core
product, Epogen, for anemia, is threatened by Transkaryotic
Therapies' GA-EPO, which delivers the same protein in a different
way. He said Biogen's sales have slowed, Genzyme remains a
confusing conglomerate and Chiron continues to search for new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   One standout among mature biotechnology companies is Genentech;
although Roche is its majority owner, the company trades as a
separate stock. ``Genentech is a stock that everybody has to own if
they invest in mature biotech companies,'' Mehta said. ``They do
more things right than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has two successful new cancer drugs, with several more
in the pipeline, and will soon seek approval for a new asthma
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Mehta is buying more earlier-stage companies,
including Transkaryotic; Cor Therapeutic, with an approved drug for
dissolving blood clots; Emisphere, with an oral form of insulin in
clinical trials; and Maxim. But he balances these with investments
in large-capitalization pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology
companies based in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The key lesson of the price plunge is that biotechnology is,
after all, a place for patient money. ``If you're going to be in
biotech at all, the reality is you have to buy a basket of stocks
and sit on them for a decade,'' said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a
consultant. &QL;

   What's all the fuss?
</P>
<P>
   From the day the Nasdaq composite hit a record high on March 10,
through its trough on April 14, the index lost 34 percent of its
value. Yet over that same period, the average U.S. stock actually
fell by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. By simply using a somewhat different methodology,
it is perfectly reasonable to argue that not only are stocks
avoiding the clutches of a bear market _ traditionally viewed as a
decline of 20 percent or more from a high _ but that they also have
a long way to go before even entering a correction _ usually
defined as a sell-off of 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy arises, in part, because the Nasdaq composite
does not represent the entire market. But more important is the
fact that none of the major stock market indexes reflect the
performance of the average stock. Instead, they are built to give
far greater weight to certain stocks _ those with the biggest
market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   As a capitalization-weighted index, the Nasdaq composite is one
of the worst offenders in this regard. The index weighting of Cisco
Systems, the largest Nasdaq stock with a market cap of $434
billion, is more than a thousand times that of, say, Offshore
Logistics, with a market cap of just $268 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its capitalization-based weightings, the Nasdaq
composite paints a far too rosy picture when the largest-cap Nasdaq
stocks are leading the market, as they have in recent years. In
1999, for example, when Cisco rose about 131 percent, it led the
Nasdaq composite to an 86 percent gain. The average Nasdaq stock,
however, gained less than 10 percent that year.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Nasdaq composite often paints a far too
pessimistic picture when the dominant stocks perform poorly, as was
seen over the past month. Although the index shed a third of its
value, the average Nasdaq stock on April 14 traded at more or less
the same level as it did in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other major stock indexes, like the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, the Russell 2000 and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market,
are also skewed by capitalization weighting. Sure, the Wilshire
5000 is more comprehensive than the Nasdaq composite, in that it
encompasses virtually all publicly traded United States stocks. But
it still gives heavy weighting to large-cap stocks. From March 10
through April, for example, the Wilshire 5000 declined 11 percent.
Though that's not as large as the loss of the Nasdaq composite, it
is still very different from how the average stock has performed.
</P>
<P>
   A number of indexes seek to give equal weight to each of their
component stocks. But these benchmarks pose problems, too, because
no one has figured out how to calculate them without imputing a
bias to the results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in part because of the way price changes are
translated into percentage changes, the Value Line Arithmetic Index
of some 1,700 widely traded stocks has an upward bias _ it rose 0.4
percent at the same time the Nasdaq was plunging 34 percent. Its
sister benchmark, the Value Line Geometric Index, makes use of
logarithms in its calculations, which gives the index a downward
bias. It fell 1.6 percent over the same period. I simply split the
difference to arrive at my estimate of a loss of just 0.6 percent
for the average stock.
</P>
<P>
   Using skewed benchmarks has serious consequences beyond leading
investors to mistake a simple market ``breather'' for a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   The practice also leads investors to draw spurious conclusions
about their fund managers' performance. In recent weeks, after
noting that more fund managers were beating the S&AMP;P 500, some
commentators concluded that those managers were to be applauded for
doing a better job. But all that happened, of course, was that
those managers were jumping over a ridiculously low hurdle instead
of a sky-high one.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is simple: If you are gauging the market, or your
fund manager, by using an index that is prejudiced toward a few
large-cap technology stocks, chances are that you're reaching the
wrong conclusion.

AMERITRADE OFFERS FREE ELECTRONIC TRADING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, the chairman of Ameritrade Holdings Corp. said
the price war among online brokerage companies might eventually
drive trading commissions to less than zero. To undercut
Ameritrade's latest discount, competitors will have to go that low.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ameritrade, the sixth-biggest electronic brokerage
company, quietly introduced a completely electronic trading service
that pledges not to charge any commissions on orders to buy or sell
stocks at market prices. The bare-bones operation, called
freetrade.com, expects to make money from interest on loans to
investors, from payments it receives from other companies for
sending trades their way and from selling advertising space on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is all about freedom and free,'' said J. Joe
Ricketts, Ameritrade's chairman and co-chief executive. ``Some of
our competitors have started to offer certain types of trades free.
This is just a continuing evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express Co. is the only big financial company that is
giving away stock trades. That offer, which was widely mocked by
American Express' competitors, is viewed as a lure to attract
wealthy customers to use the company's other services.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, freetrade.com is the anti-Ameritrade. Like its
rival, ETrade Group, Ameritrade has pumped huge sums into a
national advertising campaign, wiping out virtually all of its
operating profits. That approach has created a following for a
character in the commercials who is called Stuart, a punkish youth
with a fetish for trading. He peppers his appearances in the
Ameritrade commercials with exhortations like ``Let's light this
candle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, which earned $3 million last quarter, plans to spend
about $200 million on advertising this year. ``If you turn off your
advertising, you'll die,'' Ricketts said. ``Those big budgets will
always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, freetrade.com will not advertise or promote itself
much at all, he said. Indeed, the only announcement of its
existence was made on Ameritrade's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The stealthy start-up puzzled analysts who worry that
Ameritrade's existing customers will exercise their freedom to
switch from paying $8 to place an online trade through Ameritrade
to paying nothing to place the same trade through its new sister
company.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Appleby, an analyst with Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco, called the venture an experiment. ``They would do this
because they think this is where the market will go eventually,''
said Appleby, who has followed Ameritrade for a few years but was
not aware of freetrade.com until a reporter asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Butte, an analyst with Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., said: ``This, to
me, is unbelievable because it shows how desperate these companies
are, that they are willing to cannibalize their own business to
build account growth. I don't think the competition is on price any
more. I think the competition is on technology.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Electronic brokerage companies are taking extreme measures to
hold on to the most active stock traders because they are so much
more profitable. Butte estimates that ``semiprofessional'' traders
amount to less than 1 percent of the customers at online brokerages
but account for 75 percent of all the trades.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab Corp., the longtime industry leader and
trendsetter, made a statement about the importance of the most
active traders earlier this year when it agreed to buy CyBerCorp, a
small company that provides individual traders direct access to
electronic stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Freetrade.com was designed to appeal to experienced online
traders who will not mind that they can't visit or call their
brokerage company. Their only means of communicating with the
company will be by electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that everyone is going to find
attractive,'' Ricketts said. ``There will be some people from
Ameritrade who move and some who won't.''

 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to know for sure, particularly after last week's
rebound in the Nasdaq market, but investors may be waking up to the
fact that the markets can go down as well as up _ and that safety,
whatever that is, is worth something.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that investment vehicles, whatever the model,
are entirely free of risk. Mattresses can get lumpy, and they are
flammable to boot. And even money market accounts have been known
to get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, some precincts in the investing world where
people are less likely to suffer. Following are excerpts from
conversations last week with analysts and portfolio managers about
four such places in the market.
</P>
<P>
   BEYOND A TECHNOLOGY RUSH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles T. Freeman is portfolio manager of the $15.6 billion
Vanguard Windsor fund, which has stayed almost religiously focused
on value stocks over the last few years while so many other money
managers chased increasingly expensive technology shares. During
the technology sell-off from March 10 through April 14, his fund
gained 8.4 percent, vs. a 34.2 percent loss in the Nasdaq
composite.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you make of the volatility we have seen in the stock
market so far this year, particularly in technology stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a lot of uncertainty and nervousness. We have had a
real long run in the economy and an unusual run in the stock
market. These are late-cycle jitters and are very understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The edginess is compounded by the fact that we are in a cycle of
rising interest rates. None of us really know how many times the
Fed is going to raise rates, and there is always the risk of them
overshooting. So this is a scary time.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks seem like the last place to hide, and that
gives us extreme valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given the way the market has performed over much of the last
12 months, a time when technology has outperformed nearly every
other sector, is it surprising that investors continue to gravitate
toward those stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. Stocks in general have been weak since the middle of last
year because of the Federal Reserve. It is not at all surprising
when the Fed is raising rates to see stocks get hurt. Technology
has been the exception.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1 of last year through the end of March, technology
stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which represent about
one-third of the index, were up 60 percent. The other two-thirds of
the S&AMP;P was down 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think a lot of weight is being given to a recession
right now, but it is hard to find any sign of it in the way
technology shares are being valued. Nontechnology stocks, by
comparison, have taken a much better account of what a recession
might mean.
</P>
<P>
   Is technology spending sacrosanct? Probably. Is it deferrable?
Probably, and in a recession it would be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What criteria do you use to identify and invest in value
stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. We like to buy stocks with low price-earnings ratios relative
to the market, to be price-opportunistic when we buy them, to be
disciplined on the sell side and to concentrate in areas where it
makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   We try and not really stick our necks out. Stocks that trade at
15 to 16 times earnings are a nice platform. That is how we try and
deal with risk, by not paying too much for things.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of your top holdings, which stocks have the potential to do
very well in coming months?
</P>
<P>
   A. At the end of March, our top holdings were AT&AMP;T, Alcoa,
Citigroup, Associates First, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, TJX, Aventis, IBM,
MCI WorldCom, Burlington Resources and Washington Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the four that strike us particularly are Alcoa,
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Associates First and TJX. Those are stocks that
all have upside from 30 percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At some point, the market will get a handle on when the Fed
will finish raising rates. At that point, is it your view that the
broad market will rally, and that technology will fall in favor of
other sectors?
</P>
<P>
   A. It does seem that technology will slide as the rest of the
market rallies, albeit irregularly. Our portfolio was up 14 percent
in the month of March and rose some more in April.
</P>
<P>
   My take on the up leg in stocks like this is that the market is
sniffing out the end to the Fed rate cycle.
</P>
<P>
   I think they will raise rates three more times and no more,
which is what the bond market seems to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, then they will have finished tightening by the
end of the fall. It would not be too early for the stock market to
be anticipating that now. When that happens, money seems to go into
a broad list of stocks and comes out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   A DULL SECTOR CHANGES ITS STRIPES
</P>
<P>
   Time was, utility stocks were most often associated with widows
and orphans. Regulated streams of revenue and cash flow. Consistent
dividend payments. No muss. No fuss.
</P>
<P>
   That was before deregulation, here and around the world. Utility
stocks are still good for widows and orphans. But there are also
some utility companies that pay absolutely no dividends, instead
offering investors a growth-stock story at a lower multiple than
your basic dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan C. Raleigh, a managing director and electric utility
analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., talked about what is happening in
Power Land.

   BOSTON _ On Sunday, April 30, the 25th anniversary of the fall
of Saigon, The Boston Globe will publish a 20-page special Vietnam
retrospective. Included in the package, to move in advance on
Thursday, April 27, with photos, a map and graphics, are:
</P>
<P>
   --A lead essay by Globe Editorial Page Editor H.D.S. Greenway,
and five additional ``postcards'' from Vietnam and Cambodia which
serve as the narrative spine of the section. Greenway covered
Vietnam regularly from 1967 to 1975 for both Time magazine and The
Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive commentary by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Neil
Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of
experiences -- from fighting in the war to going to Canada to evade
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the war's impact on the arts, which led to its
own genre of books, movies and music that changed the American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on Vietnam from the perspective of 20-somethings,
more of whom are taking an increasing number of college courses on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the feelings of Vietnam veterans today.
</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial, and three op-ed pieces by Vietnamese with
different perspectives: a Hanoi poet, a former North Vietnamese
Army officer who accepted the surrender of Saigon but has since
defected, and a Vietnamese-American who argues it is time for those
in the exile community here to bury the hatchet with Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   For questions, please contact  &UR; Frank Perrotta  &LR; at the Boston
Globe,  &UR; 617-929-2597. &LR;  All stories will bear the BOS designator and

 UNDATED: Power Land.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Utility stocks are not the uniformly stodgy, safe places to
stick money that they used to be. Doesn't that mean that investors
need to do at least some homework before considering an investment?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Utilities used to be all the same. Now they are uniquely
different. Some have only 5 percent of their business in
unregulated areas. But with the onset of deregulation state by
state, more and more assets are being deregulated, and more and
more opportunities have arisen for utilities to invest in other
assets. For some companies, that has translated into problems.
</P>
<P>
   Edison International and CMS Energy, to name two, are stocks
that have done pretty poorly as unregulated investments: so far
this year Edison International is down 29 percent and CMS is down
37 percent. They are the two worst performers in the S&AMP;P utility
index, which comprises 29 companies.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of talk about owning some of the
traditional electric company stocks. I have said that is fine, you
can do that, but if you want to take advantage of companies with
hard assets, with real revenues and real cash flows, you have to
look at the leaders in the power sector that have spent their lives
as deregulated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It sounds like you have some nontraditional utility companies
in mind. What are they, and why do you like them?
</P>
<P>
   A. The two most prominent ones are AES and Calpine. Neither
transformed from regulated to unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine was the fifth-best-performing stock on the New York
Stock Exchange last year, rising more than 400 percent. Over the
last three years, it is up 655 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AES was the second-best-performing stock I cover,
rising 58 percent. Over the last three years, it is up 228 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These are not utilities, because they are not regulated. They
are growth power companies. Neither stock pays a dividend, and
there are risks associated with both.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any traditional utility stocks that you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. Peco Energy, the Philadelphia-based utility, is one. Unicom
in Chicago is another. And Constellation Energy, which is the
Baltimore-based utility. Those our our favorite plain-vanilla
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aren't there also some utilities that are transforming
themselves into fiber optic cable companies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are companies that are building out fiber optic cable.
The biggest to date is Montana Power, which about a month ago
announced they are selling the remnants of their utility business,
so that all that is left is broadband. They have been in the
business for the last 10 to 12 years. And Dominion Resources is
doing it in the Middle Atlantic and Southern states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRIGHTER DAYS IN REAL ESTATE
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the Warren Buffett of his time, but Mark Twain said he
liked real estate because he was pretty sure God wasn't going to
make any more of it. Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   For the last couple of years, however, investors have shunned
that view. Real estate investment trusts, the securitized way to
play the dirt market, have been underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   That has begun to change. Jonathan Litt, senior real estate
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, discussed the possible security,
if not serenity, in investing in bricks and mortar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the case for buying REIT stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. REITs are in a particularly good spot today because investors
are increasingly becoming more nervous about the broader market and
questioning valuations.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you own REITs is that currently they trade at a
discount to net asset value of about 12 percent. Historically, they
have traded at a premium of about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, they also have the highest yields of any stock
group, at about 8.6 percent. That is higher than most investment
grade corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the real estate business in the United States is
very healthy. Ninety percent of REIT revenue this year is
identifiable, because owners have guaranteed lease obligations.
There is not a lot of guesswork for chief executives when they come
in in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, if the market decides it hates REITs, the stocks
will get whipsawed about. This is not a money market account. There
is risk to the valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Isn't real estate highly vulnerable to rising interest rates?
And aren't we pretty far along in the current cycle, particularly
if the Fed inadvertently overdoes it and pushes the economy into
recession?
</P>
<P>
   A. Today, REITs are conservatively leveraged. We are talking
about 50 percent or less debt. We have never had more conservative
leverage on real estate. It is a phenomenon of the 1990s that is a
residue of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And why are rates going up? Because of concerns about inflation.
In times of inflation, investors have traditionally wanted to own
gold and real estate. Rents are tied to the rate of inflation,
which is a great store of wealth for investors.
</P>
<P>
   I see REITs being in a good place for the next recession, as
opposed to the last one, which was like the 100-year flood in the
real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we are definitely past the sweet spot of the real estate
cycle, which lasted from 1993 to about 1997. We are now in
equilibrium in terms of supply, demand and pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 6 to 12 months, we may see a little overbuilding
in areas like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and South Florida, but
demand appears so strong it will be absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which REIT stocks are you recommending?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, the focus should be on the blue chips, and investors
should own three, not just one.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks we like the most right now are Avalon Bay
Communities, a multifamily REIT based in Alexandria, Va.; Boston
Properties, which owns high-profile office assets in markets like
New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco; and Simon Property
Group, which is our top pick among retail REITs. They are doing
some of the most innovative things in changing the way regional
malls are operated.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD STOCKS AS COMFORT
</P>
<P>
   People have to eat, but for the last year investors have
absolutely hated food stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended March 31, the food stocks in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 36.5 percent. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is evidence over the last five weeks that some
investors are taking comfort in food: since March 15, stocks
including Bestfoods and Quaker Oats are up 30 percent or more. John
O'Neil, an analyst at PaineWebber, served up some thoughts on the
business, and the stocks:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why has such a stable business been so beaten up by
investors?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Part of it is due to a shift in focus to more growth-oriented
stocks in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in the food group was worst between November and
February of this year, when for no structural reason the stocks
fell off a cliff. During that period they were oversold, and fell
to 14 times to 15 times earnings. That is the lowest they have been
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, these food stocks are on sale. But shouldn't people
looking for growth steer clear of them? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over all, the food industry only grows at the rate of the
population. The successful food companies will be those that can
increase their share of the consumer stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, people have thought of food stocks as a group. But
they are not all created equal. You want to own these stocks not
just for defensive reasons, but as assets that can grow and
appreciate as well.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a handful of companies that are well positioned to
grow earnings at a low double-digit rate. Marketing is the key to
growth for food companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So who in your view are the best marketers in the business? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over time, there are only a handful of stocks worth owning.
We are focusing on four _ Quaker Oats, Bestfoods, General Mills and
Nabisco. These are stocks you can buy and put away. They have the
skill and execution capabilities to sustain long-term growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You seem especially keen on Bestfoods. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Bestfoods is the best example of a buy-it-and-put-it-away
stock.
</P>
<P>
   They have grown earnings at a 12 percent annual compound rate
over the last 10 years. Two-thirds of its earnings come from
outside the United States, and it gets 35 percent of its total
profits from emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a food company, they are less susceptible to economic
downturns in those markets than other consumer goods companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is like Coke or Gillette or Colgate, but the stock trades at
half the multiple of those companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which of the companies you follow just don't get it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a handful of food stocks you don't want to touch,
because they are not spending to grow their businesses. And if they
decide to invest soon, their earnings will be lower near term, and
the stocks will fall.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup is the prototype of the stodgy food company.
Volumes are down in soup, in Pepperidge Farm cookies, in V8
beverages. And their marketing expenditures are down.
</P>
<P>
   We would also shy away from H.J. Heinz and Kellogg. We have a
neutral rating on Hershey Foods as well. The outlook there is
improving, but the news is already priced into the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is going to happen with Nabisco? Carl C. Icahn is
looking at it. Do you see other bidders coming in?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nabisco is for sale. If it can be sold at all, I think it
will be sold by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Icahn, I think Danone, a French food company,
will take a look at it. And I think Campbell Soup should look at
it.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Nabisco would give Campbell an opportunity to
diversify and get a management team that is among the best in the
industry. &QL;

PUTIN SEEN TAKING UPPER HAND IN COMING TALKS WITH US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Suddenly, arms control is all the rage in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of Russia's parliament upstaged the United
States Friday when it overwhelmingly ratified a treaty banning
global nuclear testing. President Clinton was unable to persuade
the US Senate to approve the same treaty last October.
</P>
<P>
   The 298-74 vote approving the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty came
exactly one week after lawmakers here broke a seven-year deadlock,
ratifying the 1993 START II strategic arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's rapid-fire ratification of the two pacts will allow
Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to claim the moral high ground
in upcoming arms control talks with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratification gives Russia an excellent chance to seize the
initiative in nuclear arms talks,'' said Dmitry Rogozin, chairman
of the State Duma's committee on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty has been signed by 154 countries. But only
52 of them, including Russia, have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty will not go into effect unless all 44 countries with
known or suspected nuclear capability ratify it. Besides the United
States and China, other holdouts include Egypt, Pakistan, India,
and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow and Washington are at loggerheads over an array of arms
control issues. The most contentious is the Clinton
administration's desire to build a missile defense system to
protect the United States against potential attacks by what it
calls ``rogue states'' such as Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has unsuccessfully tried to persuade Moscow to
support amendments to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which
prohibits missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has staunchly opposed the move, saying it would
damage Moscow's national security and upset the fragile nuclear
balance between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's newfound interest in ratifying lingering arms accords,
analysts here said, is part of a strategy to pressure the United
States to abandon its plans to install a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes on the eve of a series of high-profile
international arms control meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations conference on halting the spread of nuclear
weapons technology begins in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Clinton will travel to Moscow to hold his first summit
meeting with Putin, with arms control issues high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Volk, a defense analyst at the Heritage Foundation in
Moscow, said Russia's new approach to arms control ``is a
propaganda offensive designed to stop the American advance on
ABM.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is designed to put the Senate and the Clinton
administration in the limelight of international public opinion by
showing that Russia is interested in arms control while the US is
not,'' Volk said.
</P>
<P>
   When it ratified START II on April 14, Russia's parliament added
amendments linking it to Washington's adherence to the ABM treaty.
Legislators also approved a 1997 US-Russian protocol to START II
that pushes back from 2003 to 2007 the deadline for Moscow to scrap
its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The US Senate, where a missile defense system has broad
bipartisan support, has yet to approve the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans say the ABM treaty, a centerpiece of
US-Soviet strategic relations, is obsolete now that the Cold War is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said he would tear up START II and abandon any future arms
treaties with Washington if the United States breaks the
antiballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States are also at loggerheads over how
deep to make the weapons cutbacks in next strategic arms treaty,
called START III.
</P>
<P>
   Under START II, the US and Russia must cut their arsenals from
6,000 warheads each to between 3,000 and 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations on START III, the Clinton administration has
called for cutting down to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads. But Russia,
which lacks the funds to maintain such an arsenal, is pushing for
deeper cuts, to 1,000 to 1,500 warheads for each side.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have suggested that Clinton and Putin could strike
a deal under which the Russians agree to a limited missile defense
system and the US accepts deeper cuts in strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Russia's security council approved a new military
doctrine that upgraded the role of nuclear weapons in the country's
national defense.
</P>
<P>
   The new doctrine says Russia will use nuclear weapons if
necessary to fight off a conventional attack.

POLICING KOSOVO: AN UPHILL BATTLE AMID AGE-OLD HATREDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (1600 words; includes police contribution text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ She was petite, said she was 15 years old,
had just beaten a man to death with a pipe, and wasn't the least
bit interested in protesting her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' the girl told her police interrogators, dismissing
their questions with a wave of her hand, ``we can talk about
anything you want, but this was only a Serb.''
</P>
<P>
   Charly Gortano, an Austrian detective who heads the homicide
squad here, looked to Tom Pellegrini, a homicide detective from
Baltimore, and rolled his eyes. Two months later, the girl walked
free after her family showed up with a birth certificate that
claimed she was only 13, below the age that people here are can be
held criminally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Balkans,'' Gortano told a disbelieving
Pellegrini.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kosovo, a year after NATO launched its war against
Yugoslavia, the hatred is as thick as the smog that shrouds
Pristina, the capital. A year ago, Serbs ran roughshod over the
ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the 2 million
population, killing thousands and driving nearly 1 million from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But what goes around always comes around in the Balkans, and
today Albanians are exacting their revenge, killing Serbs and
forcing them to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stop or at least stem the violence is a group of about
2,400 police officers drafted from 45 countries by the United
Nations. They are fighting an uphill battle, slogging against a
maddening UN bureaucracy, a nearly non-existent criminal justice
system, and the utter refusal by many people to adhere to the rules
of civil society. They are undermanned, underequipped and
increasingly disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Police drive red and white Toyota sports utility vehicles,
leading the locals to nickname them ``the Coca-Colas.'' Despite
their presence, some 500 people, most of them Serbs, have been
murdered since the war ended last June. Few of the killers have
been apprehended, and still fewer have stood trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina has a well-established Code of Silence, which means
murderers usually go unpunished. Some potential witnesses fear
retribution, while others approve of the revenge killings. Even
when innocents are killed, witnesses keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a UN worker from Bulgaria was walking with two
British colleagues in Pristina's main pedestrian area when a group
of Albanian youths, suspecting him to be a Serb, asked him the time
in Serbian. When he replied in Serbian, the young men beat him
savagely before one of them pulled a gun and shot him in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were at least 50 or 60 people who witnessed the whole
thing. We told some of the witnesses that this guy had come here to
help them, but no one would cooperate,'' said Gortano.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a 62-year-old Serbian university professor, his
51-year-old wife, and their 76-year-old female friend were set upon
by a crowd returning from an Albanian Flag Day celebration. The
professor and one of the women were beaten to death. Again, despite
hundreds of witnesses, no one came forward.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the minority of Serbs still in Kosovo are similarly
uncooperative. In north Mitrovica, the last large Serb enclave,
Serbian men who were angry that a Serbian woman had rented an
apartment to a Jordanian police officer forced the officer at
gunpoint to watch as they shot and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Detention centers are so crowded that only suspects who were
carrying rifles or machine guns are held without bail. There are so
few courts in operation that many are freed because there is no
judge to conduct a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre ironies abound. Under a UN decree, clerical staff get
$30 a day for hazardous duty, but police officers do not. The UN
pays judges and other important cogs in the justice system about
$200 a month, about a quarter of what it pays its drivers and
interpreters, perpetuating the shortage of judges in the face of a
paralyzing backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Koenigs, the UN's chief of administration, agreed in an
interview that the discrepancy between the pay of judges and
intepreters is fodder for critics who say the United Nations is a
bureaucracy blind to common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain imbalance. I regret that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Koenigs said the pay scale for interpreters and drivers is
set in New York, while judges and other civil servants are paid a
wage that has to be sustained locally for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is temporary work for the drivers and interpreters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police scoff at that explanation, saying that paying judges
such low wages is an invitation to corruption and sends the message
that criminal justice is not a priority. They said the United
Nations has not provided the tools to do proper criminal
investigations, such as laboratories to do DNA, fingerprint and
ballistic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Gortano, the detective, has resorted to sending evidence to
colleagues in Austria for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that there is too much crime, Koenigs insisted it
is not as bad as most other postwar societies. He said the United
Nations has done a good job at stabilizing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every murder is one too much, but you can't say this mission
has failed because there is a murder every night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many police officers, about 500 of whom are Americans, have been
enticed here by the chance to make $100,000 a year tax-free. But
more than 100 officers, half of them American, have given up and
gone back home, frustrated by the lack of legal, institutional and
forensic support.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who heads the UN operation in
Kosovo, said only about half of the promised police have arrived.
Some countries, including France and Belgium, have failed to keep
their promises, while the Americans, British, and Germans have sent
more than they orginally pledged.
</P>
<P>
   General Klaus Reinhardt, the German who commands nearly 40,000
peacekeeping troops, said the shortage of police has forced him to
deploy soldiers to do jobs that should be done by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could use two or three times as many police officers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are here already say it doesn't matter how many
police are here if the criminal justice system remains toothless.
Dmitry Kaportsev, a Russian police officer, said the real shortage
is in specially trained units who can tackle problems specific to
Kosovo, such as riot control. But even when trained officers are
deployed, they can run into the bureaucratic handcuffs of the
United Nations, which has to take cultural and political
sensitivities into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When 60 officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's police force, were recently dispatched here, they
volunteered to go to Mitrovica, the divided northern city which is
a constant flashpoint. Among the international contingent, the
Northern Ireland officers have the most training and practical
experience in dealing with divided, violent communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UN agreed to let four of us work in Mitrovica, but they
said it would look racist if they sent all of us up there,'' said
one RUC officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It is little wonder that gangsters and assorted ne'er-do-wells
have flocked to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Police have been instructed by the United Nations to focus on
keeping people from killing each other. In the meantime,
racketeering is flourishing. Some police said that because the
United Nations needs the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation
Army to make any long-term settlement work, it is willing to
overlook the many former rebels who are now extorting payoffs from
cafes and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Guyton, who took a year's leave of absence from his job as
a deputy sheriff in North Carolina, said targeting organized crime
has taken a back seat to preventing mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of manpower,'' he said. ``We're trying to
start a police department from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the UN police are supposed to hand off their
responsibilities to a locally recruited police department. So far,
about 340 locals have been trained, and the goal is to have 4,500
trained by December 2001. But many international police believe
that goal is overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys may be criminals, but there's no way to do
background checks,'' said Guyton.
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrini worked homicides in Baltimore for eight years, and
was the inspiration for the character of Detective Bayliss on the
TV drama ``Homicide,'' before retiring to come here. He said the
saddest case he has come across here reminded him of how many
damaged lives there are in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy who left his wife and seven kids here to go
work in Germany,'' he said, sitting in the homicide office. ``While
he was away, his 15-year-old son stepped on a landmine and blew off
his arm and leg. The husband came home and blamed his wife for not
keeping an eye on the kid, an argument ensued and he ended up
strangling and killing her.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran homicide cop looked out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war has done a number on people,'' he said, ``and we
haven't seen the half of it yet.''

`TOO OLD' HITS EARLY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At age 37, Miklyn Provenzano is over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's a mother of two young daughters and walks with
a spring in her step, Provenzano is too old to get a job as a
federal law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agencies have a rule that new hires
cannot have reached their 37th birthday by the time they join. That
way, the reasoning goes, the law enforcement officers can retire at
the mandatory retirement age of 57 and receive a pension, which
requires at least 20 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law, which went into effect in 1974, covers the
gun-toting investigatory jobs in the federal government, including
those at the FBI, Postal Service, U.S. Customs Service, Drug
Enforcement Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Probation Department and the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people try to apply who are older than 37, said U.S.
Postal Inspector William Scott. But the situation is actually
better than it was years ago when applicants had to be under 35.
That was the rule when Scott joined the postal inspectors squad.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't care about a pension and you just need a job
like Provenzano, it doesn't matter. She went through a divorce
recently and has to feed her two young children. You can't get
hired if you are older than 37.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think education will help. It doesn't matter that
Provenzano is finishing up her master's degree in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DISCRIMINATION IRONIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government slams the door in the face of
``older'' job seekers, there is also a federal law that forbids
employers from discriminating against people who are 40 years of
age or older.
</P>
<P>
   The irony wasn't lost on Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, who was
stunned when he heard there was an age cutoff for federal law
enforcement jobs. The government should live by the same rules as
private employers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates should be judged on whether they can physically
and mentally do the job, he said. There ought to be more important
criteria than using retirement qualifications as the basis for
hiring someone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he would direct his staff to look into the current
law and said that he plans to introduce legislation to open up the
jobs to all workers.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the reason for the age cutoff is to allow
the officers to retire with a pension, but Houston lawyer Joel
Androphy doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, especially the FBI, want their agents young
because they want to be able to mold them to their liking, Androphy
said. They figure it's too difficult to reprogram an older person.
</P>
<P>
   Al Tribble, a special agent for the FBI in Houston, scoffed at
Androphy's suggestion. It's not easy to meet the physical
requirements to be an agent, which include running, sprinting,
push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   However, ironically, there are no mandatory physical fitness
tests for existing agents. They can eat all the donuts they want
and still stay on the force.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AGE-OLD RULES FRUSTRATING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city of Houston also has a rule that police officers with
the Houston Police Department can't be older than 35 when they
join. However, in the city's case, it's not tied to a pension,
because there is no mandatory retirement age.

   The law dates back to the late 1940s, when the Texas Legislature
voted to allow cities with more than 10,000 residents to adopt a
maximum age for new police officers. The only exception is if the
applicant is under 45 and has five years as a peace officer or in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that if someone is 40 years old, his five to 10 to
15 years of law enforcement experience compensates for his
diminishing physical abilities, according to a lawyer for the city.

   It was all very frustrating for Provenzano as she sat in her
spacious northwest Houston home over a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a job,'' she said, her voice rising.
</P>
<P>
   While she earns some money as a substitute school teacher,
there's a job opening she's heard about that she'd like to pursue
at the federal probation office. While her 35- and 36-year-old
colleagues in her criminal justice program at the University of
Houston Clear Lake can go for it, it's beyond her reach.
</P>
<P>
   It's not fair, she said. Older people are physically fit, too.

   BOSTON _ On Sunday, April 30, the 25th anniversary of the fall
of Saigon, The Boston Globe will publish a 20-page special Vietnam
retrospective. Included in the package, to move in advance on
Thursday, April 27, with photos, a map and graphics, are:
</P>
<P>
   --A lead essay by Globe Editorial Page Editor H.D.S. Greenway,
and five additional ``postcards'' from Vietnam and Cambodia which
serve as the narrative spine of the section. Greenway covered
Vietnam regularly from 1967 to 1975 for both Time magazine and The
Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive commentary by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Neil
Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of
experiences -- from fighting in the war to going to Canada to evade
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the war's impact on the arts, which led to its
own genre of books, movies and music that changed the American
culture.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on Vietnam from the perspective of 20-somethings,
more of whom are taking an increasing number of college courses on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the feelings of Vietnam veterans today.
</P>
<P>
   -- An editorial, and three op-ed pieces by Vietnamese with
different perspectives: a Hanoi poet, a former North Vietnamese
Army officer who accepted the surrender of Saigon but has since
defected, and a Vietnamese-American who argues it is time for those
in the exile community here to bury the hatchet with Hanoi.

GERM-KILLER IN RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bacteria-fighting antibiotics are classic victims of their own
success. The more one antibiotic proves effective in killing off
one germ or another, the more it is used and the more quickly
mutant bacteria that are resistant to it proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   That is why US Food and Drug Administration officials want use
of the newest miracle drug, Zyvox, limited as much as possible to
hospitals and nursing homes. Because of the heavy use of
antibiotics in those settings, they are breeders of the most
dangerously resistant strains. Zyvox comes in both intravenous and
oral forms, so doctors can start patients on it at the hospital and
have them finish with it at home, but physicians would do well to
think twice before starting it on patients who are not in a
hospital or nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, Zyvox has been shown to be impressively _ but not
universally _ effective against both staph infections that resist
methicillin and enterococcus bacteria that can survive doses of
vancomycin, a long-time last-resort antibiotic. It also is
recommended for cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort of the FDA and the drug's makers,
Pharmacia and Upjohn, to stop overuse of Zyvox, its label will ask
doctors to ``carefully consider alternatives before initiating
treatment with Zyvox in the outpatient setting.'' Other antibiotics
have been used too indiscriminately both by doctors and by
livestock farmers, who often include antibiotics in their animals'
feed.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who developed Zyvox are hopeful that bacteria
resistant to it will not spring up too quickly. The first truly new
antibiotic to be approved in 35 years, Zyvox strikes at the
bacteria life cycle at an earlier stage than other antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Developing new drugs is not the only approach medical science
has to the problem of Superbugs. Other researchers are working to
modify existing antibiotics, like tetracycline, and others seek to
reduce the need for antibiotics overall by developing preventive
vaccines against bacterial diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is incumbent on health officials and
practitioners to protect Zyvox from overuse.

FOR PROTESTERS, HARD TO RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday, Kate Purdy was saving the world from
globalization. But Tuesday was the hard part: Going back to
Hampshire College, to be a normal sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, Purdy drove back to Washington. And by Friday,
four days after the anti-World Bank demonstrations ended, Purdy was
back in protest mode, joining some two dozen students and activists
from western Massachusetts who never left here at all.
</P>
<P>
   They called their mission ``solidarity,'' gathering outside the
District of Columbia jail in a vigil for the 150 or so activists
who had been held since the weekend until they were finally
released late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the students hanging around the lawn at the D.C. jail,
there seemed to be an after-shock quality to their efforts as well
_ what one student called a ``hangover,'' making it all but
impossible to return to the banality of daily life after taking on
the police, the World Bank, the economic structure of the entire
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shifts your priorities,'' Purdy, 19, said. ``A lot of
people had a lot of trouble getting back into the academic spheres
of their minds. I think we all naively assumed things would go back
to being the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Information, none of which could be confirmed, trickled out of
the jail for days: That the prisoners were on a hunger strike. That
groups of women had taken off all their clothes to avoid being
moved by police. That scores of vegetarians were unable to eat at
all, given the nature of jail food.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prisoners were there because they refused to give
their names, instead being labelled as Jane or John Doe. Under a
plea bargain reached late Friday, according to their lawyer, the
charges against the prisoners were reduced to jaywalking and they
were fined $5 each and released.
</P>
<P>
   Some had claimed they were mistreated in the jail but city
officials denied that.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, things have more or less returned to normal. The
last protest signs are being ripped down, and the last police
barricades outside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
headquarters were hauled away earlier in the week. The debate is
now post-game: Did the police act too aggressively? Did the World
Bank deserve the criticism? Did the protesters know what they were
fighting for at all?
</P>
<P>
   For a handful from Massachusetts, however, as well as some
others from Washington and other cities nearby, the demonstration
never stopped. They have been at the mercy of strangers for more
than a week, sleeping first at a Jewish Community Center, and then,
more recently, on the floor of a Washington church. They have
skipped class and work. They have barely slept. Many of them have
gotten sick.
</P>
<P>
   But they seem less eager to go home than to continue bonding
with one another. And for many of the students, the atmosphere
outside the D.C. jail was not all that different from life on an
especially grungy college campus quad: Some people sat huddled
together under plastic tarps. Others sang and played the drums. A
small group did yoga. At one point, the group went on an impromptu
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were really prepared for what the whole arrest
experience was going to be like,'' said Sienna Baskin, 22, a
substitute teacher who graduated from Hampshire College earlier
this year. ``After I got out of jail (where she spent the night),
there was just no way I could leave until I knew everyone was
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is what kept Kai Newkirk, 19, from going back to
his dog in western Massachusetts until early Friday. It has kept
Matthew Knoester, 25, a Roxbury public school teacher, here all
week. It is why Kazu Haga, 19, is missing work as a chef in
Amherst, and why Laura Anderson, 20, has missed history and writing
classes at Hampshire College, even though she knows doing so could
affect her grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in this kind of situation, when you have friends
in jail and hunger strikes, your perspective changes,'' Anderson
said Friday, as she crouched on a curb outside the D.C. jail under
gray skies. Nearby, beneath the painted protest signs stuck to the
make-shift tents on the jail lawn, lay giant plastic bags of bread,
cans of black beans and tins of coffee, at the ready in case a
group of prisoners was released. ``I'm not sure my professors will
be understanding. But that doesn't really matter as much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could quite explain the disproportionate number of people
from Massachusetts who hung on to the event, the first major
anti-globalization effort since last November, when thousands of
activists surprised the world by temporarily stopping the World
Trade Organization summit in Seattle. More than 1,000 Massachusetts
protesters were here over the weekend, organizers estimate.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the spirit of western Massachusetts _ long a bastion
of activism _ played a role. So did the sheer number of students,
whose schedules and idealism are at the foundation of many a noble
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just brought so many people down,'' said Haga, wearing a
black sweatshirt with Western Massachusetts emblazoned across it.
Against the bland brown backdrop of the D.C. jail, he spoke to
friends, chatted on a cell phone, and checked periodically to see
if any new information about the prisoners inside had been
released. ``We are very dedicated to staying until they get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they were rewarded.

SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS ON LEO, OPRAH AND OTHER WEIGHTY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week at the beach clears the mind with the vigorous efficiency
of a tropical storm, allowing one to focus on the important stuff,
such as ...
</P>
<P>
   The journalistic credentials of Leonardo DiCaprio. Some Web site
periodistas, particularly the ``media critic'' types, have treated
this dustup with the reverence accorded cleavage at the Oscars or _
gasp! _ Kathie Lee's successor. Upon learning that a mere
entertainer would get to interview the president of the United
States while card-carrying journalists stewed in their own bitter
juices _ today's special: boiled crank au jus _ some newsies were
said to be in high dudgeon, which I'm told is nothing like tall
cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the affront! An actor posing as a journalist! Why, that
would be like a ballplayer becoming a sportscaster, or an Army
general becoming a school superintendent. How silly. Where does an
actor get off thinking he can ask intelligent questions of POTUS?
Surely it is written that only well-coiffed journalists with
impressive egos, er, resumes can ask thoughtful, probing questions,
and that non-journalists are not only unworthy of an audience with
the first bubba but also incapable of pulling it off without
embarrassing themselves or the presidency. And on the off chance
that Mr. DiCaprio's interview, which was scheduled to air as part
of an ABC Earth Day special Saturday night, did include a dumb
question, what of it? It's not as if it would be the first time a
network infotainment figure had said something stupid on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the public thinks journalists are a bunch
of smarmy, elitist microbes who have nothing better to do than
worry about their bruised feelings? That is, when they're not
contemplating ...
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of Planet Oprah. No, this isn't a snide reference
to weight fluctuations. I'm just uncomfortable when something or
someone gets big enough to qualify as a Dow Jones industrial.
Monoliths scare me, and when you've got your own TV show, a piece
of a cable channel, a book club, a production company and a
magazine with your picture on the cover every month, well, your
lith most definitely has mono. Like Disney. Microsoft. Martha
Stewart. And Hearst (which owns part of Oprah's magazine, not to
mention this newspaper).
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't the Justice Department be thinking about divvying up
Oprah into several miniliths right about now? If it doesn't, we all
know what'll be next: Oprah franchises. For only half a million
bucks and your solemn word that you won't tell anyone what Oprah is
really like, you'll be able to operate an Oprah drive-thru in your
neighborhood. Dispense Oprah's wisdom, pathos, book excerpts and
favorite recipes while interviewing your kid's Little League coach
about the importance of achieving a metaphysical oneness with the
infield fly rule. It's bound to happen, as long as Janet Reno is
busy starring in ...
</P>
<P>
   Elian, the Miniseries. When I was about 6 years old, I wanted to
live with my Uncle Joe because he drove a trailer truck every day,
which was too cool to imagine. Who knew that if I had pressed my
case in the U.S. Court of Appeals I might have forced my
station-wagon parents to relinquish me into the custody of a
relative with an 18-wheeler?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was nothing like ``Elian, the Miniseries''
to show me the way. Back when I was 6, TV networks hadn't yet
discovered that they could create the impression of a news story
simply by reporting the same thing for weeks on end. Nowadays, the
networks and their local affiliates, in the spirit of public
service, subscribe to the no-news-is-still-news theory because it's
easier to camp out in one spot for a long time than waste expensive
gas traipsing all over the country looking for real news. This
helps explain the widely held penchant for ...
</P>
<P>
   Anniversary journalism. Born of the long-held belief that a
story should always have a news ``peg'' before it gets reported to
the masses, an anniversary is one of the flimsiest _ and most
popular _ excuses to manufacture coverage. If done well, it can
help us understand what we've learned since the original event. But
more often than not, be it the fifth anniversary of Oklahoma City
or the first anniversary of Columbine, it's little more than a
cheesy attempt to draw viewers with maudlin, manipulative
programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make one want to take a vacation. From
television. And, as it happens, Monday is the first day of TV
Turnoff Week, a national campaign to wean America away from the
tube. For more information, call TV-FreeAmerica at 202-887-0436,

NUCLEAR TRIGGER-LOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 25, 1995, a US weather rocket launched from Norway
caused the nuclear suitcases of Russian leaders to be activated.
Somehow Russian officers who had been informed of the scientific
rocket launch did not pass the message on. As a consequence,
Russian leaders and their nuclear advisers held an emergency
conference to decide whether they should authorize a nuclear
retaliation. It took eight fateful minutes to determine that the
rocket from Norway was not indicative of a surprise first strike
from American nuclear submarines.
</P>
<P>
   That frightful false alarm was significant for what it
demonstrated about the dangers of an unintended or accidental
nuclear war. Boris Yeltsin and his advisers came within four
minutes of the deadline for ordering a nuclear attack on the West,
according to Russia's procedures for a retaliatory
launch-on-warning.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since that close call, the likelihood of a
nuclear catastrophe caused by a false alarm has only become
greater. The deteriorating computers and communications equipment
in Russia's nuclear command system malfunction more often. Russian
early-warning satellites and ground radar installations are more
likely than ever to produce nuclear false alarms. Underpaid,
unpaid, demoralized, and suicidal personnel in Russian nuclear
units add to the peril of an apocalyptic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The safest and most feasible method for reducing the risk of
accidental nuclear war produced by a false alarm is to de-alert the
nuclear weapons of all eight nuclear states. There are several
measures that could increase the time needed to respond to a false
alarm, but the most effective would be to remove warheads from
missiles and store them, under multinational verification, at
separate sites.
</P>
<P>
   The model for such de-alerting was the unilateral action of
George Bush in September 1991 in the aftermath of the coup attempt
in the Soviet Union. All bombs were then taken off US planes and
sequestered. When he returned to Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev
reciprocated. Those sage precautions taken by Bush and Gorbachev
should become models for the de-alerting of all nuclear missiles in
the world's current state of permanent peril.

THE POWER OF MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 23, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 1,000 years or more _ possibly 1,200 or 1,300 _
``Beowulf'' is a bestseller again.
</P>
<P>
   In a brilliant new translation from the Old English by Nobel
poet Seamus Heaney _ one that opens modern eyes to what Heaney
rightly calls ``a work of the greatest imaginative vitality'' _ the
Scandinavian hero strides with fresh boldness to rid the world of
the monster Grendel, ripping his arm off at the shoulder; then
Grendel's enraged mother; then, late in life, a fire-spewing
dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Many treasures of the poem are quickly apparent, from such
striking images as the reference to a stretch of ocean as ``the
gannet's bath'' to powerful passages on the dangers of power and
the loss of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the news business, frequently criticized for
dwelling on the violent and the sensational, may be excused for
noticing that Beowulf's three great battles dominate this story,
while his 50-year reign as king in peace and prosperity merits
three lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the more intriguing question is the reason for the book's
surprise success. Why is it jostling with the Harry Potter books
for rungs on the best-seller list?
</P>
<P>
   Why in this age of instantaneous futuristic techno-everything
are we suddenly captivated by myth, including monsters and
fire-breathing dragons?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly it has to do with the fact that our society is awash in
rationality, inundated with technology, infatuated with money and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   In such a soulless world, myth has obvious appeal. We want to
believe that something magical can still happen. That it's easy to
tell the white hats from the black. That heroes and goodness can
conquer evil. That in our most desperate hour there is still hope
that the wizard will come to save us.
</P>
<P>
   So these books are comforting now. But it has been said that
myth is embraced by all ages. Certainly, ``Beowulf'' and Harry
Potter are both read eagerly by small children at bedtime and also
by graying adults. No matter that one work is months old and the
other has crossed the millenia.

GORE SAYS HE'LL STEP UP THE ATTACK ON BUSH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ After watching Texas Governor George W. Bush
try to edge him out on two of his favorite subjects _ education and
the environment _ Vice President Al Gore has decided to go back on
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign game plan, which debuted Friday, calls for Gore
to try to shred Bush's policy proposals and his record in Texas in
much the same way he attacked Bill Bradley during the primary. And
just as Gore's assault on Bradley steadied his then-shaky
candidacy, advisers hope that a vigorous onslaught against Bush
will revive what has lately been seen as a lackluster performance
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   At his first news conference of the general election Friday,
Gore began dissecting Bush's pronouncements and his record as he
trumpeted the Sierra Club's decision to name Texas the most
polluted state in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush seems to have the smug assumption that he can
get away with calling himself an environmentalist, in spite of the
record of what has gone so badly wrong in Texas because of his
decision to replace the environmental regulators with
representatives of the polluting industries,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Bush fared no better in Gore's estimation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking that many families in Texas have to go across
the border to Mexico in order to get health care that they are not
provided by Governor Bush and his administration in Texas,'' Gore
said, noting that Texas has the worst record of all 50 states for
providing health care to people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore alleged that Bush would undermine the nation's strong
economy with his tax cut and spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``His economic numbers do not add up,'' Gore said. ``In fact,
they don't even come close. His proposal to privatize Social
Security would lead to a bankrupting of Social Security in the
first quarter of this century. You can't have a $2.1 trillion tax
scheme without putting our country immediately into deficits
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, called it no surprise that
Gore would go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly sounds like the vice president has nothing
positive to say about his campaign,'' Fleischer said. ``He sounds
intent on running a negative attack campaign and that's
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of attacking, perhaps the vice president could explain
why there are 8 million more Americans who lack health insurance
since he took office, why reading scores have stagnated across the
country and why our public schools have failed to improve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is going to focus on policy and subtance and Al
Gore is going to run a negative attack campaign, where he himself
said it's important to rip the lungs out of your opponent. That's
unfortunate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, during his Michigan stop, also offered a defense, on the
eve of Earth Day, of his reputation as an ardent environmentalist.
Speaking in the heartland of the US auto manufacturing industry he
said he believes that it may be possible to eventually phase out
the internal combustion engine in favor of more efficient
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard, and in the months ahead I am sure we will hear,
every possible scare tactic on this issue,'' Gore said. ``But we
will not give in and we will not back down. It is not extreme but
mainstream to champion cleaner fuels and energy efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his shift to a more aggressive strategy, Gore said he
won't let Bush continue to portray himself however he wants. ``I
think that these things catch up to you over time,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president is expected to step up the rhetoric even
further on Tuesday during a major address in New York, accusing
Bush of taking an ``irresponsible approach'' toward the economy by
providing a large tax cut with ``not a penny'' left to protect
Social Security and Medicare. Later, Gore is expected to
deconstruct Bush's claim to have improved educational quality in
Texas. And he will critique Bush on foreign policy during a speech
in Boston on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that George Bush has taken two steps to the left from the
edge of the right-wing cliff as part of his Bob Jones redemption
tour, there are some comparisons we can make on his vision and our
vision on education, health care, the environment and the
economy,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's return to the attack mode has been a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the New Hampshire primary, the vice president
largely dropped off the nation's radar screen as the Republicans
duked it out across the country. Then, after locking up the
nomination on March 7, Gore seemed to fade once more into the
background, almost intentionally keeping his profile low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush launched a vigorous effort to upstage
Gore on the issues and to moderate his image after a tough primary
battle with Senatory John McCain. From education to health care to
the environment, Bush has spent weeks trying to make Gore's
signature issues his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shannon, the former Massachusetts congressman who served as
Bradley's state chairman, said he believes Bush is even more
vulnerable to Gore's tactics than Bradley was because he presides
over a state with a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it unfair? Absolutely,'' said Shannon, referring to the
kind of attacks Gore levelled at Bradley. ``It was unfair and very
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to plant seeds of doubt about somebody who wasn't
really well known by the voters, who was just introducing himself
to the voters,'' Shannon said. ``As soon as (Bradley) surfaced with
serious proposals, Gore pounced and seriously distorted Bradley's
record with the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven times Friday, Gore used the word `responsible' or
`responsibility' to talk about pollution and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will always argue that pollution is the inevitable price
we pay for our prosperity -- that invites and excuses a policy of
environmental irresponsibility,'' Gore said, in an implicit dig at
Bush during an official White House event on the loading floor of
the Alvan Motor Freight company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has preferred to more subtly criticized
Bush, sometimes without even mentioning his name.
</P>
<P>
   But from here on in, there will be little mistaking the intent
and intensity of Gore's words as the campaign hones in on what they
like to call ``the mess in Texas.''

   BOSTON _ On Sunday, April 30, the 25th anniversary of the fall
of Saigon, The Boston Globe will publish a 20-page special Vietnam
retrospective. Included in the package, to move in advance on
Thursday, April 27, with photos, a map and graphics, are:
</P>
<P>
   --A lead essay by Globe Editorial Page Editor H.D.S. Greenway,
and five additional ``postcards'' from Vietnam and Cambodia which
serve as the narrative spine of the section. Greenway covered
Vietnam regularly from 1967 to 1975 for both Time magazine and The
Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and
author David Halberstam, who writes about why Vietnam has been so
stubborn in lingering in the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   --An exclusive commentary by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Neil
Sheehan, who argues that Vietnam actually helped America because it
made us less willing to become the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   --An overview by Globe Deputy Managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr.
describing Vietnam today.
</P>
<P>
   --Four retrospective essays by Americans who had a range of
experiences -- from fighting in the war to going to Canada to evade
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   --A feature on the war's impact on the arts, which led to its
own genre of books, movies and music that changed the American
culture.

A MAP TO WHERE?

<P>
   President Clinton recently posed questions with long-term
consequences: hen the full sequencing of the human genome is
announced in a few months, he asked, what will be the implications?
How did it come to be? And where are we going from here?
</P>
<P>
   These are valid questions, which scientists working on the
genome have themselves been posing and, to the extent they can,
answering. There is general agreement that actual announcement of
the completed sequencing of the blueprint of human life will be
less a eureka moment than a PR one. Wisdom will be found among
those who can give the event its proper weight. The rival public
and private teams doing the sequencing of a small number of
randomly chosen and unnamed volunteers' 80,000 to 100,000 genes
will undoubtedly squabble over who has really achieved what, and
with what degree of accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   And the finish line is really a starting line, as far as making
actual use of the completed body of knowledge is concerned. The
effort to map and sequence all the human genes began 10 years ago
after scientists decided it made more sense than the piecemeal
identification of genes up to that time. Even before then,
scientists had isolated genes with mutations that caused
devastating diseases like cystic fibrosis and Huntington disease _
but those discoveries still have not led to better treatments. One
industry official has compared the hoopla over which team first
completes the genome sequencing to runners elbowing to see which
gets the first two steps in a race of 90 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the implications for completing what has been called
biology's equivalent of the periodic table are enormous.
Ultimately, this knowledge holds out the promise that medicine will
be able to tackle the wide range of diseases with a genetic basis
by rectifying defective genes or replacing missing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Just how difficult that can be was demonstrated last year by the
death of an 18-year-old boy with a rare genetic disease of the
liver. In a University of Pennsylvania experiment, researchers used
a virus as a transporter of a normal gene, but the virus
overwhelmed the youth's system and caused his death. So far, while
there have been promising experiments with gene therapy, it has yet
to produce an approved medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of an individual's genetic makeup could, however,
improve the use of conventional medicines. Each year, an estimated
100,000 Americans die from adverse reactions to prescribed drugs _
some of which could be predicted from genetic tests. Such scanning
would also let doctors know what form of chemotherapy might work
best for a cancer patient.
</P>
<P>
   Short of preventing or curing disease, knowing the genetic code
can _ and already has _ aided in the predicting of disease. This is
especially beneficial in the case of genetic markers for
conditions, such as a metabolic disorder that causes mental
retardation, that can be identified early on and avoided by
specific diets or lifestyle changes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a downside to knowing from genes the diseases
an individual is likely to face: possible discrimination by
employers or insurers. Craig Venter, the CEO of the Celera company,
which is racing the public team to finish the genome sequencing,
has deplored the sketchiness of state and federal laws banning or
strictly regulating such discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial of all the brave-new-world
implications of the genome sequencing is the potential it raises
for parents _ and by extension the human race itself _ to
manipulate the genes of coming generations. Even if this is done
only to avoid diseases, there are pitfalls: The gene that causes
sickle-cell anemia also protects against malaria.
</P>
<P>
   But the temptation will be great to fiddle with genes to
predetermine all kinds of babies' characteristics, from height to
nose length. There is a whiff of this in those ads placed by
infertile couples in Ivy League newspapers seeking women egg donors
with high SAT scores. Even though 99.9 percent of all genes are
unvaried from one person to the next, that 0.1 percent offers
opportunities for a great deal of mischief, well-intentioned or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Other implications of the genome sequencing are a question mark.
As Venter has noted, when electricity was first mastered, no one
predicted it would lead one day to the personal computer. President
Clinton was right to call for a discussion of the issues raised by
genome sequencing; his successors _ and the nation as whole _ will
have to do more than just talk about them.

A DEFINING MOMENT AT FOXBORO STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As we sat there this week watching the video sweeping
us into new $325 million Foxboro Stadium on the wings of reality,
my mind shot back to the opening days of its predecessor, the
former Schaefer Stadium, a marvel of modern construction at a cost
of $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference 29 years can make. The next new stadium for
only $319 million more. But as fancy-schmancy as it's going to be,
it will never open with the same drama produced on Saturday, Aug.
28, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Super Flush. Perhaps the critical day in Patriots history.
</P>
<P>
   There we were, your humble servant and a handful of others,
suddenly called upon to save the franchise. It wasn't easy, even
though we still had our own teeth and hair in those days. Reaching
back with every ounce of strength and stamina to save the stadium
from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember what happened?'' said Bob Marr, former Patriots
president, whose brother, Dan, was the stadium's prime mover. How
could I forget? I was one of the heroes of Super Flush, but I'll
continue to be humble and let Bob Marr tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had played the first game ever in the stadium two weeks
before against the New York Giants and we had a disaster,'' he
said. ``At half, when the people went to the restrooms, the urinals
and toilets wouldn't work. We didn't have enough water pressure in
the stadium to make them work properly. You can just imagine the
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the Patriots were due to host the Los Angeles
Rams in another preseason game. The state board of health
threatened to call off the game unless it could be assured the
urinals and toilets would work. On Saturday noon, on a boiling hot
day, a couple of sportswriters, a few owners' sons, and one or two
Patriot locker room employees were suddenly caught up in Super
Flush.
</P>
<P>
   The two people from the board told the Patriots the game had to
be canceled unless the team could demonstrate that the pressure
would work under pressure. Then someone came up with an insane
idea: Let's try to simulate what would happen at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it might have sounded reasonable _ if we had a person for
each of the nearly 500 stalls. But there were only seven or eight
of us. Nevertheless, we pushed on.
</P>
<P>
   It was decided that Super Flush would work this way: All of us,
standing in front of the main office building, at the word from the
state, would rush to assigned bathrooms, then, waiting for another
signal, would rush up and down, flushing our little heads off as
fast as we could.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a dozen of us were supposed to do the work of hundreds
and then return to home base.
</P>
<P>
   Back we came, sweaty, gamey, but flushed with the glow of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said the state employees, telling us they weren't
quite sure of their readings.
</P>
<P>
   About that time the rest of us were sure we'd like to kill the
two of them. But they were professional state employees. They stood
in the shade and gave orders while the rest of us hauled butt and
flushed.
</P>
<P>
   Back we went up the hill again, racing to our destinations, and
running madly through the empty restrooms, hearts pumping (even if
the toilets weren't) and wrists aching.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all worth it. The state gave the OK. The game could
go on. Some 53,000 could be entertained, feeling assured that they
could relieve themselves at the appropriate moments. But the day
didn't turn out that great. The Rams whacked the Patriots, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized then we had a big problem,'' said Marr. ``The
system in the stadium, as it was, wasn't going to work. So we had
to spend another $250,000 and build the big water tank down there
in a hurry. Once we did it, that solved the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. There were other problems. For example, when Roman
Gabriel, a lanky 6-foot-4-inch quarterback for the Rams, went to
use a urinal in the visiting locker room, he came back and offered
to his teammates, ``These guys must have one of the biggest teams
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The urinals in the visiting locker rooms had been placed too
high by the construction workers and had to be redone.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19 came the season opener and a stunning victory for
the Patriots over the powerful Oakland Raiders. The Patriots,
behind a rookie named Jim Plunkett, rolled to a 20-6 victory. As
the fallen Raiders lamented their loss, some pipes burst in their
locker rooms, dumping you know what on some of the players.
</P>
<P>
   It was later discovered somebody, allegedly unhappy that
nonunion workers had been employed during construction, threw
planks and boulders into the pipes before they were sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's a prediction: Things will not go as smoothly as we
think from here on in with the beautiful (and it is a great-looking
stadium) facility in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the off-site parking lot owners are threatening a
boycott this year. They say they may close their lots or not even
apply for licenses because they feel they are being taxed too much
by the state to help defray the $70 million the state is putting
into the project for infrastructure. I'm told there are 8,000
off-site parking spots and the owners are being charged $50 per
spot, per year, by the state, which they think is too much.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I'm told, that even though the ``squatters'' (no pun
intended) are selling their homes in the trailer park at the back
of the property, there are a handful that are holding out and who
might try to make a noisy last stand. Reportedly, several of them
have guns and can be heard practicing. Who knows? We may have
another standoff. Talk about fanfare. The stadium can open with a
shootout. It would beat a flyover, any day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stadiums, the Red Sox say they will hand over their
financial plan to the city and state within two weeks. I'll believe
it when I see it. But when it comes, the fun will be to see which
politician runs for cover the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   If I were running the Red Sox, I'd be dealing with the City of
Revere already, trying to get a park built on Suffolk Downs
property on the East Boston line. If Boston doesn't think it's a
big deal, build it somewhere else and let the politicians explain
about how downtown Boston became a wasteland when the Sox pulled
out of town. Baltimore, Cleveland, and Detroit were all dying
downtown, and built stadiums to revitalize those cities. Bob Kraft
has to be on the hook for $325 million to build the stadium in
Foxborough. When the Red Sox' plan comes out, they will want to put
up $350 million to build a new Fenway Park, which is more than any
other team, in any other sport, has ever put up to build a stadium
_ and they're going to get a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's my spin on Pat Burns. The Bruins realized how popular he
was with the media and fans, while at the same time weren't pleased
with the team's style of play. In the meetings with Burns, team
president Harry Sinden emphasized that if Burns was going to coach
the final year of his contract, then Burns would have to switch
from his defensive-minded approach to an aggressive, offensive
game. Obviously, Burns and Sinden thought they could coexist with
their agreement on how things are going to be done next season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The talent hunt for the Bruins and Celtics: The hockey team will
look for another defenseman, most likley in free agency. And
they'll probably draft a young defenseman with their first pick in
the draft, seventh overall. With Ray Bourque gone, the Bruins have
to find another defenseman who can step in and play right away.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will be looking to draft a big guard who can be a
stopper on defense. Kenny Anderson and Paul Pierce, excellent
offensive players, can't get it done on the defensive end. However,
getting this type of guard in the draft is not going to be easy.
Celtics top scout Leo Papile thinks there'll be at least 11 good
players in the draft. So, depending on where the Celtics select
(and they'll draft no lower than No. 11), a good player should be
on the board.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL personnel types think that the Patriots' top pick,
Adrian Klemm, has a chance to be an excellent pass-blocking
offensive tackle, but question whether he will be a good run
blocker. Klemm played in a run-and-shoot offense at the University
of Hawaii last season. But the Patriots say the previous year, when
he played in a run-oriented offense, he showed he had the potential
to be a good run blocker. Others say their second pick, J.R.
Redmond of Arizona State, is a third-down back. But Colts general
manager Bill Polian doesn't agree. ``Redmond is a power runner,''
he said. ``He can run through people. He's an every-down back, as
far as I'm concerned, and a good one. I couldn't believe he stayed
on the board until the third round. So I think it's a heck of a
pick for New England.''

SPECIAL STATUS OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fannie Mae, the giant company created by the
government decades ago to help make mortgages available to home
buyers, is no stranger to hardball politics or high-stakes finance,
having established itself as a power to be reckoned with both in
Washington and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder owned but federally chartered, it is an odd hybrid
that dominates the business of channeling money between lenders and
Wall Street by buying mortgages and packaging them into securities.
Its chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, is a former White House
budget director whose name has been floated by Vice President Al
Gore's presidential campaign as a possibility for the No. 2 spot on
the Democratic ticket, and its executives have close ties to both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's very size and clout have now put it in the
middle of a firestorm. Together with several smaller
government-chartered corporations, Fannie Mae could soon supplant
the federal government as the benchmark for creditworthiness in the
bond market, a possibility that has already set off emotional
sparring between the company and the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials are not the only ones raising questions about
Fannie Mae's special status. In recent weeks, the company has also
been fighting a bitter war of words with a powerful Republican
lawmaker while simultaneously fending off a lobbying assault by its
biggest and best-heeled business rivals.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the fight is over whether Fannie Mae and its
smaller cousin in the mortgage finance business, Freddie Mac,
should continue to enjoy special benefits conferred on them by the
government in the name of making home buying more affordable for
low- and middle-income people. Those benefits directly or
indirectly give Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an edge in raising money
at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Their purely private-sector competitors in the housing finance
industry say the situation is unfair. Sensing that Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac may be politically vulnerable, a coalition of banks,
mortgage companies and trade groups has mounted a well-funded and
unusually aggressive offensive in Congress seeking to limit the
ability of the so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs,
to use their advantages to expand into related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, called FM Watch, includes General Electric's GE
Capital, Chase Manhattan, American International Group, Wells Fargo
and many financial services industry trade groups. The members fear
that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are intent on using their
government-provided advantages to move into businesses like
financing mortgages for people with questionable credit histories,
selling mortgage insurance and making loans directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to ensure that the GSEs perform their original
mission, which is to provide liquidity in the secondary market and
that they do not compete unfairly in markets that private
enterprise is already adequately serving,'' said W. Mike House, FM
Watch's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Fannie Mae say they are not getting into any new
lines of business but are simply making mortgages available to more
people, exactly what the government intended them to do. They
derisively refer to the new group opposing them as ``the coalition
for higher mortgage costs'' and promise to fight back against what
they see as a plea from their competitors for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of what I believe to be the most concerted effort
I've seen in 20 years around Washington by a group of really big
companies to use the political process to try and make a buck,''
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the competitive tussle, there is a far-reaching
public policy issue: whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have grown
so big and deeply entrenched in the nation's financial system that
their ill-defined relationship with the federal government poses
the risk of a taxpayer bailout if they were to run into financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a strong political consensus that the success
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have had in making mortgages available
at the lowest possible cost to millions of home buyers has far
outweighed any potential risks. Now, though, both the
administration and Congress seem intent on at least taking another
look at the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential benefits that GSEs bring to a particular market
must be balanced, therefore, against potential risks to the
financial system and potential effects on market competition,''
Gary Gensler, the under secretary of the Treasury for financial
markets, told a Congressional subcommittee last month.
``Reconsideration of this balance is appropriate from time to time
and as financial conditions change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the financial markets, Gensler's carefully hedged words were
considered a coded suggestion that the government wanted to sever
its ties to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Treasury Department
backtracked a few days later, saying its basic policy toward the
companies had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime the entire bond market was roiled, and
Timothy Howard, the chief financial officer of Fannie Mae, publicly
called Gensler's testimony ``irresponsible,'' a statement that he
later said he regretted.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp reaction in the bond market was in large part a
function of forecasts that Fannie Mae and the other such
enterprises would within three years have more debt outstanding
among investors and financial institutions than the U.S. Treasury.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are raising money to finance their rapid
expansion, while the Treasury is paying down the national debt as
the government runs big budget surpluses. If the surpluses continue
to materialize as projected, the national debt will be paid off by
2013, meaning there would be virtually no more Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Making the issue of particular interest to investors is the very
real possibility that the debt securities of Fannie Mae and those
other enterprises will replace the Treasury bond as the national or
even worldwide benchmark for low-risk debt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Treasury debt, the debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac to help finance mortgages is not backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government. But investors have long perceived
that the government has made an unwritten commitment to treat
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as too big to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Although the implicit guarantee has not been tested _ and indeed
is explicitly contradicted in the offering documents for the debt
the companies sell _ it has nonetheless generally allowed Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac to borrow money at lower interest rates than
any entity short of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In paying less to raise money than their purely private-sector
competitors in the banking, securities and housing industries,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have long had a built-in cost advantage.
Based on that advantage, the companies have been able to hold down
mortgage rates for home buyers _ and to enrich their own
shareholders and executives.
</P>
<P>
   If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on the benchmark role, it
would reinforce the perception among investors that the housing
companies are so vital to the financial system that the government
could never let them default.

</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Raines of Fannie Mae suggested that the
Treasury Department's expression of interest in reconsidering the
benefits and potential risks of government-sponsored enterprises
was motivated by a combination of ideological opposition to
government support for a company operating in the capital markets
and a reluctance to give up the influence it exerts in the markets
as the issuer of the benchmark security. (A day later, he called
back to say that he had no objection to ``the legitimate role of
the Treasury in asking questions about large financial institutions
and what role they may play in systemic risk.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gensler and other Treasury officials declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what steps, if any, Congress will pursue. But one
concern receiving particular attention is the heavy dependence
banks have on debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Banks are
permitted to make unlimited investments in the debt securities of
the enterprises, while banks can hold only limited amounts of debt
issues by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored enterprise debt also is counted as safer
than traditional corporate debt by regulators when they assess the
financial strength of banks. As a result, many banks have made such
debt a big part of their capital base, a situation that has left
some regulators and members of Congress speculating about the
implications for the financial system if Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
were to get into serious financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues are being raised in hearings by Rep. Richard
Baker, R-La., who is chairman of the House subcommittee that
oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   At a Banking Committee hearing earlier this month, Baker said he
was concerned about the risks that government-sponsored enterprises
would pose to the financial system in an economic downturn, and he
compared the companies to Long-Term Capital Management, the giant
hedge fund that rocked world markets when it nearly failed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he stressed that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were healthy
and profitable, Baker said that to ignore ``the potential impact of
a misstep'' by one or both of the companies was ``to flirt with a
potential disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the government-sponsored housing companies continue to
grow unchecked in size and influence, Baker said at the hearing,
the government might ultimately find itself on the hook for a
bailout that would be financed out of ``your constituent's
wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae quickly responded that the comparison to a high-risk
hedge fund was unfounded and that the company exceeded all
regulatory standards for financial strength.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the defense that his company had used successfully for
years, David Jeffers, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said a proposal
by Baker to tighten regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was
``going nowhere because it is anti-housing.''

LARGEST SWISS BANK SEEKING PIONEER FUNDS, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Switzerland's biggest bank is a leader in the bidding
for Pioneer Funds, sources close to the situtation said, as the
Boston mutual fund group faces investor pressure to find a buyer by
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The sources say Union Bank of Switzerland has taken the lead in
a bidding process that began in February, when Pioneer hired two
investment bankers to shop the 72-year-old firm. Pioneer is
expected to announce a buyer before its May 16 annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   UBS's U.S.-based asset management group is Brinson Partners Inc.
of Chicago, which oversees $359 billion for institutions and in
mutual funds. UBS Brinson has bought other small U.S. investment
managers and is often seen as a buyer of American fund groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer manages about $24.5 billion of assets and has a long
history as a ``value'' player, or a firm that buys beaten-up stocks
rather than the growth technology stocks that have been dominating
the market in recent years. Brinson manages both growth and value
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer declined to comment on the bidders. In a letter to
shareholders last week, the company said, ``. . .your board is very
encouraged by the expressions of interest received to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Lens Investment Management of Portland, Maine, an activist
investor group, has launched a proxy fight against Pioneer. It
suggests the fund group could fetch between $29 per share and $42
per share in a sale, or between $760 million and $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer shares closed last week at $23.3125, down 25 cents. The
shares have risen 48 percent since Jan. 1, fueled by the buyout
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that the upper end of the range Lens
suggests would be rich for a firm that has failed to grow
significantly while rivals have surged ahead in the bull market.
However, a source said Fleet Financial Group bid aggressively for
Pioneer and was edged out, as were other bidders, by UBS.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bennett, director of governance for Lens, said the
suggested sale numbers were reasonable based on deals done in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Lens, in addition to pushing for a sale of Pioneer, is looking
to replace half of the fund company's board with its own nominees.
Pioneer, in the letter to shareholders last week, urged investors
not to approve Lens's nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Other large investors are interested in seeing Pioneer sold.
Mario Gabelli's Gabelli Funds of Rye, N.Y., hold an 8.9 percent
stake in Pioneer, and he has said he's for a sale. Southeastern
Asset Management Inc. of Memphis owns 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's chairman, John F. Cogan Jr., holds 13.6 percent of the
shares.

NEVADA WEB REALTY SERVICE DISPUTES GOMEZ RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Nevada-based Internet real estate service is picking a fight
with a popular Web site rating service run by Gomez Advisors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On its own Web site, Gomez touts the ``rigorous methodology''
behind its surveys. But HomeSeekers.com Inc. of Reno says two Gomez
surveys of their site were riddled with factual errors that led to
a poor score.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent ranking, Gomez, based in Lincoln, Mass.,
rated HomeSeekers ninth out of 20 real estate Web sites it surved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of hate mail from investors'' after the first
negative report in March, said company spokeswoman Pamela Johnston.
And though she has no firm data on whether the report drove away
customers, Johnston feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   HomeSeekers hoped to boost its score by finding out exactly what
qualities Gomez looks for in a Web site. So HomeSeekers paid Gomez
$35,000 in order to gain access to the company's research tools and
data. But HomeSeekers chief engineer John Hensley says that Gomez
still refuses to reveal all of its rating criteria, making it
difficult for him to know what features of his site ought to be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unreasonable they won't show the criteria
they judge everybody on,'' said HomeSeekers' chief engineer, John
Hensley. ``Even to a paying customer they won't show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez spokeswoman Julie Ward dismissed the HomeSeekers complaint
as sour grapes from a disgruntled customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ranting,'' Ward said. She refused to comment further,
saying that because Gomez filed for a initial public stock offering
on Thursday, federal securities regulations forbid a detailed
discussion of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Web-site rankings are a notoriously subjective business, but
Gomez asserts that it bases its measurements on a set of
``consistent, objective, and replicable'' standards called Gomez
Scorecards. The company uses between 150 and 250 criteria for
judging a site's performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Hensley said that even after paying a subscription fee to
the company, Gomez would reveal only 35 of the criteria it uses. As
a result, he said, it was impossible for HomeSeekers to figure out
what it needed to do to get a better ranking.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the 35 criteria HomeSeekers was allowed to see,
Hensley claims some of them contained incorrect data about the
company. For example, Gomez said that the HomeSeekers site did not
include a mortgage payment calculator. In fact, the site does have
this feature. Hensley claims there are several other errors, each
of them tending to depress HomeSeekers' final score.
</P>
<P>
   For now, HomeSeekers is fighting back by publicly denouncing
Gomez' alleged inaccuracies. The company hopes the media attention
will make up for any bad publicity from the Gomez ranking. Asked
whether the company might take legal action against Gomez, Johnston
replied: ``At this time, we don't know.''

GORE HOLDS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE IN TWO MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., skedded earlier as GORE-TRUCKS)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ After two months of keeping his distance from
the journalists who travel with him, Vice President Al Gore held
his first news conference since Feb. 19 on Friday in this auto city
30 miles from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he held a news conference at all, speaking for 23
minutes, seemed more noteworthy than what he said.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his position on Elian Gonzalez, saying the boy's
family should be encouraged to get together and resolve the
dispute, declining to say whether he believed the Justice
Department should retrieve the boy from the home of his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have faulted him for not lobbying aggressively for
permanent trade relations for China, he said he had called ``a
bunch'' of members of Congress, but would not say how many or whom.
``And I've made some progress in my calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore credited the minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, for handling his disagreement with the administration's
view on the trade bill ``in a very classy way.''
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside political questions, saying, ``I am not a very
good political analyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not taken questions on the record from his traveling
press corps since Feb. 19 in Springfield, Mass. Chris Lehane, his
press secretary, said of the end of the drought Friday, ``We had
time on the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   So much time that during lunch aides rushed out to print up
buttons that said: ``I was at Al Gore's first general election
press conference,'' dated April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's Republican rival, holds
news conferences with his traveling press corps nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane insisted that Gore had not been avoiding reporters. ``We
make ourselves extremely accessible,'' Lehane said. ``We've given
hundreds of interviews during the course of this campaign and in
the last six weeks of this campaign to virtually every news
organization.'' Gore has held open meetings where he has taken
questions from voters.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore confidant, pointing to the lack of news conferences
during the primaries, said: ``We were in a very strong position and
it didn't make much sense to try to change the formula.'' But some
Gore aides have worried about tension building up with the press
courps, and campaign officials now assert that news conferences
will be held more regularly.

FEWER JOBLESS, MORE JOBS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts job creation continued at a brisk pace
last month, as the state's unemployment rate fell to 2.4 percent,
the fifth-lowest of any state.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training reported
Friday that a surge in hiring by construction and service
companies, a broad category that also includes software development
and consulting, more than offset job losses in the manufacturing
and trade industries.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in total employment of 1,200, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, pushed the jobless rate down from 3.1 percent in
February _ a steep 0.7 percentage-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' rate of joblessness ranks behind Iowa, New
Hampshire, South Dakota, and Connecticut. Nebraska and Vermont tied
Massachusetts, with 2.4 percent rates.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Winer, the state's chief economist, said such a large
decline for a single month is due in part to a statistical fluke.
Nevertheless, he said the state experienced its tenth consecutive
months of rising employment levels in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to add jobs at a strong pace,'' Winer said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' jobless rate is far below the national rate of
4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the state has increased employment by nearly 2
percent in a growing economy that has stretched its labor force to
its limits. Construction firms, due to a strong housing market and
work on the Central Artery/Tunnel project, hired 1,500 workers last
month. That resulted in a strong 7.7 percent rate of job growth
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Service companies last month gained 3,400 jobs, giving the
sector an annual growth rate of 3.2 percent. Driving that
performance was a 6.6 percent annual rate of job creation in the
high-tech, non-manufacturing industry.

   RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS (Moscow) _ In a display of unity that seeks to
put the United States on the diplomatic defensive, the Russian
Parliament on Friday handed President-elect Vladimir Putin his
third overwhelming vote in a week endorsing a major arms control
accord. At the same time, Russia's military and civilian leaders

arms race should Washington go ahead with plans to build a national
antimissile defense shield in violation of the 1972 treaty that
prohibits the development or deployment of such defenses. By

   BUSH-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) _ In an extraordinary retreat
from traditional Republican tenets, Gov. George W. Bush has in
recent weeks advocated an expansion of the federal role on programs
ranging from education to low-income housing to health care. And he
has made overtures to constituencies, like gays and gun-control
proponents, that have never been mainstays of his own party. Yet
what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the nine weeks
since the South Carolina primary, when he presented himself as an
unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal and social
conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about past
nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative
organization has aggressively spoken out against Bush. By Richard

   CUBAN-BOY (Washington) _ Fast running out of options, Attorney
General Janet Reno awaited word Friday from her law enforcement
agents in Miami on the best time for them to remove Elian Gonzalez
from his Florida relatives. But she could not give even his father
a timetable for their reunion. While Reno clung to hope for a
last-minute negotiated turnover, she held a surprisingly short,
15-minute meeting at the Justice Department with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, father of the 6-year-old Cuban boy whom Miami relatives
have refused to relinquish. ``I assured him that I would continue
working toward the goal of reuniting him with his child, but I also
told him that I could not commit to a particular course of action
or timetable,'' Reno said. Justice Department officials said that
key federal marshals and immigration agents were being positioned
in Miami outside the home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.

OBJECTIONS VOICED TO DEPICTION OF JEWS IN FAMOUS PASSION PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Western Christians, Saturday is the midpoint of a three-day
period freighted with enormous spiritual power. Friday was Good
Friday, which commemorated the crucifixion of Jesus, and Sunday
will be Easter, when believers proclaim his resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The story can be experienced anew each year, providing many with
a sense of spiritual renewal and a hope for society's
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, amid an increasing awareness of religious
pluralism, some may wonder how to declare faith in a theological
triumph, yet avoid sounding triumphalistic, at the expense of
others who do not share their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   That question would seem pertinent, given the coming debut of an
internationally famous cultural event, the passion play at
Oberammergau, a German village whose residents have regularly
staged a version of the biblical events surrounding the
crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   The play, performed about once a decade since the 1600s, will
open in May and run through summer, attracting thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Among invited guests will be Rabbi Leon Klenicki, director of
interreligious affairs at the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. He has long taken an interest in the event and, along with
others, has urged its organizers to remove anti-Jewish elements
from the script.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Klenicki said, the play ``reflected a sort of a
medieval view'' that blamed the Jewish people for the death of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The play's organizers began revisions in the 1980s, he said, and
important changes have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a report released by the league, Klenicki said that
while the organizers are to be congratulated on the revisions,
concerns remained, such as how the script depicts the Jews of
Jesus' time.
</P>
<P>
   Critical comments, Klenicki added, did not mean opposition to
staged portrayals of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. Instead,
he said, ``We are against a negative interpretation of Jews and
Judaism based on the passion of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, so too, he noted, was the Second Vatican Council of
the Roman Catholic Church. From an interfaith standpoint, the most
important of the council's reforms was its Declaration on the
Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, adopted in
1965. The statement deplored anti-Semitism and rejected the idea
that the Jews could be blamed for the death of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Orbis Books reissued a landmark history of the
council, ``Vatican Council II,'' by the Rev. Francis X. Murphy, who
reported on that event under the pseudonym Xavier Rynne. His
description of the debate over the declaration is a reminder of how
controversial the document was at the time, many years before the
Vatican would recognize Israel as a country.
</P>
<P>
   As for the play, it will be the subject of a book,
``Oberammergau: The Troubling Story of the World's Most Famous
Passion Play,'' by a Columbia University professor, James Shapiro,
to be published in May by Pantheon Books.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the Death Penalty
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic peace organization, Pax Christi USA, used the
occasion of Good Friday to call for the end of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the organization said that its ``unconditional
opposition'' to capital punishment was based on ``the gospel of
Jesus Christ and in the consistent ethic of life, which teaches
that all life is sacred from the moment it begins until its natural
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics who share that view have received encouragement from
church leaders. The American bishops published a statement against
capital punishment last year. More dramatic was the successful
effort by Pope John Paul II, while visiting the United States in
January 1999, to persuade Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri to commute
a convicted murderer's death sentence to life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the Resurrection
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, with 1.5 million
members, hoped to remind people that not all Christians celebrate
Easter this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That day will be Palm Sunday for 250 million Eastern Orthodox
Christians, who follow a different liturgical calendar than their
Western counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   To mark Orthodox Holy Week, Archbishop Demetrios, the
archdiocese's leader, released an encyclical on the theological
meaning of Christ's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the 15th chapter of the Apostle Paul's First Letter
to the Corinthians, the archbishop wrote: ``The flesh he assumed in
the incarnation, although sinless, was like our own, susceptible to
death; the flesh that he raised in his three-day resurrection is
splendid and powerful, for he graced the perishable with
imperishability and the corruptible with incorruption.''

IRANIAN WOMEN USE CREATIVITY TO EXERCISE FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 23) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ With the adroitness of a seasoned flier, Azar
Farahani hoists a heavy pack on her back and snaps a helmet on her
head. Slowly, she spreads a pink and yellow wind sail on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to run against the wind, feel the giant sail fill with
air, then glide down the barren mountain toward the high-rises of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy task in a black head scarf and ankle-length
cloak.
</P>
<P>
   But Farahani has devised a clever way to paraglide in the
cumbersome costume that all Iranian women must wear according to a
``fatwa,'' or edict, of the country's religious rulers.
</P>
<P>
   She has cut holes on both sides of her gown for the straps of
the wind sail's harness. Under her long black outfit, called a
``hijab,'' Farahani has pulled on a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``See!'' says the muscular 34-year-old, breaking into a
mischievous smile as she pulls a strap of the harness through one
of the holes and fastens the binding around her left thigh. ``I tie
this around my leg, and it holds the harness in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I showed them this, we convinced them we could fly with
the `hijab,''' Farahani adds, referring to government officials in
charge of women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   Like Farahani, many women in Iran are testing the limits of
their country's strict Islamic system and finding ways to loosen
the restraints.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1979 Islamic revolution, women were sidelined from
politics, barred from sitting as judges in courts of law and forced
to obtain their husbands' permission before leaving the country.
They covered themselves in mournful black and diligently hid every
wisp of hair. They were discouraged from wearing makeup and
strictly segregated from men.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise 1997 election of President Mohammed Khatami, a
reformist openly opposed by Iran's religious Old Guard, the
restrictions imposed on women began to ease amid a new atmosphere
of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many women dare to allow their veils to fall back slightly
to show some of their hair. Some wear lipstick and paint their
nails, then rush to wipe their lips and put on gloves if the
authorities known as the ``morals police'' arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that on the slopes north of Tehran where people go to
ski and to paraglide, authorities often turn a blind eye to the
absence of the ``hijab,'' as long as women cover their hair and
wear jackets that reach their knees. Some simply tuck their hair
inside knitted ski caps.
</P>
<P>
   The new climate of openness, many women say, has encouraged
government officials to accommodate their requests for small new
freedoms. Particularly in the ministry of culture, a stronghold of
Khatami supporters, they say they are finding receptive ears.
</P>
<P>
   When Farahani showed ministry officials last spring that she
could paraglide while wearing the ``hijab,'' for instance, she and
a few dozen other female fliers got permission to form the Tehran
Flying Women's Committee. Already, the group has 40 members.
</P>
<P>
   Malihe Saidi, one of Iran's best-known singers, used a similar
strategy to get her music back on the market. Barred from
performing for years because of a religious edict that prohibits
women from singing in public, Saidi last year discovered the
existence of another ``fatwa'' that worked in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   Women can sing in public, the edict said, as long as they are
part of a choir. Saidi, who teaches music at a girl's school in
Tehran, showed the ruling to the cultural minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, OK, I could sell my tapes in the market,'' Saidi
recalls. On the recording, her strong voice is clearly audible
above the background voices of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, too, have taken steps to aid women.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing Parliament, for instance, enacted a law that
increased the minimum amount of money that a man must pay his wife
for living expenses. Lawmakers also passed legislation allowing
divorced mothers to retain custody of young children a few years
before giving them up to their former husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Massoumeh Ebtekar, a woman who serves as one of Iran's vice
presidents as well as minister for the environment, points to the
measures as proof that the country is moving in the right
direction. ``A lot of practical steps have been taken to improve
the condition and the status of women,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian women overwhelmingly supported Khatami's bid for the
presidency, and their vote was key to his upset victory. He showed
his gratitude by appointing two female ministers to his Cabinet, a
move that, many say, helped encourage other women to enter
politics. In municipal elections last year, more than 300 women won
seats on local and regional councils.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Iranian women say that they have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Merengeez Karr, an attorney who was barred from practicing law
for five years after the revolution and now concentrates on family
and criminal cases, remains pessimistic about women's ability to
change a system that, she says, fundamentally discriminates against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constitution doesn't allow secular reformers to run in
elections. Only the religious can run,'' she says from behind a
desk cluttered with child custody and divorce cases. ``And
religious people don't believe in equality between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman, Karr notes, still cannot initiate divorce, except if
she can prove that her husband consistently beats her, abuses drugs
or commits a short list of other offenses. Under the custody laws
softened by Parliament, divorced women can keep their children only
until their sons turn 2 and their daughters become 7.
</P>
<P>
   A wife inherits one-eighth of her husband's cash estate and
cannot inherit his land, Karr says. Women can serve as judicial
assistants, but not judges. The legal age for female marriage is 9.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Karr, the previous Parliament passed legislation
that set women's rights back. One such measure prohibited
newspapers from publishing articles about female rights, if,
according to the law's vague wording, the report would create
conflict between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's rights are very complicated and involved with religion
here,'' Karr says. ``Even the reformers don't want to take on
traditional clerics on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many Iranian women say that the mandate to wear the
``hijab'' in some ways became liberating in the early days of the
revolution. Conservative Muslim families who otherwise might have
kept their daughters at home felt comfortable allowing them to work
and to study in the head-to-toe gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk on the street, and no one can touch me,'' says
Zahara Gambari-Nejat, a 20-year-old draped in an especially
concealing version of the ``hijab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other countries, they don't cover, but they can't walk down
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, university enrollment of women soared.
Today, more than 50 percent of the students attending college in
Iran are female.
</P>
<P>
   Covered by the ``hijab'' and segregated from men, women were
allowed to play sports. Female rowing teams, weight lifters and
basketball stars emerged. Hundreds of women became coaches and
referees. Since the revolution, Iran has hosted two all-female
Olympics for women from Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, liberal women such as Karr, whose own dark brown curls are
dutifully tucked under a loose scarf, see the mandatory ``hijab''
as a symbol of the restrictions placed on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all dressed in black,'' she says. ``Even color is
considered political in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But up in the mountains north of Tehran, Neda Jahashani, a
25-year-old wearing a bright yellow ski suit and a flowered green
head scarf, says the morals police don't always enforce the rules
these days. Once, she recalls, a policeman took a picture of her
and her boyfriend standing in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out with him,'' Jahashani boasts. ``We go dancing. We
gozz~?

NEW TRANSPLANT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, April 24, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great advances in medicine in recent decades has been
doctors' ability to transplant organs into patients who would die
without them. Unfortunately, there are never enough organs for
those who need them, and last year 4,800 patients died before a
transplant could save them.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors and health officials have long believed that fewer
patients would die on waiting lists if there were a better way to
distribute organs as they become available. The Clinton
administration took this to heart and last month invoked
regulations that make medical urgency more important than
geographic location in distributing organs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that had been in place, the country was divided
into 62 areas and 11 regions, and an organ was offered first to
patients within the donor's area and then region. This often meant
sicker patients elsewhere didn't have a chance at the organ, and
waiting times varied greatly from state to state. The
administration's more national distribution system makes better
sense and is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a motherhood and apple pie position, but it's
not. The old system tended to ensure a steady supply of organs for
the smaller transplant centers around the country. (There are 278
centers altogether.) A system based on medical urgency will steer
more organs toward the major centers, including Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen from districts with smaller centers helped pass a
House bill recently to block the new administration regulations. In
the Senate, the health committee last week passed a bill written by
Senators Edward Kennedy and Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee
who was a transplant surgeon before his election. Their measure
would let the Clinton administration regulations stand and would
set up a carefully crafted system for resolving organ-policy
disputes between the secretary of health and human services and the
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network board.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-Frist bill merits support as a way to make sure that
patients get the greatest possible benefit from the skills of
transplant surgeons and the generosity of donors.

   CHILDCARE (Washington) _ Child advocacy groups say the 1996 law
requiring welfare recipients to go to work is not providing enough
money for most of them to put their kids in day care. Only about 15
percent of the youngsters eligible for the federally funded care

more easily find out what's happening inside Iran. By DEBORAH

NEWS OUTLETS BARRED FROM WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL BECAUSE OF DEBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has been hopscotching the nation
and the world in the final year of his presidency, following a
frenetic schedule that shows no signs of letting up. But dozens of
news organizations have been barred from traveling along because of
outstanding debts, and the list may be growing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Travel Office has restricted organizations
ranging from the Weekly Standard to the national television network
of Chile from participating in official White House trips. The
debts, according to the White House, range from $4.31 owed by
Esquire magazine to $10,131.71 past due from a group named
I'talio-Americano.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to recover the money, the White House Travel
Office recently began to bill the news organizations that travel
regularly with the president for the nearly $74,000 in bad debt of
other media outlets. The plan was endorsed by the White House
Correspondents Association, a group of news organizations that
cover the White House, but some media outlets, including The
Washington Post and The New York Times, are balking at paying
others' bills.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has refused to pay $5,777.52, which the White
House says is its share of the other organizations' bad debt. The
White House has said that failure to pay the March 13 bill within
90 days may result in a newspaper being barred from future travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not our debts, and no one has explained to me why
we're responsible for the debts of other people,'' said Joseph
Lelyveld, the executive editor of The Times. He called the threat
to cut off The Times from presidential travel ``crude and almost
childish.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major outlets, including The Los Angeles Times and USA
Today, have opted to pay the debts. Susan Page of USA Today, the
outgoing president of the correspondents association, defended the
plan in a letter to news organizations last month. ``We believe
that this reallocation method represents an accurate and fair tool
to balance our books,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The news media pays its own way while trailing Clinton. A small
pool of reporters travels along on Air Force One while the rest of
the press corps flies on a separate press plane. The Travel Office,
which works with White House staff as well as the press, arranges
charter flights, hotel accommodations and other logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations on the bad debt list contend that Travel
Office billed them improperly. White House officials said they
would not discuss the billing.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, publisher of the Weekly Standard, said his
magazine had been challenging a White House charge of $504.97 since
1996, when a reporter traveled with the president to Jerusalem for
the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said the reporter, David Brooks, told the White House he
merely wanted to fly to and from Jerusalem on the press plane but
did not require any space in the press center the White House
typically sets up at presidential events, or any food or ground
transportation. But Brooks did hop on the press bus at the airport,
Kristol said, prompting the White House to bill him for all the
ground services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kristol said he had no idea his organization had been
barred from White House travel and was also unaware that the debts
were being passed along to other organizations. ``I'm totally
stunned,'' he said. ``I have heard nothing from the White House for
years about this.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent future bad debts, the Travel Office has instituted a
new policy that requires organizations that have never traveled
before to pay up front on costly foreign trips. Most of the
organizations that owe money are foreign media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Paying up front is the way White House travel was handled in
previous presidencies. But early in the Clinton administration,
presidential aides fired the seven-member Travel Office staff,
accusing them of financial mismanagement in their handling of press
trips and ordering a FBI investigation. The new office began
billing media organizations, which has proven to be a cumbersome
process.
</P>
<P>
   No fired workers were ever found guilty of any violations, and
the way the White House handled the matter was eventually
investigated by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr's
replacement, Robert Ray, is expected to issue a report on the
matter in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel investigation also has affected the
current situation with billing. The White House has said that Starr
subpoenaed Travel Office records and held them so long that some
bills were not paid. Among them is a $300,000 AT&AMP;T bill from early
in the president's first term that the telephone company has
subsequently reduced to about $100,000. Because of the long delay,
officials have said they are uncertain for which trips the phone
bill applies.

SAMUEL BLOCK, 60, CIVIL RIGHTS HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Calif., Vt.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Block, who was repeatedly beaten and imprisoned as he
fought for voting rights for blacks in his native Mississippi Delta
during the 1960s, died April 13 in his Los Angeles apartment, his
sister Margaret said. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Block said the cause of death remained undetermined, though
her brother was a diabetic and suffered from a number of maladies.
The family is arranging an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Block was a field secretary for the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which helped blacks register to
vote in the face of stiff opposition from whites. He brought raw
physical courage, limitless energy and a fine singing voice to the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   He became the point man for the registration effort in a key
battleground: Greenwood, Miss. Greenwood was a cotton trading
center where the racist White Citizens Councils maintained their
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Medgar Evers, leader of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People who was killed in 1963, had revoked
the charter of the local NAACP chapter because of its tepid
response to the infamous lynching of Emmett Till in Greenwood in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   In Block's first six months in Greenwood, Look magazine reported
in 1963, he managed to sign up only five black voters.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, after one of Block's arrests, a judge offered to
suspend his sentence if he would agree to stop working for the
SNCC, give up the voter registration project and leave town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge,'' Block replied. ``I ain't gonna do none of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Moses, an organizer for the SNCC who campaigned at
Block's side, sometimes in the face of gunshots, said the civil
rights workers faced a stark challenge in Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when you go into a place like that,'' he said,
``you become a flash point for the authorities' and local people's
anger and frustration. You're basically seen as responsible for
starting all this.''
</P>
<P>
   James Travis, who was shot in the head and neck as he drove a
car with several SNCC colleagues in Greenwood in 1963, called Block
``very smart'' and ``fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through a lot,'' Travis said. ``He was beaten and
jailed on many occasions. He was dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Theodore Block was born in July 1939 in Cleveland, Miss.
His father was a construction worker and his mother was a maid.
</P>
<P>
   Block's feisty nature was apparent in the ninth grade, when he
refused to take an IQ test at the segregated school he attended.
``He said it didn't have anything to do with our culture and the
way we lived,'' his sister Margaret said. As a result, despite a
brilliant academic record, he was forced to repeat the ninth grade
Ms. Block said her brother is still known as one of the best
drummers in the town. In high school he played with other students
in a group called the East Side Jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Air Force,
but asthma led to a medical discharge the next year. He studied
political science for two years at Marlboro College in Marlboro,
Vt., then transferred to Mississippi Valley State College in Itta
Bena, Miss., a traditionally black college. He was expelled for his
civil rights activities, Margaret Block said.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulty in these activities, even at a black college,
reflected the precipice on which civil rights campaigners were
forced to balance. Often, other blacks were reluctant to associate
with them for fear of reprisal. For another example, when Block
first arrived in Greenwood, he was forced to sleep in cars for four
months because no one would give him a bed, Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   His own family, however, supported the movement and let the
Freedom Riders fighting for equal access to transportation stay in
their house. The young Block became involved in the movement
through his friendship with Amzie Moore, owner of a Cleveland gas
station, who became a leading civil rights activist in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Taylor Branch in his 1988 book, ``Parting the
Waters: America in the King Years'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), Block
became a pivotal figure in Greenwood as the town's importance in
the civil rights struggle grew. Branch wrote: ``As the one SNCC
student who lived continuously in Greenwood during the nine months
of the registration project, Block had acquired a local reputation
as a stubborn, lonely figure among the strange new breed of devout
daredevils.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch continued: ``His seventh arrest in Greenwood was a
compelling topic of conversation while he stayed in jail over the
weekend. Some people had been won over by his sheer persistence,
others by his performances in the tiny mass meetings, where he led
call-and-response spirituals in a distinctively jaunty tenor,
marked by a hint of calypso syncopation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Travis was shot by someone in a Buick with no
license plates. The SNCC and other civil rights groups made
Greenwood their national focal point, and reporters from across the
country streamed into town. Dogs were unleashed to attack
demonstrators as scores of blacks flocked to the courthouse to try
to register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Seeger brought a young Bob Dylan to sing in Greenwood,
while Dick Gregory led marches. ``We will march through your
dogs!'' Gregory cried. ``And if you get some elephants, we'll march
through them. And bring on your tigers, and we'll march through
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of his life, Block continued to support civil
rights causes, and was planning to attend an SNCC reunion when he
died. He became active in business, manufacturing a sealant to fix
flat tires, nutritional supplements and other products. From 1984
to 1988, he was in federal prison after conviction on wire fraud
charges; he never disclosed their exact nature to family or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said Block's ultimate importance was in ``opening up''
Greenwood, one of the toughest struggles in the civil rights
movement. ``In the early years, the question was whether we could
get a beachhead,'' he said. ``That was the importance of the work
Sam did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that left another, deeper question. ``Once you got a
beachhead,'' Moses said, ``could you actually survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Block is survived by his brother, Oliver, of Dobbins, Calif.;
his sisters Margaret Block of Cleveland, Miss., Minnie Jane
Bankhead of New York City and Olivia Block of Puyallup, Wash.; a
daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce, Veronica Block of
Los Angeles, and one granddaughter.

NBA PLAYOFFS ARE REALLY THE TV PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA playoffs start today. We might have a new president
before the first round is over.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing _ nothing! _ but television considerations in mind,
the league has submitted schedules that are, in some cases, so
preposterous as to be laughable. The only problem is they're very
real, and people will be forced to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggeration? You decide. Let's take Indiana-Milwaukee. Game 1
is Sunday. Game 2 is Thursday. Los Angeles-Sacramento. The same.
Utah-Seattle. Game 2 is Monday. Game 3 is Saturday. New
York-Toronto. They've schdeuled 13 days for a five-game series,
with Game 3 on a Saturday and Game 4 (if) on the following Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about ratings. Forget the combatants. Forget the paying
customers. In the NBA's world view, it is far better that a guy in
Fargo, N.D., have a TNT or TBS doubleheader or an NBC tripleheader
just about each and every day or night than to do something that
might stimulate competition or serve the needs of the people who
actually have a direct rooting interest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the prickly matter of game times. All potential
Games 4 and 5 in the first round are listed as TBA. As far as the
local fans are concerned, the T and B might as well stand for
``Tough Bananas.'' And I've likewise got an idea what the A stands
for, if you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   This is pure panic on everyone's part. Yes, the NBA is a damaged
product. It is not delivering the goods for its national television
broadcast partners. But God forbid that anyone accept that in the
world of sport, life can be cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   In saner, simpler times, people were reconciled to the concept
of booms and busts. Attendance didn't go up (itals)every(unitals)
year. General interest fluctuated, mostly according to Ws and Ls.
But no matter what was going wrong, management always tried to act
in the best interests of the local paying customers, who were
perceived to represent the so-called bread and butter of the
operation, and you messed with them at your peril. If you had to
submit a somewhat convoluted playoff schedule it was for one reason
only: you had an arena conflict of some sort. You would do the best
you could and you'd make sure to apologize for any inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   But the league has already abadoned the traditional fan,
blasting him or her out of the building with raucous rock music
while steadily bombarding everyone with flying T-shirts and inane
games of all description. The NBA no longer trusts its product,
and, of course, the game really isn't as good as it once was, for a
reason no one wishes to acknowledge. (Hint: It begins with an ``E''
and it results in there being too many people in the league who
don't belong there.)
</P>
<P>
   Now it just so happens that there is a slight sliver of blue up
there in the NBA's clouds. There are some appealing young stars,
but none of them are Michael, Magic, or Larry, so it will take time
for them to catch on with the public. People will find them at
their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA wants to catch up to where it was when it had the 76ers,
Celtics, Lakers, Bad Boys, and Michael, but it doesn't have the
patience to allow nature to take its course. That's what happens
when you sell your soul to television. People have got to believe
there is a viable product, and the post-Michael/Magic/Larry NBA has
not yet earned their complete trust. All these scheduling
machinations won't have any effect, anyway. As Yogi Berra would
say, ``If people don't want to watch, you can't stop 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   But we know how these TV fools think. If the ratings for the
first round go up by so much as half a point, the assumption will
be that all their clever scheduling was the reason. This will, of
course, be nonsense, since no one really knows the whys of viewing
habits, any more than anyone really knows how many really are
watching anything, anyway, ratings being the single greatest myth
in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   What (itals)will(unitals) matter are entertaining games and
spirited series. But how can Indiana-Milwaukee be a passionate
series when Game 1 is on a Sunday and Game 2 is on a Thursday; and
when Game 4 (if) is on a Monday and Game 5 (if) is on a Thursday?
Way to stoke those fires, guys.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm not mistaken, we used to have playoff series around here.
And, as I recall, the most emotional series were always bang-bang
affairs. Nothing kept the pot stirred better than those
back-to-backs, or those Friday night-Sunday afternoon turnarounds.
You were really (itals)into(unitals) it, and I'm talking about
fans, media, team executives, ushers, ballboys, and even the
referees, not to mention the players. You will find none of that in
the NBA of 2000. You'll have people walking around town after town
saying, ``Who are we playing, anyhow? It's been so long since we've
had a game. Geez, maybe it's over, and I missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   How smart do you have to be to understand that the product
should always come first, not the packaging? They can stretch the
first-round series out for a month and put on one game a night, and
they can offer to pay everyone who watches it, oh, I dunno, $5, and
it still won't matter in the long run if the game reeks. If I were
the NBA, I'm not sure I'd want (itals)anyone(unitals) to watch
Miami-Detroit. I'd consider handing out blindfolds to the people in
attendance. I'd schedule doubleheaders at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Attention, David Stern: Your league was a little more
entertaining this season, but it is still in an artistic recession,
OK? Accept it. Deal with it. Use your influence to make sure teams
hire coaches who will recognize that the stated object of the game
is to put the ball in the basket, not merely prevent the other team
from doing it. Basketball isn't different than any other sport.
Offense sells tickets. Tinker with the rules as much as necessary
in order to promote offense. But have a little patience. Trust your
game. It can come back. It (itals)will(unitals) come back. But The
Supremes told us you can't hurry love, and I'm here to tell you
that you can't hurry up the fans, either. Give them a little time.
</P>
<P>
   But just who am I talking to? The David Stern I used to know
would never have to be told what was right and what was wrong. This
David Stern, I fear, is a total captive of television. How sad. How
destructive. How foolish.

CUBANS RECALL SEPARATION FROM PARENTS IN 1960S 
</HEADLINE>

 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was 1961, in the nascent days of the Castro
revolution, and 10-year-old Michael Musa stood in the Havana
airport, waiting to board an airplane for the United States, not
knowing if he would ever see his parents again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before I got on the plane, I saw my father walk away to
hide, so I couldn't see him,'' said Musa, now a 49-year-old
business executive in Indianapolis. ``But I did see him. He was
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1960 and 1962, some 14,000 Cuban children were spirited
out of the communist nation in what was known as Operation Pedro
Pan. Administered by Catholic Charities, with aid from the U.S.
government, it was said to be the largest exodus of unaccompanied
children from any nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now the case of Elian Gonzalez has loosed a flood of memories
and emotions for the alumni of Pedro Pan, people who long ago
blended into the fabric of everyday American life.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Musa, who was eventually reunited with his
family, and Rafael Pavelo, a 52-year-old social worker in Chicago
whose parents were never able to emigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Cuban parents believed they were sending their
children to America for only a few months, to keep them out of
harm's way until Fidel Castro fell from power and life returned to
normal in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The children were housed temporarily in camps in Miami, and then
sent to foster families around the United States. Most were
teen-agers, but some were as young as 3 or 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a man in Miami drawing a sketch on paper of the
United States, and showing me Indiana,'' said Musa, whose voice
still breaks with emotion as he revisits the memories. ``I had
never heard of Indiana. But he pointed at it and told me, `That's
where you're going.'''
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his sister, Maria, who was 6, were placed in
Indianapolis with a family who did not speak Spanish. Six months
later, the Musa parents made their way to Indiana, where they
started a new life. But about half the young Cubans who were
evacuated to the United States never again lived with their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fate of Pavelo, who was 13 when he was sent to
Miami. Soon after, he was sent to a seminary in Costa Rica, where
it became clear to him that the promised reunion might never take
place.
</P>
<P>
   For Musa, the president of a division of Ameritech, ties to Cuba
have been eclipsed by his identity as a suburban family man in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me what I am, I will tell you that most of all I am
a Hoosier,'' Musa said, referring to the old nickname for residents
of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   As he watches the highly publicized custody battle over
6-year-old Elian _ with the boy's father and other relatives
fighting over whether the boy returns to Cuba or stays in the
United States _ Musa said he shakes his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy should be with his father,'' Musa said. ``It's a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a view shared by others who came to the United States in
the Pedro Pan operation, a stance vehemently opposed by many
Cuban-Americans in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami Cubans, they either came to the United States with
their families or were reunited with them very quickly,'' Pavelo
said. ``They don't understand. It's a very different situation when
you're talking about taking a boy away from his parent.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in the seminary, he recalled, he received a letter from
his mother. The stationery was stained with tears. And the envelope
held a lock of her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember holding her hair in my hand and crying,'' said
Pavelo, who fought vainly to hold back tears as he recounted the
experience. ``I missed my family so much.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the months after he was sent to the United States, Pavelo
said, his parents began to blame each other for the decision to
send the boy away. Within two years, they divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The fears of Cuban parents at the time were largely driven by
rumors that the Castro government would take all children away from
their families, enroll them in camps and indoctrinate them with a
philosophy that the state was more important than the family. In
fact, the Cuban government had taken many children out of urban
schools and sent them to the countryside in a literacy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Pedro Pan operation unfolded around Christmas 1960, when a
homeless Cuban refugee child appeared in the office of the Rev.
Bryan Walsh, who was the director of Catholic Charities in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban-American man had taken the boy to Walsh and asked if he
could help find a home for him and also help a handful of other
children who had been sent from Cuba. Walsh agreed to help, and
soon word got back to parents in Cuba about the priest in Miami who
would look after young refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of children arriving in Miami grew, Walsh sought
help from the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Walsh, who was born in Ireland, said the U.S. government agreed to
waive the visa requirement for the children, as long as an agency
outside government, like Catholic Charities, administered the
program in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The aid was expanded after President John F. Kennedy took
office. Father Walsh said the flights were often financed by U.S.
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest share of refugees came from Catholic schools in
Cuba. But Walsh said at least 500 of the children were Protestant
or Jewish. The Protestant children were taken by United Way, and
the Jewish children were turned over to the Hebrew Emigrant Aid
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all word of mouth,'' said the priest, now 72, a
monsignor who has retired from charity work. ``When the children
arrived, they were very often frightened and confused.''
</P>
<P>
   He said about 60 percent of the refugees were teen-age boys. All
of the children were supposed to have been at least 6 years old but
some were considerably younger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the resettlement, Musa said he was amazed at how
quickly he and his sister had assimilated, even before their
parents arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good life,'' he said. ``There were no other
Latin-Americans in the neighborhood, but most things _ playing,
going to school, listening to the nuns _ were really not that
different than they had been in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he bore a heavy weight in the first six months, worrying
about his parents in Cuba, in a way that his younger sister did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a world of difference between the way I looked at
things as a 10-year-old, and the way my sister looked at things as
a 6-year-old,'' he said, noting that Elian is also 6. ``For my
sister, it was all kind of an adventure. For me, I quite clearly
understood what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time that he waited for his parents to arrive in the
United States, he said, he never fully unpacked his suitcase. His
mother had folded his clothes, and he did not want to disturb any
lasting touch of her hands on the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept all the letters sent from Cuba by his parents. But
he cannot bring himself to open the envelopes and read them again.
Reading those letters, he said, would put him back in the shoes of
a little boy in a strange country, terrified that he might never
again see his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll read them,'' he said, ``one of these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearing 50, he is not ready quite yet.

SOFTWARE CAN'T MAKE SCHOOL SAFE

   PHILADELPHIA _ Imagine a software program that would let schools
predict which students will commit acts of horrific violence.
Imagine a program that could have spotted Dylan Klebold and Eric
Harris, the gunmen who attacked Columbine High School a year ago,
before they could act. If it sounds too good to be true, that's
because it is.
</P>
<P>
   Yet school administrators and parents across the country have
been led to believe that software called Mosaic-2000 will do just
this. Visitors to the Web site of Gavin de Becker Inc., which
developed Mosaic and licenses it to schools, find a button labeled
``Preventing School Shootings'' leading them to details about the
software.
</P>
<P>
   Mosaic was not developed through a recognized scientific
procedure, nor has its validity as a risk predictor been tested by
objective evaluators. A group of people hired by Gavin de Becker,
the personal security consultant and best-selling author, generated
a list of variables that they saw _ based on their experiences in
law enforcement, corporate security, education and psychology _ as
likely to predict which students posed the greatest risk.
Conspicuously absent from the primary development team were any
leading researchers in risk prediction. Such professionals know
that we simply cannot predict violent acts before they occur.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, the number of school-age children who died
from homicide averaged around 2,500 a year. But fewer than half of
1 percent of them were killed in or around schools. Let's say, for
argument's sake, that each of these incidents involved a student
perpetrator. In a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the
dozen or so students a year who might commit murder is like looking
for a needle in a haystack the size of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger problem with software is the almost certain
mislabeling of perfectly innocent children as dangerous (or, as the
Mosaic folks would say, ``in need of intervention'').
</P>
<P>
   If software identified only one student in every school as at
risk for committing a homicide, it would be wrong for about 89,990
kids each year. Even if the prediction were broader _ identifying
risk for any act of serious violence _ the program would be wrong
in the vast majority of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site says Mosaic ``helps evaluate situations, not
students.'' But its evaluations are based largely on information
about individuals and are intended to ``identify those students
most in need of the interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   How large is the downside of the false positive problem? It
depends on how school officials would act. But even the most
well-intentioned of reactions raise serious concerns. Do schools
have the right to brand a student as dangerous just because he
satisfies a set of criteria that have never been scientifically
validated? To worry parents that their child might be dangerous? To
force a child to attend ``anger control'' classes?
</P>
<P>
   No software could have predicted the Columbine massacre.
Sensible gun control policies and expanded mental health services
for troubled children would do far more good than any false sense
of high-tech security.

LAWYER AUCTION IN AN AUCTION TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For two months the federal judge presiding over
mountains of litigation against the auction giants Sotheby's and
Christie's knew that he faced a thorny problem: how to select the
lawyers from at least 25 firms across the country to lead the
growing class-action suit charging the two houses with
price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he came up with an answer. Hold an auction.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan issued
a court order Friday in which he invited all the lawyers
representing the approximately 40 plaintiffs so far to submit
secret bids by May 12 to determine who will manage the plaintiff's
case, a prize that could be worth millions. The judge appointed an
interim team of six lead lawyers on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The bids are to list a maximum amount of recovered money that
the lawyers would be willing to see go entirely to the plaintiffs.
For any recovery beyond that, the lawyers are to list a fee that
they would take in full. If the recovery exceeds the sum of both of
these, the lawyers would get one-quarter of the additional amount
with the rest going to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, experts said, the lawyers have an incentive to offer a
maximum financial recovery to their clients at a minimal legal fee.
If the recovery is exceptionally large, the lawyers would make much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's innovation, experts said, was the formula that
increases legal fees as the recovery increases.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the plan relied on the kind of free-market
competition that Sotheby's and Christie's are accused of subverting
by colluding on fees and commissions charged to buyers and sellers
since 1993. The houses are also being investigated by federal
antitrust prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not promise to select the low bidder but ``which
bidder is likely best to serve the interests of any class that may
be certified, taking into account the economic terms of bids as
well as qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Such bargaining to limit lawyers fees in class-action suits has
occurred in several previous cases, but Kaplan wrote that his
bidding process ``never has been used as far as the court is
aware.''
</P>
<P>
   He invited comments from the interim lead lawyers, who are
likely to argue against changing lawyers now, and even from
outsiders, and he said that if the plan drew significant opposition
he might scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew K. Niebler, a Washington lawyer whom the judge cited
as an expert on lead counsel auctions, applauded the new formula.
``This is really an important advance for better aligning the
interests of the class members and plaintiffs' class counsel,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The formula also won high marks from at least one plaintiff's
lawyer who had been prepared to drop out of the case, feeling, as
he said, that ``other guys carved it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked late Friday if he had heard of the order, that lawyer,
Stephen Susman of Houston, said, ``No, but I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way judges ought to do it,'' he said. ``Pick the
lawyers who offer the most reasonable deal to the class.'' Now, he
said, ``we'll definitely be back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The six interim lead lawyers have not responded to calls. They
are Frederick P. Furth, Stanley M. Grossman, Michael D. Hausfeld,
Robert N. Kaplan, Christopher Lovell and Robert A. Skirnick.
</P>
<P>
   In another decision Friday, the judge rejected Christie's
contention that there was no basis for the lawsuit and commented,
``Certainly the interim lead counsel and their clients are capable
of pursuing the litigation in an appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   One effect of the formula, the experts said, is to reduce the
attractiveness to the plaintiffs' lawyers of a quick settlement,
for which they might ordinarily do little work but get a big fee.
</P>
<P>
   There are no set fees in class-action cases. Judges commonly
award lawyers 10 to 30 percent, but the lawyers do not know the
amount going in, creating uncertainties for lawyers and clients
alike.
</P>
<P>
   In class-action suits, where many plaintiffs sue collectively,
lawyers often designate the lead members themselves and the judge
approves them. Lead counsels shoulder the bulk of the work and also
commonly reap the largest fees.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan assured the lawyers that if he decided not to go ahead
with his bidding formula, he would not reveal the bids. He also
ordered them not to discuss their positions among themselves or try
to rig their bids.

ARGENTINA HOLDS 14 OFFICERS IN BEATING OF LABOR DEMONSTRATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Fourteen police officers have been
arrested for beating 35 union supporters and shooting another at a
demonstration this week that has jeopardized the centerpiece of
President Fernando de la Rua's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on Wednesday, in which the officers bludgeoned
demonstrators as they lay on the ground, was televised live,
stunning the country and deeply embarrassing de la Rua.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the worst cases of police brutality here since
civilians retook power from a military dictatorship in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred labor supporters demonstrated to block access to
the Congress building to impede the start of a Senate debate on a
new labor code. The change is intended to lower labor costs and
make businesses more competitive on world markets with measures
like reducing the power of national unions to set wages in local
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition Justicialist Party, who control the
Senate, responded by putting off the debate until next Wednesday.
Union leaders say they will demonstrate then to halt the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The police crackdown put the government on the defensive. The
top law enforcement official, Interior Minister Federico Storani,
conceded that the beatings represented ``a political bill the
government will have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The police who exceeded their powers will be severely
punished,'' Storani added.
</P>
<P>
   Before a federal judge ordered the officers' arrests on Thursday
night, de la Rua echoed press speculation that the harsh measures
of the police might have been planned to embarrass his government
and stymie the changes in the labor law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been lack of professional skill on the part of
the police or something else,'' he told reporters. ``We are
investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   When de la Rua ran for president last year, he made cleaning up
police corruption and brutality a campaign issue. Since he took
office in December, he has purged the civilian government and
military intelligence branches of hundreds of officials suspected
of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials suggested that the violent officers might
have been trying to embarrass the new chief of the federal police,
Ruben Santos, whom the new government appointed to improve crime
fighting and conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine demonstrators were arrested in the demonstration.
Nine officers were reportedly injured. A union leader was seriously
injured by a rubber bullet that struck him in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration put the opposition Justicialists, who have
been associated with big labor since their party was founded by
Gen. Juan D. Peron a half-century ago, in a difficult position with
regard to supporting de la Rua's proposal. That has raised the
likelihood that the bill could be watered down.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is being delayed as de la Rua struggles to show
progress in reinvigorating an economy that has been in recession
for two years. Tax receipts last month fell 3.3 percent below the
total for March 1999, despite an increase in rates, suggesting that
domestic demand is still suffering. Meanwhile, the 14 percent
unemployment rate is creeping up.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say they still believe that the economy will grow
4 percent this year, after a 3 percent decline last year. They cite
the 9.4 percent growth in industrial output in the first quarter
over the same period last year as evidence that a pickup has begun
and will gain momentum in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, de la Rua has said he needs the labor bill to cut the
unemployment rate. The bill appeared to be sailing to enactment six
weeks ago, after a planned national labor strike had failed and the
lower house of Congress passed it overwhelmingly in late February.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Carlos Saul Menem joined crucial
Justicialist governors in backing the legislation, Senate passage
looked certain. But a dissident faction of the national Peronist
labor confederation has sworn to continue resistance to the bill,
and opposition senators are calling for amendments that government
officials say are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Some Peronist senators are now thought to favor enactment of the
labor bill by presidential decree, so that they do not have to vote
for the measure and anger organized labor. But others appear
willing to continue negotiations with the government.

SKINNER EXPLAINS ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Skinner had to talk about it. Again. Explain how he lost
another race he could have won.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner is getting used to the could-haves, would-haves and
should-haves that seem to dot his racing career and his
second-place finish Sunday at the Talladega's DieHard 500 has
joined the list.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as bad as Atlanta, a race Skinner dominated before
blowing an engine. That was a race he should have won. This was a
race he could have. Even Jeff Gordon, the winner at Talladega,
admitted that.
</P>
<P>
   During the final laps, Skinner was so tight on Gordon's bumper
it was almost like they were one car. A little tap in the right
place, Gordon goes for a spin and Skinner has his first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had two or three good runs at me,'' Gordon said, ``but
either he lost momentum, went down on the grass or bumped me. I
guess he did all three. He bumped me a few times because he had
momentum and he didn't want to go on the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   But Skinner never hit Gordon hard enough to knock him out of
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Irwin could really get on us down in the corner and
through the corner but he just couldn't get a big enough push to
get me by Jeff,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I was going to beat him was if I hit him and spun
him and took a chance of hurting somebody, and I don't want to win
my first race because I knocked somebody out who had raced me clean
all day,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gordon wouldn't have been where he was without
Skinner's help. With 18 laps to go, he was ninth, but he got behind
Skinner with about 10 left and the two of them went to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gordon darted around Skinner, past Mark Martin, into the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dale Earnhardt was behind Skinner, and maybe Gordon
was fortunate Earnhardt was running third and not second, because
Earnhardt has been known to push the envelope, so to speak, when
the race is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, the only way I was going to get by Gordon was if
I ran in there real hard and just hit him, and I wasn't going to do
that,'' Skinner said. ``I didn't want to win the race that way. I
think we've got a strong race team, and I think we can win them
without doing that to a guy who races us as clean as he did all
day.''

<P>
   He sets out with the stated aim of showing New York how
big-time, West Coast venture capital is done, Adam Dell can't
imagine why anyone would want to do anything besides start a
dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   One day this month, Dell, who left Silicon Valley only last
November and soon founded Impact Venture Partners in New York,
faced a crowded classroom as he taught his Columbia University
business school course on starting an Internet company. Standing
6-foot-3 and dressed in dot-com attire _ khakis and a button-down
shirt, sleeves rolled to the elbows _ Dell is a lot better-looking
in person than in the geeky photograph on his company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a semester of indoctrination, he asked how many
students still planned to work for Fortune 500 companies. When even
a few _ perhaps made anxious by sagging dot-com stocks _ meekly
raised their hands, Dell, gritting his teeth and running his hands
through his wavy brown hair, exclaimed, ``I've failed in every
sense!''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, at 30, has accumulated the credentials and the confidence
to teach such a course. Having an older brother by the name of
Michael has certainly helped create opportunities. But having a
last name that has become a leading brand name, associates say,
cannot account for his own ability to find and nurture promising
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell himself says he has done little for his brother
besides investing in his $100 million venture capital fund, which
has already had two of its companies go public. ``Adam opened the
doors for himself,'' Michael Dell said. ``The things he's done are
his own. I can't take any credit or blame.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Michael Dell's near-conquest of one business has
made Adam Dell that much more intent on conquering another. ``I
have an intense passion to win and to build colossal businesses
that will survive and exist in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Dell left Crosspoint Venture Partners in Silicon
Valley (a backer of Ariba Inc., among others), where he was a
partner, to shift his focus to Manhattan's Silicon Alley. Besides
his brother, he has attracted marquee backers like Frank Quattrone,
head of the technology group at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dell specializes in fledgling Internet companies meant to speed
transactions among businesses, especially in industries like
textiles and trucking. ``We're here to bring East Coast businesses
to the Net faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started his fund with investments in companies he got to know
on the West Coast, including OpenTable, an online restaurant
reservation system based in San Francisco but operating in cities
including New York. Two of his companies went public on April 7,
even as the Nasdaq was well into its slide from its March peak:
GoAmerica, a wireless Internet service provider that was issued at
$16, now trades at $8.625. Opus360, an online employment service
that was issued at $10, is at $8.25. Impact invested in both
companies after they were founded.
</P>
<P>
   Dell preaches what he practices. He urges his Columbia students
to stay as wired as they can, encouraging them to surf the Web on
their laptops while he teaches.
</P>
<P>
   When West Coast colleagues send him e-mail messages at 2 a.m.
New York time, they often receive responses within five minutes.
``I think he has it connected to his bed or something,'' said Carl
Bass, chief executive of Buzzsaw.com, a provider of goods and
services to the construction industry that Impact Ventures
financed.
</P>
<P>
   As technology stocks took a beating this month, Dell managed not
to flinch. ``It's a hiccup, but also a wake-up call to reality on
valuations and business models,'' he said. ``The volatility is a
part of how this cycle will play out.''
</P>
<P>
   His own investments, he said, are in industry leaders that can
withstand a bear market. ``These are not flash-in-the-pan, Internet
hype deals,'' he said. ``These are real businesses with real value.
We are focused on long-term returns, not quick pops.''
</P>
<P>
   Why move from Silicon Valley, the hotbed of Internet activity,
to New York? ``I saw a gaping hole in the need for early-stage
venture capital in New York, and I said, `This is a no-brainer.'''
</P>
<P>
   But other, better-known firms say they are more able to fill the
gap. Draper Fisher Jurvetson of Silicon Valley established a
Manhattan affiliate in February, and a half-dozen other venture
firms have sprung up in Manhattan in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an individual venture capitalist who moved from the West
to the East Coast,'' said Dan Schultz, a managing partner of Draper
Fisher's New York-based fund, referring to Dell. ``He's got
relationships there, done deals there, but it's not like his old
firm opened here with a bicoastal practice. It's a subtle but
important difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who is single, was raised in Houston; his mother was a
stockbroker and his father an orthodontist. Growing up, Dell was
fascinated by computers. In 1982, in junior high school, he started
an online bulletin board. ``It had games, content, application,
software packages,'' he said. ``People could chat.''.

REGGIE JEFFERSON IN THE SWING IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last time I saw Reggie Jefferson, he was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He wants people to know that he has a job with a professional
baseball team in Japan that needs his services. He said he's sorry
he missed Opening Day at Fenway Park. His friends will understand.
The rest don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   He voiced these sentiments in sort of a goodwill gesture to the
Red Sox, who kept him off the playoff roster and then released him
in the offseason. After turning down three major league offers,
none of which came with a guarantee of playing time, the Seibu
Lions of the Pacific League came along and upped the ante by $1
million. Jefferson, 31, quickly accepted _ although he had never
visited Japan before spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson had very little choice. In 1999, he had managed only
206 at-bats and a .277 batting average while playing in just 83
games. These were clearly not good numbers for a designated
hitter/first baseman who earned $3.25 million in his final season
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed as a free agent in '95, Red Sox general manager
Dan Duquette referred to him as a ``professional hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although injuries plagued him during stops in Cincinnati,
Cleveland, and Seattle, the Red Sox took a chance after Jefferson
hit .347 in 122 games in '96 and gave him a three-year contract. It
seemed to be the right move the next year when Jefferson hit .317
and appeared in 136 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all downhill the next two seasons. In '98, Jefferson
played in just 62 games (and none after July 15) because of a lower
back strain. Last year, his absence from the lineup had more to do
with the manager's choice than injuries. The return of Mike Stanley
and the emergence of rookie Brian Daubach cut into Jefferson's
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the ax was near. But he didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew all along that they weren't going to put me on the
(playoff) roster,'' said Jefferson. ``They could have released me,
or something like that, during the season. The situation was dead.
A couple of teams did call the Red Sox. But with my salary, nobody
was going to make a deal with the Red Sox unless the club agreed to
pay some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told Mark Portugal in September that he could go home.
That's when I asked, `Why are you going to keep me around? You know
you're not going to use me.' Last year, I was hurt 90 days, and
even when I was there, I'm sure a lot of people felt like I was
done. You don't want to have three straight years in the big
leagues in which you don't play. I'm just glad that it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has no illusions about his immediate future. He signed
a one-year contract with the Lions, who are based in suburban
Tokyo. Barring injuries, he will try for another major league job
next year. In signing with Seibu, which has won 13 Pacific League
championships since '82, he will be with a winner playing in a
domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can withstand the rigors of a Japan League season,
and the lifestyle that goes with it, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Cecil Fielder,'' he said, referring to the
most famous Japanese crossover player. ``So obviously, this will be
a big adjustment. Ideally, this is for a guy who never got to play
in the major leagues, a guy who has been in Triple A for a while
and didn't get his shot. This is a chance for a guy like Lou
Merloni to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe if I come here and play every day, people know I'm
healthy. My idea is to play for a year. If nothing else, it will be
a good cultural experience. The worst I can do is come back in good
shape and get an offer to play in somebody's game. Also, there will
be several more dollars in the bank. It's not like I had that great
offer sitting on the table. So play here and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said it's hard to describe what it's like to play in
Japan after nine seasons in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to forget all the things you learn in the major
leagues in order to have success over here,'' said Jefferson. ``You
have to put everything out of your mind. And once you're here,
focus on what you have to do. Pitching, the umpires, the way they
play the game itself, you can't compare it. If you try to compare
it to the major leagues, you just make it hard on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said he is just glad the market has changed enough in
the last three years to allow veterans to make their own deals in
Japan. Until recently, younger players were sought for the slots
reserved for foreign players and the Japanese clubs received a
large chunk of the money. Jefferson still has power and Seibu
hasn't won a Japan Series championship since '92. Bigger
marketplace, more jobs, more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take it for what it is: Japanese baseball,'' said
Jefferson. ``I will just try to have a good year. That's how I look
at it. If I don't have a good year, that's fine, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've saved a little money for a rainy day. Mostly, I want it
to be a good experience. If I hit .200 and they send me home, I'd
still like for it to be a good experience. I've had a few cultural
experiences already that I won't forget.''

EARTH DAY, THE TECHNOLOGY ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Environmentalism is one of America's most successful social
movements since World War II, responsible for making the air, land,
and water cleaner, especially in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now activists are confronting the price of success: a whole
raft of new issues that are steeped in cutting-edge science that
even activists scarcely understand.
</P>
<P>
   Life used to be so much simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1970, when 20 million Americans marched on the first
Earth Day, air pollution over Los Angeles was as thick as fog,
while raw sewage floated in Boston Harbor and toxic chemicals drove
the bald eagle, America's national symbol, to the brink of
extinction. Ugly as it was, the environmental mess was such a clear
and present danger that it galvanized a movement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as millions more prepare to celebrate Earth Day's 30th
anniversary, the issues have become far more complex, abstract, and
harder to sell.
</P>
<P>
   An invisible gas people exhale is warming the planet. Radiation
is pouring through an ozone hole six miles up in the sky.
Protesters rally against something called the International
Monetary Fund, complaining that it is plundering faraway nations.
And environmentalists once-reliable targets, from car makers to
forest clearcutters are claiming to be green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier back then because the threats were so obvious,''
said Denis Hayes, cofounder of Earth Day and current chairman and
chief executive of Earth Day Network. The group is coordinating
events in 185 nations today, from a festival in London to a car
boycott in Indonesia, from a parachuting demonstration in Croatia
to a free concert on the Charles River Esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   While Hayes is not nostalgic for the hideous black smoke or
lead-poisoned children of yesteryear, he says he found those issues
easier to deal with than issues like global warming, where the
threat is invisible and almost everyone in the United States is
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Hayes admitted, global warming, an important theme of
this year's celebration, ``is, candidly, a little bit boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the difficulty of the new issues, the
environment has slipped in the public's consciousness. The public
is still deeply concerned _ 52 percent of people surveyed by
Newsweek magazine feel the United States has made only minor
environmental progress since 1970 _ but the protest over
genetically engineered corn doesn't draw the visceral reaction of
the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new complexities are due to the wealth of scientific
information amassed over the years, yielding far more detailed
understanding of some ecological problems while identifying new
problems that had been obscured by the old.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill still complain that ``sound science'' is
lacking on issues from dioxin to desertification. But others say
there is no shortage of science, thanks to environmentalists who
have pushed for more and more research.
</P>
<P>
   Yet science is only part of the story. Environmental concern is
now woven into American life, from street protests to clothing
catalogs, from hybrid cars to Hollywood films. Americans support
the environmental movement so deeply that they have virtually
silenced or converted its critics. Few speak ill of nature these
days.
</P>
<P>
   But, if everyone from E.O. Wilson to Leonardo DiCaprio is now an
environmentalist, leading environmentalists are concerned over how
to keep the movement focused in the coming years, especially as it
takes on issues such as climate change that do not lend themselves
to clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, this is a generational challenge that affects
all movements,'' Hayes said, citing ``the feminist movement, civil
rights movement, labor movement, where people forge bonds and
values in a series of battles that proceed from assumptions not
always inherited by the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's particularly true of the environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That nature is better off now than it was in 1970, at least in
the United States, is hard to dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the 1960s and the first Earth Day, in 1970, we have made
some remarkable gains,'' writes Vice President Al Gore in his new
forward to ``Earth in the Balance,'' his 1992 book reissued today.
``Especially in the last seven years, we have laid the foundations
to make the first decade of the twenty-first century the
Environment Decade, for America and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House report released nine days ago concluded that since
the start of the Clinton Administration in 1993, 44 million more
Americans are breathing clean air and 34 million more are drinking
clean water. Superfund hazardous waste sites are being cleaned up
three times as quickly, environmental exports have more than
doubled, and spending on environmental priorities has
''dramatically risen.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as clear is that many of the ecological threats known
in 1970 persist, although in some cases not as severely, while new
ones are cropping up about as quickly as endangered species are
vanishing. The Worldwatch Institute's ``State of the World 2000''
report painted a gloomy picture of disappearing species, rising
temperatures, and collapsing fisheries, all while the global
population has doubled since 1970 to 6 billion people. It will hit
9 billion by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale and urgency of the challenges are unprecedented,''
said Worldwatch president Lester Brown. In this country alone,
environmentalists say, sprawl is encroaching on open lands,
drinking water is beset by pollutants, the summertime air in many
cities is sending asthmatics to hospitals, exotic plants are
wreaking havoc with ecosystems, and national parks are being
overrun by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that sense of crisis that attracts many young
people to the environment as a cause, jamming environmental studies
programs and launching Internet campaigns against multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental issues seem so threatening, so imminent,'' said
Suzanne Slezak, 18, a Wellesley College freshman. She joined other
area students last Tuesday in calling on their peers nationwide to
pledge, via a web site, not to work for, invest in, or buy from BP
Amoco and six other companies, contending that the firms pollute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hollywood is turning out films such as ``A Civil
Action'' and ``Erin Brockovich,'' both of which rely on old-style
contamination issues to create a sense of good versus evil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the emerging environmental issues don't fit the neat
profile of corporations illegally dumping chemicals on innocent
victims. Important issues such as sustainable development in
developing nations are awash in tough science, obscure treaties,
and a pervasive sense that everyone is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the young people who were the foot soldiers in
recent protests in Boston, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., against
global trade and biotechnology are part of the problem, according
to Hayes, if only because their lives reqire so many natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Young people ``are incredible consumers,'' he said, quite
different from ascetically minded elders such as Raph Nader who
have dominated the environmental movement for decades. Today's
teenagers are completely wired to the Internet, which makes them
easier to organize, but all the electronic gadgetry consumes vast
amounts of energy and contributes to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayes is far from downcast about environmentalism, because
he is convinced that, in the main, people want to do the right
thing, a commitment that leaders can tap into.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmentalism emanates from a set of values that includes
diversity,'' he said. ``Those values will be summoned up with force
and dynamism around key issues, be they individuals like Newt
Gingrich trying back in 1995 to roll back 25 years of environmental
progress or events like the Exxon Valdez and Chernobyl. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of it is that we have a far more educated
populace now when it comes to the environment,'' Hayes said. ``In
1970, if you asked people whether they were environmentalists, my
guess is 90 percent of them would have asked you what that is.
That's not true now.''

COLOMBIANS FLEE INTO PANAMA AS WAR FEARS RISE

<P>
   JAQUE, Panama _ Bertilda Castro Tejada and her family are living
in this small Panamanian village where time and trouble are all
they have. The place may be dreary, but, unlike the home they left
in Colombia, it is not deadly. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   They fled to Panama from their home in Jurado, Colombia, soon
after leftist guerrillas overran the police station and military
barracks there in December. After enduring an 18-hour siege, they
feared that they would not survive the inevitable: right-wing
paramilitary death squads that were sure to arrive, dispensing
vengeance on those who had helped the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no police in Jurado,'' Castro said, sitting outside
a friend's cramped home, where she and her family live for now.
``The guerrillas are in the mountains. When the paramilitaries
come, they beat up the peasants, asking, `where are the
guerrillas?' We are defenseless. They do whatever they want with
you because a town without law is not worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with endless fighting, hundreds of Colombians _ 800 by
official estimates _ have found refuge in Panama's dense jungle
province of Darien, crossing over the sprawling border as they did
in more peaceful times when Panamanians and Colombians alike went
looking for commerce and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   So too have the guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, as have the paramilitary squads, searching
for refugees they suspect of giving medicine, food or shelter to
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of more than 500 frightened refugees here just
before Christmas placed a sudden burden on Panamanian officials
who, lacking resources, turned to international relief agencies and
the Roman Catholic Church for help.
</P>
<P>
   But the more unsettling question is whether the chaos and
violence from Colombia will spill over the unsecured border,
especially if a U.S. program to help Colombia battle narcotics
trafficking escalates the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border between Panama and Colombia is at this moment the
most dangerous, conflicted and vulnerable one of Latin America,''
said Bishop Romulo Emiliani of the Diocese of Darien ``The
Colombian conflict has been spilling into our sector because the
effects of the war are extending into Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials said that neither the Panama Canal nor Panama
City, the capital some 200 miles from the border, face any imminent
danger, the incursions have become a nettlesome test for Panama's
ability to control the land over which it now has total
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Panama abolished its army after a U.S. invasion ended the
dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega 10 years ago. And since
December, when the United States gave Panama the canal, the country
lacks the deterrent of having U.S. troops on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a danger that is restricted for now to Darien,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former vice president, and it
``creates more of a socioeconomic problem than a security problem.
But there is also a feeling among some people that we are not
enforcing our national sovereignty. We are not able to make our
borders respected and give security to the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 30 miles from Colombia, Jaque is close enough that
the Panamanian border police say they often overhear radio
transmissions made by frantic Colombian forces under guerrilla
attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was one such attack last December that set off the exodus to
Panama. Throughout the night and halfway into the next day,
residents hid under beds or pressed themselves against walls during
a battle that claimed the lives of almost two dozen soldiers, about
twice as many guerrillas and one civilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it cleared up, they started to say that the soldiers were
defeated,'' said one Jaque refugee, who would only give his first
name, Pedro, for fear of reprisals. ``We looked out and recognized
a few of the guerrillas. They came into my home. It was raining,
and we cooked for them. They said not to worry, nothing would
happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But after they left, the military arrived with reinforcements,
and that is when many Colombians decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
   An officer accused them of having helped the guerrillas. ``Then
a military patrol came by and said, `After us, the bad ones are
coming,''' Pedro said, referring to the paramilitaries. ``They told
us we should leave for a while, five or six months, so we did.''
</P>
<P>
   He and five relatives each paid about 30,000 Colombian pesos, or
$15, for the three-hour boat ride to Jaque. Others risked the
tangled jungle paths. When they arrived many of the refugees had
friends or family who took them in.
</P>
<P>
   Life since then has hardly been easy. Although a few of the
older men who are experienced farmhands cut bananas each morning,
most of the refugees have not found work. Children are not allowed
to attend Panamanian schools. Except for emergency medical
treatment, none of the refugees are allowed to travel outside of
the town.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like Jose Perez, who arrived in December, all they can do is
wait. Perez stood on the shore recently watching as some of the
townspeople clambered aboard boats that would make the overnight
trip to Panama City. It was a teasing diversion from his otherwise
boring routine. In Jurado, he was successful enough as a
jack-of-all-trades to keep himself and his family comfortable in a
two-story house with an electrical generator. ``I had a house with
everything. Here, I sleep on a piece of cardboard on the floor,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He watched the boats and wondered when he might go home. But he
and the others will stay here until the Colombian government, with
the help of the United Nations and human rights monitors, can
assure their safety back home. That may take as much as eight
months, since that is how long Colombian officials said it would
take to rebuild the destroyed police station.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Jaque, about 15 Panamanian border policemen patrol the town,
walking at night in pairs with assault rifles slung over their
shoulders. Residents said they were worried that the police force
could be overwhelmed if Colombian guerrillas or paramilitaries come
to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Last year armed groups attacked a settlement on the Caribbean
coast, burning several houses. In 1997, according to Emiliani, 40
paramilitary troops went to the Panamanian town of Yape and stayed
there for three days until they found their target, a Colombian
doctor who had treated guerrillas, and executed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a vast stretch without any police presence,'' the
bishop said. ``It is very dangerous. Little by little, Darien can
become a path for crime if this is not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   By various estimates, there are about 1,000 members of armed
groups in Darien, with about three times as many support personnel
and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Panamanians just don't mess with them, and for good
reason, because they would get their clocks cleaned,'' said a
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials are beefing up border police units with
helicopters and other equipment. The measures are part of the
country's first national security plan, which has been stalled for
months by political bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has got to step up to the plate in that this is their
border,'' said the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Simon Ferro.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials said they would welcome foreign assistance,
but they also do not want to re-establish their own army nor do
they want a return of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a government have a firm policy not to remilitarize our
country,'' said Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman. ``As a
political party, we lived a traumatic history under the military
dictatorship. We suffered a lot with exile, jail and no freedom of
expression. We do not want to reinstate the military in our
country. We do not want the border, given all that has happened, to
be an excuse to remilitarize our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one approach the Panamanian government has undertaken is
to begin an $80 million development project in Darien, building
roads and providing services that would make the area seem less
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Aleman said his government was supporting the
peace effort started by Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana. He
also said no refugees would be returned to Colombia until
Pastrana's government can assure their safety.
</P>
<P>
   But few people here in Jaque think peace will come soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it will ever be resolved here,'' said Silda
Segura, a nurse who lives here. ``This is the border, and it will
always be like this. In this town you always had Colombians. If
before they came here when they had no problems, imagine what would
happen if the situation becomes difficult over there?''

   DILI, East Timor _ People here have gotten used to the scene: a
mob of unemployed young men shoving, shouting and weeping in anger
outside the headquarters of the United Nations, held back by an
impassive multinational police contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed!'' they shouted the other day, and their
complaint has become a theme for critics _ both foreign and
Timorese _ as the United Nations passes the six-month mark in its
first experiment in building a new nation.
</P>
<P>
   As monsoon rains bring added misery, whole towns and villages
still stand burned, roofless and silent, devastated by the rampage
of destruction that followed East Timor's vote last August to end
24 years of Indonesian occupation.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80 percent of the territory's 700,000 people have no
jobs. Another 100,000 or more remain in camps across the border in
Indonesian West Timor, still afraid to return.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of East Timor's unemployed, and the first spasms
of violence it has spawned, are the sharpest signs of a swelling
discontent in this physically and emotionally traumatized land.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers and diplomats say they fear that this discontent
could lead to lawlessness and political disarray and could open the
door to trouble from the Indonesian-backed militias that crossed
the border to Indonesian West Timor after laying waste to the
territory last September.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an invasion of peacekeepers, bureaucrats and aid workers
in the months since, much of this battered land remains, as
officials like to say, at ground zero. There is still no working
police force or justice system, no government structure, few
schools, no working water or power or transportation system, no
post office, not much of an economy, little reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very sad story,'' said one young woman, summing up this moment
in her country's history in halting English. ``Hungry. Cry. Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace of recovery has called into question the capacity
of the United Nations, with its lumbering centralized bureaucracy,
to address urgent needs and operate as the government of a nation
in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It has never tried anything quite like this before: to create
and administer a nation from a fresh blueprint of its own. When it
tried to do so in Cambodia nearly a decade ago, there was already a
government structure to work with. In Kosovo today, the U.N. effort
is closer to traditional peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge machine, an enormous machine,'' said a Canadian
aid worker, speaking of the United Nations. ``Every time you want
something done it has to be checked and rechecked. If something
needs to be done right away, it's not unusual to take a week, two
weeks, three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   An urgent multimillion-dollar job-creation program that was
approved in January, for example, is now scheduled to go into
operation in June, if indeed there are no further delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the United Nations that's moving quickly,'' said Manoel de
Almeida e Silva, the chief spokesman for the United Nations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely we are dealing here with a level of expectations
that is not being met by international community mechanisms,'' he
said. ``You can destroy in a matter of days but you don't
reconstruct in a couple of days or a couple of weeks or a couple of
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the reconstruction can begin, he said, ``you need to
establish a central payments office, a border service, a fiscal
authority, a civil service commission, because you are really
starting from scratch, from zero.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was invaded by Indonesia
in 1975, touching off a resistance war that eventually took as many
as 200,000 lives. Last year nearly 80 percent of the population
voted for independence, despite a campaign of intimidation by the
Indonesian-backed militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   That vote was followed by a brutal organized campaign of
destruction in which 70 percent or more of East Timor's buildings
were destroyed and more than one-fourth of its population kidnapped
and forced into exile.
</P>
<P>
   International investigators say as many as 700 people were
killed and an uncounted number of women raped.
</P>
<P>
   Much of East Timor is agricultural, but most farm implements
have been destroyed and most farm animals killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the international community has pledged over $500 million to
build a new East Timor during the next three years under the
guidance of the United Nations. For aid groups and development
specialists, East Timor is a sort of petri dish of nation-building
where everything from the Constitution to the currency to the
national language has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to conceive of how anybody could go in there and
make an instant success out of such a complex set of problems,''
said Sidney Jones, who heads the human rights office of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   One predictable, almost instant effect has drawn the most
criticism: the creation of a giant gap in wealth that threatens to
distort East Timor's economy for years.
</P>
<P>
   Dili today does not present a pretty picture, with a separate
expatriate world superimposed on a scene of destruction and
poverty. The foreigners are rich, with cars, offices, hot running
water, Sunday barbecues. The East Timorese have almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't take a table out to the side of the road to sell
things,'' one U.N. official said, ``because not only do they not
have anything to sell but they don't have a table.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Chinese restaurant serving $50 meals is so crowded with
foreigners that it has made a chic annex of the burned-out building
next door, stringing it with Christmas lights. Just down the
street, Eugenia Gago feeds her extended family on less than $5 a
day, selling grilled meat to passers-by from the rubble of a
burned-out shop. Unlike the Chinese restaurant she has no
generator, so she stops when it gets dark.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of security for an international agency put it:
``Salary scales are a real problem. We pay $3 a day for unskilled
labor. I can get a good cappuccino at the Dili Cafe for $3.''
</P>
<P>
   Given these problems, some local people have already begun to
give up hope that the United Nations can fix their broken country,
said Milena Pires, one of the few expatriate Timorese who have
returned to help rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing impatience because people do see the United
Nations embodying all these ideals,'' said Pires, who leads a
campaign to establish women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see all these cars going back and forth and they think,
`If the United Nations is doing so much work, why don't we see a
difference in our own lives?''' she said. ``So now some have begun
saying: `OK, wait two years until the United Nations is finished.
Then we'll begin to rebuild.'''
</P>
<P>
   The view of one Western diplomat was only slightly more
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everyone has to do is lower their expectations a bit,''
he said. ``The most they could hope for, I think, is to just get
through, to keep the political process stable, to keep divisions
within the community to a point where they are manageable.''

</P>
<P>
   If this fails, some people fear, die-hard militia groups that
still lurk just across the western border may try to stir trouble.
If they cannot reverse East Timor's independence, perhaps they can
at least vindicate their predictions that independence would be a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of armed men continue their forays along the
border, occasionally eliciting exchanges of fire. ``The militia are
still around and they are still getting some support,'' said James
Dunn, author of the basic history of East Timor, ``Timor, a People
Betrayed'' (ABC Books, 1996). ``The militia wouldn't exist if the
Indonesians really wanted to switch them off. It's a bit dangerous.
It's tricky now.''
</P>
<P>
   One critical problem, as the United Nations looks ahead to an
eventual transition to local government, is that relatively few
local people are being given important roles in the planning and
running of the reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners, rather than local people, have been named as
district administrators. And East Timorese deputies within the U.N.
structure tend to have little influence, officials here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were coming to work with us, not us with
them,'' said Father Jovito de Jesus Rego, an influential young
Roman Catholic priest. ``Now everything is being determined by
outsiders. We have these big, big, big nations here and it seems we
are becoming alien to our own culture and history.''
</P>
<P>
   But given its history of colonial domination, East Timor is
desperately short of the qualified people it needs to administer
itself.
</P>
<P>
   When the United Nations set out to create a court system, for
example, it found only 70 people in the country with law degrees,
not one of whom had been allowed by the Indonesians to work as a
lawyer or a judge. Legal training is proceeding on an elementary
level, starting with the concept of the presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Indonesian leadership, most senior civil servants,
teachers, doctors and technical workers were Indonesians. Virtually
all of them have fled. As schools prepare to open later this year,
high school students are being drafted to teach. And given the
repressive nature of Indonesian rule, a new police academy is
refusing to accept anyone who has ever worked as a police officer
in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   At the demonstration outside the U.N. headquarters the other
day, none of the young men demanding jobs appeared to be qualified
for the available openings as interpreters, clerks and computer
operators.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was calmed only by the arrival of Jose Alexandre
Gusmao, East Timor's independence hero and its moral center. Don't
count on government jobs, he told them. He said Indonesia's bloated
Timorese civil service of about 30,000 people would be replaced by
a government roster only one-fourth that size.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor will grow on the basis of private enterprise, not
government make-work, Gusmao told them. ``Just guarantee the
peace,'' he said, ``and we will guarantee that investors will come
to help East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Loh, a potential investor who was visiting from Hong Kong,
was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for anything,'' Loh said. ``They've got to give
investors peace of mind. Everything is still wait-and-see. One
problem is land ownership. The United Nations loves to say: `Where
is the document? Where is this? Where is that?' But all the
documents are burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays, the discontent, the confusion, the bureaucratic
nightmares _ all may simply be ``bumps in the road,'' as de Almeida
of the United Nations put it.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be cynical about this, like the Western diplomat
who smiled and muttered, ``Optimism is a wonderful quality.''
</P>
<P>
   But indeed there is no shortage of optimism among the East
Timorese, who have so recently been rescued from a time of horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really happy to have the foreigners here,'' said Gago
as she sold grilled meat from a broken building, with her hungry
children sitting around her. ``The foreigners have made everything
safe. We don't have to be afraid anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Xisto Soares, 23, who teaches English at a seminary, summed up
his view in this way: ``For now in East Timor, just hope and try.''
</P>
<P>
   Soares represents that rarest of qualities here, normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   With his excellent English, he could easily find a high-paying
job with the United Nations or a foreign aid group. But he said:
``I love my students. I will always be happy among my students. And
also this is my profession.''

COMMENTARY: AMERICA EMBRACES ANOTHER JONBENET 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the zillions of words spilled in the cause of Elian Gonzalez,
only those of Nathan Lane cut to the chase. Doing standup at a
benefit in New York three weeks ago, the actor asked: ``Now if he
wasn't so adorable, do you think there'd be such a dilemma? If he
looked less like Haley Joel Osment and more like Herve Villechaize,
would we still be talking about this?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is no. Despite the efforts of partisans
on all sides to pump up a nasty child custody battle into a
full-scale ideological conflict, it isn't festering Cold War
animosities that have driven the national Elian show. He is instead
the latest pawn in our culture's increasingly pornographic
exploitation of children _ especially cute children who belong to
someone else. For Americans outside Miami and Washington, Elian is
not a proxy for anti-Castro freedom fighters but the new JonBenet
Ramsey, a child the camera loves who can be bought, sold,
dramatized and ogled for ghoulish fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which Gonzalez you side with as we reach the opera's
finale, this 6-year-old boy's fate should have been decided by a
legal process in which the warring adults, not the child, do all
the public sparring, in court or on TV. But not with his face.
Stripped of schooling and minimal privacy, Elian has been
sacrificed to the media gods, who extract a fresh slice of video
meat daily. His performance has been gleefully facilitated by the
Miami relatives, who purport to have the boy's best interests at
heart, and eagerly disseminated by entertainment corporations that
saw a ratings winner.
</P>
<P>
   On the record, news executives defend the weeks of intrusive and
excessive doting on this child as public service. One CNN vice
president, Keith McCallister, told The New York Times' Bill Carter
that ``this is not a tabloid story'' but one ``that raises major
issues about the foreign policies of two countries'' and ``involves
serious legal issues.'' TV hands speaking not for attribution offer
other explanations. As an executive at another network said to me:
``Elian's not a political symbol; he's a very sexy kid in a soap
opera. Despite what the extremes say, it's not as if he's going to
be president if he stays in America or he's going to be killed if
he goes back to Cuba. For TV, it's plain old voyeurism, and for
voyeurism to be really fun, it has to include good-looking people.
Those gold chains are a look. The way he's been dressed, he could
be a 16-year-old hanging out with Gloria Estefan.''
</P>
<P>
   Without its hot star, the war over Elian might have generated TV
coverage as pro forma and meager as that of the pressing political
debate over human rights in the more crucial communist realm of
China. But such has been the orgiastic response to the kid that the
Center for Media and Public Affairs found that the number of
network evening news stories about Elian easily passed the totals
racked up by the deaths of Princess Di and John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the pack in this tally is ABC News, the same outfit
that's been ridiculed all month for tapping Leonardo DiCaprio to
interview Bill Clinton (a treat the network will air in Cuisinarted
form Saturday night). But given the widespread interchangeability
of celebrities and journalistic talking heads, the DiCaprio
assignment at least avoids the conflict-of-interest charges that
would have dogged ABC had it, say, picked George Stephanopoulos to
grill his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   The real scandal at the network was Diane Sawyer's ``visit''
with Elian, parceled out on both ``Good Morning America'' and
``20/20,'' in which she rolled around on the floor like a Romper
Room teacher to extract exclusive video of her prey. The Sawyer
``visit'' was not only an exploitation of a child for commercial
purposes but emotional self-aggrandizement in the guise of
reportage. ``His eyes ask a question _ how can the U.S. government
enforce the law without hurting a little boy?'' intoned the
heart-tugging Sawyer. Maybe, but how do we know he didn't just need
a nap? This disingenuous venture was even less honest, and no less
creepy, than the flat-out propaganda video subsequently staged by
the Miami relatives, in which Elian cried out ``Papa, I don't want
to go to Cuba!'' in a setting (a bed late at night) befitting
Calvin Klein's idea of kids' culture. It too had its network
premiere on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Television had no choice but to air that hostage film (though
not incessantly) _ it was news. But most of what it displays of the
mugging Elian is mere titillation. What's next? A ``Saturday Night
Live'' sketch the week after the Sawyer fiasco joked that Disney,
ABC's parent company, might follow ``The Lion King'' and ``Aida''
on Broadway with ``Elian, The Cuban Boy!,'' a musical featuring a
``Miss Saigon''-style love duet between Janet Reno and Juan Miguel.
But even satire can't keep pace with this story. CBS, having
recently scored big with its JonBenet TV movie, has now announced
an Elian miniseries, with its producer, Craig Anderson, promising
that ``in the middle of all of it is going to be the angelic face
of that boy.'' The casting call alone could be a TV event worthy of
JonBenet's beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's too easy to shovel all the blame for Elian's
exploitation on the media, or on the Miami relatives who've
embraced this ``Truman Show.'' Complicit in the equation is a large
and willing American audience that is all too compliant when
children are used as props to sell it something, whether
entertainment, prurience or the agenda of a politician (Cuban or
American).
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, has decreed that ``women
consistently respond to the phrase `for the children' regardless of
the context,'' and politicians seem to agree. They see votes in
kids as rapaciously as cable news operations see Nielsen numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a century ago that Hillary Clinton was ridiculed for
pandering in ``It Takes a Village'' and Bill Clinton for his
poll-driven initiative to promote school uniforms. All the
candidates are Clintons now. Though education hasn't been a prime
presidential election issue since Lyndon Johnson made it one in
1964, it's a mantra this year. By late March, in the tabulation of
The Wall Street Journal, George W. Bush had already campaigned at
82 schools and Al Gore at 77 _ symbolic overkill that far outstrips
any president's ability to have impact on local education. (Only 7
percent of school budgets come from Washington.) In his zeal to be
seen as a children's advocate, Gore spent the night before one
school visit in a 12-year-old Ohio girl's temporarily vacated
bedroom, surrounded by posters for 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
Bush's classroom photo ops have not been deterred by the fact that
in one of them he flunked an elementary school student's question
about his own favorite childhood reading. ``I can't remember any
specific books,'' was his reply.
</P>
<P>
   What's disturbing about the public's role in all this is not
just its gullibility but its inability to practice what it preaches
to pollsters. Remember the clamor for V-chips and TV ratings? The
chips are now built into TV sets by law but there's no evidence
that anyone is using them. A year after Columbine, a new
Gallup/CNN/USA Today Poll shows that more Americans keep guns at
home now than they did before that massacre. There has been no
similar increase in mental health services for children, even
though, as The Times confirmed in its study of rampage killings, it
is untreated psychiatric illness, not the intake of violent TV or
video games, that is the greatest cause of these bloodbaths.
</P>
<P>
   The same hypocrisy surrounds the national outpouring of
``caring'' for Elian. ``Elian Gonzalez has made parents of us
all,'' says Time magazine this week _ yes, but deadbeat parents.
When Janet Reno appealed on Wednesday for the media to ``turn off
the TV lights'' on Elian out of respect for his welfare, no one
noticed. Though there are advocacy groups monitoring television
programming for every conceivable affront, whether to minorities,
religions or household pets, there's been no major outcry against
the Elian show.
</P>
<P>
   If we really love this boy, why are we so willing an audience
for a circus that few of us this side of the Ramseys would tolerate
with our own children? Why do we hold either the Miami relatives or
Fidel Castro accountable for child abuse, but not our own
voyeuristic enabling of the worst excesses of our media culture?
Even the professional child actors whom ruthless Hollywood moguls
or grasping stage parents have most aggressively pushed into the
limelight, from Judy Garland to Macauley Culkin, had more privacy,
schooling and off-camera time than has been granted to Elian
Gonzalez. Given the extended family all over America that has
smothered him with ``love,'' this is one kid who might have been
better off home alone.

BOY'S RELATIVES, US SEEKING WAY TO PLACE HIM IN FATHER'S CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Outside parties'' in Miami are drafting a plan that
would transfer Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his
father's care, Justice Department officials confirmed Friday night.
The officials said they ``would welcome a real agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A department official would not disclose who the third parties
were, except to say they were people from the Miami community and
that they were working with the Miami relatives and were in contact
with Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are still working out the details of such a
plan,'' the official said, adding that ``significant gaps''
remained in the negotiations and that an immediate transfer to the
father must be included. The plan had not been presented to Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, who came to the United States from
Cuba 17 days ago to reunite with his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   After a tense day of swirling reports that Reno was ready to
send law-enforcement officials into Little Havana to retrieve the
boy, the unexpected news of a plan for a peaceful, negotiated
settlement raised hopes inside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is the appearance of viability here, and as
long as that possibility exists, it has to be explored,'' a Justice
Department spokeswoman said. She said she expected the deal to be
brokered or die within hours. ``Whoever these outside parties are,
they have a vested interest in having this ended peacefully. They
saw the writing on the wall, and they are trying to have families
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez Friday afternoon and told him
she could ``not commit to a particular course of action or
timetable'' to reunite him with his son. It is not clear what the
status of the mediation in Miami was, or whether Reno discussed it
with Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the Justice Department, plans were still going
forward to remove the Cuban boy from his Miami relatives as early
as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not ruled out this weekend,'' a Justice Department
spokeswoman said, adding that law-enforcement officials were still
weighing such factors in Little Havana as crowd size, the weather,
and the public reaction to taking Elian from his great-uncle's
house over Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to minimize civilian injury, not to mention
casualties, and trauma to the child, and we want to utilize the
option with the highest probability of officer safety,'' the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Elian's temporary home in Little Havana, Cuban-American
protesters reacted angrily to reports of plans to seize the boy.
Even as community leaders continued to advocate peaceful
resistance, a small number of ardent Cuban exiles warned that an
attempt by federal authorities to forcibly remove the young refugee
could be a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving him back,'' said Jose Clemente, a
construction worker who was born in Cuba, arrived in Miami as a
child, and later served in the US Army. ``We don't want violence,
but if they break the law and try to take that kid by force, we're
going to have another Waco, I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   Waving a large replica of the flag that flew over Cuba before
Castro's revolution, Clemente said, ``They're going to have to kill
a couple of people here, and we're ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to confirm reports that she had decided to send
agents to break the human chain in Little Havana. ``If I were going
to do something like that, I certainly wouldn't tell you,'' she
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to work it out,'' Reno said before her
15-minute meeting Friday with Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his lawyer,
Gregory B. Craig. ``I'm exploring every possibility I can to see
this resolved peacefully, promptly, and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released later, Reno said she assured
Gonzalez that she would continue working to reunite him with his
child. ``I was deeply moved by Mr. Gonzalez's evident love for his
son,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department reported receiving more than 7,000 calls
Friday in the wake of a public plea Thursday that Americans back
his cause. Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's spokesman, said the
White House had gotten ``a good volume of calls'' that
overwhelmingly supported the father's request.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Clinton Friday also heard from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
who wrote them that ``the forcible separation of Elian and his
current caregivers is unwise and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation, not confrontation, is what is in young Elian's best
interest at this critical point in time,'' said Bush, who urged the
federal officials to accept an offer by the 11th Circuit Court in
Atlanta to provide mediation services to resolve the custody
dispute between Elian's father and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a meeting, free of governmental pressure and away from
the glare of media attention, would present the best chance for a
family-inspired solution to this controversy,'' said Bush, a
Republican and the brother of GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, which on Wednesday ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until it decides whether he should get an asylum
hearing, suggested the custody case be mediated, but it did not
order it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says it does not object to family talks
as long as the Miami relatives, who have cared for Elian since he
was rescued from a shipwreck on Thanksgiving day, are prepared to
turn the boy over to his father. In a meeting with federal
officials in Miami Friday, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle,
reportedly again refused to accept that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, at the White House, repeated what the president said
Thursday, when he weighed in with his most substantive comments on
the case. ``The time for (the Miami relatives) to come forward and
effect a transfer to the father is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was not aware of any new overtures from the
Miami relatives, and he questioned how serious they had been in the
past about reuniting father and son. The steps they had taken so
far, he said, proved to be ``false starts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that if that's what they'd like, they should
come forward in good faith and do that,'' Lockhart said.``You know,
this is not about playing games, it's not about public relations,
it's not about trying to influence the coverage of this. It should
be about coming forward and doing what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   No official suggested the government is playing games with a
threat to use force in Miami, but it may be waving its trump card
as it tries to get the Miami relatives to relent and give up the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of brinksmanship that comes into
play,'' a Justice Department official said. ``If you have the whole
federal government staring into your face, saying we are coming
tomorrow with all these law-enforcement officers to support us,
there is a possibility, albeit slim, that the family will talk
turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials understand the dangers involved, both physical
and in public opinion. To minimize crowds and the risk of violence,
the Justice Department is relying on local police to push back
barricades and block additional streets around the Gonzalez home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can minimize the numbers of protesters, but people may try
to jump the barricades, and get arrested, and maybe there will be
bloodshed,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said. ``This stuff is
not going to look pretty or nice, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is obviously concerned about that. Chief of
staff John Podesta was getting periodic updates from the Justice
Department on the situation, and Lockhart said the president would
be briefed before the attorney general ordered a law-enforcement
action.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied reports that the White House is dissatisfied
with Reno and her agency's handling of the case. ``The president
has been very supportive of the work they've done,'' Lockhart said.
``He has done his best to make sure that he does nothing to inject
politics further into this.''
</P>
<P>
   As Easter weekend began, Elian was seen increasingly in the
heavily Catholic exile community as a symbol of hope that Cuba one
day will triumph over Castro's regime. Several demonstrators
marched through Little Havana with crosses on their shoulders,
advocating keeping Elian with his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a spiritual war, and I don't know how they can battle
that,'' Connie Crespo, a Cuban-American exile, said of the Clinton
administration. ``They're going by the laws made by men, which has
nothing to do with what God has in mind.''

BUSH NOT ALIENATING CONSERVATIVES AS HE REACHES OUT TO MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a retreat from recent Republican tenets, Gov.
George W. Bush in the past several days has advocated an expansion
of the federal role on programs ranging from education to
low-income housing to health care. And he has made overtures to
constituencies, such as gays and gun control proponents, that have
never been mainstays of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the nine
weeks since the South Carolina primary, when he presented himself
as an unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal and social
conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about past
nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative
organization has aggressively spoken out against Bush. Some have
even embraced his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over several days, prominent conservatives on
Capitol Hill and around the country said they were intent on
rallying behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they were essentially giving Bush a pass, many
conservatives offered the same explanations again and again _ often
using the identical word: After eight years, they were ``hungry''
to win back the White House, even if that might mean sacrificing
some bedrock Republican positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some risk to the strategy of the Republican Party
asking, `Where does he stand overall on basic Republican
principles?''' said Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas. ``But Republicans
are hungry to win the presidency, and that makes people more
willing to be understanding when proposals like these come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such forgiving attitudes, some leading conservatives
said Bush's positions might make them all the more insistent that
he not pick a running mate who favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I describe it as the great accommodation,'' said Marshall H.
Wittmann, director of congressional relations for the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative group, said: ``But this can only go so
far. I do believe Bush would run into a major problem if he put a
pro-choice running mate on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, conservatives are showing no signs of defection.
Like many of his peers, Stephen Moore, director of fiscal studies
at the Cato Institute, which has long condemned new federal
spending, offered a rationale for the measures Bush has taken that
he finds distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of a Clintonesque quality to these policy
proposals,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to defend the guy. The
housing program he came up with was really absurd. But, when you're
talking about a $2 trillion budget, the price tag on that program
was maybe a few billion. I don't like the programs, but it's not
like they'll bust the bank.'' Such proposals, Moore said, may be
``what it takes to wrest the White House from Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush did name a running mate who backs abortion rights,
many social conservatives went as far as to say they would stand
behind him _ albeit less enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum and a leading
abortion foe, did not seem particularly unsettled by recent
comments of Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania who called for loosening
the party's anti-abortion plank. He is considered a prospect to be
Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd lose if he did that,'' she said of the possibility of a
running mate like Ridge. ``There's enough of a pro-life
constituency who would feel so betrayed that they would not vote
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schlafly vowed to remain loyal even if Bush picked a running
mate who backed abortion rights. ``I'll probably stick with the
ticket,'' she said. ``There really isn't any option. Bush isn't
Gore _ and that's a big plus.'' Asked if she would defect to Pat
Buchanan, who is steadfastly against abortion and is seeking the
Reform Party nomination, she said, ``Well, I'm a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's courtship of moderates also underscores changing dynamics
in the country and in his own party: With huge federal surpluses,
even Republicans now can afford to espouse bountiful spending. And
many Republicans who were riding high after the Republicans'
takeover of the House in 1994 said they have been humbled by their
losses in 1996 and 1998 _ and that now an unabashed conservative
agenda may not be politically sensible. Some conservatives said
they would not object to the governor's proposals because they were
more a symbolic nod to Democrats and not a repudiation of
Republican philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is able to continue to reach to the center without
alienating his party's base of conservative voters, that could make
him a far more formidable candidate than if he were distracted by
the intraparty sniping that plagued Bob Dole's campaign in 1996 and
President George Bush's re-election drive four years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success thus far belies the predictions of many
Republican strategists, and many backers of Vice President Al Gore,
who said the Texas governor would trigger an outcry if he returned
to the more moderate path he had scrupulously followed throughout
1999 before his sharp detour to the right _ symbolized by his
appearance at Bob Jones University _ in late February.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing that in large part our policies have not only
appealed to nontraditional Republican groups but have not
engendered any backlash,'' said Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor
of Indianapolis who is Bush's chief domestic policy adviser. Asked
whether conservatives were backing the governor's proposals for
pragmatic reasons, Goldsmith said: ``Sure. Absolutely. It's nice to
have people wanting to win but also be happy about our policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are warning that Bush's strategy could lead
some conservatives to refuse to vote in November. ``He's going to
the left of Al Gore,'' said L. Brent Bozell, president of the
Conservative Victory Committee, which contributes to Republican
candidates. ``When Republicans take their base for granted, that
base stays home _ and Bush would not stand a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But an important reason why Bush is free to reach beyond hard
core Republicans is that polls show that Republicans voters have
rapidly consolidated behind him. A poll of registered Republicans
that was conducted April 13-14 and published by Newsweek found that
85 percent said they would support Bush. Candidates usually are not
able to muster such impressive levels of support until after they
rally the faithful at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said whenever any conservative
raises questions about Bush's bonafides on abortion or question his
proposals for more spending, he has a ready answer: ``They'd better
concentrate on the fact that the next president of the United
States is going to nominate three or four people to the Supreme
Court. Do they want Bush doing that? Or do they want Gore doing
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, who was a strategist for the Steve Forbes
campaign, said, ``Nobody wants to be held responsible for hurting
the nominee of the party who's at least talking about some
conservative issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political strategists say that Bush's aggressive efforts to
reach out has given him the upper hand over Gore in recent weeks.
They likened his approach to Bill Clinton's successful shift from
the liberal wing of his party when he ran for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying to emulate what we did,'' said Al From, who
heads the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group that was
a foundation for Clinton's bid for the White House. ``And he's had
no pressure from the Democrats or the right wing. Maybe the
Republican right will roll over dead and he'll have a free ride.
Then it will be up to Gore to show who's the imposter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some staunch supporters of the vice president warn that he
should not allow Bush to appropriate issues from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me squirm a little bit when he endorsed what we did on
Medicare,'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who has pressed his own party
to steer a moderate course, said of Bush. ``He's done it on
education, he's done it on health care. He's actually been
aggressive in those areas. Now Gore also has to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign officials said any advantage Bush may enjoy
will be short-lived. In coming days, they said, the vice president
will intensify his attacks, asserting that Bush cannot both call
for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years as he is proposing
more government spending. They also said Gore will begin to poke
holes in the Bush proposals themselves as mere window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What we call the Bob Jones Redemption Tour is flawed in a lot
of different ways,'' said Carter Eskew, a leading architect of the
Gore strategy. ``The more he talks about education and health care,
the more he exposes the fundamental flaw of his campaign: the tax
cut, which is a deal he had to make with the devil to secure his
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's move to the center ``might look like a politically
clever move,'' Eskew said, it will damage him in the end. ``If you
start to raise expectations that Bush is going to address those
problems, voters are going to put a spotlight on him. And we get
into a comparison. Guess what? That's our turf.''

ELIAN CASE PUTS FOCUS ON A CHILD'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ga., N.Y., Calif., Ill.)  (Eds.: With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal appeals court ruling Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez
case has startled experts on family law because it suggested that
immigration officials should ask 6-year-old Elian whether he wanted
to return to Cuba or remain with his Miami relatives, regardless of
the wishes of his father.
</P>
<P>
   But just how much control should a 6-year-old have over his
future? Beyond the international political fight, and the chanting
of the crowds outside a small Miami house, should Elian be able to
choose his country?
</P>
<P>
   At least until Elian's case, the answer under American law
seemed to be that a 6-year-old had no such right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is that parents decide for children,'' said Martin
Guggenheim, an expert on children's rights at New York University
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the language of the preliminary ruling from the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and the reaction of legal
experts this week, has suddenly placed unusual attention on a
little-examined corner of American law. In fact, very young
children, those under 12, are seldom asked to decide questions as
important as whether they will live with their parents, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers and judges pointed out that the appeals judges'
suggestion that Elian should be interviewed by immigration
officials did not mean that his preferences would carry any
significant weight. Immigration officials may still conclude that
he is too immature to make meaningful decisions about seeking
political asylum in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the experts said they were troubled by the fact that
the judges seemed actually to suggest that the boy had already made
meaningful decisions about seeking asylum. The court said not only
that Elian might be able to apply for asylum but ``it appears he
did so.'' The appeals judges noted that the 6-year-old had signed
an application filed with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a nearly meaningless question to ask a 6-year-old
whether he prefers one economic system to another economic system,
one culture to another culture,'' said Lee E. Teitelbaum, an expert
on juvenile law who is the dean of Cornell University Law School.
``These questions are hard enough for adults to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In American courts dealing with more routine disputes like
custody battles, older children are sometimes asked their views,
but courts do not necessarily feel bound to abide by them.
</P>
<P>
   That legal approach to children is based on a view that very
young children, do not have the maturity to make decisions about
their future and that to ask them to try may be psychologically
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal question is complicated in the Elian Gonzalez case
partly because there is no absolute rule in American law setting
forth how old children should be before their opinions are
considered in court. ``We tend not to draw the line,'' said Carol
Sanger, an expert on children's legal rights at Columbia Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanger said the courts have not expanded their flexible
approach to credit the wishes of a 6-year-old on an issue as
important as where he should live when a living parent has
expressed a strong desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a maturity standard,'' Sanger said. ``But the judicial
system thinks a 6-year-old is inherently immature. We think they
discuss what they want now: chocolate milk, an electric car.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said the suggestion by the appeals court that
officials should ask a 6-year-old to decide whether to seek asylum
violated principles that have been widely accepted in the legal
system. ``American courts think certain things have to be decided
by adults and the adults who decide them ought to be the parents,''
said Michael S. Wald, a specialist in children's legal issues at
Stanford University law school.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some expansion of children's rights in recent
years, with children treated less and less like the property of
their parents. In the 1970s, Hillary Rodham Clinton was one of the
proponents of that movement, writing law review articles proposing
the expansion of children's rights in some circumstances. (She has
said Elian should be reunited with his father.)
</P>
<P>
   But even taking into account this more modern view of children,
some experts say it would be difficult for the courts to use this
case to expand children's rights to the point of giving a
6-year-old veto power over his father's decision that no asylum
application should be filed for his son.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the varying treatment of children in the
American legal system depends on the context. For example, the
``age of majority'' at which children are deemed to be able to make
all decisions independently varies from 17 to 21. Under federal
law, 18-year-olds are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, children 7 and younger are typically deemed
so immature in their thought processes that they cannot form the
conscious intent to commit crimes. As a result, even when they
commit violent acts they are often immune from prosecution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when children are called upon to testify as witnesses,
judges apply a different test. They evaluate whether a potential
child witness understands the nature of the oath to tell the truth
by asking, for example, whether the child knows what it means to
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Guggenheim of New York University said that under that test,
very few 6- or 7-year-olds qualify to present sworn testimony. But
he said many courts across the country did hear sworn testimony in
civil and criminal trial from children 8 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Sanger of Columbia said the courts had different standards in
evaluating children's participation in court proceedings. As
witnesses of events involving other people, like observing a crime,
one test is whether a child would be a reliable witness. Many
courts have concluded that children can correctly report events
they have observed.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other experts said a different issue arose when a
child was being asked to explain in court what he or she wanted in
the future, for example, when parents were battling over custody.
In the cases of very young children, she said, courts have
overwhelmingly shied away from asking children to make choices
between parents.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because judges typically conclude that children
can be manipulated and that they can suffer psychologically when
they later consider the choices they made as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been concluded by the courts that for the majority of
children,'' Wald of Stanford said, ``it will be harmful for them to
have their voices heard because it puts them in loyalty conflicts
and it encourages disputes that get drawn out for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have suggested that Elian's Miami relatives
may be focusing on the issue of Elian's ostensible desire to seek
asylum here as a legal strategy to draw out the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier case that was similar in some ways, a 12-year-old
Ukrainian immigrant, Walter Polovchak, decided in 1980 with his
17-year-old sister that he did not wish to return to the Soviet
Union when his parents left the United States to return to their
country.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, an Illinois trial court first found that two
children were ``persons in need of supervision,'' which limited
their parents' rights. The court then declared the children wards
of the state. In the meantime, the Ukrainian boy had applied for
asylum. The asylum application was later granted.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was appealed, however, the Illinois appeals courts
overruled the trial court, saying the court had no grounds to limit
the parents' rights. Eventually, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled
that ``Walter should have been returned to his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time all of the court battles were over, Walter
Polovchak had turned 18 and had decided to remain in the United
States.

FOR PROTESTERS, HARD TO RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday, Kate Purdy was saving the world from
globalization. But Tuesday was the hard part: Going back to
Hampshire College, to be a normal sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, Purdy drove back to Washington. And by Friday,
four days after the anti-World Bank demonstrations ended, Purdy was
back in protest mode, joining some two dozen students and activists
from western Massachusetts who never left here at all.
</P>
<P>
   They called their mission ``solidarity,'' gathering outside the
District of Columbia jail in a vigil for the 150 or so activists
who had been held since the weekend until they were finally
released late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the students hanging around the lawn at the D.C. jail,
there seemed to be an after-shock quality to their efforts as well
_ what one student called a ``hangover,'' making it all but
impossible to return to the banality of daily life after taking on
the police, the World Bank, the economic structure of the entire
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shifts your priorities,'' Purdy, 19, said. ``A lot of
people had a lot of trouble getting back into the academic spheres
of their minds. I think we all naively assumed things would go back
to being the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Information, none of which could be confirmed, trickled out of
the jail for days: That the prisoners were on a hunger strike. That
groups of women had taken off all their clothes to avoid being
moved by police. That scores of vegetarians were unable to eat at
all, given the nature of jail food.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prisoners were there because they refused to give
their names, instead being labelled as Jane or John Doe. Under a
plea bargain reached late Friday, according to their lawyer, the
charges against the prisoners were reduced to jaywalking and they
were fined $5 each and released.
</P>
<P>
   Some had claimed they were mistreated in the jail but city
officials denied that.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, things have more or less returned to normal. The
last protest signs are being ripped down, and the last police
barricades outside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
headquarters were hauled away earlier in the week. The debate is
now post-game: Did the police act too aggressively? Did the World
Bank deserve the criticism? Did the protesters know what they were
fighting for at all?
</P>
<P>
   For a handful from Massachusetts, however, as well as some
others from Washington and other cities nearby, the demonstration
never stopped. They have been at the mercy of strangers for more
than a week, sleeping first at a Jewish Community Center, and then,
more recently, on the floor of a Washington church. They have
skipped class and work. They have barely slept. Many of them have
gotten sick.
</P>
<P>
   But they seem less eager to go home than to continue bonding
with one another. And for many of the students, the atmosphere
outside the D.C. jail was not all that different from life on an
especially grungy college campus quad: Some people sat huddled
together under plastic tarps. Others sang and played the drums. A
small group did yoga. At one point, the group went on an impromptu
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were really prepared for what the whole arrest
experience was going to be like,'' said Sienna Baskin, 22, a
substitute teacher who graduated from Hampshire College earlier
this year. ``After I got out of jail (where she spent the night),
there was just no way I could leave until I knew everyone was
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is what kept Kai Newkirk, 19, from going back to
his dog in western Massachusetts until early Friday. It has kept
Matthew Knoester, 25, a Roxbury public school teacher, here all
week. It is why Kazu Haga, 19, is missing work as a chef in
Amherst, and why Laura Anderson, 20, has missed history and writing
classes at Hampshire College, even though she knows doing so could
affect her grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in this kind of situation, when you have friends
in jail and hunger strikes, your perspective changes,'' Anderson
said Friday, as she crouched on a curb outside the D.C. jail under
gray skies. Nearby, beneath the painted protest signs stuck to the
make-shift tents on the jail lawn, lay giant plastic bags of bread,
cans of black beans and tins of coffee, at the ready in case a
group of prisoners was released. ``I'm not sure my professors will
be understanding. But that doesn't really matter as much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could quite explain the disproportionate number of people
from Massachusetts who hung on to the event, the first major
anti-globalization effort since last November, when thousands of
activists surprised the world by temporarily stopping the World
Trade Organization summit in Seattle. More than 1,000 Massachusetts
protesters were here over the weekend, organizers estimate.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the spirit of western Massachusetts _ long a bastion
of activism _ played a role. So did the sheer number of students,
whose schedules and idealism are at the foundation of many a noble
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just brought so many people down,'' said Haga, wearing a
black sweatshirt with Western Massachusetts emblazoned across it.
Against the bland brown backdrop of the D.C. jail, he spoke to
friends, chatted on a cell phone, and checked periodically to see
if any new information about the prisoners inside had been
released. ``We are very dedicated to staying until they get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, they were rewarded.

LARGEST SWISS BANK SEEKING PIONEER FUNDS, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Switzerland's biggest bank is a leader in the bidding
for Pioneer Funds, sources close to the situtation said, as the
Boston mutual fund group faces investor pressure to find a buyer by
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The sources say Union Bank of Switzerland has taken the lead in
a bidding process that began in February, when Pioneer hired two
investment bankers to shop the 72-year-old firm. Pioneer is
expected to announce a buyer before its May 16 annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   UBS's U.S.-based asset management group is Brinson Partners Inc.
of Chicago, which oversees $359 billion for institutions and in
mutual funds. UBS Brinson has bought other small U.S. investment
managers and is often seen as a buyer of American fund groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer manages about $24.5 billion of assets and has a long
history as a ``value'' player, or a firm that buys beaten-up stocks
rather than the growth technology stocks that have been dominating
the market in recent years. Brinson manages both growth and value
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer declined to comment on the bidders. In a letter to
shareholders last week, the company said, ``. . .your board is very
encouraged by the expressions of interest received to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Lens Investment Management of Portland, Maine, an activist
investor group, has launched a proxy fight against Pioneer. It
suggests the fund group could fetch between $29 per share and $42
per share in a sale, or between $760 million and $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer shares closed last week at $23.3125, down 25 cents. The
shares have risen 48 percent since Jan. 1, fueled by the buyout
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that the upper end of the range Lens
suggests would be rich for a firm that has failed to grow
significantly while rivals have surged ahead in the bull market.
However, a source said Fleet Financial Group bid aggressively for
Pioneer and was edged out, as were other bidders, by UBS.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bennett, director of governance for Lens, said the
suggested sale numbers were reasonable based on deals done in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Lens, in addition to pushing for a sale of Pioneer, is looking
to replace half of the fund company's board with its own nominees.
Pioneer, in the letter to shareholders last week, urged investors
not to approve Lens's nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Other large investors are interested in seeing Pioneer sold.
Mario Gabelli's Gabelli Funds of Rye, N.Y., hold an 8.9 percent
stake in Pioneer, and he has said he's for a sale. Southeastern
Asset Management Inc. of Memphis owns 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's chairman, John F. Cogan Jr., holds 13.6 percent of the
shares.

REGGIE JEFFERSON IN THE SWING IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last time I saw Reggie Jefferson, he was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He wants people to know that he has a job with a professional
baseball team in Japan that needs his services. He said he's sorry
he missed Opening Day at Fenway Park. His friends will understand.
The rest don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   He voiced these sentiments in sort of a goodwill gesture to the
Red Sox, who kept him off the playoff roster and then released him
in the offseason. After turning down three major league offers,
none of which came with a guarantee of playing time, the Seibu
Lions of the Pacific League came along and upped the ante by $1
million. Jefferson, 31, quickly accepted _ although he had never
visited Japan before spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson had very little choice. In 1999, he had managed only
206 at-bats and a .277 batting average while playing in just 83
games. These were clearly not good numbers for a designated
hitter/first baseman who earned $3.25 million in his final season
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed as a free agent in '95, Red Sox general manager
Dan Duquette referred to him as a ``professional hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although injuries plagued him during stops in Cincinnati,
Cleveland, and Seattle, the Red Sox took a chance after Jefferson
hit .347 in 122 games in '96 and gave him a three-year contract. It
seemed to be the right move the next year when Jefferson hit .317
and appeared in 136 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all downhill the next two seasons. In '98, Jefferson
played in just 62 games (and none after July 15) because of a lower
back strain. Last year, his absence from the lineup had more to do
with the manager's choice than injuries. The return of Mike Stanley
and the emergence of rookie Brian Daubach cut into Jefferson's
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the ax was near. But he didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew all along that they weren't going to put me on the
(playoff) roster,'' said Jefferson. ``They could have released me,
or something like that, during the season. The situation was dead.
A couple of teams did call the Red Sox. But with my salary, nobody
was going to make a deal with the Red Sox unless the club agreed to
pay some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told Mark Portugal in September that he could go home.
That's when I asked, `Why are you going to keep me around? You know
you're not going to use me.' Last year, I was hurt 90 days, and
even when I was there, I'm sure a lot of people felt like I was
done. You don't want to have three straight years in the big
leagues in which you don't play. I'm just glad that it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has no illusions about his immediate future. He signed
a one-year contract with the Lions, who are based in suburban
Tokyo. Barring injuries, he will try for another major league job
next year. In signing with Seibu, which has won 13 Pacific League
championships since '82, he will be with a winner playing in a
domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can withstand the rigors of a Japan League season,
and the lifestyle that goes with it, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Cecil Fielder,'' he said, referring to the
most famous Japanese crossover player. ``So obviously, this will be
a big adjustment. Ideally, this is for a guy who never got to play
in the major leagues, a guy who has been in Triple A for a while
and didn't get his shot. This is a chance for a guy like Lou
Merloni to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe if I come here and play every day, people know I'm
healthy. My idea is to play for a year. If nothing else, it will be
a good cultural experience. The worst I can do is come back in good
shape and get an offer to play in somebody's game. Also, there will
be several more dollars in the bank. It's not like I had that great
offer sitting on the table. So play here and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said it's hard to describe what it's like to play in
Japan after nine seasons in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to forget all the things you learn in the major
leagues in order to have success over here,'' said Jefferson. ``You
have to put everything out of your mind. And once you're here,
focus on what you have to do. Pitching, the umpires, the way they
play the game itself, you can't compare it. If you try to compare
it to the major leagues, you just make it hard on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said he is just glad the market has changed enough in
the last three years to allow veterans to make their own deals in
Japan. Until recently, younger players were sought for the slots
reserved for foreign players and the Japanese clubs received a
large chunk of the money. Jefferson still has power and Seibu
hasn't won a Japan Series championship since '92. Bigger
marketplace, more jobs, more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take it for what it is: Japanese baseball,'' said
Jefferson. ``I will just try to have a good year. That's how I look
at it. If I don't have a good year, that's fine, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've saved a little money for a rainy day. Mostly, I want it
to be a good experience. If I hit .200 and they send me home, I'd
still like for it to be a good experience. I've had a few cultural
experiences already that I won't forget.''

   DISNEY-VERDICT (Los Angeles) _ The Walt Disney Co. coerced an
executive dying from AIDS into signing away millions of dollars in
benefits, a federal jury ruled. In an 8-0 vote, jurors rejected
Disney's argument that Robert Jahn chose to give up his benefits
after he was discovered taking kickbacks. ``It's a moral victory.
This is the appropriate verdict. And I hope this corporation gets
the message. It shouldn't conduct business like this,'' said Larry
Sackey, an attorney for Jahn's estate. Disney's lawyer had no
comment. A judge will decide how much to award Jahn's estate. By

   MAHONY-FREEWAYS (Los Angeles) _ Can religious believers find
peace, or at least become patient motorists, on Los Angeles'
clogged freeways? That's one of the points Cardinal Roger Mahony
is, ahem, driving at in his Easter message. The Roman Catholic
archbishop of Los Angeles _ head of the nation's largest
archdiocese, located in the fatherland of America's freeways _
issued an Easter message highlighting several areas where believers
can remove ``obstacles in our lives,'' including, he said,
overcoming frayed nerves that cause loss of temper and hostility
toward other motorists. He also tailored his remarks to other
aspects of life in L.A., including the area's ethnic diversity. It
should be noted he is building a new cathedral above the Hollywood
Freeway. By Rick Orlov. (Will move in the ``a'' national and ``n''

BOY'S RELATIVES, US SEEKING WAY TO PLACE HIM IN FATHER'S CARE

<P>
   MIAMI _ ``Outside parties'' in Miami are drafting a plan that
would transfer Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his
father's care, Justice Department officials confirmed Friday night.
The officials said they ``would welcome a real agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A department official would not disclose who the third parties
were, except to say they were people from the Miami community and
that they were working with the Miami relatives and were in contact
with Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are still working out the details of such a
plan,'' the official said, adding that ``significant gaps''
remained in the negotiations and that an immediate transfer to the
father must be included. The plan had not been presented to Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, who came to the United States from
Cuba 17 days ago to reunite with his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   After a tense day of swirling reports that Reno was ready to
send law-enforcement officials into Little Havana to retrieve the
boy, the unexpected news of a plan for a peaceful, negotiated
settlement raised hopes inside the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is the appearance of viability here, and as
long as that possibility exists, it has to be explored,'' a Justice
Department spokeswoman said. She said she expected the deal to be
brokered or die within hours. ``Whoever these outside parties are,
they have a vested interest in having this ended peacefully. They
saw the writing on the wall, and they are trying to have families
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez Friday afternoon and told him
she could ``not commit to a particular course of action or
timetable'' to reunite him with his son. It is not clear what the
status of the mediation in Miami was, or whether Reno discussed it
with Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the Justice Department, plans were still going
forward to remove the Cuban boy from his Miami relatives as early
as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not ruled out this weekend,'' a Justice Department
spokeswoman said, adding that law-enforcement officials were still
weighing such factors in Little Havana as crowd size, the weather,
and the public reaction to taking Elian from his great-uncle's
house over Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to minimize civilian injury, not to mention
casualties, and trauma to the child, and we want to utilize the
option with the highest probability of officer safety,'' the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Elian's temporary home in Little Havana, Cuban-American
protesters reacted angrily to reports of plans to seize the boy.
Even as community leaders continued to advocate peaceful
resistance, a small number of ardent Cuban exiles warned that an
attempt by federal authorities to forcibly remove the young refugee
could be a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving him back,'' said Jose Clemente, a
construction worker who was born in Cuba, arrived in Miami as a
child, and later served in the US Army. ``We don't want violence,
but if they break the law and try to take that kid by force, we're
going to have another Waco, I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   Waving a large replica of the flag that flew over Cuba before
Castro's revolution, Clemente said, ``They're going to have to kill
a couple of people here, and we're ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to confirm reports that she had decided to send
agents to break the human chain in Little Havana. ``If I were going
to do something like that, I certainly wouldn't tell you,'' she
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to work it out,'' Reno said before her
15-minute meeting Friday with Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his lawyer,
Gregory B. Craig. ``I'm exploring every possibility I can to see
this resolved peacefully, promptly, and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released later, Reno said she assured
Gonzalez that she would continue working to reunite him with his
child. ``I was deeply moved by Mr. Gonzalez's evident love for his
son,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department reported receiving more than 7,000 calls
Friday in the wake of a public plea Thursday that Americans back
his cause. Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's spokesman, said the
White House had gotten ``a good volume of calls'' that
overwhelmingly supported the father's request.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Clinton Friday also heard from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
who wrote them that ``the forcible separation of Elian and his
current caregivers is unwise and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation, not confrontation, is what is in young Elian's best
interest at this critical point in time,'' said Bush, who urged the
federal officials to accept an offer by the 11th Circuit Court in
Atlanta to provide mediation services to resolve the custody
dispute between Elian's father and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a meeting, free of governmental pressure and away from
the glare of media attention, would present the best chance for a
family-inspired solution to this controversy,'' said Bush, a
Republican and the brother of GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, which on Wednesday ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until it decides whether he should get an asylum
hearing, suggested the custody case be mediated, but it did not
order it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says it does not object to family talks
as long as the Miami relatives, who have cared for Elian since he
was rescued from a shipwreck on Thanksgiving day, are prepared to
turn the boy over to his father. In a meeting with federal
officials in Miami Friday, Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle,
reportedly again refused to accept that condition.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, at the White House, repeated what the president said
Thursday, when he weighed in with his most substantive comments on
the case. ``The time for (the Miami relatives) to come forward and
effect a transfer to the father is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was not aware of any new overtures from the
Miami relatives, and he questioned how serious they had been in the
past about reuniting father and son. The steps they had taken so
far, he said, proved to be ``false starts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that if that's what they'd like, they should
come forward in good faith and do that,'' Lockhart said.``You know,
this is not about playing games, it's not about public relations,
it's not about trying to influence the coverage of this. It should
be about coming forward and doing what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   No official suggested the government is playing games with a
threat to use force in Miami, but it may be waving its trump card
as it tries to get the Miami relatives to relent and give up the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of brinksmanship that comes into
play,'' a Justice Department official said. ``If you have the whole
federal government staring into your face, saying we are coming
tomorrow with all these law-enforcement officers to support us,
there is a possibility, albeit slim, that the family will talk
turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials understand the dangers involved, both physical
and in public opinion. To minimize crowds and the risk of violence,
the Justice Department is relying on local police to push back
barricades and block additional streets around the Gonzalez home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can minimize the numbers of protesters, but people may try
to jump the barricades, and get arrested, and maybe there will be
bloodshed,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said. ``This stuff is
not going to look pretty or nice, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is obviously concerned about that. Chief of
staff John Podesta was getting periodic updates from the Justice
Department on the situation, and Lockhart said the president would
be briefed before the attorney general ordered a law-enforcement
action.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart denied reports that the White House is dissatisfied
with Reno and her agency's handling of the case. ``The president
has been very supportive of the work they've done,'' Lockhart said.
``He has done his best to make sure that he does nothing to inject
politics further into this.''
</P>
<P>
   As Easter weekend began, Elian was seen increasingly in the
heavily Catholic exile community as a symbol of hope that Cuba one
day will triumph over Castro's regime. Several demonstrators
marched through Little Havana with crosses on their shoulders,
advocating keeping Elian with his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a spiritual war, and I don't know how they can battle
that,'' Connie Crespo, a Cuban-American exile, said of the Clinton
administration. ``They're going by the laws made by men, which has
nothing to do with what God has in mind.''

 &HT;    Al-Amin flown back to Georgia
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin is back in Georgia,
after unexpectedly abandoning his extradition fight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals flew Al-Amin in a helicopter from Alabama to
Atlanta soon after the extradition hearing ended, said Arnold
Perkins, spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's office in Atlanta. He was
then driven to the Cobb County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is accused of killing one Fulton County deputy and
seriously injuring another.
</P>
<P>
   A decoy vehicle with an armed escort also drove to Atlanta from
Alabama, followed by television news crews.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said the heavy security and decoy was ``just for
security purposes. We didn't know what to expect ...'' Nancy
Bodiford, spokeswoman for the Cobb Sheriff's Department, said
Al-Amin is being held without bond in the jail on the original
warrant for his arrest for failure to appear in court on relatively
minor charges _ theft by receiving a stolen car, impersonating an
officer and no proof of insurance. Fulton Deputies Ricky Kinchen
and Aldranon English were shot trying to serve that warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Bodiford said Cobb will eventually release Al-Amin to
authorities in Fulton County to answer the more serious charges
against him there.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County officials would not discuss Al-Amin's whereabouts
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's decision to waive extradition came at the end of a
hearing at which flamboyant attorney J.L. Chestnut argued that
documents authorizing his client's return from Alabama were
improper because they were signed by Gov. Don Siegelman's legal
advisor and not the governor. Chestnut didn't repeat allegations
raised in earlier petitions that there was a government conspiracy
against his client and that Al-Amin's life would be in danger if
brought back to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles Price ordered a 90 minute recess to consider the
legal argument. When he re-convened the hearing, Chestnut stepped
forward and withdrew his petition to keep Al-Amin in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, who had promised a long battle to keep Al-Amin from
being brought back, said the decision to waive extradition was a
joint one between him and Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been dealing with things in Georgia and here and when
some things were put in place in Georgia we were prepared to go
back. But we were not prepared to do anything in the midst of the
hysteria that I saw in two states,'' Chestnut said later.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut wouldn't say what has changed to make it safe for
Al-Amin's return. But he said there has been a cooling off period
and that has eased tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of hysteria did not surround Timothy McVeigh, who
blew up a federal building in Oklahoma and killed 168 people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's court proceedings lasted less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The packed courtroom, which was filled with Al-Amin supporters,
security and reporters, grew tense as Al-Amin rose to make a
statement. His only previous public utterance has been, ``It's a
government conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of accusing his accusers, Al-Amin read a brief,
prayerful statement inviting people to be Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nations are raised by their righteousness,'' he said, ``and
they fall by their corruption of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his statement, Al-Amin thanked the court saying,
``I appreciate your patience and your tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Friedly, spokesman for Fulton County District Attorney Paul
Howard, said that if routine is followed, Al-Amin's first
appearance would be at his plea and arraignment sometime within the
next two weeks. At that hearing, the state would have to announce
if it plans to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Martin, one of Al-Amin's Atlanta attorneys, attended the
hearing Friday and met with Chestnut and Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad he's back in Atlanta,'' Martin said Friday
afternoon. ``He wants to fight these charges. He wants to prove his
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said it's too early in the process to predict when
Al-Amin could be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just learning the facts in this case. We're
investigating those facts, carefully and calmly. It behooves us all
to reserve judgment,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin couldn't predict when Al-Amin would stand trial in
Georgia. That depends on whether the prosecution seeks the death
penalty and other factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first order of business,'' Martin said, ``is to find out
what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Joshua B. Good, David
Pendered and Jack Warner contributed to this report.

<P>
   When the mayor of a small Midwestern town and his wife decided
they needed marriage counseling, they were wary of seeking out a
local therapist, for fear of gossip. So without ever leaving their
home, they turned to the place where millions of anonymous business
and personal transactions take place each day: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's cyber-search eventually landed them in the All
Rivers Online Christian Counseling Center, where they plugged in
their credit card number and began engaging in e-mail counseling
with a psychologist who billed himself as ``Dr. Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans turning to the Internet to find the perfect sofa,
or even a car, then why not a therapist?
</P>
<P>
   To the excitement, and alarm, of experts in the field, new
mental-health Web sites are beginning to pop up almost daily, and
many are offering the type of counseling once offered only in the
intimacy of a therapist's office.
</P>
<P>
   The players range from the folksy, like ``Dr. Ralph'' D'Onofrio,
a psychologist-Internet entrepreneur whose other ventures include
Childprayer.com, a site that processes prayer requests for sick
children, to nonprofit organizations that provide services like
depression-screening tests, to Ivy League psychiatry professors who
have developed sleekly designed Web sites featuring advice from
doctors with high-brow credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the free-form world of the Internet, the therapists
are not subject to the rigorous system of interstate licensing that
governs conventional, in-office counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is so new that the major professional
organizations are just working out their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on mental health agree that online counseling,
through e-mail, real-time e-mail exchange, and eventually video
conferencing, is one of the most promising developments of the
maturing Internet because it opens up new treatment options to
people in remote areas, the disabled and those who feel too
stigmatized to seek treatment for mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This form of communication is very important, because we have
overcome the basic limitations of space and distance _ and those
are worth overcoming,'' said Dr. Zebulon Taintor, chairman of the
American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Telemedicine who is
a professor of psychiatry at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has drafted some guidelines for online psychiatry
that address issues like appropriate behavior for doctors. Taintor
said he expected approval by the association in late May.
</P>
<P>
   But Mirean Coleman, head of the policy and practice of clinical
social work committee for the National Association of Social
Workers, said privacy issues related to the Internet would have to
remedied before her group would recommend online treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, skeptics say the medium's anonymity allows patients to
misrepresent themselves by disguising their appearance. At the very
least, the skeptics say, doctors are at a disadvantage when they
cannot hear the inflections of a patient's voice. Nor, they point
out, is there anything to prevent an unqualified entrepreneur from
putting out a shingle as a mental-health expert.
</P>
<P>
   And while the fledgling field of online psychiatry has yet to
yield any documented disasters, some Web sites have taken
precautionary steps to prevent crises like suicides. Some, for
example, have installed emergency systems where severely troubled
patients are automatically referred to a local suicide hot line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some mental health experts see a world full of potential
catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible, and it could be disastrous,'' said Dr.
Sheldon Miller, head of the department of psychiatry and behavioral
sciences at Northwestern University and Hospital. ``You just don't
deal with strangers in that kind of format and expect anything
wonderful to happen. There's no way of controlling the outcome, and
I have a real problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethical questions are just beginning to emerge, because
medical-related Web sites, and particularly those devoted to
psychiatric care, are ``embryonic,'' said Claudine Singer, a senior
analyst with the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications.
Specific numbers for psychiatry-related Web sites are not
available, she said, and of the roughly 17,000 medical sites, only
200 can be considered legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everything on the Internet, it is the quality and
thoroughness of the product that doctors are most concerned about.
But unlike buying a broken Palm Pilot on eBay, going wrong with
medical treatment can have serious consequences, doctors warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a danger wherever there isn't a complete
diagnosis,'' Taintor said, stressing the importance of a
traditional, in-office doctor's visit before engaging in online
treatment. ``You want to have as much data as possible, and
anything that compromises that is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Taintor added: ``If you were to ask where I recommend
telemedicine, it's wherever a psychiatrist isn't available. I still
think face-to-face treatment, with three dimensions and all the
textures that go on between doctor and patient, is much more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who most zealously promote online psychiatric
treatment say it could dramatically change the way patients and
doctors communicate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into chat rooms, you can see that people do establish
intense relationships with other people, and they tend to disclose
much more than they would when face to face,'' said Dr. Robert
Gugliemo, formerly the senior director of New York City's Family
Court Forensic Clinical Service and an assistant professor or
psychiatry at New York Medical College who is now one of the new
breed of psychologists turned entrepreneur. Along with a colleague,
Dr. Arthur Sullivan, he has co-founded Mentalhealthline.com, a Web
site that offers mental health services, including counseling
through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, another reason for the enthusiasm of mental
health professionals is money. Because mental illness tends to be a
chronic problem, psychiatric Web sites could translate into repeat
visits, turning them into a money-making venture, Singer says.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliemo said, ``There is a big expectation that this could be
very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate as to how patients should be charged for
treatment. D'Onofrio, for example, charges according to how much
time he spends reading and responding to an e-mail; typically,
after an initial free consultation, about $25 to $30 an hour. But
others, like Taintor, shun the idea of billing by the hour.
Gugliemo and Sullivan, meanwhile, hope to work with insurance
companies to find ways to cover online counseling through corporate
employee assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Kramer, a professor of psychiatry at Brown University
who is the author of ``Should You Leave?'' and ``Listening to
Prozac,'' said it was the uncertain future of conventional
psychiatry that led him to explore professional opportunities on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard time for psychiatry,'' said Kramer, who is on
the advisory board of Here2Listen.com, a psychiatric service site
that is backed by several Ivy League professors. ``Now, doctors
tend to be funded on an ad-hoc basis. I don't know just which
direction things are going to take, but I thought that with this,
at least there's some hope that if you get it right, you could set
some standard of quality and build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here2Listen.com, which was started in February, features
articles by doctors on topics like infidelity and ways to overcome
shyness. The e-counseling portion of the site went online April 17,
and includes a database of 300 psychiatrists where patients search
for the right doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can set your criteria, like that you want an
African-American doctor in Chicago, and we'll find them for you,''
said Susan Sheehan, spokeswoman for Here2Listen.
</P>
<P>
   Patients plug in their credit card numbers and engage in
one-on-one e-counseling in a secure chat room with a professional;
fees vary according to what the individual doctor would charge for
an in-office visit.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Taintor, have been more fully engaged in using
telemedical treatments for years, at least in a supplemental
fashion. As part of his work with the Bedford Hills Correctional
Facility in Westchester County, N.Y., Taintor works with inmates
who were seeing a therapist before they were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a drug-addicted woman who had ``really bonded''
with one of the psychiatrists in Taintor's private practice was
incarcerated at Bedford Hills. Now that woman speaks with her
doctor each week via teleconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those involved in the nonprofit sector are also
working on developing online tools for coping with often
stigmatized mental illness, particularly depression.
</P>
<P>
   Shela Halper, vice president of education for the National
Mental Health Association, said depression was the No. 1-searched
illness on the Internet. In response, the association recently
started offering depression screenings on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking a depression screening test is one of the quickest and
easiest ways of knowing if someone's experiencing depression,''
Halper said. ``About 9 million Americans experience it, but less
than a third of them seek treatment because they're not aware of
signs and symptoms,'' or they are afraid to talk to their doctor
about it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a screening test online and then bringing the results to
a psychiatrist can be the first step in treating a potential mental
illness, Halper said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the new breed of Web doctors are beginning to realize
for themselves the limits and opportunities associated with
practicing on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Brett'' _ the Midwestern mayor who sought
online marital counseling with his wife _ D'Onofrio, who is based
in Indiana, said he realized that e-mail alone would not give him
enough information to treat them, and he added some telephone
conversations to their counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is great, but when they first contacted me I knew I
needed to talk to them _ there are some things you can only get
over the phone,'' Dr. D'Onofrio said. ``First, I feel out if I can
be of help, and if they can be comfortable with me. Sometimes I'll
tell people they need to go to a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy, also, is a natural concern when dealing with the
Internet, particularly when sensitive information is being
transmitted through computer servers that do not always seem
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Ken Starr showed the world, you can retrieve lots of e-mail
messages you thought were deleted, even at the White House,'' said
Taintor, who does not rely on e-mail as a primary means of
communication with his patients.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the issue of licensing: How to translate
interstate regulations into a world where no such boundaries exist?
</P>
<P>
   ``In medicine, licensing is a control, a way to monitor,'' said
Dr. Miller of Northwestern. ``But the Internet doesn't deal with
that, and the consuming public has no idea who's back there.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Federation of State Medical Boards said that
the federation had not yet considered the licensing issue, and that
so far, state medical boards were simply cautioning prospective
users of mental-health sites to check the credentials of the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some doctors are hesitant about associating
themselves with what many consider an unreliable medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm wary,'' said Kramer, the Brown professor. ``Or at
least, I was wary, but I think there is room for extremely
responsible material on the Internet.''

HACKER IS SAID TO LIVE IN A MONTREAL SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ILE BIZARD, Quebec _ It is the picture of North American
suburban normalcy: a new four-bedroom house on the edge of a golf
course, an orange basketball left outside in the rain by the
15-year-old son, a soggy cigar butt left outside on a plastic chair
by dad.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Canadian and American police, the
15-year-old basketball player is Mafiaboy, for the moment charged
as North America's latest computer criminal. From this house, the
Canadian police have carted away computers that they say the
ninth-grader used to sabotage CNN.com on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing OK,'' a young man who answered the door said Friday
of his younger brother, the 15-year-old. The older brother cut
short questions, noting that his father and brother were out and
that his girlfriend was visiting Friday, a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent suburban normalcy was also the image painted Friday by
Yan Romanowski, the Montreal lawyer hired to defend the 15-year-old
against two charges of criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is your everyday teen-ager, not the kind of guy who
isolates himself in a basement,'' said the lawyer, adding that he
had known the family for years. He ``attends high school, has many
friends, enjoys sports, wears baggy clothes, Nike sneakers'' and
his cap turned backward, Romanowski continued. ``He has never
committed nor been accused of any criminal offense, nor has he been
involved with police authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, citing classmates and law enforcement
officials, reported Friday that the boy had been suspended
repeatedly from two high schools over the last two years. In
response, Romanowski said: ``I have absolutely no knowledge of the
veracity or falseness of that, or of his grades. I am more
concentrated on preparing the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the cul-de-sac in this upper-middle-class, largely
English-speaking development in Montreal's western suburbs, Denis,
a computer consultant who declined to give his last name, said he
had talked to the boy's father, John Calce, on Wednesday night,
hours after the authorities disclosed the charges. ``He said he
didn't know anything about the computer stuff,'' the neighbor said
of Calce, a heavy-set, 45-year-old bus company executive who
routinely goes out on the front porch to smoke a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN site was hit in a wave of strikes in early February that
blocked or hindered access to some of the biggest Web sites for
hours at a time. In the attacks, remote computing centers were
taken over and used to relay streams of meaningless data at the
target site, overwhelming it with traffic. A spokeswoman for
CNN.com, which is owned by Time Warner, said the site was
``seriously affected'' for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, some computer experts have surmised that more
than one person was involved because of certain differences in
technique, and that copycats may have gotten into the act. If so,
Mafiaboy was not most skilled among them, the authorities said on
Wednesday _ or in any case, not the most careful. ``He was not what
we would call a genius in that field,'' said Inspector Yves Roussel
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence that led to the Montreal boy, authorities
said, were records from a California campus computing center used
as a relay point and online conversations by someone using the
Mafiaboy screen name. But in the end, the police say, it was Calce
who precipitated his son's arrest, and his own.
</P>
<P>
   About two months ago, investigators from the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police questioned Calce's 15-year-old son about the
attacks. Without enough information to make an arrest, they placed
wiretaps on the family's telephones.
</P>
<P>
   In listening to family conversations, the police say, they
overheard Calce conspire with a friend to have a business associate
assaulted. In a raid before dawn last Saturday, police officers
arrested father and son. Calce and his friend were charged with
conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. Both men pleaded not
guilty and were released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Calce, who lives here with his second wife and two sons from his
previous marriage, put his house up for sale last summer, asking
the equivalent of about $320,000, high for a Montreal suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Calce's 15-year-old son, whose name the Canadian authorities
have not used because he is a minor, pleaded not guilty and was
freed on conditions that forbid him from going on the Internet,
from entering a business with computers, or from going into a
computer store. Also, he is not to talk with his three closest
friends, a restriction requested by prosecutors who hope to use
them as witnesses against him. In online chats, Mafiaboy had
bragged of temporarily disabling a host of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say my client is Mafiaboy,'' said Romanowski, the
defense lawyer. ``But according to what I have read, many other
people around the world have bragged about being Mafiaboy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities are considering whether to file any charges
against Calce's son or any others involved in the attacks, Steven
Berry, an FBI spokesman, said Friday from Washington. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, who are handling the investigation, have
said they may bring additional charges against the boy once they
have finished studying the seized computers.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski predicted that a trial would expose the vulnerability
of the Internet, with sabotage ``recipes'' posted for easy
retrieval and ``security experts who don't take the necessary
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-known hackers have offered their support and help,''
he said, adding that his defense work would be bolstered by ``a
team of computer systems specialists and computer security
specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the lawyer said he hoped the interest of news
organizations would fade so that his 15-year-old client could get
back to his weekend basketball and final exams at Riverdale High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that he will be back in school on Tuesday,''
Romanowski said.

   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe _ Rallying behind Zimbabwe's president,
Robert Mugabe, the leaders of three of this country's closest
neighbors called on Britain Friday night to follow through with
financial pledges to support land reform here in its former colony.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after several hours of talks in Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe's premier resort city, the presidents of Mozambique,
Namibia and South Africa said they were satisfied that Mugabe was
taking the steps necessary to halt the ongoing occupation of
white-owned farms by blacks and end the violence that has flared in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the regional leaders insisted that only action by Britain
would ultimately resolve the question of how to redistribute land
to the vast majority of the population that has no land. When
blacks won majority rule from a white-led government 20 years ago,
the agreement with the former colonial ruler governing the
transition period committed Britain to helping pay to redistribute
land from white owners to black peasants.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement reached in 1998 was supposed to have accelerated
the acquisition and redistribution of that land. But nations
helping pay for the plan objected to the way the limited land
reforms had been carried out, and they held off on financing
Zimbabwe's efforts. This in turn touched off a standoff between
Britain and Zimbabwe that persists today.
</P>
<P>
   The backing Friday by the three presidents was a victory for
Mugabe, who has faced mounting international pressure to act
against the thousands of squatters occupying white-owned farms
around the country. Led by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa,
the three leaders refused to criticize publicly the 76-year-old
president, who was one of the leaders of the fight against white
minority rule more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki and Presidents Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Sam
Nujoma of Namibia said Friday that they had been asked by the
British government to reach out to Mugabe and begin the work of
rebuilding the bridge between Zimbabwe and Britain. The two
countries have been locked in a war of words in recent months, with
the tone escalating as the crisis here has deepened.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension appears to be easing after Mugabe's efforts this
week to mediate the dispute between white farmers who own much of
the country's fertile land and protesters who are leading the fight
to be given that land. Britain had already invited a Zimbabwean
delegation to London for talks on British financial support for
land reform. The ministers from Zimbabwe are expected to arrive
there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the presidents' meeting, Britain reaffirmed Friday
night that money was available for land reform. Peter Hain, the
Foreign Office minister, said Britain would dicuss a fair land
reform program and fair elections ``within the rule of law'' with
the Zimbabwean delegation in London next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been on the table since 1998,'' Hain said. ``We have
been waiting since then for President Mugabe to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, who has publicly condoned the farm invasions, has been
accused of exploiting the land issue as a way to hold on to
political support for his party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union _ Patriotic Front, which faces parliamentary elections next
month. With the economy a shambles and a new opposition party
drawing considerable support, the governing party is facing its
most serious electoral threat since it came to power 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the government is using the farm invasions as one
instrument in a campaign of intimidation against supporters of the
new party, the Movement for Democratic Change. Two white farmers
who back the new party and two black members of the party have been
killed in the last week in confrontations with the farm squatters
and governing party supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe's counterparts said their meeting with the embattled
leader had convinced them that Mugabe wants to see an end to the
occupation and the violence.

VENTURE CAPITAL IS OPENING DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See INTERNET-ENTREPRENEUR FOR alternate viewpoint)  
(For release Sun., April 23) 
 By TIMOTHY DRAPER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ To say that entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists are wasting money in these exuberant times is
provincial at best, and anti-markets, anti-risk-taking and
downright un-American at worst. It is true that in many instances,
young entrepreneurs are spending like drunken soldiers on leave
(hopefully, none are in our portfolio), but they are the exception,
not the rule, and market forces quickly dispose of inefficient
market behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The typical start-up aspires to be the leader in its space,
often requiring a big marketing budget to grab market share before
the competition does. Creative marketing doesn't have to be
expensive, but I know that when a company has a breakthrough and
customers are anxious to buy, it is time to pour in the rocket
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the greatest revolution in the history of the
world. And for all the capital we have plowed into Internet
businesses, we are probably undercapitalizing the industry as a
whole. When adequately capitalized, these revolutionary companies
can improve our quality of life that much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   I say this with confidence because, through our investment
activities and those of our affiliates, I have been privy to a
glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, we backed one of the first Internet companies, Internet
Software, which has since been acquired. Internet Software showed
us that commerce could be done on the Web. About two years later,
we financed Hotmail, which used ``viral'' marketing to spread to
more than 11 million users in its first 18 months and serves about
100 million today. Sabeer Bhatia, the founder, sent one e-mail
message to a friend in India, and three weeks later Hotmail had
100,000 registered users there.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it was clear that the Internet was global _ it
could reach and connect us all. Put this information together with
the fact that commerce could be done on the Web, and you have a
phenomenon that can break through the bad governance of India, and
presumably China, Pakistan, Africa and even the United States,
allowing everyone in the world to participate actively in the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of selling widgets to the usual 500 million suspects,
a company could reach all six billion of us! That could conceivably
power a 12-fold increase in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers suggest that all Internet profit margins will
collapse and cite a few examples from electronic retailing. The
margin shrinkage that they envision happens in all commodity
businesses. But how do America Online, Yahoo, Microsoft, GoTo.com,
NetZero, Kana, Tumbleweed, Digital Impact and so on all have
expanding margins? Clearly, they are not commodity businesses; they
are changing the way the world works.
</P>
<P>
   The margins I see collapsing are not commercial, but
governmental. The Internet allows a new kind of competition that
could drive down government's share of the nation's economic output
to 15 or 20 percent, from 40 percent today. Sure, the military and
the police may still have to be location-based monopolies. But why
couldn't I choose my Social Security program, my education program,
my welfare program and my medical program from a host of choices in
cyberspace? Competitive efficiency in government would be
refreshing, and very good for long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   I do not hope to predict exactly what will happen, or how. But
the market shaped by these changes will be a venture capitalist's
dream. Our $10 trillion economy could grow by an order of
magnitude, to more than $100 trillion. Where will the value be
created? In Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ones like GoTo.com, with its auction system for Web
marketing, or Tumbleweed, with its efficient, secure digital
delivery of customer information, or Aveo, which gives computer
users support even before they know they need it, or EdgeMail,
which helps companies base all their operations on the Web without
needing Windows. These and others like them are real companies
generating real margins that nonetheless need cash to continue
their growth.
</P>
<P>
   I would say that the $60 billion or so that the venture capital
industry has invested around the globe is well justified and even a
little light, given the immensity of the market we are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is creating this value in every sector of the world
economy, not just in technology fields. Every industry will be
recreated, from sporting goods (think of FogDog, say) to mail order
(Digital Impact). The number of new companies doing the recreating
will grow exponentially, and so will their size.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors will be believers one day, Doubting Serges the
next _ but the revolution will rage on.

JUSTICE OFFICIALS HOLD OUT HOPE FOR ACCORD ON ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinging to what appeared to be a frail hope for a
last-minute settlement of the custody battle over Elian Gonzalez,
Justice Department officials said Friday night that unnamed
intermediaries were working on an agreement under which the boy's
Miami relatives would immediately turn over the child to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The department said in a statement that ``outside parties in
Miami are in the process of putting together a plan for a
cooperative resolution that would include the immediate transfer of
Elian to his father's care.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who the unnamed parties were _
although some officials identified them as Miami political leaders
_ or whether the proposed agreement would be acceptable to the
Miami relatives, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But a Justice official said the plan, which included an
arrangement in which Elian would meet his father at a neutral site
along with the Miami relatives, had not yet been presented to
Elian's father or the government.
</P>
<P>
   A day that began with Justice Department officials dourly
resigned to using force to retrieve the child ended with the
unexpectedly buoyant prospect that unofficial efforts might succeed
where the government had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father met earlier Friday with Attorney General Janet
Reno in what officials described as an emotional plea for his son,
but Reno emerged saying she could offer no specific timetable for
their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that throughout the day that Reno held
out the possibility, however remote, that the Miami relatives would
at last yield to the government's demands to relinquish the boy,
realizing that she was poised to use force to obtain custody of the
child.
</P>
<P>
   But those fragile hopes seemed to collapse after a private
meeting between the Justice Department community relations
officials in Miami and Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and
his daughter, Marisleysis, who has helped care for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, they said, department officials offered Elian's
Miami relatives a final chance to negotiate the boy's surrender to
authorities. But the relatives stood their ground, unrelenting in
their refusal to give up the boy unless his father came to Miami to
get him _ precisely the same conditions that led to the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, Reno and Doris Meissner, the
immigration commissioner, met for about 15 minutes with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, who has asked that the government
fulfill its commitment to deliver Elian to him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez left the department looking grim as officials said the
meeting was an emotional session in which the father pleaded to be
reunited with his son, saying that he and his child had suffered
through the long custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, in a written statement, Reno said that she
had little optimism. ``I could not commit to a particular course of
action or timetable,'' she said. ``I was deeply moved by Mr.
Gonzalez's evident love for his son. I assured him I would continue
working toward the goal of reuniting him with his child.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Reno told reporters that she still hoped to
resolve the stand-off. ``I'm exploring every possibility I can to
see this resolved peacefully, promptly and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was ready to dispatch federal agents to take the
child, Reno replied, ``If I were going to do something like that, I
certainly wouldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the possibility of a peaceful solution ebbed away, Reno's
advisers seemed to have little advice left to give, relying on
outside parties to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Reno sat in her fifth-floor office at the Justice
Department agonizing about whether and when to send a team of
federal agents to retrieve the child from the home of his
great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' defiance of government threats to take him
forcibly energized the demonstrations in the neighborhood where
Elian has been staying since he was rescued from the Atlantic last
Thanksgiving after his mother and others drowned in an attempt to
flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, several hundred
Cuban-Americans continued to bask in Wednesday's court victory but
remained concerned that the government might try to remove the boy
and reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that they'll try to get the boy at night,''
said Carlos Hernandez, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might try to fool us. They might say one thing and do
another, so you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exiles, however, were determined to prevent efforts to
take the boy. Dozens of people, rosaries in hand or carrying wooden
crosses, prayed for divine intervention. Others chanted, ``Elian,
my friend, God is with you,'' in Spanish. Still others vowed to
give their lives should government agents appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought for this and we won't get up,'' said Reynaldo
Ramos, 57. ``We won't leave until this thing is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd periodically was buoyed by the appearance of the boy,
who would scramble into the yard and wave to admirers before
ducking back into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian, you won't go! Elian, you won't go!'' the crowd chanted
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno remained reluctant throughout the day to give the
final authorization to begin the operation, immigration officers
and federal marshals readied a plan to sweep unannounced in the
Little Havana neighborhood after days of surveillance to gauge when
they were likely to encounter the least resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the operation could come at any time
over the weekend or early next week. The officials acknowledged
that any tactical maneuver would probably be complicated by the
increasingly vocal protesters who gathered Friday in the

authorities from removing the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As efforts to resolve the issue progressed, some Florida
political leaders sought more time for mediation. In a letter to
President Clinton and Reno, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican,
said that negotiations should be given another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said using force was ``unwise and unwarranted'' and that
``mediation not confrontation is what is in young Elian's best
interest at this critical point in time.''

   WHERE-THE-HEART-IS-FILM (Undated) _ People don't get much more
alone in the world than Novalee Nation in the early scenes of
``Where the Heart Is.'' She's 17, very pregnant and even barefoot _
since her shoes fell through a huge hole in the car floor somewhere
between Tennessee and Oklahoma. On the drive from her trailer-park
home to a new life in California, she makes the mistake of asking
her boyfriend to stop at a Wal-Mart so she can go to the bathroom.
When she returns to the parking lot, he and the car are gone.
Novalee (Natalie Portman, looking radiant but very un-Queen
Amidala-like) does the only thing she can think of, since she
doesn't know a soul in Sequoyah, Okla. She goes back into the
store, and when it closes for the night (while she's in the ladies'
room) she just stays. Thanks to the camping, patio furniture and
exercise equipment departments and shelves full of magazines and
working alarm clocks, she's quite comfortable for six weeks. After
she goes into labor there she's a local celebrity, and little by
little she builds a life in Sequoyah, with the usual ups and downs,
weddings and funerals, kidnappings and tornados. Directed by Matt
Williams, ``Where the Heart Is,'' opens on Friday. By Anita Gates.

   POPULAR-CULTURE-FILMS (Undated) _ What do we really talk about
with our friends when we're not discussing the vicissitudes of our
personal lives? Why, popular culture, of course! Much of the
conversational glue that binds us together comes from the stuff
that wafts off television, movie and computer screens, from our
stereo speakers and headsets. But go to almost any Hollywood movie,
and you'll find a strange absence on screen of palaver about
recordings, movies, television shows and popular fiction. That's
one reason that when a film comes along that acknowledges the
passions millions of us harbor about favorite works of popular art,
it can strike a deep chord of recognition. Two of the best American
movies released this year _ ``American Psycho'' and ``High
Fidelity'' _ show a bone-deep understanding of how much of our
emotional energy is invested in the consumption of popular culture.
By Stephen Holden.  &QL;

   LISA-KRUEGER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The writer and director Lisa
Krueger, 39, has made only two movies, but the longing for
structure is a central theme in both. Indeed, some of the most
touching moments in her 1996 indie debut ``Manny and Lo'' involve
watching how the lives of two underage orphan runaways (Scarlett
Johannsen and Aleska Palladino) are enriched when they kidnap a
discipline-driven woman (Mary Kay Place) and the three become a
makeshift family. As for Joline (Heather Graham), the nightclub
manager heroine of Ms. Krueger's latest film, ``Committed''
(opening Friday), she finds comfort in structure, too. But her
quest _ to save an unraveling marriage by hunting down her wayward
photojournalist husband, Carl (Luke Wilson) _ comes at the expense
of her happiness and, eventually, her own sanity. By Margy Rochlin.

   BIG-KAHUNA-FILM (New York) _ Last winter, the cast and crew of
``The Big Kahuna'' filmed a feature in the time some people spend
on a beach vacation. Made in Manhattan in just 16 days, stars Kevin
Spacey and Danny DeVito. Adapted by Roger Rueff from his play
``Hospitality Suite,'' the 90-minute film, directed by John
Swanbeck, opens on Friday. It throws three businessmen into one
claustrophobic hotel room and, with a large dose of humor, forces
them to hash out issues of religion, principle and morality. By Ted
Loos. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOUND-FOR-GLORY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Hal Ashby's 1976 film
biography of the militant singer-composer Woody Guthrie, ``Bound
for Glory,'' misses critics' four-star ranking by a fraction, which
isn't bad for a film with some weaknesses to go along with its
considerable strengths. Ashby, who died at age 59 in 1988 and whose
credits include ``Harold and Maude'' (1971), ``Shampoo'' (1975) and
``Being There'' (1979), had a feeling for quirky characters.
``Bound for Glory'' (MGM, 146 minutes, $24.98, PG) is one of those
old movies that gets a substantial second wind from the clarity of
DVD. By PETER M. NICHOLS. . &QL;

<P>
   CHOUINARD-DANCE (New York) _ Offstage, the Montreal-based
choreographer Marie Chouinard could pass for Joni Mitchell's
double, with her sleek 5-foot-8-inch frame, her fragile beauty and
her long, blond hair. Onstage, her persona is fiercer. During her
22-year dance career, Chouinard has been called everything from
``the high priestess of choreographic shock'' and ``a sorceress''
to ``the praying mantis in the hothouse of Quebec dance.'' Many of
her solo dances _ including the first, ``Crystallization'' (1978) _
are being presented by Compagnie Marie Chouinard in a rare
appearance in New York at the Joyce Theater for five performances,
beginning on Wednesday. By William Harris.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALLEY-OF-IAO-THEATER (New York) _ Lee Nagrin left her childhood
home, Seattle, to come to New York City, where in the early 1950s
she became a noted Off Broadway performance artist and director,
collaborated with Meredith Monk and painted. Her younger brother,
Bert Swezea, stayed behind, becoming a popular real estate agent in
Seattle, where he married and had two sons. Their decidedly
different-seeming paths rejoined in 1992, when Nagrin received news
that Buddy, as she called him, was seriously ill in Maui, Hawaii,
where he had formed a new life of the spirit. Nagrin traveled to
Hawaii to be with her brother, who died the following year. Out of
that experience has come ``The Valley of Iao,'' which opens on
Thursday for a three-week engagement at La MaMa. By Jennifer
Dunning.  &QL;

   ALMEIDA-THEATER (London) _ If we discount the much-hyped London
debut of Kathleen Turner in a stage version of ``The Graduate,''
the Almeida theater has been gobbling up the London critics'
attention in recent weeks. First there was the premiere of Harold
Pinter's ``Celebration'' at the company's grungy headquarters in
Islington. Then it presented Nicholas Wright's new ``Cressida'' in
the West End, with a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon
as a trainer of the boy actors who took female roles in
early-17th-century England. And now it has reopened the doors of
the East End film studios once used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged
``Richard II'' with Ralph Fiennes as the king, a production
expected at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall. By Benedict
Nightingale.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SINEAD-CUSACK-THEATER (London) _ It would be an easy assumption
to make, but a wrong one, to think of Sinead Cusack as famous by
association. In her native Ireland, the surname evokes associations
to that country's eminent acting clan. Not only was her father,
Cyril, one of the last century's best-known Irish performers, but
having been born into celebrity, Cusack proceeded to marry a man
who became one: Jeremy Irons, the film star. Cusack, however, has
garnered an impressive share of acting renown of her own. Last week
she opened Off Broadway at the Irish Repertory Theater in Sebastian
Barry's ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' reprising a role that won her a
Critics' Circle Award and an Evening Standard prize for best
actress in London in 1998 at the Royal National Theater. By Matt
Wolf. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YARD-GAL-THEATER (London) _ As is often the case by this point
in the Broadway season, London playwrights are having their say.
This year, three of England's senior dramatists are represented in
plays both new and in revival: Michael Frayn (``Copenhagen''),
Peter Shaffer (``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').
On Wednesday they will be joined Off Broadway by one of Britain's
younger generation when Rebecca Prichard, 28, makes her American
theater debut with her play ``Yard Gal.'' In previews at the MCC
Theater in Chelsea, ``Yard Gal'' is a study over time of two
feisty, quick-witted girl gang members. By Matt Wolf.  &QL;

   VARESE-MESSIAEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ On Friday evening Christoph
von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra will present Edgard
Varese's ``Ameriques,'' and on Saturday evening Seiji Ozawa and the
Boston Symphony will offer Oliver Messiaen's ``Turangalila
Symphony,'' with the excellent Pierre-Laurent Aimard in the
important part for solo piano. Varese began ``Ameriques'' shortly
after he had settled in New York, in 1915, and Messiaen wrote
``Turangalila'' for Ozawa's orchestra (which was then, in the late
'40s, Serge Koussevitzky's, though the first performance was
conducted by Leonard Bernstein). By Paul Griffiths. . WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   RAUTAVAARA-MUSIC (Helsinki, Finland) _ Matthew

   BOOTY-SONGS (subslug) (Undated) _ Soundtracks to spring lust are
nothing new, of course. The booty historian could trace the genre
back to medieval maypole dances or, in modernist times,
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' The latter not only depicts the
primitive fertility rituals at the root of today's spring singles
but also uses music more dependent on rhythm than melody, with the
fast-driving string ostinatos and emphatic percussive downbeats
that are at the core of Sisqo's ``Thong Song.'' The song, a
celebration of glimpses of scanty female underwear by Sisqo of the
rhythm-and-blues group Dru Hill, was bubbling well under the Top
40. But by last week, with spring love in the air and spring break
on the beach, it was up at No. 5 and still climbing. By Neil
Strauss.  &QL;

   ACADEMIE-JULIAN-ART (New York) _ One of this season's more
rewarding sleepers is ``Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the
Academie Julian'' at the Dahesh Museum, in Manhattan. Visitors,
though not always numerous, tend to be keenly attentive. The
subject matter makes very good points at every turn but does not
set out either to bully or reproach us. It is in every history of
French painting that in 1868 Rodolphe Julian, a former wrestler,
founded an independent art school in Paris that remains active to
this day. It was the only place in the city at which a woman could
study art intensively in a well-lighted room from a living model
and count on being taught by artists of substantial quality. By

   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moving in the `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds
for social ostracism. Cell phones are required for professionals
from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the
first CD players, gadget freaks have often seemed to exist in a
jargon-filled matrix of their own, oblivious to the mundanities of
civil society. By Amy Harmon. (Moving in the `a' category)

<P>
   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped
the modern American character. Where they differ is on whether
Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.

<P>
   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose initial
public offering in January zoomed from an initial price of $2 a
share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder
and chief executive officer, Ethan Proctor, 17, the youngest
dot-com billionaire on record. During the recent sell-off in

   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel
naked. Private companies are launching increasingly sophisticated
reconnaissance satellites, and governments are finding it harder to
restrict what snapshots they distribute to anyone willing to pay
the price. By William J. Broad.

   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam war, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox BUtterfield.

   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
Parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By

   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: the way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.

   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

CAMBY EXPECTS THE RAPTORS TO GET PHYSICAL

   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ When practice ended at SUNY-Purchase Friday,
Marcus Camby walked off the court by himself and unfolded his long
body against the wall under a basket. He had made it through his
first workout since reinjuring his right knee last Saturday and was
certain he would be ready for the start of the playoffs against the
Toronto Raptors on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Before he took the floor, Camby was surrounded by tape recorders
and cameras, drawing more attention than he wanted. He could handle
the questions about his right knee, which had a large ice pack
wrapped around it. But Camby found himself the center of attention
for other reasons. He has become a potential target of his former
team. It was an odd situation for a player built more for stealth
than for banging.

   After he was quoted as saying that Coach Butch Carter of the
Raptors had lied to him before Toronto traded him to the Knicks,
some of the Raptors players responded by saying that if Camby
insulted the coach, he had insulted them, too. The Raptors have a
front line of Charles Oakley, Antonio Davis and Kevin Willis, so
Camby was aware, but unafraid, of the ramifications of his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just all about playing now,'' Camby said. ``I've just got
to play. Winning is the cure-all, so we just have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, any doubt surrounding Camby's abilities to function
in the postseason spotlight came from within the Knicks'
organization. But after soaring over and around the Miami Heat and
the Indiana Pacers, the belief in him in New York is firmly
established. Now, the questions arise from his role as a vital cog
on the Knicks, as well as how he will respond to being targeted by
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot because of the way they handled us during the
season,'' Camby said. ``But by that being my former team and the
animosity going on, it's just that they beat us three times
handily. It's an obstacle we have to overcome, beating them and
trying to move on. I'm not going to try to make it an individual
thing between me and them. We just want to go out and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm more relaxed,'' he added. ``I'm not as nervous as
last year, that being my first time in the playoffs. Last year I
didn't really know what to expect. People were saying they didn't
know how I would react in the playoffs, but I managed to put all
that stuff aside and go out there and just try to play hard. That's
all I'm going to try to do in this playoff series.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Davis was a part of the Pacers team that Camby
played so well against last year in the playoffs, Camby admitted
that his forays to the basket were not as easy this season, because
teams had seen what he was capable of doing and were determined to
stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a physical ball club,'' he said. ``I have to play
my game. It's not as easy as it was last year. I think I snuck up
on a lot of people last year. Now, as I've seen during the course
of the season, I'm not sneaking up on anybody anymore. Guys are
putting two or three guys on me, trying to bang me from getting to
the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change my game because a team is a physical
ball club. I'm just going to go out there and try to be me. There's
no special trick Knicks coming in for me, no special assignments.
I'm just going to play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   But after spraining a knee on Feb. 6 and undergoing arthroscopic
surgery, which caused him to miss 17 games, he is still feeling the
effects. He reinjured the knee last Saturday after taking a charge
against the Cleveland Cavaliers' Andre Miller and sat out the final
two games of the regular season. Although he said he would play
Sunday against the Raptors at Madison Square Garden, it will not be
without some ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt all right for the most part today,'' Camby said.
``I'll be ready to go come Sunday. It's a whole lot better than
when I came back before. I've still got a little lingering from the
surgery that I had before. I've still got some swelling in it, but
it's going to be like that the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really worry about it. Ever since I came back from my
knee, I've been trying to do the things I've been doing, taking
charges, diving on the floor, just trying to do the things I was
doing before I got hurt. I'll be myself. I'll be out there trying
to bring that energy. I don't expect anything to change. I went the
whole practice, did everything that everybody did.''

GEORGE MOORE, 95, EX-BANKER WHO LED METROPOLITAN OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.Y., Spain)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George S. Moore, a banker who led the overseas expansion of what
became Citibank and steered the Metropolitan Opera in New York
through turbulent financial times, died April 21 at his home in
Sotograde, Spain. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who eventually rose to become chairman of First National
City Bank of New York (now known as Citibank) was born on April 1,
1905, in Hannibal, Mo., to a family of moderate circumstances. His
father was a claims inspector for the Burlington &AMP; Quincy Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   From early on he established himself as an energetic young man.
During summers in St. Louis, were he grew up, Moore earned extra
money selling honey and delivering orders for a delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he helped put himself through Yale by booking tours to
Europe and tickets to Broadway shows for classmates.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. in 1927, which
eventually merged with First National City, Moore rose swiftly to
positions of power.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues described him as a determined salesman who thought
that more than five hours of sleep a night was a waste.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is credited with moving aggressively to expand the bank's
reach in whatever department he ran. As head of the bank's domestic
division in 1957, Moore pushed for the bank's entry into real
estate lending and expanded consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Later as the head of First National City's overseas division, he
set up new branches in countries across Europe and Latin America.
The Latin American branches, while successful during his tenure,
later caused the bank headaches as economies in the region
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy that Moore was most proud of, according to his
son, George Moore of New Canaan, Conn., was transforming the
caliber of the institution's workers.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore joined banking, it was still a closed, conservative
society staffed largely by the scions of old-line moneyed families
like the Stillmans and the Rockefellers. Moore aimed to replace
what he perceived to be indolent family heirs with motivated
graduates of business schools.
</P>
<P>
   The claims inspector's son took some pride in being a tough guy
who could fire incompetent underlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fanatical about finding top talent and inventorying
people with high IQs,'' said Phillip L. Zweig, who interviewed
Moore at length for a book on Walter B. Wriston, Moore's
hand-picked Citibank successor. ``But he was lightening in a bottle
and did not suffer fools lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore became president of the Metropolitan Opera Association in
1967. It was a troubled financial time in the opera's history, as
the recent move to its Lincoln Center home had emptied the coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was determined to run the opera like a business and
insisted that creative operations meet budgets. Under his tenure,
the opera raised the price of tickets several times and postponed
opening the season to trim costs. In 1973, the Met even canceled a
scheduled production of ``Don Giovanni'' as well as free summer
concerts that were to be held in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Moore retired from First National City in 1970, but he continued
to work long energetic days until he was almost 90.
</P>
<P>
   Among his responsibilities was being the sole trustee for the
Onassis family interests in the United States and being a financial
consultant to numerous United States and foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept a full social and philanthropic calendar. In his
autobiography ``The Banker's Life,'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co., 1986), he
included among his friends Sen. Jacob K. Javits, opera singer Maria
Callas and the auto-fortune heir Henry Ford II.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son by his first marriage, Moore is survived
by his second wife, Charon C. Moore; their three children,
daughters Christina Sendagorta and Maria Pia and a son, Steven C.
Moore, all of Madrid; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson. &QL;

 By LAURA M. HOLSON and SAUL HANSELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, to pen the first draft of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``IVillage Becomes a Metropolis on First Trading Day,'' roared a
headline in The Los Angeles Times on March 20, 1999, describing the
tripling in the stock price of iVillage, the online community for
women. When Miningco.com went public a few days later, The Wall
Street Journal called that Web forum ``the latest Internet stock to
strike gold.'' And a few days after that, Priceline.com ended its
first trading session at four times its offering price, prompting
USA Today to call it ``a hot ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Awful puns aside, those were heady days. The seven Internet
companies that sold shares that month were in the vanguard of the
legions that made their debuts in 1999 before a public hungry for
nothing but Net. Stock prices exploded out of the gate.
Entrepreneurs became billionaires overnight. And in the months that
followed, investors only clamored for more as the hysteria for
anything dot-com reached fever pitch, helping push the Nasdaq
market index to its all-time high on March 10, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market's recent rout, even with last week's rebound,
helped bring the highfliers back to earth. Four of the seven
companies that went public in March 1999 now are trading below
their offering prices: Manhattan-based iVillage, down 49 percent;
OneMain.com, a collection of Internet service providers, down 72
percent; Autobytel.com, which refers car buyers to dealerships over
the Internet, down 74 percent; and Ziff-Davis-ZDNet, which operates
technology Web sites, down 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining three _ About.com (the Web portal that began life
as Miningco.com), Priceline.com and Multex.com, which distributes
financial information _ are trading at least 60 percent off their
record highs. (Priceline.com has performed most admirably, up 324
percent from its offering price.)
</P>
<P>
   Market pundits say Internet stocks were due for a correction.
Anyone who read a prospectus knew that the dizzying sums that
investors were paying for unseasoned companies defied their
fundamental worth. The breezy days of last spring were bound, logic
said, to turn unwelcoming and cold.
</P>
<P>
   But how was it that the investing world suspended disbelief in
the first place, letting the most irrationally exuberant investors
assign values to these companies?
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, it was in the interest of everyone involved to take
advantage of a frenzied market that, in more measured times, would
have seemed absurd. Entrepreneurs rushed to get money _ and lots of
it. Venture capitalists were eager to cash out. Investment banks
were happy to oblige. And, of course, rapacious investors _ big
institutions and the man and woman on the street _ clamored for
their shares of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to close the book on the Class of March 1999; the
Internet story is far from over. No expert worth the title can
predict the permanence of the damage caused by the market's recent
shakeout. And investors are only beginning to decide which
companies they think have the most promising future.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these companies are a microcosm for an Internet
marketplace where the fortunes of companies have been made _ and
lost _ virtually overnight. And their experiences shed light on the
roles that financiers, entrepreneurs and investors played in
inflating the Internet bubble until it almost burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to think about it as Charles Darwin meeting Adam Smith,''
said Gary Rieschel, a partner at Softbank Technology Partners in
Mountain View, Calif. As in nature, he explained, ``the checks and
balances have to get out of whack for them to get back in order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Order of Things
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, a founder of OneMain.com, knows about the natural
order firsthand. His company, an Internet service provider (like
America Online), went public on March 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Smith recalled, he was worried that the offering
price for his company _ $22 a share _ was too high, even though
bankers had discounted the value of his subscriber base to the
clientele of more established peers.
</P>
<P>
   But who was he to bicker over his good fortune? ``I wasn't going
to argue with the market at that time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, was a market that had just bid up iVillage _ a
company that had struggled for several years to go public _ from an
offering price of $24 to a first-day close of $80.13. And those
numbers did not fully express the demand for dot-com shares;
iVillage's investment bankers at Goldman Sachs had originally
planned to price the stock at $12 to $14.
</P>
<P>
   So iVillage became the standard against which other companies
measured first-day success. Watching the excitement about iVillage
mount, executives at Miningco.com decided to put off their public
offering so its shares, too, could command more than the $12 to $14
a share that executives first expected, recalled Dan Veru, an early
investor in the company. It was a smart move; bankers at Bear,
Stearns priced Miningco.com at $25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   How could a rational market push the share prices of these
nascent companies to such heights? As he conducted the road show
for OneMain.com, pitching the business to professional money
managers, Smith recalled, he was surprised that they did not ask
many in-depth financial questions. Of his 72 one-on-one meetings
with institutional investors, he said, few lasted more than 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found people were only interested in the story,'' he said.
``They hadn't read anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's stock hit a high of $39.5625 the day it began trading,
an 80 percent increase over the offering price. Colleagues at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, where he had been a banker for nine
years, swooned.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, the stock price of OneMain.com began to slide _ by
June, the shares were trading in the mid-teens _ despite Smith's
contention that he was delivering on everything he had promised
investors, including his subscriber projections. He said, however,
that bankers at what is now Deutsche Bank Alex Brown had failed to
deliver on two of  &UR; their &LR;  promises: The analyst he had expected to
cover his company left the bank, Smith said, and its sales and
trading desk did not support a higher price. And that, he added
bitterly, was despite OneMain.com's having paid fees of more than
$7 million. Deutsche Bank Alex Brown declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   And so Smith, a 40-year-old Californian, found himself across
the table from investors for 40 days last year, struggling to pump
up his stock price. He was briefly successful _ OneMain.com hit
$33.125 last July, during a two-week road trip that took him from
San Diego to Boston. But the shares have since drifted downward,
falling 87 percent since their peak to close at $6.25 on Thursday,
even though he said the company has met the earnings and revenue
targets it set for itself.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, who owns 8 percent of the company, that decline has
erased tens of millions of dollars in his net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives in the March '99 class said that at least some
investors inquired deeply into their companies and business models,
but the executives agreed that most professional money managers had
ignored fundamentals and just bet on stocks that seemed to have
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a herd mentality around Internet stocks,'' said
Daniel L. Rosensweig, chief executive of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who professed to be long-term fundamental investors
turned out to be short-term traders, he said. ``You go on the road
show, and all these people say they will hold forever. Then you get
the first list of shareholders and find out they flipped the stock
right away. The best you can hope for is that they will buy your
stock back on the dip.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet once a stock falls out of favor, even good news will not
necessarily restore its luster. A month ago, iVillage announced a
$200 million venture with Unilever, the consumer products giant.
And while financial analysts lauded the news, investors ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announce highly strategic deals, and there is no movement in
the stock,'' said Candice Carpenter, the company's chief executive.
``Poor Pavlov's dog is confused. It doesn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Of Risky Businesses
</P>
<P>
   Like most of her peers, Carpenter attributes her company's stock
performance to an investing environment that now favors the
business-to-business Internet sector and companies promising a
quicker path to quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier era, that would have sounded like an odd
complaint; companies generally did not even go public until they
stood a good chance of delivering profits. So if the market is
again demanding earnings, it is only reverting to form.
</P>
<P>
   But when iVillage and the others had their coming-out parties,
Carpenter rightly notes, Internet companies and their bankers
certainly made no secret of the hurdles that stood between them and
earnings. Specifically, she said investors in iVillage were told
that it could take the company 7 to 10 years to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some companies devoted 20 pages or more of their
prospectuses to such warnings. So much so, some analysts suggest
they have little meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk factors have become so common they are almost
irrelevant,'' said Scott Siprelle, a cofounder of Midtown Research
Group, a Manhattan investment boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet companies were so young, he said, investment
banks relaxed their insistence on a management team that had long
worked together and on years of profitability before taking a
company public.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good investment bank has to constantly balance the franchise
versus the revenue,'' Siprelle said. ``But the opportunity has been
so large it has been hard to be disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, 1998, investment banks have earned an estimated
$2.18 billion in underwriting fees for taking Internet companies
public, according to Commscan, a research company based in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prosperous investment banks in the technology
world is Goldman, Sachs; since 1995, it has helped take 54 Internet
companies public. If Brad Koenig, Goldman's co-head of technology
investment banking, sounded frayed last week, it was because the
criticism leveled at bankers for stocks trading below their
offering prices was wearing a little thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to remember that investment banks and
underwriters were getting criticism for  &UR; underpricing &LR;  IPO's not
too long ago,'' Koenig said. He is right: banks took a drubbing all
last year for pricing offerings too low, supposedly to make the
stock price soar in first-day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with e-commerce stocks suffering, Koenig suggests that it
is unfair to blame the same bankers for having set offering prices
too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you wake up one morning and price the I.P.O.,''
he said. He explained that pricing was a three- to four-month
process of comparing companies against their peers. Considerable
time is spent examining fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   And even established companies, like Yahoo, traded lower than
their offering prices in the early days. Besides, it isn't as
though bankers don't exercise discretion: Goldman is one of the
most selective, he said, and turns away 15 companies for every one
it takes public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should be held accountable or responsible if
a sector falls out of favor,'' Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a momentum-driven environment, some financiers like
venture capitalists certainly play their part in the making of
fads.
</P>
<P>
   When Isaak Karaev and James Tousignant founded Multex Systems
seven years ago, they wanted to help brokerage firms send
electronic research to institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the Internet happened,'' said Karaev, the company's chief
executive. ``And all our investors said, `This is an Internet
play.' We took the opportunity to change ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Multex created a Web site that lets individuals read Wall Street
research for a fee. But the venture capitalists were not satisfied.
``The consumer was the big play, so everyone wanted us to jettison
everything else and give it all away free,'' Karaev recalled. The
founders agreed to change the company's name to Multex.com, but
insisted on keeping the institutional investor service, which
accounted for two-thirds of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Their venture backers should be grateful they did; now,
business-to-business Internet companies are hot, while those
catering to consumers are not. These days, Karaev said, the company
calls itself a ``financial e-marketplace,'' to play to the latest
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy hasn't changed,'' he said. ``The challenge is
which component to highlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greene, who invested in Multex at Chase Capital, and is
now a partner in Flatiron Partners, concedes that venture money has
long followed trends. In 13 years as an investor, he said, ``I
spent all my time going from one hot area to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Internet era has been a remarkable time. It used to
be that a return of 300 percent was ``an awesome home run.'' Now,
with the public markets so accommodating, venture capitalists can
make 1,000 percent to 2,000 percent on shares they hold for just
two years.
</P>
<P>
   And that means early investors are barely splattered when a
bubble bursts. Chase Capital, for example, has paid an average of
just over $3 a share for its 3 million Multex.com shares, he said _
putting it hardly in the same boat as investors who bought at $60 a
share and saw the stock fall as low as $13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these values fall to half of where they peaked, in the
context of our industry, they are great returns,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent decline, however, has sobered things up, he said.
``Two months ago, you would look at a business plan and the
investment banks would say, `We can take that company public in
four months for $500 million.' So you would say, `Why not?''' Now,
Greene said, ``We don't say `Why not?' We say `Why?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to Mention Day Traders
</P>
<P>
   If any group played the most public role in fueling the Web
frenzy, it was day traders and other online investors, many of them
congregating in Internet chat rooms like Silicon Investor and
Raging Bull. They could sometimes inflate and burst bubbles in a
single day.
</P>
<P>
   A little after midnight on March 26, 1999, someone posted a
message on Silicon Investor wanting to know if Autobytel.com shares
would begin trading later that day. It would _ offered at $23 a
share _ and by noon, posters were speculating about how high the
price would soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are it will open between 40 and 50,'' wrote
``Scott H.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't start over lunch would they?'' added ``William
Griffin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking 60-65 opening in next 10-20 mins,'' wrote ``SteveG''
at 12:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``WOW,'' Scott H. responded. ``Steve, do you think it will take
off after the open?''
</P>
<P>
   In a word, yes. Autobytel.com opened at $52.75 a share, hit a
high of $58 and then closed for the day at $40.25.

   Blue chips? Or wooden nickels?
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the leading technology stocks might be wondering
how to appraise them after the plunge of early April left the
technology sector as skinny as a football lineman on an
all-broccoli diet.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell an ugly tale. Cisco Systems stood at $80 on
March 27. By April 14, it traded at $57. Sun Microsystems slid from
$105 to $76.50 over the same span.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco and Sun have held up well, compared with the Internet
stocks, which have been in a bear market since January. The
bellwether there, Yahoo, was down more that 50 percent, to $114.375
on April 14, from $237.50 on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Those are enormous declines, considering that companies like
Cisco and Yahoo are supposed to be the new-economy leaders, with
solid products, superior management and real sales and profits.
Buying them was supposed to be the safe way to invest in technology
_ at least when compared with the hordes of dot-coms that have
proliferated since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the blue-chip technology companies have held
up a bit better and recovered a bit faster than their more
speculative kin during the Nasdaq's rocky ride this month. But
losing 30 or 40 percent of an investment in two weeks never feels
great, even if someone else's stock is down 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So where do these companies stand? Is the recent sell-off
nothing more than a short-term dip and the latest buying
opportunity? Or is it a warning to investors that there is no such
thing as a technology blue chip, that even the best technology
companies are overpriced and due for a fall?
</P>
<P>
   To answer those questions, Money &AMP; Business reviewed the
prospects of six technology leaders in six key markets with Wall
Street analysts and institutional investors. The common thread to
the experts' views: in a market filled with uncertainty, investors
will have to pay up for the quality they seek.
</P>
<P>
   Intel: No Longer a Cyclical?
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest maker of microchips, is a powerhouse
whose lofty earnings, according to Wall Street's consensus
estimate, will rise 23 percent a year, on average, over the next
five years. Yet the ratio of the company's current stock price to
estimated earnings for this year is below 40, a bit under the
average for technology companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. And that multiple is well below those of other leading
information technology suppliers like Sun Microsystems (92.1) or
Cisco ( 126.5).
</P>
<P>
   So is Intel a bargain? The fact that it fell just 8.1 percent
during the technology sell-off suggests that a lot of people think
so. And it certainly deserves to be an anchor holding for any
investor in information technology, according to L. Roy Papp, whose
firm has 12 percent of its $1.25 billion under management invested
in Intel.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, L. Roy Papp &AMP; Associates of Phoenix, invests in what
its researchers determine are the growth stocks with the strongest
outlooks over the next three to five years. His investment case for
Intel, his largest holding, is built on the conviction that it is a
stellar company with outstanding management.
</P>
<P>
   It is also predicated on the belief that the semiconductor
industry that Intel dominates has changed. As the productivity
payoff from information technology has become increasingly
apparent, Papp said, companies have come to regard computing as
both fast-changing and essential. Accordingly, their spending
patterns will hold steady, because they have recognized that
technology is a continuing cost of doing business. Intel should be
a prime beneficiary of that trend. ``This is no longer the cyclical
swing business that everybody has always said it was,'' he said.
That line of reasoning would explain why Intel easily warrants its
current P/E multiple of 38.1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company faces daunting challenges as computing's center
of gravity moves beyond the PC industry _ Intel's stronghold _ and
toward the Internet. If the highest growth comes from Internet
appliances like hand-held computers and ``smart'' cell phones,
Intel could be hurt. It has a promising entry for that niche, the
StrongArm chip, but it has a host of competitors including
start-ups like Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is moving forcefully to make chips for powerful server
computers that are the hubs of computer networks. Its
microprocessors for servers are very profitable, selling for $1,000
to $3,000 apiece, compared with as little as $65 for the Celeron
chips that power low-cost PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say server chips account for only a tiny
percentage of Intel's chip volume and could not soon offset real
slippage in its basic PC business. ``Potentially, these are huge
problems for Intel,'' said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of
Microprocessor Report, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And a revived Advanced Micro Devices is giving Intel competition
for the high-performance, high-profit chips that run more costly
PC's.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Intel is coping pretty well with its challenges. Its
share of the PC processor market is 82 percent, up from 76 percent
at the end of 1998, when it was slow to respond as rivals began
making low-cost PC chips, according to Mercury Research in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet challenge, Intel appears to be moving
quickly to adjust. Once before it made a tough but successful
transition in its business _ when it abandoned memory chips in the
mid-1980s and bet its future on microprocessors. ``Intel is a
company that reinvents itself,'' said Dean McCarron, a Mercury
Research principal.

   Yahoo: An Earnings Engine
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Yahoo may have fallen from a high of 240 on Dec. 31 to
barely half that level last week, but the company's fans are as
confident as ever in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that even at its current levels, Yahoo, the leading
Internet portal, has a market valuation of more than $70 billion
and a price-to-earnings ratio of 279.2. Never mind that even if
Yahoo's earnings rise 50 percent a year for the next five years and
its stock stays flat, Yahoo will still have a P/E ratio of near 40
in 2005. Yahoo may be expensive, but investors get what they pay
for, analysts and money managers say.
</P>
<P>
   That Tiffany-style reasoning may infuriate value investors. But
anyone who is even considering buying Yahoo is no value investor.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the bulls' case:
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most dot-coms are losing money, Yahoo makes a lot
of it. In the first quarter this year, Yahoo reported sales of $228
million and net income of $63 million. That is a net after-tax
profit margin of 28 percent, far higher than that of most
old-economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   The high margins are no accident, according to Lise Buyer, an
Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Like America
Online, Yahoo is benefiting from scale,'' Buyer said. Once the
company's servers are running and its technical support staff is in
place, the cost of each additional Web page it delivers to a viewer
is close to zero. But it is likely to earn additional advertising
revenue on each of those pages. That spells high margins once the
company passes its break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's huge audience, meanwhile, makes it more desirable to
advertisers and content providers, analysts say. That enables it to
offer better content to visitors, who are then more likely to
return, a virtuous circle that reinforces the company's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really fail to understand the strength of their
business model,'' said Minyoung Sohn, research analyst at Janus
Capital, which owned more than 5.5 million Yahoo shares at the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Janus sold Yahoo shares last year as the company's price rose
steadily, but Sohn said Janus was again buying. Yahoo should easily
surpass Wall Street earnings estimates of 54 cents a share next
year and 70 cents in 2002, because overall spending on Internet
advertising is likely to soar, Sohn said. He noted that the
Internet now accounts for 10 to 15 percent of media use, but only
about 2 percent of advertising spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``dollars will follow eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's international revenues are also likely to soar over the
next several years, said Susan Walker White, an Internet analyst at
J.P. Morgan. She noted that 40 percent of the company's users were
already outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is one of the blue-chip Internet companies,'' White
said. ``It's one of the stocks that investors need to own.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the company's sky-high P/E ratio and market
capitalization, White is not worried. ``It's hard to use
traditional valuation metrics to measure these stocks,'' she said.

<P>
   Cisco: New King of the Hill
</P>
<P>
   No event better underscored the changing of the guard in the
Internet economy than when the market capitalization of Cisco
Systems surpassed that of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly peaking at a half-trillion dollars before slipping over
the last month, Cisco has been the exemplary Silicon Valley growth
machine of the last five years: Its annual earnings growth over
that period has averaged almost 43 percent; revenue growth has been
above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Microsoft marked the shift from centralized
computers to the desktop PC. Cisco's dominance is evidence of the
new hegemony of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For many industry executives in Silicon Valley, Cisco's
ascendancy underscores two growing beliefs: that Microsoft has
peaked, and that the financial success stories of the Internet age
will be driven by the world's insatiable appetite for additional
communications capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is the leading manufacturer of the Internet's plumbing _
powerful computers that route and switch the data packets among Web
servers and Internet surfers. As such, it stands to be the largest
beneficiary of the growing push toward multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Under John Chambers, its chief executive, the company has
pursued a strategy of growth by acquisition that has been so
successful that in the valley the company is known as the Borg _
after the ``Star Trek'' character that incorporated its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth-by-acquisition model has allowed Chambers to scan the
horizon for the next important Internet niche and then to buy the
companies whose technologies will ensure that Cisco maintains a No.
1 or No. 2 position in markets where it chooses to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue in the future is how many balls can John
Chambers juggle?'' said David Bunnell, author of ``Making the Cisco
Connection: The Story Behind the Real Internet Superpower'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 2000). Of course, growth also depends on the stock
market's continued enthusiasm for Cisco, he noted; the company now
uses its explosive stock value to provide ``Cisco dollars'' to fuel
its acquisitions, of which there have been dozens.
</P>
<P>
   But with a P/E of well over 100, it is fair to question the
inflated value of that currency. ``The valuation is extreme,'' said
Andrew S. Cupps, portfolio manager of the $850 million Strong
Enterprise fund, who adds that Cisco's current multiple assumes
that it will be able to maintain its dominance of networking and
continue to execute its strategy flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order. ``I don't think they are going to just
roll over into the next paradigm,'' Cupps said. Indeed, while the
growth of Cisco's router and switch business seems assured, the
company has begun zeroing in on markets that are certain to lead to
titanic industry battles: Internet telephony and Internet
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers has said that he is anxious to remove the traditional
analog telephone from his desk and replace it with one that routes
voice conversations over the Internet. That will ensure that Cisco
collides head-on with two of the companies that are already its
biggest competitors, Lucent Technologies and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that battle may pale in light of Cisco's growing
interest in the market for Internet appliances _ consumer devices
designed to permit Internet surfing from the kitchen or the den.
Thought to be the next great area of Internet growth, the struggle
over the appliance market will inevitably set Cisco on a collision
course with Microsoft.

   Amazon.com: E-tailers on Sale
</P>
<P>
   No new-economy sector has taken a worse smack on the chin than
Internet retailers. Stock prices of merchants like eToys and
Bluefly started plunging well in advance of the Nasdaq downswing.
As a group, the stocks remained depressed well after technology
stocks started to rebound last week. Are such shares
bargain-basement buys or damaged goods?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com remains the 800-pound gorilla of Internet retailers,
with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. And in many
ways, Amazon exhibits the attractions _ and vulnerabilities _ of
the group. Sell-side analysts remain as bullish on the company as
they were a year ago, even though the stock has fallen 50 percent,
to $52.375, from a 52-week high of $113 on Dec. 9. Of the 28
analysts who follow the stock, 11 rate it a strong buy and 10 rate
it a buy, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why they have faith: Customer demand for online shopping
is more robust than ever. In a study released last week, Shop.org
and the Boston Consulting Group predicted that online sales would
soar 85 percent in 2000, to more than $61 billion. And as a market
leader, Amazon stands a better chance of reaping the benefits;
indeed, its sales continue to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbling stock prices could play to Amazon's favor, if weeding
out the competition leaves more spoils for the top players.
``Tightening of capital markets is good news for all the folks
trying to build lasting companies, as opposed to the subset that
are trying to build flash-in-the-pan stocks,'' said Jeffrey Bezos,
Amazon's endlessly optimistic chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But this last-man-standing theory ignores that Amazon, like many
of its virtual competitors, relies on complex marketing
arrangements with other dot-com companies to produce revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has deals in which it takes stakes in companies that it
finds promising _ Living.com and Audible.com, for example; those
companies agree to pay Amazon substantial annual sums for the
patronage. Amazon is counting on these deals to bring in a revenue
stream of nearly $100 million a year over the next five years _
something that is not likely to happen if the overall market for
dot-coms collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of cost controls. As every quarter
passes, Amazon's losses deepen. Bezos is promising that this will
change as of the fourth quarter this year. ``We are looking to
drive our loss as a percentage of sales to single digits by the end
of this year,'' he said. That means losses won't end, but will
finally start to grow less rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but investors have heard that before. As of last week,
First Call predicted a loss of $1.22 a share for 2000, and a loss
of 58 cents a share for 2001. It was just a year ago that the
guidance Amazon gave analysts led them to forecast losses for 2000
of 14 cents a share.

<P>
   The Inktomi Corp. crossed an all-too rare milestone last week:
for the first time, it reported a net profit. And for the eighth
consecutive quarter, the company had revenue growth of over 200
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you are new to Inktomi's story, you are not alone. Founded in
1996, Inktomi makes products that are largely invisible _ much like
the Intel microprocessor inside a personal computer or the Cisco
Systems router shuttling bits on the computer network. That is
because Inktomi specializes in Internet infrastructure. Its first
``product'' was actually a service, a Web search engine for Yahoo,
Hotbot, Lycos and other big portals. The company also sells Web
shopping and directory services.
</P>
<P>
   But the big revenue driver has turned out to be a software
product, Traffic Server, which Inktomi sells the old-fashioned way,
in a shrink-wrapped box. Traffic Server, which runs on Unix or NT
servers, is an Internet cache that functions like the bit of cache
memory on a microprocessor to speed delivery of Web pages. Used by
big Internet service providers like America Online and
Excite(at)Home, Traffic Server monitors network traffic and stores
information nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dravis, an analyst at BancAmerica Securities, rates Inktomi
a ``strong buy'' and a core holding among Internet software stocks.
``They are very uniquely positioned, one to have their business
model driven by people doing searches and shopping on the Web, and
second by the focus on content distribution because they have a set
of technologies to sell to network providers to enhance
performance,'' he said. ``In a world where everybody is trying to
pick between the haves and the have-nots, they're definitely among
the haves.''
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi has been surprising in its ability to deliver on that
assessment. For the quarter ended March 31, Inktomi reported
earnings of $1 million, or a penny a share; analysts had expected a
loss of 2 cents a share, according to First Call. Revenue rose to
$47.3 million, compared with $15.2 million in the period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With growth like that, it is no surprise that some investors
think that Inktomi is a buy, especially given the fact that at
$129.125, it is trading at just over half its value of a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Inktomi faces ample competition, from established
companies like Cisco Systems, which offers a line of cache servers,
and Novell, which sells caching software to server manufacturers.
It also is up against newcomers like CacheFlow, which sells caching
appliances _ simple servers preloaded with a proprietary operating
system and caching software. Oracle has talked about giving away
caching with future releases of its database. And Akamai
Technologies, the other big name in speeding up the Internet,
offers caching as part of its suite of content delivery services on
a pay-as-you-go basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Inktomi executives say the company was never just about
caching, and they point out that by publishing the application
programming interfaces to Traffic Server, they are in fact
establishing a new platform. That means that independent software
developers could write programs that run on Traffic Server much as
they write programs to run on Microsoft's Windows or Oracle's
database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only group that has third-party developers for
Internet infrastructure software; that's by design,'' said Eric
Brewer, Inktomi's chief scientist and a co-founder. ``If you're
just doing caching, you don't need any of this. But our view has
always been that we're rebuilding the Internet.''

   Sun Microsystems: Sun, in Blazing Color
</P>
<P>
   Ask Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, about Sun
Microsystems and he sees red.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Ballmer views Scott McNealy, Sun's
co-founder and chief executive, as a ringleader of a Silicon Valley
cabal that persuaded the Justice Department to pursue its antitrust
investigation of Microsoft. Sun has also been in Microsoft's cross
hairs ever since Microsoft began trying to move up the computer
industry food chain in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last quarter, the one in which Microsoft began to ship its
long-overdue ``Sun Killer'' Windows 2000 operating system, Sun's
revenue grew by a striking 35 percent, to $4 billion, and earnings
rose 49 percent, to $436.2 billion. That means that Sun's revenue
growth is almost certain to accelerate this year above the 25
percent it averaged in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The financial numbers are all the more remarkable because of the
threats that Sun faces from all sides. It is apparently managing _
at least for now _ to disprove what its archrival Microsoft would
like to establish as industry wisdom: that Microsoft's Windows
2000, offered in conjunction with low-cost hardware based on Intel
microprocessors _ would be Sun's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's success in recent years is an exceptional gauge of the
growth and impact of the Internet. These days, the computer maker
is usually the first company that a new commercial Web site comes
to when it wants to create an Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rivalry in the service space is intense. Indeed,
Microsoft ranks second among the Internet software threats faced by
Sun. The free Linux operating system and its Apache Web server is
actually the leading Internet server software.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy has also been the primary target of both Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. of IBM and Carly S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard. Both
chief executives have scrambled in recent years to catch up with
something that Sun understood first: that the market for powerful
and reliable server computers is the backbone of e-commerce growth.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of them appears to be gaining ground, at least not
yet. Analysts said Sun's numbers indicated that it was actually
gaining market share against its rivals in the hot market for
dot-com e-commerce servers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sun's 239.2 percent rise leading up to the Nasdaq peak,
its shares retreated only 18.8 percent from March 10 through April
14, far less than Nasdaq's decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun's decline was exceptionally moderate and underscores the
company's strength,'' said Roger McNamee, a fund manager at
Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ``If you are in a period
like we are in today _ when you don't know where we are in the
cycle and there is a flight to safety _ then Sun is a huge
beneficiary of that.'' Sun shares closed on Thursday at $87.75.
</P>
<P>
   While some investors are taking a ``show me'' attitude toward
Sun as they wait to see what inroads Windows 2000 will make in its
server business, McNamee minimizes that threat: ``I think the
market is expanding faster than Microsoft can serve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McNealy has no shortage of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives expect the portable and mobile
Internet appliance world to be the dominant growth area of the
future. It may be the most significant part of Sun's business to
watch _ and the measure of whether McNealy will continue to keep
Ballmer huffing and puffing.

   MOSCOW _ In an unusual display of political unity, the Russian
Parliament on Friday handed President-elect Vladimir Putin his
third overwhelming vote in a week ratifying a major arms-control
accord. The vote set the stage for a diplomatic campaign to put the
United States on the defensive in nuclear disarmament talks.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 298-74, the lower house of Parliament ratified the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that the U.S. Senate rejected last
October. In the last seven days, Putin won ratification in both the
upper and the lower houses of a strategic arms-reduction accord
that calls for halving the U.S. and Russian arsenals to no more
than 3,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russia's military and civilian leaders warned
of a resumption of the nuclear arms race should Washington go ahead
with plans to erect a national anti-missile defense shield in
violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
prohibits the development or deployment of such defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not clear whether Russia had the means to carry
out the threat, Putin's maneuvers still left President Clinton in a
political squeeze. On one side, Moscow is putting ever stronger
pressure on the United States to seek even greater cuts in nuclear
arms. On the other, political opponents in Congress want to block
any deals with Moscow that might limit the United States' ability
to develop the anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has hoped that Russia would agree to
some modifications in the existing anti-missile treaty, clearing
the way for some form of a national shield, in exchange for
negotiations on further strategic cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 senior Republican senators, including Majority Leader
Trent Lott and Jesse Helms, told Clinton in a letter this week that
they would oppose any efforts to negotiate amendments to the treaty
that might limit the national missile defense system they favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have maneuvered themselves into a position where
they are the advocates of arms control and arms reduction,'' said
Ivo Daalder, an arms-control expert at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, ``and this puts the United States in a terrible
position,'' especially after the Senate's rejection of the nuclear
test ban treaty last October. ``The Clinton administration needs to
come up with an idea on how to move the ball forward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The votes in Moscow over the past week demonstrated that Putin
has significant political command of the legislature, which often
thwarted his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   They also showed the president-elect moving swiftly and
forcefully on one of the most pressing national security problems
facing Russia _ how to maintain a strategic nuclear balance with
the United States at a time when Russia simply cannot afford a
large nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials would like to further reduce U.S. and Russian
nuclear arsenals to about 1,500 warheads each, while the Pentagon
insists that 2,500 warheads are needed to ensure U.S. security from
every conceivable threat, including rogue states and accidental
launches.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China believe that these threats are exaggerated and
that Washington wants to erect a missile shield as the first step
toward undermining their national strategic deterrent forces. After
the vote Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said, ``The
ball is now in the court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also said that if the United States withdrew from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, ``Russia would not be bound by its
strategic arms-reduction obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, a deputy chief of the general staff of
the Russian military, warned that Russia was prepared to respond to
a breakdown in the treaty with ``asymmetrical'' systems that could
undermine U.S. advances in missile defense. ``Our scientific,
technological and military potentials are capable of offsetting the
harm resulting from the disintegration of the system of disarmament
agreements,'' Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed gesture, Putin met with his security advisers
Friday and formally approved a new national security strategy that
warns of potential threat from U.S. military pre-eminence and the
expansion of the western military alliance closer to Russia's
frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   The document spelled out a new doctrine that would authorize
Russian forces to be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict
in which they faced ``large-scale aggression'' or were attacked
with ``weapons of mass destruction,'' according to Col. Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, who was quoted by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, last week Russia and Belarus reached an agreement to
create a 300,000-strong joint military force to counter NATO's
eastward expansion. Though the creation of the force was largely
symbolic, and an immediate dispute broke out over who would command
the troops, Putin's personal involvement in the negotiations
underscored his resolve to project a stronger image of Russian
military power.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov flies to New York this weekend for a meeting at the
United Nations to review efforts to eliminate the threat from
nuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons technology, and
he is certain to make full use of the ratification votes.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's vote, Ivanov told reporters that because the
treaty had been ratified by an overwhelming majority, ``This is an
important step towards preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.''
Russia now joins Britain and France as original nuclear powers that
have both signed and ratified the treaty banning all nuclear
explosions. The United States and China have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These votes are a very clear demonstration of the willingness
of Mr. Putin and of the Parliament to save arms control at a
critical moment when we see dangers to the regime of negotiations
started by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1960s,''
said Andrei Kokoshin, a member of Parliament and a senior national
security aide to former President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Kokoshin said the Russian leadership is deeply concerned that
the politics of the U.S. presidential election campaign were adding
to the pressure on Clinton to go forward with the deployment of a
national missile defense system, even if that meant unilaterally
breaking the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials this week emphasized that the U.S. Senate must
now ratify several outstanding protocols of the Start II
arms-reduction accord, which clarify and reaffirm the terms of the
anti-missile treaty. Without Senate action, the Russians say they
will not carry out the Start II treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration immediately praised the Russian vote
and sought to play down the U.S. failure to complete its own
ratification process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome that,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters. ``We hope as time goes on and we are able to make our
case to the Senate, our Senate will follow the lead of many other
countries around the world and ratify an important treaty.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin also expressed
hope that ``quiet consultations'' with members of the Senate might
make it possible for the United States to join the ratifying
states. ``It was the United States that led the way in signing the
comprehensive test ban and pushing for its negotiation and
ultimately its agreement. So I think we feel quite confident that
it was our leadership that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due to visit Moscow in June to try to persuade the
new Russian leader that the ballistic missile threat from rogue
states such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq warrants an adjustment to
the anti-missile treaty to allow a defense system capable of
shooting down a small number of incoming ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has set a target date of late summer to decide whether
to proceed with a missile defense system after the next scheduled
test of a prototype interceptor.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 nations have signed the test-ban treaty and more
than 50 have ratified it, but the treaty will not take effect until
44 nations specifically designated in the treaty have ratified it.
Among those are the United States and China, neither of which has.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nations welcomed the Russian vote Friday. ``This is
a big step towards our goal of this crucial treaty's entry into
force as soon as possible,'' said Peter Hain, spokesman for
Britain's Foreign Office. ``We hope that the United States and
China will now do likewise.'' He added, ``Early signature of the
treaty by India and Pakistan would also be a major step forward.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leaders of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, who were
on the verge of gaining approval to build a $500 million casino in
the Catskills, have turned their back on that plan and signed a
highly unusual agreement with the largest gambling company in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would turn over exclusive rights to build, develop and
manage any Mohawk casinos in New York state to the company, Park
Place Entertainment, the owner of three casinos in Atlantic City,
according to copies of the agreement given to The New York Times by
people who deal with the tribe. Those rights could be worth
billions of dollars, gambling industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the impoverished Mohawks would receive a $3 million
loan and a large percentage of the profits from any casino,
although some industry experts doubt that Park Place will ever
build a Mohawk gambling hall. That is one of the many unanswered
questions surrounding the deal. It is unclear, for example, whether
the agreement would stand up to federal scrutiny or a challenge by
the tribe's original casino partners.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the agreement _ negotiated by Arthur M.
Goldberg, the chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, with the
help of former U. S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato _ will almost
certainly delay the coming of any casino to the Catskills for
years. Some analysts question whether that was the intent.
</P>
<P>
   The Catskill Development Group, which had planned to donate 30
acres to the tribe for a casino in Monticello, N.Y., in return for
a share of the revenue, learned only Thursday night about the
secret agreement, which was signed by six tribal chiefs and
Goldberg on April 14. Robert Berman, a partner in the development
group, which said the tribe was being misled by what he said were
Goldberg's promises to build a casino in the Catskills within four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest rip-off of an Indian tribe since the
Dutch grabbed Manhattan for $24,'' Berman said. ``We hope that the
tribe will understand that Park Place is a wolf in sheep's clothing
whose true intention is to kill the casino in Monticello to protect
their interests in Atlantic City. The tribe is selling out its
future for a $3 million loan. But I still believe there's an
opportunity for the tribe to salvage this.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said he believes the tribe could renounce the Park Place
deal on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump and other Atlantic City casino operators _ but not
Goldberg _ have spent millions lobbying in Albany against the
Monticello casino, which they believe would cut into their profits
by attracting gamblers from New York City and northern New Jersey.
Analysts have said the Monticello casino would draw 9.3 million
visitors a year and generate more than half a billion dollars a
year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Goldberg nor the company's general counsel, Clive
Cummis, returned telephone calls Friday requesting comment. Both
men were at the Mohawks' Akwesasne Reservation Friday on the
Canadian border in Hogansburg, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gus McDonald, the tribe's executive director, and the six chiefs
who signed the agreement also did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal clerk, Carol Herne, and a former Mohawk chief,
Barbara Lazore, both said they were appalled by the deal with Park
Place. The two women said they confronted Goldberg at a restaurant
on the reservation Friday, where he was meeting with the tribal
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow this project to go down the drain,'' Lazore
said. ``I don't believe they're here to help the Monticello
project. It'd be the No. 1 competition to Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling is unconstitutional in New York, but sovereign
Indian lands are an exception. Only 16 days ago, the federal
Interior Department approved a four-year-old proposal in which
Berman's group would get around the constitutional problem by
giving the federal government 30 acres next to the Monticello
Raceway in trust for the Mohawks. The Monticello casino plan is now
awaiting approval by Gov. George Pataki and, possibly, the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Berman's application was approved in Washington,
Mohawk tribal leaders were being wooed in secret by Goldberg and
his adviser, D'Amato, according to tribal executives, rival casino
operators and Catskill Development. The six tribal chiefs signed
the Park Place agreement without consulting the lawyers the tribe
had hired to work on gambling issues, according to two tribal
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to add a whole new dimension to an already complex
situation,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Pataki. ``We'll
need to review the document closely. It appears to have some
significant implications.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a longtime adviser to Goldberg, is also close to the
governor. The former senator did not return calls, but Wayne
Berman, D'Amato's partner, said their consulting company ceased
representing Park Place on April 14, the day the agreement was
signed with the Mohawks. Wayne Berman, who is no relation to Robert
Berman, declined to discuss D'Amato's work on behalf of Park Place.
An official in the Pataki administration said that D'Amato had
stepped down as Park Place's consultant to prevent his friendship
with the governor from putting Pataki in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Place deal with the Mohawks is unusual, experts said,
because Indian tribes routinely grant casino development rights for
specific locations, but experts say that no tribe has ever given
exclusive rights to as large a territory as New York state.
</P>
<P>
   In return for granting Park Place exclusive development rights,
tribal leaders received a $3 million loan from the casino company
``for use by the tribe in its discretion.'' The tribe presumably
would use the money to bolster its small money-losing casino in
Hogansburg, where the Mohawks recently ousted the existing operator
as part of a separate deal with Park Place. The Mohawks would also
get 70 percent of the profits from every casino, after Park Place
is reimbursed for any advances.
</P>
<P>
   The casino development agreement would not cover the Hogansburg
casino or a proposal that just surfaced last year for a Mohawk
casino in Green County.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear Stearns, said Goldberg was
playing a shrewd game of chess. On the one hand, he said, Goldberg
could be using the prospect of a first-class casino in the
Catskills to scare off other companies that are considering
building new casinos in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, does he ever want to get it built?'' Ader
said. ``With one-third of his profits coming from Atlantic City,
the expansion of gaming in New York could be detrimental to this
franchise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that the Mohawks want new casinos to
provide the tribe with money and jobs. Unemployment on the Mohawks'
Akwesasne reservation ranges from 35 to 40 percent. But the
year-old casino on the reservation in Hogansburg loses about
$300,000 a month. This week, the tribe ousted the operator, Ivan
Kaufman, a Long Island businessman. The tribal leaders plan to
operate that casino themselves, under a separate consulting
agreement with Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this month, one tribal executive
expressed concern that Alpha Entertainment, a gambling company that
is working with Catskill Development, would not gain the approval
of the National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees casino
management contracts signed by Indian tribes. Desperate to avoid
another Hogansburg catastrophe, the tribal leaders looked to the
largest casino operator in the world for salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simply buying out Alpha Entertainment and replacing
it, however, Goldberg sought to take over completely. But one
tribal adviser said that Goldberg's promise to build a casino for
the tribe in Sullivan County within four months was absurd. The
Interior Department approved a specific proposal at the Monticello
Raceway. Any new proposal would have to undergo environmental and
regulatory approval, which could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning whether Park Place's promises to the tribe could
ever be delivered, one Mohawk adviser said, ``The chiefs are so
obsessed with the on-reservation casino that they've lost sight of
the larger picture.''

 &HT;    Costly chances for Heat
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Willie Roaf of New Orleans is one of the NFL's standout
offensive linemen, yet he is envious of his friend P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't even touched the post-season,'' Brown says. ``He
comes to see us play, and he's like, 'P.J., man, if I can just get
one chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   How about four in succession, under the winningest playoff coach
in a league's history? How would that sound? How about the one that
begins today, against an opponent with no real cachet, one that
doesn't have any psychological grip on your team, as recent
post-season foes have? How about starting such a series at home?
</P>
<P>
   Would you take that?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got another chance,'' Brown says. ``You don't get too
many chances. These chances are priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this opportunity comes at a considerable cost, should it be
squandered. Costly for the players, if any are truly concerned
about remaining together next season. Costly in particular for Tim
Hardaway, if he can't return to play at a level that earns him
another expensive contract.
</P>
<P>
   Costly perhaps for exalted status of the future Hall of Fame
coach, who has won hundreds of games but no title since 1988, no
second-round games since 1997, and only 12-of-30 playoff games
overall with this, his third team.
</P>
<P>
   So, would Roaf really want this grand opportunity the Miami Heat
have?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure on us,'' Hardaway said just before
he was hurt again. ``You may not see it, you may not think it, but
it is, it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pat Riley, the coach who has recorded 999 career
regular-season wins and 16 division titles, acknowledges it. Sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure, but I don't feel any,'' Riley says. ``Not
right now. I've been in this too long and too many times, I feel
tremendous excitement to get started. I know there's a bulls-eye on
our back, not just by the opposition, but by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Including him? He resisted pressure to reshape this roster after
last season's first-round loss to the Knicks, the second in
succession. He promised one more healthy run for a group that was
without a healthy Hardaway in that loss to the Knicks. He
delivered, though he did make attempts to tinker.
</P>
<P>
   But Hardaway is hurt again, and too many aging members of Alonzo
Mourning's supporting cast have worn casts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now they limp into the playoffs, after a successful season that
didn't always feel that way. Brown called it his most frustrating
go-round with the Heat, and he missed the least time of any of the
five starters.
</P>
<P>
   The team's fast start, propelled by a refreshing Go-Game
offense, was bogged down by injuries, doubts, inconsistencies,
controversies. Somehow, the Heat gutted out 52 wins, and are back
where they longed to be 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a run at a ring. Or more abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set our minds on 15 games,'' Brown says of the necessary win
total. ``It seems like a big-time deal to get, but I think we can
do it. I think we've been through a lot of heartache and pain
around here, and hopefully, it's our time. Hopefully destiny is
calling on the Heat to come on up.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that way, when Hardaway made a shotput three-pointer
to beat the Knicks at the buzzer two weeks ago, in a game that
decided the Atlantic Division title. But the Knicks are in front of
the Heat now.
</P>
<P>
   A second-round reward, perhaps, for beating Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out of the first round, that's our first start,''
Mourning said. ``Playing well, and getting out of the first round.
Then we are just looking forward to progressing from there, but
right now, that's our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's as well. The Heat are 7-11 in the first round under him,
after all. He and Jimmy Johnson stormed South Florida in the middle
of last decade. By the time Johnson finished his hair-raising term,
his reputation was tarnished, his spirit broken, his promises
unkept. Riley is signed up for five more seasons, and fiery as
ever. He inherited less than Johnson and has delivered more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Heat's leader is the only superstar coach left to
question, and the criticism may come in the wake of another playoff
failure.
</P>
<P>
   So, beyond the challenge, what is his personal stake?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about that anymore,'' Riley says. ``I'm not
trying to prove anything to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His team is another matter. He has constantly redefined an
us-against-them dynamic. Us against the officials, against the
naysayers, against the media. Riley hasn't said so, perhaps hasn't
even thought so, but it is possible that after the season the
``us'' includes himself and Mourning, and numerous newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what's at stake, after the season, whatever happens,
nobody knows,'' Brown says. ``Nobody knows what is going through
coach's mind. Right now, he's not even thinking about that. His
mind is Pistons, Pistons, Pistons. Nobody else should be thinking
nobody else but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Riley will be here, his past deeds having
earned unconditional security. This is why players protest his
controlling ways in private, not public. He is the Heat now.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was coaching out of fear of losing my job or that
I wasn't working hard enough or that I didn't know how to coach,''
Riley says. ``The first six or seven years, I didn't negotiate a
contract. I shook hands with the owner and said, 'That's good
enough.' Everything that has come my way as a coach has come
because of those early fears. I have no personal agenda in terms of
proving anything for myself. I want the team to prove itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Brown, Mourning, Hardaway, Jamal Mashburn and Dan
Majerle. We know the names. Riley knows them best, as they know
him. That's why motivation has been a challenge. Riley openly
speculated that his players had tired of the regular season, so
cognizant were they of how little it has ultimately meant. He knew
not to try many gimmicks this season, nothing like last, when he
stuck his head underwater and came up gasping, saying this is how
bad his players should ``want it.''
</P>
<P>
   As one veteran said, echoing the sentiment of several others,
``We're too old for that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Riley's big surprise this season _ other than being
somewhat less demanding _ was his December diversion of a plane to
Las Vegas for some off-day fun. Mashburn peeked out the window and
pointed out there was no MGM Grand in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   There, in Sin City, some players and coaches partook in games of
chance. Starting today, they will try another.
</P>
<P>
   A game of one last chance.

 &HT;    Voluntary evacuees a hurricane problem for Florida last year
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ ``Shadow evacuees'' _ people who didn't have to
leave but did anyway _ caused the biggest problem in the
unprecedented and chaotic evacuation of the East Coast during
Hurricane Floyd last year, according to a Florida State University
study.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 7,000 people in coastal Florida, Georgia and the
Carolinas showed many weren't in mandatory evacuation zones _
usually right at the coastline or in low-lying areas _ but left
anyway, said FSU geography Professor Jay Baker, a 25-year veteran
of hurricanes and how people react to them.
</P>
<P>
   Baker presented the figures Thursday at the National Hurricane
Conference, a gathering of weather forecasters and researchers,
emergency managers and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers surveyed 600 people in each of 11 clusters, one of
them composed of Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River,
Okeechobee and Hendry counties. In that region:
</P>
<P>
   _ Twenty-three percent of those living in flood-prone areas but
not in mandatory evacuation zones left their homes. In addition, 22
percent of those living in nonflooding areas of coastal counties
fled and 20 percent in inland counties fled. Many inland residents
did have to evacuate because they lived in mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 60 percent of those ordered to leave went to a friend's
home, 30 percent to hotels, and only 1 percent to public shelters.
But more than half of those who left their homes left their county.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you worry about in terms of road congestion,''
Baker said. ``It's these people who ... try to go to Orlando or
Jacksonville or Atlanta.'' _ Of those who evacuated, 18 percent
said they would stay in their homes next time.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, which was just shy of a Category 5 hurricane as it bore
down on the Eastern Seaboard, sparked the largest peacetime
evacuation in American history, with some 3.5 million people
leaving their homes either voluntarily or under orders, from
Miami-Dade County to North Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   While no one died in the evacuation, it was still chaotic and
could be improved, said Joe Myers, director of the Florida Division
of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do a better job of communicating,'' Myers said.
Ideas include an Internet page on which residents can enter their
ZIP code and see whether they are supposed to leave, he said. The
Web page, www.floridadisaster.org, is already up and offers other
features, but officials hope to have the ZIP code information ready
by the start of hurricane season, which runs June 1 through Nov.
30, Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, governments need to continue to preach to residents to
build the safest house they can and stay in it rather than risk
being trapped in traffic when the storm arrives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the conference are known to play a parlor game
of predicting which of their colleagues will be the ``star'' of the
following conference, the one representing the area struck by that
season's big storm. In 1999, it was virtually everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just about the only part of the Southeast that didn't
face a monster storm last summer was the city hosting this
convention. That's small consolation; when the Big One hits the
low-lying Big Easy, the potential for catastrophe here is greater
than anywhere in the hurricane target zone.

   TELEVISION-NEWS (Los Angeles) _ A new nationwide survey has
found that endless, annoying promotions and sensationalized stories

NEWS ANALYSIS: BUSH NOT ALIENATING CONSERVATIVES AS HE REACHES OUT
TO MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds ``News Analysis'' to hed) 
By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a retreat from recent Republican tenets, Gov.
George W. Bush in the past several days has advocated an expansion
of the federal role on programs ranging from education to
low-income housing to health care. And he has made overtures to
constituencies, such as gays and gun control proponents, that have
never been mainstays of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is most striking about Bush's repositioning in the nine
weeks since the South Carolina primary, when he presented himself
as an unflinching conservative, is that prominent fiscal and social
conservatives _ many of whom have been outspoken about past
nominees _ have been silent. Not one leading conservative
organization has aggressively spoken out against Bush. Some have
even embraced his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over several days, prominent conservatives on
Capitol Hill and around the country said they were intent on
rallying behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they were essentially giving Bush a pass, many
conservatives offered the same explanations again and again _ often
using the identical word: After eight years, they were ``hungry''
to win back the White House, even if that might mean sacrificing
some bedrock Republican positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some risk to the strategy of the Republican Party
asking, `Where does he stand overall on basic Republican
principles?''' said Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas. ``But Republicans
are hungry to win the presidency, and that makes people more
willing to be understanding when proposals like these come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such forgiving attitudes, some leading conservatives
said Bush's positions might make them all the more insistent that
he not pick a running mate who favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I describe it as the great accommodation,'' said Marshall H.
Wittmann, director of congressional relations for the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative group, said: ``But this can only go so
far. I do believe Bush would run into a major problem if he put a
pro-choice running mate on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, conservatives are showing no signs of defection.
Like many of his peers, Stephen Moore, director of fiscal studies
at the Cato Institute, which has long condemned new federal
spending, offered a rationale for the measures Bush has taken that
he finds distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of a Clintonesque quality to these policy
proposals,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to defend the guy. The
housing program he came up with was really absurd. But, when you're
talking about a $2 trillion budget, the price tag on that program
was maybe a few billion. I don't like the programs, but it's not
like they'll bust the bank.'' Such proposals, Moore said, may be
``what it takes to wrest the White House from Clinton and Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush did name a running mate who backs abortion rights,
many social conservatives went as far as to say they would stand
behind him _ albeit less enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum and a leading
abortion foe, did not seem particularly unsettled by recent
comments of Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania who called for loosening
the party's anti-abortion plank. He is considered a prospect to be
Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd lose if he did that,'' she said of the possibility of a
running mate like Ridge. ``There's enough of a pro-life
constituency who would feel so betrayed that they would not vote
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schlafly vowed to remain loyal even if Bush picked a running
mate who backed abortion rights. ``I'll probably stick with the
ticket,'' she said. ``There really isn't any option. Bush isn't
Gore _ and that's a big plus.'' Asked if she would defect to Pat
Buchanan, who is steadfastly against abortion and is seeking the
Reform Party nomination, she said, ``Well, I'm a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's courtship of moderates also underscores changing dynamics
in the country and in his own party: With huge federal surpluses,
even Republicans now can afford to espouse bountiful spending. And
many Republicans who were riding high after the Republicans'
takeover of the House in 1994 said they have been humbled by their
losses in 1996 and 1998 _ and that now an unabashed conservative
agenda may not be politically sensible. Some conservatives said
they would not object to the governor's proposals because they were
more a symbolic nod to Democrats and not a repudiation of
Republican philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is able to continue to reach to the center without
alienating his party's base of conservative voters, that could make
him a far more formidable candidate than if he were distracted by
the intraparty sniping that plagued Bob Dole's campaign in 1996 and
President George Bush's re-election drive four years before that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success thus far belies the predictions of many
Republican strategists, and many backers of Vice President Al Gore,
who said the Texas governor would trigger an outcry if he returned
to the more moderate path he had scrupulously followed throughout
1999 before his sharp detour to the right _ symbolized by his
appearance at Bob Jones University _ in late February.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing that in large part our policies have not only
appealed to nontraditional Republican groups but have not
engendered any backlash,'' said Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor
of Indianapolis who is Bush's chief domestic policy adviser. Asked
whether conservatives were backing the governor's proposals for
pragmatic reasons, Goldsmith said: ``Sure. Absolutely. It's nice to
have people wanting to win but also be happy about our policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are warning that Bush's strategy could lead
some conservatives to refuse to vote in November. ``He's going to
the left of Al Gore,'' said L. Brent Bozell, president of the
Conservative Victory Committee, which contributes to Republican
candidates. ``When Republicans take their base for granted, that
base stays home _ and Bush would not stand a prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But an important reason why Bush is free to reach beyond hard
core Republicans is that polls show that Republicans voters have
rapidly consolidated behind him. A poll of registered Republicans
that was conducted April 13-14 and published by Newsweek found that
85 percent said they would support Bush. Candidates usually are not
able to muster such impressive levels of support until after they
rally the faithful at their national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said whenever any conservative
raises questions about Bush's bonafides on abortion or question his
proposals for more spending, he has a ready answer: ``They'd better
concentrate on the fact that the next president of the United
States is going to nominate three or four people to the Supreme
Court. Do they want Bush doing that? Or do they want Gore doing
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, who was a strategist for the Steve Forbes
campaign, said, ``Nobody wants to be held responsible for hurting
the nominee of the party who's at least talking about some
conservative issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political strategists say that Bush's aggressive efforts to
reach out has given him the upper hand over Gore in recent weeks.
They likened his approach to Bill Clinton's successful shift from
the liberal wing of his party when he ran for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying to emulate what we did,'' said Al From, who
heads the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group that was
a foundation for Clinton's bid for the White House. ``And he's had
no pressure from the Democrats or the right wing. Maybe the
Republican right will roll over dead and he'll have a free ride.
Then it will be up to Gore to show who's the imposter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some staunch supporters of the vice president warn that he
should not allow Bush to appropriate issues from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me squirm a little bit when he endorsed what we did on
Medicare,'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who has pressed his own party
to steer a moderate course, said of Bush. ``He's done it on
education, he's done it on health care. He's actually been
aggressive in those areas. Now Gore also has to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign officials said any advantage Bush may enjoy
will be short-lived. In coming days, they said, the vice president
will intensify his attacks, asserting that Bush cannot both call
for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years as he is proposing
more government spending. They also said Gore will begin to poke
holes in the Bush proposals themselves as mere window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What we call the Bob Jones Redemption Tour is flawed in a lot
of different ways,'' said Carter Eskew, a leading architect of the
Gore strategy. ``The more he talks about education and health care,
the more he exposes the fundamental flaw of his campaign: the tax
cut, which is a deal he had to make with the devil to secure his
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's move to the center ``might look like a politically
clever move,'' Eskew said, it will damage him in the end. ``If you
start to raise expectations that Bush is going to address those
problems, voters are going to put a spotlight on him. And we get
into a comparison. Guess what? That's our turf.''

WHITE HOUSE AIDES CRITICIZE GOP'S MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has sharply criticized the House
Republican proposal for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs,
saying it seemed ``like a Swiss cheese plan with more holes than
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's economic policy adviser, Gene Sperling, and
his health policy coordinator, Chris Jennings, said on Thursday
that they were frustrated by the lack of specifics in the
Republican plan and disliked the details that they did know.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials insisted that they wanted to work with
Republicans in Congress to add prescription drug benefits to
Medicare, the health insurance program for 39 million people who
are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican plan, outlined last week, would use private
insurance subsidized by the government to help pay prescription
drug costs for people treated outside hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, in contrast, drug coverage would
become a standard part of the Medicare benefits package, available
to anyone willing to pay an extra premium, and the government would
bear most of the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House briefing Thursday and in interviews Friday,
White House officials appeared to be sending two messages.
</P>
<P>
   First, they said, the House Republican plan is flawed. Second,
they still want to work out a compromise on the issue, which will
figure prominently in the presidential campaign and in many
congressional races this year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe their strategy in passing the
legislation, Sperling and Jennings said they pinned their hopes on
the Senate Finance Committee, where members of the two parties have
a history of working together. The committee has held several
hearings on Clinton's plan and on drug benefits in general.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, Jennings said, there is no guarantee
that private insurers will offer affordable drug coverage in all
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what provision of the proposal assures that all,
most or even any Medicare beneficiaries will have access to the new
drug benefit,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans are fleshing out their proposal, drafting
legislation based on cost estimates they had received from the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said: ``White House officials are shooting in the dark. They want
to turn this into a political issue. If they would try to work with
us instead of just shooting at us, we might be able to get
something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, said,
``The silver lining of the Republicans' prescription drug plan is
that they finally came up with one, though it's two pages.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Sperling said, ``What we have now from the
Republicans is a two-page document which has more questions than
answers, and to us, it still seems like a Swiss cheese plan with
more holes than substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also said the financial outlook for Medicare
was brighter than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be solvent until
2025, two years later than previously projected, Shalala said. A
report issued on March 30 by trustees of the Medicare program said
the trust fund would be exhausted in 2023.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year difference can be explained by a computer
programming error, officials said. Because of the error, the
government underestimated the interest that would be earned for the
trust fund. The assets of the trust fund, beyond the amounts needed
to pay benefits and other expenses, are invested in special
government securities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Medicare program, said
the amount of the underestimate, $2.1 billion this year, would
increase gradually to $20 billion a year by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberal Democrats have questioned the sincerity of House
Republicans, suggesting that they are drafting a prescription drug
plan to provide political cover in this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Sperling said he would not challenge the Republicans'
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for us right now is not to try to read their
minds, or read their motivations,'' Sperling said, ``but, for the
good of the country, to take seriously any suggestion someone makes
that they are sincere and trying to work together with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to respond to the Republicans, he said, is ``by
giving them the benefit of the doubt and taking them at their word
that they want to work together.''

 &HT;    In a familiar battle, Heat without its strongest soldier
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was difficult to watch.
</P>
<P>
   There was Tim Hardaway, not so long ago the Heat's most
important player, on the sideline at LaSalle High School while his
teammates went through a final practice Friday afternoon in
preparation for today's NBA playoff opener against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There was Hardaway struggling through exercises on knees and
legs and feet so sore he is unwilling or unable to describe the
pain that burns too often and lingers too long. He would dip, and
labor to return to a standing position. He would balance on one
leg, and strain _ especially on his left side _ to stabilize for
more than a few seconds. He would step up and down, on and off a
bench in movements too deliberate to hide the exertion necessary to
complete the task.
</P>
<P>
   He is 33 years old, and closer to the end of a very good career
than he cares or allows himself to admit.
</P>
<P>
   He is 33 years old, and still tormented by last spring's
disappointment when New York's belligerent Knicks bumped the Heat
from the first round of the playoffs. That episode only compounded
the disappointment of the previous spring when the Knicks also took
out the Heat in a first-round confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, perhaps more than anyone on Miami's roster, craved a
return playoff test. April and its so-called second season couldn't
get here quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here it is.
</P>
<P>
   And the harsh reality of it all as the Heat come lugging their
baggage of playoff failures past into playoffs present is that
whatever they do _ beginning against Detroit _ they'll probably do
without Hardaway assuming any kind of a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING AGAINST A STRONG TIDE
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway isn't a great player anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In his current state of physical disrepair, arguments have grown
from whispers that Hardaway isn't much better than average. His
feet hurt. His ankles hurt. His knees hurt. And his feet, ankles
and knees hurt beyond the normal range of pain many NBA players
endure at this stage of a long season.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that the most recent of Hardaway's injuries _ an
inflamed plantar fascia tendon in his left foot _ is a mask for
recurring problems stemming from his knee injuries anger him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my foot,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Heat head coach Pat Riley, too, says it's Hardaway's foot. And
then he says more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the deal,'' Riley said. ``There's nothing under the
rug. Even when he was healthy and playing, Tim was hurting. He has
had knee problems. That's nothing new. The foot? The ankle sprains?
It's like a bathtub you turn on and forget about ... it overflows.
That's what Tim is fighting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Hardaway would strap himself into a harness
and walk against water resistance in a pool at AmericanAirlines
Arena. The force of the spray can rush out at an impact of 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway won't drown.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, without him, might.
</P>
<P>
   HARDAWAY CAN ONLY GIVE SO MUCH
</P>
<P>
   The Heat played almost half the regular season (30 games)
without Hardaway, and Riley insists he is comfortable with rookie
Anthony Carter, who was a Yakima Sun King in the CBA last season,
at the point. That's what he says. Whether he means it or not is
another question. Riley, though, is absolutely uncomfortable about
the 10 or 15 minutes every game the Heat play without Hardaway when
Jamal Mashburn goes to the point in relief of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A position we don't like to be in,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Hardaway, if available, might fit.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said it's ``doubtful'' Hardaway will play at all in the
opener against the Pistons, but that's coachspeak gobbledygook
meaning little. More revealing is Riley's admission _ hope, is what
it was _ that the Heat might milk those same ``10 or 15 minutes'' a
game out of Hardaway at some juncture in the Detroit series.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who remains more capable of producing the heroic
moment than anyone else on the team simply because he remains more
willing to take the heroic risk than any of his teammates, can't do
what he wants to do these days. So it is that Riley will get from
Hardaway what he can.
</P>
<P>
   Because he must.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Republican senators told President Clinton
this week that they opposed his efforts to renegotiate an arms
control treaty with Russia and to build only a limited anti-missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The senators _ including Majority Leader Trent Lott and Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms _ favor a full, robust
defense system against missiles, and many of them prefer to scrap
the treaty altogether. They worry that Clinton will be too willing
to compromise in order to conclude a strategic arms agreement with
Russia before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The president has promised a decision this summer on whether he
will proceed to build a anti &UR; - &LR; missile defense system, which would
violate the treaty unless it is amended.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, 25 senators complained that his proposal
would tie the hands of a future administration by letting Russia
dictate changes in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. That
accord prohibits any national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without significant changes to your approach, we do not
believe an agreement submitted to the Senate for consideration
should be ratified,'' the Republicans said in a letter sent to the
White House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have embraced missile defense as their issue and
hope to use it against Democrats in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, said he would deploy an anti-ballistic
missile system ``at the earliest possible date.'' He also said he
would be willing to withdraw from the treaty if Russia refuses to
make the changes he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
supports Clinton's approach and wants the president to decide
during the campaign on deployment. That would allow Gore to fend
off Republican charges that the Democrats have been soft on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Fuerth, Gore's national security adviser, said recently
that Clinton ``has time, and there is every reason why he should
make this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In its search for a compromise, the administration has come up
with an approach that pleases neither the Russians _ who believe
the Americans want to build too large a missile defense _ nor the
Republicans. They say they will block the proposal because it is
not big enough.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is attempting to lock the United States into a
system that cannot defend the American people against even the
limited threats we face today,'' Helms, a North Carolina
Republican, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed amending the treaty to allow the United
States to begin building 100 missile interceptors at a site in
Alaska; it would be the center of a system guided by ground and
space-based radars. The shield is intended to protect the country
against a limited missile attack from potential threats like North
Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, the U.S. and Russian officials have been engaged
in informal talks, which a senior administration described as very
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are not anywhere near accepting what the
administration has offered,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the president's actions would make it
difficult to field a much larger anti-missile defense system later,
or to take advantage of other promising technologies, like
space-based lasers and anti &UR; - &LR; missile defenses aboard ships.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A senior Senate Republican aide said the timing of the letter
was meant to blunt Clinton's enthusiasm for negotiating a deal with
Vladimir Putin, the newly elected Russian president, when they meet
in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to try to get word to the White House of the views
of most Senate Republicans,'' said the aide, who said there were 10
to 15 other Republicans who support the aims of the letter. ``The
president wants a strategic arms accord for his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Republicans in Congress have pushed the
administration to deploy a missile system, some, like Sen. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, are not in a rush, arguing that it would be
better to wait for the next administration to make such an
important decision.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are wary of building a missile shield if it undermines
the agreements to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, a position
supported by many European allies.
</P>
<P>
   This week at the behest of Putin, the Russian Parliament passed
two arms control treaties, including Start II, which nearly halves
the nuclear arsenals of both countries. But Parliament conditioned
those agreements on American adherence to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Start II treaty can take affect, the Senate would
have to agree to several protocols, including extending the treaty
to 2007 and accepting that Russia is one of the four successor
states to the accord. It takes a two-thirds Senate vote to approve
a treaty or the protocols.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's strategy is to demonstrate to the world that it is
Washington and not Moscow that is jeopardizing the ABM agreement
and all subsequent treaties to curb the spread of nuclear and other
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from around the world convene in New York on Monday
to begin reviewing the nonproliferation treaty, under which nations
without nuclear weapons vow not to acquire them, in exchange for
help with civilian nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who signed the letter this week could block any
treaty changes submitted to the Senate for approval. While it takes
34 votes to reject a treaty if it comes to the Senate floor, in
practice either Helms or Lott could block one by himself. Helms
could keep any pact bottled up in his committee, or Lott could
refuse to call it up for floor action, even if it had come out of
committee.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There he sits, Jimmy Marks, two rows of diamonds on
the bridge of his glasses, diamond cuff links, gold and diamond
rings. He won't give up his fight, this Don Quixote, this deposed
prince of the Gypsies of Spokane, Wash. Most of Spokane's Gypsies
would just like Marks to shut up. He has brought too much exposure
to their secretive world, they say, and he plays into Gypsy
stereotypes. Now he is ``marime'' _ ``unclean'' in Romany, the
Gypsy language _ an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refuse to invite me to a funeral, or a wedding,'' he
said. Recently, he went to a Gypsy gathering, and he was
ostracized. ``They didn't offer me food,'' he said. ``Do you
understand? They didn't give me coffee or cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks was sitting in a Greek coffee shop in the Chelsea section
of Manhattan, in town to promote ``American Gypsy,'' a documentary
film by Jasmine Dellal that tells the story of how Marks came to be
an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   The film describes the police raid in 1986 on the houses of
Marks and his father, Grover, a ``baro,'' ``big man,'' a patriarch
of Spokane Gypsies. The Markses were fortunetellers and used-car
dealers in Spokane. The police said they were searching for stolen
goods. They tore gold-plated false fingernails from the women,
snatched earrings from a girl, searched a baby's diapers. They
found $1.6 million in cash, some sewn into quilts, and $160,000 in
jewelry. There were items from 35 different burglaries, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later a Superior Court judge ruled the search
illegal because it had taken place before a warrant was issued. The
Gypsies, who do not trust banks, often keep money at home.
Eventually, four charges were dropped; the cash and jewelry were
ordered returned. Marks and his mother, Lippie, pleaded guilty to
misdemeanors, saying they had unwittingly bought a few items from
an informer for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Marks family then sued the city of Spokane in federal court
for $40 million, claiming their civil rights had been violated.
Marks was now considered unclean because his home had been
``polluted'': the careful boundaries of Gypsy custom between men
and women, between the upper and lower body, had been violated by
the police in their search. He had also committed another crime in
the Gypsy world: he had brought unwelcome attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   During the 11 years the legal dispute lasted, ``I entertained
myself with the city and county of Spokane,'' Marks said. He
presented a set of deer horns to Spokane's late mayor, Jack
Geraghty. ``I told them, `I gave you horns because you're all
devils.''' He left hundreds of telephone messages for city
officials and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 the case was settled, and the city and county
awarded $1.4 million to the Markses, without admitting wrongdoing.
Marks took only a dollar. His brothers split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal, who produced the film, is from a Jewish-English
background. She said she began making ``American Gypsy'' because of
the almost casual prejudice against Gypsies in the United States
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Her film opens a door onto a culture long hidden from
``gadje''(non-Gypsies in Romany). (Gypsies usually prefer to be
called ``Rom,'' or ``Roma.'') The exact number of Gypsies worldwide
is unknown because they distrust outsiders and often do not
identify themselves. ``If I were asked where I was from,'' Marks
said, ``I'd say I was Greek because this is a Greek coffee shop.''
</P>
<P>
   There are estimated to be about 12 million Gypsies worldwide, 1
million in the United States. They have always been nomadic _ and
persecuted. Between 500,000 and 1.5 million Gypsies were
slaughtered during the Holocaust, which is known in Romany as the
``Porrajmos'' or ``the devouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for Gypsies in Eastern Europe continue to be
precarious, according to journalists and Gypsy organizations. They
were targeted during and after the war in Kosovo, with 100,000
reportedly driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The film addresses some of the myths about Gypsies. It was once
thought that they originated in Egypt, hence the word ``Gypsy.''
But, ``evidence points to their having been a multi-ethnic military
body assembled to fight off the spread of Islam,'' said Ian
Hancock, a professor of Romany Studies at the University of Texas
in Austin, who appears in the film. Hancock is a Romanichal Gypsy,
descended from British Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The Romany term ``gadjo,'' ``outsider,'' is related to the
Sanskrit ``gajjha,'' or ``civilian,'' Hancock said. The Rom began
migrating from India in the 11th century; until 1864 they were
slaves in the area that eventually became Romania. Today, Romanian
Gypsies, or ``Vlax,'' the group to which the Marks family belongs,
form the largest population of Gypsies in the United States and are
the least assimilated. Rom are divided into groups and subgroups by
country of origin and profession. Among the Vlax are the Kalderash
and Machwaya. The Kalderash, once coppersmiths, often work in auto
body shops; Machwaya women are usually fortunetellers. Marks comes
from both groups.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who believes he is about 52, was born in a tent near
Boise, Idaho. His parents were migrant laborers. ``They washed my
diapers in cold winter in the river,'' he said. ``I decided to do
my birthday Feb. 14,'' Valentine's Day, he said, to make it easier
to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal's film describes the powerful sanctions against
``pollution'' that govern Gypsy life. The lower part of a woman's
body is considered unclean because of menstruation and is
traditionally covered by a long skirt. Separate towels are used by
both sexes for the upper and lower bodies. Scholars think the
taboos arose because the Rom were forbidden by the local people to
use their public wells, and the customs helped maintain hygiene. A
woman can deliberately ``pollute'' a man by flicking him with the
end of her skirt, causing him to be ostracized. Gypsy marriages are
arranged; a married woman wears a head scarf in public. Among the
Vlax, violations of taboos are judged by a ``kris,'' a court. And
the ultimate punishment, like that imposed on Marks, is
``marimos.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies have long been identified with petty crime. But their
advocates argue that they have been driven to crime because of
discrimination and their inability to get jobs. Still, there are
Gypsy physicians and lawyers. Gypsies are reluctant to send their
children to school, partly because it could provoke interference by
outsiders, and because, they say, they are afraid their children
will learn about ``outside'' ways like drugs and sex. Thus many
Gypsies are illiterate or semiliterate, like Marks, who had only a
second-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marks technically won his case against the city of
Spokane, he is still crying for justice. He said that his fellow
Gypsies continue to ostracize him ``because I'm still talking to
the media and to city hall, opening our culture to the world,'' he
said. ``The settlement was just money. I know I'm a victim of a
vicious rape.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that his family is still being harassed by the
police. Over the Labor Day weekend last year, family members,
including his son, David, were arrested at the grave of his father,
where they said they were following the Gypsy custom of ``sharing''
food and alcohol with the dead. ``They want us to leave our dead,''
Marks said. But the Spokane police have denied harassing the
Gypsies. Sheriff Mark Sterk defended the actions of the deputy who
arrested the Markses. ``He asked them to do certain things to
comply with the law and was violently assaulted instead,'' Sterk
told The Spokesman-Review.
</P>
<P>
   Dellal, sitting in the coffee shop with Marks, said that he had
become obsessed. ``That's what's allowed him to triumph,'' she
said. ``But it's also his downfall. He's a loudmouth. It
perpetuates the way he's ostracized.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marks sees himself as a hero, ``your Daniel Boone.'' Marks
asked, ``why didn't he keep his mouth shut?''

   WHERE-THE-HEART-IS-FILM (Undated) _ People don't get much more
alone in the world than Novalee Nation in the early scenes of
``Where the Heart Is.'' She's 17, very pregnant and even barefoot _
since her shoes fell through a huge hole in the car floor somewhere
between Tennessee and Oklahoma. On the drive from her trailer-park
home to a new life in California, she makes the mistake of asking
her boyfriend to stop at a Wal-Mart so she can go to the bathroom.
When she returns to the parking lot, he and the car are gone.
Novalee (Natalie Portman, looking radiant but very un-Queen
Amidala-like) does the only thing she can think of, since she
doesn't know a soul in Sequoyah, Okla. She goes back into the
store, and when it closes for the night (while she's in the ladies'
room) she just stays. Thanks to the camping, patio furniture and
exercise equipment departments and shelves full of magazines and
working alarm clocks, she's quite comfortable for six weeks. After
she goes into labor there she's a local celebrity, and little by
little she builds a life in Sequoyah, with the usual ups and downs,
weddings and funerals, kidnappings and tornados. Directed by Matt
Williams, ``Where the Heart Is,'' opens on Friday. By Anita Gates.

   POPULAR-CULTURE-FILMS (Undated) _ What do we really talk about
with our friends when we're not discussing the vicissitudes of our
personal lives? Why, popular culture, of course! Much of the
conversational glue that binds us together comes from the stuff
that wafts off television, movie and computer screens, from our
stereo speakers and headsets. But go to almost any Hollywood movie,
and you'll find a strange absence on screen of palaver about
recordings, movies, television shows and popular fiction. That's
one reason that when a film comes along that acknowledges the
passions millions of us harbor about favorite works of popular art,
it can strike a deep chord of recognition. Two of the best American
movies released this year _ ``American Psycho'' and ``High
Fidelity'' _ show a bone-deep understanding of how much of our
emotional energy is invested in the consumption of popular culture.

<P>
   LISA-KRUEGER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ The writer and director Lisa
Krueger, 39, has made only two movies, but the longing for
structure is a central theme in both. Indeed, some of the most
touching moments in her 1996 indie debut ``Manny and Lo'' involve
watching how the lives of two underage orphan runaways (Scarlett
Johannsen and Aleska Palladino) are enriched when they kidnap a
discipline-driven woman (Mary Kay Place) and the three become a
makeshift family. As for Joline (Heather Graham), the nightclub
manager heroine of Ms. Krueger's latest film, ``Committed''
(opening Friday), she finds comfort in structure, too. But her
quest _ to save an unraveling marriage by hunting down her wayward
photojournalist husband, Carl (Luke Wilson) _ comes at the expense
of her happiness and, eventually, her own sanity. By Margy Rochlin.

   BIG-KAHUNA-FILM (New York) _ Last winter, the cast and crew of
``The Big Kahuna'' filmed a feature in the time some people spend
on a beach vacation. Made in Manhattan in just 16 days, stars Kevin
Spacey and Danny DeVito. Adapted by Roger Rueff from his play
``Hospitality Suite,'' the 90-minute film, directed by John
Swanbeck, opens on Friday. It throws three businessmen into one
claustrophobic hotel room and, with a large dose of humor, forces
them to hash out issues of religion, principle and morality. By Ted

<P>
   BOUND-FOR-GLORY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Hal Ashby's 1976 film
biography of the militant singer-composer Woody Guthrie, ``Bound
for Glory,'' misses critics' four-star ranking by a fraction, which
isn't bad for a film with some weaknesses to go along with its
considerable strengths. Ashby, who died at age 59 in 1988 and whose
credits include ``Harold and Maude'' (1971), ``Shampoo'' (1975) and
``Being There'' (1979), had a feeling for quirky characters.
``Bound for Glory'' (MGM, 146 minutes, $24.98, PG) is one of those

DVD. By PETER M. NICHOLS. . &QL;

double, with her sleek 5-foot-8-inch frame, her fragile beauty and
her long, blond hair. Onstage, her persona is fiercer. During her
22-year dance career, Chouinard has been called everything from
``the high priestess of choreographic shock'' and ``a sorceress''
to ``the praying mantis in the hothouse of Quebec dance.'' Many of
her solo dances _ including the first, ``Crystallization'' (1978) _
are being presented by Compagnie Marie Chouinard in a rare

<P>
   VALLEY-OF-IAO-THEATER (New York) _ Lee Nagrin left her childhood
home, Seattle, to come to New York City, where in the early 1950s
she became a noted Off Broadway performance artist and director,
collaborated with Meredith Monk and painted. Her younger brother,
Bert Swezea, stayed behind, becoming a popular real estate agent in
Seattle, where he married and had two sons. Their decidedly
different-seeming paths rejoined in 1992, when Nagrin received news
that Buddy, as she called him, was seriously ill in Maui, Hawaii,
where he had formed a new life of the spirit. Nagrin traveled to
Hawaii to be with her brother, who died the following year. Out of
that experience has come ``The Valley of Iao,'' which opens on

   ALMEIDA-THEATER (London) _ If we discount the much-hyped London
debut of Kathleen Turner in a stage version of ``The Graduate,''
the Almeida theater has been gobbling up the London critics'
attention in recent weeks. First there was the premiere of Harold
Pinter's ``Celebration'' at the company's grungy headquarters in
Islington. Then it presented Nicholas Wright's new ``Cressida'' in
the West End, with a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon
as a trainer of the boy actors who took female roles in
early-17th-century England. And now it has reopened the doors of
the East End film studios once used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged
``Richard II'' with Ralph Fiennes as the king, a production
expected at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall. By Benedict
Nightingale.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SINEAD-CUSACK-THEATER (London) _ It would be an easy assumption
to make, but a wrong one, to think of Sinead Cusack as famous by
association. In her native Ireland, the surname evokes associations
to that country's eminent acting clan. Not only was her father,
Cyril, one of the last century's best-known Irish performers, but
having been born into celebrity, Cusack proceeded to marry a man
who became one: Jeremy Irons, the film star. Cusack, however, has
garnered an impressive share of acting renown of her own. Last week
she opened Off Broadway at the Irish Repertory Theater in Sebastian
Barry's ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' reprising a role that won her a
Critics' Circle Award and an Evening Standard prize for best
actress in London in 1998 at the Royal National Theater. By Matt
Wolf. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YARD-GAL-THEATER (London) _ As is often the case by this point
in the Broadway season, London playwrights are having their say.
This year, three of England's senior dramatists are represented in
plays both new and in revival: Michael Frayn (``Copenhagen''),
Peter Shaffer (``Amadeus'') and Tom Stoppard (``The Real Thing'').
On Wednesday they will be joined Off Broadway by one of Britain's
younger generation when Rebecca Prichard, 28, makes her American
theater debut with her play ``Yard Gal.'' In previews at the MCC
Theater in Chelsea, ``Yard Gal'' is a study over time of two
feisty, quick-witted girl gang members. By Matt Wolf.  &QL;

Varese's ``Ameriques,'' and on Saturday evening Seiji Ozawa and the
Boston Symphony will offer Oliver Messiaen's ``Turangalila
Symphony,'' with the excellent Pierre-Laurent Aimard in the
important part for solo piano. Varese began ``Ameriques'' shortly
after he had settled in New York, in 1915, and Messiaen wrote
``Turangalila'' for Ozawa's orchestra (which was then, in the late

   BOOTY-SONGS (subslug) (Undated) _ Soundtracks to spring lust are
nothing new, of course. The booty historian could trace the genre
back to medieval maypole dances or, in modernist times,
Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring.'' The latter not only depicts the
primitive fertility rituals at the root of today's spring singles
but also uses music more dependent on rhythm than melody, with the
fast-driving string ostinatos and emphatic percussive downbeats
that are at the core of Sisqo's ``Thong Song.'' The song, a
celebration of glimpses of scanty female underwear by Sisqo of the
rhythm-and-blues group Dru Hill, was bubbling well under the Top
40. But by last week, with spring love in the air and spring break
on the beach, it was up at No. 5 and still climbing. By Neil

   ACADEMIE-JULIAN-ART (New York) _ One of this season's more
rewarding sleepers is ``Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the
Academie Julian'' at the Dahesh Museum, in Manhattan. Visitors,
though not always numerous, tend to be keenly attentive. The
subject matter makes very good points at every turn but does not
set out either to bully or reproach us. It is in every history of
French painting that in 1868 Rodolphe Julian, a former wrestler,
founded an independent art school in Paris that remains active to
this day. It was the only place in the city at which a woman could
study art intensively in a well-lighted room from a living model
and count on being taught by artists of substantial quality. By

   VIETNAM-MEMORIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Serving in Vietnam, we
bonded, we changed. And we returned home to the other Vietnam, the
domestic battlefield of hard-hats and peaceniks, the Vietnam that
one side proclaimed the frontline against godless communism, and
the other a symbol of all the greed and immorality of a perfidious
establishment. The protests waned, but we still avoided talking
about the war. Many people viewed veterans of the war with
condescension. But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that
developed in the 1980s was far different from any grunt, or any
Vietnam I knew. By Serge Schmemann. (Moving in the `i' category)

   TECH-SNOBS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In these digital days, not knowing
the difference between memory and hard disk space can be grounds

from a certain class background, and it helps to flaunt a personal
digital assistant _ preferably one with data-beaming capabilities.
``Early adopters'' have always been a bit obnoxious. From the first
proud few to replace slide rules with calculators to CB radio
hobbyists to the audiophiles who paid thousands of dollars for the

   HEALTHCARE-PERKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have new
expectations from their health care system. They want the latest in
medical technology, just as they hunger for the latest sports
utility vehicles and other jazzy consumer goods. But they also seek
balms for psyches often embattled by illness, and ways of dealing
with pain and discomfort that do not come in pill form. They are
also want medicine to improve their looks, often in an environment
where a checkup, a cancer screening and a facial can all be done
under one roof. And the health care industry is responding to
consumer demand. It is offering more aesthetic procedures and
complementary services. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

<P>
   CUBA-BOY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Elian Gonzalez case illustrates
that courts run on adult time while children suffer the
consequences. For many American children, their destinies remain
uncertain, sometimes for months and years, as their custody and
child welfare cases wind through the courts. Experts see tension
between two competing notions of time: the deliberate, adult pace
of the law, in which a day, or a week or a month may be seen as not
significant, and the the highly compressed time of child
development, in which bonds can be made, or poisoned, in the same
space of time. By Somni Sengupta.

   GUNS-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Both sides in the gun control
debate assume that America's earliest experiences with guns shaped

Americans should embrace their frontier heritage and reliance on
guns, or resist it. But in a new book due this fall, a historian
challenges what he calls a modern myth and argues that gun
ownership in the frontier era was far from universal. By Anthony
Ramirez.

   PIPEDREAM.COM-REVIEW (Undated) _ In this time of dizzying
volatility on Wall Street, no company's fortunes have seesawed
quite so dramatically as those of PipeDream.com, whose initial

share to 468 5/8 in its first week of trading, making its founder

   SATELLITE-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nations were once able to
hide their armaments, misdeeds and fortresses from the eyes of nosy
civilians, while militaries could pry into most corners of the
globe from spy satellites, secure in the knowledge that they could
control who got to take a peek. No more. Taking pictures from space
is undergoing a revolution, and it is making some governments feel

   VIETNAM-PHOTO-REVIEW (Undated) _ It became the most remembered
photograph of the fall of Saigon, and most people believed that it
showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the U.S.
embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture caption
usually says. But as with much about the Vietnam war, the caption
is wrong. The building is a nearby apartment complex. The people
fleeing are Vietnamese. The last flight out of Saigon was hours
away. In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. By Fox BUtterfield.

   IRAN-POLITICS (Washington) _ Iran is in the midst of a brutal,
open-ended political war being waged on several fronts - the
courts, the press, television, the Parliament, the pulpit, the
bazaar, the streets. The current round of fighting heated up after
reformists candidates swept to victory in the first round of
Parliamentary elections in February. And the stakes are high -
nothing less than the nature of the Islamic Republic itself. By
Elaine Sciolino.

   INTERNET-THIRDWORLD-REVIEW (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ The changes
created by the Internet in rich industrialized nations are well
known, affecting everything from the way people date to the way
they work. But less is known about impact on communities with
limited contact with the rest of the world. As examples of such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: the way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the
outside world is likely to be altered forever. By Simon Romero.

   GLOBAL-CONTRASTS-REVIEW (London) A correspondent describes the
contrasts he observed after leaving the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland, and then heading to Africa: rubbing shoulders with
dot-com billionaires, oil industry barons and sleek investment
bankers, in an Alpine village set among among the pristine snow
fields, and then, on the Angola-Zambia border, mingling with the
poorest of the poor, where the meaning of the word economy had been
distilled to the barefoot essentials of survival. By Alan Cowell.

THEY DIDN'T BUCKLE, AND THE DEVILS CREDIT ROBINSON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it was over on Thursday night, when the Devils had swept
the Florida Panthers out of the playoffs with four straight
victories, it was time for a few admissions. Yes, the Devils said,
there was real relief that they had avoided the humiliating
first-round exits of the previous two seasons. And yes, the calm
guidance of Coach Larry Robinson had made a real difference for a
team that in recent years had found a way to underachieve at the
worst possible moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took Friday off and will practice Saturday in New
Jersey. The second round of the playoffs will not start until
Thursday _ and the Devils are not sure yet whom they will be
playing _ but for now they can take some encouragement from the
fact that the way they took care of the Panthers this week was
reminiscent of the way they captured the Stanley Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the 1995 postseason, the Devils used brilliant
goaltending from Martin Brodeur. Scott Stevens, the Devils'
captain, neutralized Florida's best player, Pavel Bure, in the same
way he defused Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, Philadelphia's Eric
Lindros and Detroit's Sergei Fedorov in the 1995 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So now it is 1995 that the New Jersey players will probably be
asked about as they get ready for the second round next week, and
not 1998 and 1999, when the Devils were upset by Ottawa and then
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we were scared that it could happen again,'' a relieved
Randy McKay said Thursday night of the Devils' concern of being
ousted in the first round again. ``There was a lot of that
around,'' he said of the fear, ``but we have a lot of character
players on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added tellingly, ``we have a good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In the happy Devils locker room, Bobby Holik raved about the
influence of Robinson, who was named head coach with eight games
left in the regular season and the team in a serious slump. He said
Robinson's emphasis on being positive _ on even looking ahead
beyond the first round _ had bolstered the team's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry said, `Let's not be satisfied with one round,' and we
started to believe,'' Holik said. ``I don't know how many times he
calmed us down on the bench and said the right things in the
dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Robinson's speeches in the dressing room took place
during the first intermission of Thursday's game. The Devils had
played a poor first period and they could have been down by more
than Bure's only goal in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say whether he was angry or composed,'' Holik
said, ``but I can tell you he got his point across. It was because
of Marty that we were down by just a goal. We could have been down
by four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson spoke, the Devils listened. They came out with
enthusiasm for the second period and took the lead on goals by
Patrik Elias and Scott Niedermayer before the period was over. They
then protected their 2-1 lead until the final four minutes of the
game, when Sergei Nemchinov scored twice to wrap up the series.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Devils will try to stay sharp while waiting for their
next opponent to emerge. If Pittsburgh can pull off its threatened
upset of Washington, then the Penguins will play the Philadelphia
Flyers in Round 2, while the Devils play the winner of the
Toronto-Ottawa series, which is tied at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger issue for the Devils at the moment has to do with
their long layoff between the first and second rounds. The Devils
say it is good for them because they have players who need time to
heal their injuries and because they have two 36-year-old
defensemen, Stevens and Ken Daneyko, who can use the rest. Still,
after a week off, the Devils will not have quite the same momentum
they do right now.
</P>
<P>
   They will practice lightly on Saturday at their South Mountain
Arena training facility in West Orange, N.J. On Sunday they will
get the day off. And then the pace picks up as the Devils try to
write a sequel to 1995.  &QL;

FRASER, VANNEY TURNING INTO DYNAMIC DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The dangerous strike tandem of Ariel Graziani and
Jason Kreis was nearly shut out last week by Galaxy central backs
Robin Fraser and Greg Vanney, both U.S. National team regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis, Major League Soccer's reigning MVP, was shut down and
Graziani scored on a broken play in the 82nd minute, providing some
exciting final minutes before the Galaxy escaped with a 2-1 victory
over the Dallas Burn at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from that mishap and a couple others that figure to
happen along the way as the two work side-by-side for the first
time, Fraser and Vanney are developing into a dominating backline
duo.
</P>
<P>
   And, again, they will have their work cut out for them tonight
when the Galaxy play the Miami Fusion at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is led by strikers Eric Wynalda, coming back from an
anterior cruciate ligament injury that forced him to miss most of
the 1999 season, and Roy Lassiter, who had a successful season with
D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wynalda and Lassiter have been among the league's finest,
but they've struggled this season.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Wynalda, from Westlake Village, and Lassiter has
been erratic, which might explain Miami's early offensive troubles.
The Fusion has scored only four times, but remains 1-1-3 since it
has allowed a league-low three goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Wynalda, Lassiter and former Galaxy striker Welton
get on track, the Fusion will be tough to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin and I take pride shutting down the other team's forwards
and I thought we did a good job against Graziani and Kreis until
that silly goal,'' said Vanney. ``With Roy, you've got to stay with
him in the box because he finds ways to get on the end of crosses
to put away goals, but he's usually not going to create many
chances for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric can create things for himself, but he gets frustrated a
lot. You just have to stay on him and make sure you don't give him
those chances and at some point he'll get frustrated and probably
start to get on his teammates and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanney, a midfielder converted to left back and now central
back, has been a teammate of Fraser's since the inaugural season,
but the two had never occupied the same central space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin and I have good communication,'' said Vanney. ``We
understand each other and know our roles, so it's worked out all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has matched its MLS-record scoring pace in 1998,
scoring a league-high 12 goals, but Los Angeles also has given up
six goals in five games, a reason the team is 3-0-2 instead of 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those goals against the Galaxy came in Graziani fashion,
either on a broken play or a set play, which Vanney said he and
Fraser recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't given away that many good goals; most of them are
from bad clearances,'' said Vanney. ``There has also been too many
balls bouncing around the box that we're a second late getting to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we eliminate those kinds of silly goals, we'll be tough
to score against because our offense is doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid thinks Miami coach Ivo Wortman may
change his lineup with the Fusion struggling for goals. Miami has
been shut out three straight games and has gone without a goal for
315 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an improved team but I'm sure they're frustrated
because they haven't scored goals in a while,'' said Schmid. ``I
wouldn't be surprised if Welton starts, or if they start (Henry)
Gutierrez instead of (Andy) Williams. We have to be prepared for
the Miami team that has been playing or the new one that might show
up.'' &QL;

MOSCOW HINTS AT PEACE TALKS WITH CHECHEN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Changes ``this month topped'' to ``has topped'' in graf that

said: `If ...'' Expands graf that follows this graf. Inserts new
graf to follow the expanded graf.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a sign that Russia is looking for a political
solution to its war in Chechnya, President-elect Vladimir Putin
acknowledged Friday for the first time that Moscow had exchanged
peace plans with the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking to reporters, said he still regards Maskhadov as
a ``criminal'' but one who could be pardoned. And he indicated that
his government is ready to talk with a man who seven months ago, at
the start of the second Chechen war, it considered politically
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A glimmer of a political opening also came from the other side
Friday, as Maskhadov, in an interview published in the newspaper
Kommersant, said he had ordered Chechen guerrillas ``to suspend
combat operations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was part of the plan on a peaceful settlement I suggested
to Moscow,'' said Maskhadov, who said he maintains full control
over Chechnya's field commanders _ the rival war lords who are the
real rulers of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which had initially been very popular with the Russian
public and gave Putin his first political boost, has begun to prove
costly to the Kremlin financially, diplomatically and also
politically, as the number of Russian casualties has topped 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, 20 Russian regional leaders spoke out in favor
of talks with Maskhadov, whom they referred to as the ``legitimate
president of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1997 after Russia's first devastating war in
Chechnya, Maskhadov was a moderate secessionist who continued to
negotiate with Moscow over the terms of future independence. But
his control over the region, never very firm, slipped as warlords,
criminal gangs and Muslim militants took charge, turning Chechnya
into a virtual no-man's land avoided by Russians and foreigners,
journalists and aid workers who feared being robbed and kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, with Putin already leading the war effort, Moscow
effectively cut its last links to Maskhadov when he refused to
condemn Shamil Basayev and Khattab, two guerrilla leaders who
brandish a radical form of Islam, for raids last August into the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview published Friday, Maskhadov said he had
criticized the actions in Dagestan as ``a provocation against the
Chechen people.'' He also said he had ordered the release of all
hostages held by kidnappers on Chechen territory, which has long
been one of Moscow's conditions for the opening of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin said: ``If Maskhadov wants to carry out the negotiations
but cannot extradite the bandits, we are ready to help him. Let him
enter into negotiations and catch bandits along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been hints in the past that Moscow has secretly
stayed in contact with Maskhadov through Ruslan Aushev, the
president of Ingushetia, who has acted as an intermediary. But
Putin has never spoken directly about such contacts until Friday,
when he said: ``Aushev brought written proposals from Maskhadov. We
corrected them and returned them to him. But until now, there has
been no answer from Maskhadov.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin stressed that Russia has other options. ``We have every
reason to believe that we do have others we can deal with apart
from Maskhadov and the bandits, who are actually behind his back,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their respective comments, Putin and Maskhadov revealed the
gulf that still separates them, with Putin contemptuously
dismissing the Chechen leader as a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decides nothing and will never decide anything,'' Putin
said. ``He is being used to carry out tactical tasks, but those who
are using him will soon realize that he cannot do this, and their
attitude toward him will change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maskhadov complained that his overtures to Moscow had gone
unanswered. But Putin said Maskhadov had let the exchange lapse
into silence. Putin stressed that Russia has other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to believe that we do have others we can
deal with apart from Maskhadov and the bandits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov applauded harsh criticisms by the Council of Europe of
Russia's conduct of the war, and called for observers from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to take part in
a peace settlement. Russia has consistently refused offers to
mediate the conflict, although this week it again opened the way
for European observers to travel to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the dialogue between Moscow and Maskhadov
resumes, there seems to be new willingness on both sides to look
ahead to a peace settlement, even as military operations continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities this week began to allow residents back
into Grozny, the Chechen capital, which was reduced to dust and
rubble last winter as Russian troops fought to seize it. Now that
the Russian presidential campaign is over, pressure for military
success has eased even as the prospects for a long, drawn-out
partisan war increase.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the war has also begun to weigh on Russian
diplomacy. With a new president at the helm, the government is now
looking to deal with other issues, from arms control to foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential election was held on the crest of domestic
support for the Chechen campaign,'' the newspaper Izvestia wrote on
Thursday. ``Now is the time to think about the future of relations
with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the intransigence on both sides, it is difficult to
predict how peace talks might begin and where they might lead.
Hard-liners in Moscow object to any negotiations with Maskhadov.
They fear such talks would reproduce the false peace that lasted
between the two Chechen wars and also undercut the Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the army's point of view, talks with Maskhadov would be
seen only negatively _ but very negatively,'' said Vladimir
Grigoryev, the leader of a St. Petersburg veterans group.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Russian-held areas of Chechnya are being run
both by the Russian military and by Nikolai Koshman, a deputy prime
minister who is Moscow's chief administrator in the region. With
fighting continuing in scattered districts, not even the division
between Russian military and civilian authority, let alone the role
of Chechen politicians and administrators, has been determined.
</P>
<P>
   As some analysts point out, the main question is about the
future of a region administered by the same forces _ military and
political _ that organized its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not who should hold talks, and the problem is
not about legitimacy,'' said Boris Kagarlitsky, a Russian
historian, in a recent interview published on Vesti.ru, a Russian
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is what the talks should be about _ the subject
and goals of the talks,'' he said. ``Not with whom, but about what
_ that is the question.''

   BLUE CHIPS? OR WOODEN NICKELS?
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the leading technology stocks might be wondering
how to appraise them after the plunge of early April left the
technology sector as skinny as a football lineman on an
all-broccoli diet.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell an ugly tale. Cisco Systems stood at $80 on
March 27. By April 14, it traded at $57. Sun Microsystems slid from
$105 to $76.50 over the same span.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco and Sun have held up well, compared with the Internet
stocks, which have been in a bear market since January. The
bellwether there, Yahoo, was down more that 50 percent, to $114.375
on April 14, from $237.50 on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Those are enormous declines, considering that companies like
Cisco and Yahoo are supposed to be the new-economy leaders, with
solid products, superior management and real sales and profits.
Buying them was supposed to be the safe way to invest in technology
_ at least when compared with the hordes of dot-coms that have
proliferated since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the blue-chip technology companies have held
up a bit better and recovered a bit faster than their more
speculative kin during the Nasdaq's rocky ride this month. But
losing 30 or 40 percent of an investment in two weeks never feels
great, even if someone else's stock is down 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So where do these companies stand? Is the recent sell-off
nothing more than a short-term dip and the latest buying
opportunity? Or is it a warning to investors that there is no such
thing as a technology blue chip, that even the best technology
companies are overpriced and due for a fall?
</P>
<P>
   To answer those questions, Money &AMP; Business reviewed the
prospects of six technology leaders in six key markets with Wall
Street analysts and institutional investors. The common thread to
the experts' views: in a market filled with uncertainty, investors
will have to pay up for the quality they seek.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL: NO LONGER A CYCLICAL?
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest maker of microchips, is a powerhouse
whose lofty earnings, according to Wall Street's consensus
estimate, will rise 23 percent a year, on average, over the next
five years. Yet the ratio of the company's current stock price to
estimated earnings for this year is below 40, a bit under the
average for technology companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. And that multiple is well below those of other leading
information technology suppliers like Sun Microsystems (92.1) or
Cisco ( 126.5).
</P>
<P>
   So is Intel a bargain? The fact that it fell just 8.1 percent
during the technology sell-off suggests that a lot of people think
so. And it certainly deserves to be an anchor holding for any
investor in information technology, according to L. Roy Papp, whose
firm has 12 percent of its $1.25 billion under management invested
in Intel.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, L. Roy Papp &AMP; Associates of Phoenix, invests in what
its researchers determine are the growth stocks with the strongest
outlooks over the next three to five years. His investment case for
Intel, his largest holding, is built on the conviction that it is a
stellar company with outstanding management.
</P>
<P>
   It is also predicated on the belief that the semiconductor
industry that Intel dominates has changed. As the productivity
payoff from information technology has become increasingly
apparent, Papp said, companies have come to regard computing as
both fast-changing and essential. Accordingly, their spending
patterns will hold steady, because they have recognized that
technology is a continuing cost of doing business. Intel should be
a prime beneficiary of that trend. ``This is no longer the cyclical
swing business that everybody has always said it was,'' he said.
That line of reasoning would explain why Intel easily warrants its
current P/E multiple of 38.1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company faces daunting challenges as computing's center
of gravity moves beyond the PC industry _ Intel's stronghold _ and
toward the Internet. If the highest growth comes from Internet
appliances like hand-held computers and ``smart'' cell phones,
Intel could be hurt. It has a promising entry for that niche, the
StrongArm chip, but it has a host of competitors including
start-ups like Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is moving forcefully to make chips for powerful server
computers that are the hubs of computer networks. Its
microprocessors for servers are very profitable, selling for $1,000
to $3,000 apiece, compared with as little as $65 for the Celeron
chips that power low-cost PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say server chips account for only a tiny
percentage of Intel's chip volume and could not soon offset real
slippage in its basic PC business. ``Potentially, these are huge
problems for Intel,'' said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of
Microprocessor Report, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And a revived Advanced Micro Devices is giving Intel competition
for the high-performance, high-profit chips that run more costly
PC's.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Intel is coping pretty well with its challenges. Its
share of the PC processor market is 82 percent, up from 76 percent
at the end of 1998, when it was slow to respond as rivals began
making low-cost PC chips, according to Mercury Research in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet challenge, Intel appears to be moving
quickly to adjust. Once before it made a tough but successful
transition in its business _ when it abandoned memory chips in the
mid-1980s and bet its future on microprocessors. ``Intel is a
company that reinvents itself,'' said Dean McCarron, a Mercury
Research principal.

   YAHOO: AN EARNINGS ENGINE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Yahoo may have fallen from a high of 240 on Dec. 31 to
barely half that level last week, but the company's fans are as
confident as ever in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that even at its current levels, Yahoo, the leading
Internet portal, has a market valuation of more than $70 billion
and a price-to-earnings ratio of 279.2. Never mind that even if
Yahoo's earnings rise 50 percent a year for the next five years and
its stock stays flat, Yahoo will still have a P/E ratio of near 40
in 2005. Yahoo may be expensive, but investors get what they pay
for, analysts and money managers say.
</P>
<P>
   That Tiffany-style reasoning may infuriate value investors. But
anyone who is even considering buying Yahoo is no value investor.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the bulls' case:
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most dot-coms are losing money, Yahoo makes a lot
of it. In the first quarter this year, Yahoo reported sales of $228
million and net income of $63 million. That is a net after-tax
profit margin of 28 percent, far higher than that of most
old-economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   The high margins are no accident, according to Lise Buyer, an
Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Like America
Online, Yahoo is benefiting from scale,'' Buyer said. Once the
company's servers are running and its technical support staff is in
place, the cost of each additional Web page it delivers to a viewer
is close to zero. But it is likely to earn additional advertising
revenue on each of those pages. That spells high margins once the
company passes its break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's huge audience, meanwhile, makes it more desirable to
advertisers and content providers, analysts say. That enables it to
offer better content to visitors, who are then more likely to
return, a virtuous circle that reinforces the company's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really fail to understand the strength of their
business model,'' said Minyoung Sohn, research analyst at Janus
Capital, which owned more than 5.5 million Yahoo shares at the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Janus sold Yahoo shares last year as the company's price rose
steadily, but Sohn said Janus was again buying. Yahoo should easily
surpass Wall Street earnings estimates of 54 cents a share next
year and 70 cents in 2002, because overall spending on Internet
advertising is likely to soar, Sohn said. He noted that the
Internet now accounts for 10 to 15 percent of media use, but only
about 2 percent of advertising spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``dollars will follow eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's international revenues are also likely to soar over the
next several years, said Susan Walker White, an Internet analyst at
J.P. Morgan. She noted that 40 percent of the company's users were
already outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is one of the blue-chip Internet companies,'' White
said. ``It's one of the stocks that investors need to own.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the company's sky-high P/E ratio and market
capitalization, White is not worried. ``It's hard to use
traditional valuation metrics to measure these stocks,'' she said.

<P>
   CISCO: NEW KING OF THE HILL
</P>
<P>
   No event better underscored the changing of the guard in the
Internet economy than when the market capitalization of Cisco
Systems surpassed that of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly peaking at a half-trillion dollars before slipping over
the last month, Cisco has been the exemplary Silicon Valley growth
machine of the last five years: Its annual earnings growth over
that period has averaged almost 43 percent; revenue growth has been
above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Microsoft marked the shift from centralized
computers to the desktop PC. Cisco's dominance is evidence of the
new hegemony of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For many industry executives in Silicon Valley, Cisco's
ascendancy underscores two growing beliefs: that Microsoft has
peaked, and that the financial success stories of the Internet age
will be driven by the world's insatiable appetite for additional
communications capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is the leading manufacturer of the Internet's plumbing _
powerful computers that route and switch the data packets among Web
servers and Internet surfers. As such, it stands to be the largest
beneficiary of the growing push toward multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Under John Chambers, its chief executive, the company has
pursued a strategy of growth by acquisition that has been so
successful that in the valley the company is known as the Borg _
after the ``Star Trek'' character that incorporated its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth-by-acquisition model has allowed Chambers to scan the
horizon for the next important Internet niche and then to buy the
companies whose technologies will ensure that Cisco maintains a No.
1 or No. 2 position in markets where it chooses to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue in the future is how many balls can John
Chambers juggle?'' said David Bunnell, author of ``Making the Cisco
Connection: The Story Behind the Real Internet Superpower'' (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons, 2000). Of course, growth also depends on the stock
market's continued enthusiasm for Cisco, he noted; the company now
uses its explosive stock value to provide ``Cisco dollars'' to fuel
its acquisitions, of which there have been dozens.
</P>
<P>
   But with a P/E of well over 100, it is fair to question the
inflated value of that currency. ``The valuation is extreme,'' said
Andrew S. Cupps, portfolio manager of the $850 million Strong
Enterprise fund, who adds that Cisco's current multiple assumes
that it will be able to maintain its dominance of networking and
continue to execute its strategy flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order. ``I don't think they are going to just
roll over into the next paradigm,'' Cupps said. Indeed, while the
growth of Cisco's router and switch business seems assured, the
company has begun zeroing in on markets that are certain to lead to
titanic industry battles: Internet telephony and Internet
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers has said that he is anxious to remove the traditional
analog telephone from his desk and replace it with one that routes
voice conversations over the Internet. That will ensure that Cisco
collides head-on with two of the companies that are already its
biggest competitors, Lucent Technologies and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that battle may pale in light of Cisco's growing
interest in the market for Internet appliances _ consumer devices
designed to permit Internet surfing from the kitchen or the den.
Thought to be the next great area of Internet growth, the struggle
over the appliance market will inevitably set Cisco on a collision
course with Microsoft.

   AMAZON.COM: E-TAILERS ON SALE
</P>
<P>
   No new-economy sector has taken a worse smack on the chin than
Internet retailers. Stock prices of merchants like eToys and
Bluefly started plunging well in advance of the Nasdaq downswing.
As a group, the stocks remained depressed well after technology
stocks started to rebound last week. Are such shares
bargain-basement buys or damaged goods?
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com remains the 800-pound gorilla of Internet retailers,
with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. And in many
ways, Amazon exhibits the attractions _ and vulnerabilities _ of
the group. Sell-side analysts remain as bullish on the company as
they were a year ago, even though the stock has fallen 50 percent,
to $52.375, from a 52-week high of $113 on Dec. 9. Of the 28
analysts who follow the stock, 11 rate it a strong buy and 10 rate
it a buy, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks
company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why they have faith: Customer demand for online shopping
is more robust than ever. In a study released last week, Shop.org
and the Boston Consulting Group predicted that online sales would
soar 85 percent in 2000, to more than $61 billion. And as a market
leader, Amazon stands a better chance of reaping the benefits;
indeed, its sales continue to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbling stock prices could play to Amazon's favor, if weeding
out the competition leaves more spoils for the top players.
``Tightening of capital markets is good news for all the folks
trying to build lasting companies, as opposed to the subset that
are trying to build flash-in-the-pan stocks,'' said Jeffrey Bezos,
Amazon's endlessly optimistic chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But this last-man-standing theory ignores that Amazon, like many
of its virtual competitors, relies on complex marketing
arrangements with other dot-com companies to produce revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has deals in which it takes stakes in companies that it
finds promising _ Living.com and Audible.com, for example; those
companies agree to pay Amazon substantial annual sums for the
patronage. Amazon is counting on these deals to bring in a revenue
stream of nearly $100 million a year over the next five years _
something that is not likely to happen if the overall market for
dot-coms collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of cost controls. As every quarter
passes, Amazon's losses deepen. Bezos is promising that this will
change as of the fourth quarter this year. ``We are looking to
drive our loss as a percentage of sales to single digits by the end
of this year,'' he said. That means losses won't end, but will
finally start to grow less rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but investors have heard that before. As of last week,
First Call predicted a loss of $1.22 a share for 2000, and a loss
of 58 cents a share for 2001. It was just a year ago that the
guidance Amazon gave analysts led them to forecast losses for 2000
of 14 cents a share.

</P>
<P>
   The Inktomi Corp. crossed an all-too rare milestone last week:
for the first time, it reported a net profit. And for the eighth
consecutive quarter, the company had revenue growth of over 200
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you are new to Inktomi's story, you are not alone. Founded in
1996, Inktomi makes products that are largely invisible _ much like
the Intel microprocessor inside a personal computer or the Cisco
Systems router shuttling bits on the computer network. That is
because Inktomi specializes in Internet infrastructure. Its first
``product'' was actually a service, a Web search engine for Yahoo,
Hotbot, Lycos and other big portals. The company also sells Web
shopping and directory services.
</P>
<P>
   But the big revenue driver has turned out to be a software
product, Traffic Server, which Inktomi sells the old-fashioned way,
in a shrink-wrapped box. Traffic Server, which runs on Unix or NT
servers, is an Internet cache that functions like the bit of cache
memory on a microprocessor to speed delivery of Web pages. Used by
big Internet service providers like America Online and
Excite(at)Home, Traffic Server monitors network traffic and stores
information nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dravis, an analyst at BancAmerica Securities, rates Inktomi
a ``strong buy'' and a core holding among Internet software stocks.
``They are very uniquely positioned, one to have their business
model driven by people doing searches and shopping on the Web, and
second by the focus on content distribution because they have a set
of technologies to sell to network providers to enhance
performance,'' he said. ``In a world where everybody is trying to
pick between the haves and the have-nots, they're definitely among
the haves.''
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi has been surprising in its ability to deliver on that
assessment. For the quarter ended March 31, Inktomi reported
earnings of $1 million, or a penny a share; analysts had expected a
loss of 2 cents a share, according to First Call. Revenue rose to
$47.3 million, compared with $15.2 million in the period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With growth like that, it is no surprise that some investors
think that Inktomi is a buy, especially given the fact that at
$129.125, it is trading at just over half its value of a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Inktomi faces ample competition, from established
companies like Cisco Systems, which offers a line of cache servers,
and Novell, which sells caching software to server manufacturers.
It also is up against newcomers like CacheFlow, which sells caching
appliances _ simple servers preloaded with a proprietary operating
system and caching software. Oracle has talked about giving away
caching with future releases of its database. And Akamai
Technologies, the other big name in speeding up the Internet,
offers caching as part of its suite of content delivery services on
a pay-as-you-go basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Inktomi executives say the company was never just about
caching, and they point out that by publishing the application
programming interfaces to Traffic Server, they are in fact
establishing a new platform. That means that independent software
developers could write programs that run on Traffic Server much as
they write programs to run on Microsoft's Windows or Oracle's
database.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only group that has third-party developers for
Internet infrastructure software; that's by design,'' said Eric
Brewer, Inktomi's chief scientist and a co-founder. ``If you're
just doing caching, you don't need any of this. But our view has
always been that we're rebuilding the Internet.''

<P>
   SUN MICROSYSTEMS: SUN, IN BLAZING COLOR
</P>
<P>
   Ask Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, about Sun
Microsystems and he sees red.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Ballmer views Scott McNealy, Sun's
co-founder and chief executive, as a ringleader of a Silicon Valley
cabal that persuaded the Justice Department to pursue its antitrust
investigation of Microsoft. Sun has also been in Microsoft's cross
hairs ever since Microsoft began trying to move up the computer
industry food chain in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last quarter, the one in which Microsoft began to ship its
long-overdue ``Sun Killer'' Windows 2000 operating system, Sun's
revenue grew by a striking 35 percent, to $4 billion, and earnings
rose 49 percent, to $436.2 billion. That means that Sun's revenue
growth is almost certain to accelerate this year above the 25
percent it averaged in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The financial numbers are all the more remarkable because of the
threats that Sun faces from all sides. It is apparently managing _
at least for now _ to disprove what its archrival Microsoft would
like to establish as industry wisdom: that Microsoft's Windows
2000, offered in conjunction with low-cost hardware based on Intel
microprocessors _ would be Sun's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's success in recent years is an exceptional gauge of the
growth and impact of the Internet. These days, the computer maker
is usually the first company that a new commercial Web site comes
to when it wants to create an Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rivalry in the service space is intense. Indeed,
Microsoft ranks second among the Internet software threats faced by
Sun. The free Linux operating system and its Apache Web server is
actually the leading Internet server software.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy has also been the primary target of both Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. of IBM and Carly S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard. Both
chief executives have scrambled in recent years to catch up with
something that Sun understood first: that the market for powerful
and reliable server computers is the backbone of e-commerce growth.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of them appears to be gaining ground, at least not
yet. Analysts said Sun's numbers indicated that it was actually
gaining market share against its rivals in the hot market for
dot-com e-commerce servers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sun's 239.2 percent rise leading up to the Nasdaq peak,
its shares retreated only 18.8 percent from March 10 through April
14, far less than Nasdaq's decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun's decline was exceptionally moderate and underscores the
company's strength,'' said Roger McNamee, a fund manager at
Integral Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ``If you are in a period
like we are in today _ when you don't know where we are in the
cycle and there is a flight to safety _ then Sun is a huge
beneficiary of that.'' Sun shares closed on Thursday at $87.75.
</P>
<P>
   While some investors are taking a ``show me'' attitude toward
Sun as they wait to see what inroads Windows 2000 will make in its
server business, McNamee minimizes that threat: ``I think the
market is expanding faster than Microsoft can serve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McNealy has no shortage of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives expect the portable and mobile
Internet appliance world to be the dominant growth area of the
future. It may be the most significant part of Sun's business to
watch _ and the measure of whether McNealy will continue to keep
Ballmer huffing and puffing.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ An ambitious Silicon Valley effort to create
computer industry breakthroughs ended in failure Friday when the
Web site of the Interval Research Corp. was replaced with a stark
press release stating that its co-founder, Paul G. Allen, had
closed the advanced computer laboratory after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory told 30 of its 50 remaining employees that they
would be offered jobs at a smaller for-profit advanced broadband
development group that would be established by Vulcan Ventures,
Allen's investment group.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who also founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, created
Interval in 1992 in partnership with David E. Liddle, a computer
scientist. They made a 10-year, $100 million investment in an
effort to pursue new ideas that might bear fruit as much as a
decade in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the effort was intended to symbolize the
researchers' efforts to design technologies that would have an
impact in five to 10 years and would shape the computer industry
for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look down the road, what you see is the pervasiveness
of high-bandwidth data communications and completely inexpensive
computing power,'' Allen said at the time. ``If you combine those
two things, there are many interesting things that you can do.`''
</P>
<P>
   High-bandwidth communication is the ability to send computer
data, voice and video at very high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea was to mimic the Xerox Corp.'s legendary Palo
Alto Research Center, which during the 1970s had been the source of
many innovative ideas in the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Interval Research laboratory, which at one point had swelled
to employ as many as 150, was formed with the intent to spin off
business enterprises. To date, the spin-off model has largely
failed, with no startling successes having come from the years of
research.
</P>
<P>
   When Allen decided last year to narrow the focus of the research
laboratory to support his cable and broadband commercial
investments, Liddle chose to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Vulcan Ventures said Friday that Interval had made
significant, if not commercial, contributions to Allen's strategy,
but that it was a challenge to do basic research in the overheated
Internet commerce era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interval over the last eight years has contributed to Paul's
vision,'' said William Savoy, president of Vulcan Ventures, who
added that the pace of change in technology had accelerated so much
that long-range research projects did not fit well into the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The company is spinning off at least three high technology
start-ups. One company, Fantasma, is aimed at the market for
ultra-wide-band radio, an unproven communications technology that
will require approval from the Federal Communications Commission.
Although it uses low power, the technology covers much of the radio
frequency spectrum with rapid pulses of radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   Two other companies yet to be spun out will include one
concentrating on integrated circuit design and another focusing on
digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Interval researchers have been expecting the
research effort to be closed, several said Friday the announcement
came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain undercurrent of shock,'' said an Interval
researcher who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
``I'd say we got about halfway toward our original goals. But when
it became obvious that the spin-off process did not work, it was
increasingly difficult.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interval's inability to demonstrate technology breakthroughs
publicly has been an issue that has plagued the research center in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers believe that Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center
existed during an era that had been impossible to recreate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage we had at PARC was that I knew a relatively
small set of people who had pioneered the development of
interactive computing,'' said Robert Taylor, one of the founding
managers of the Xerox center and one of the creators of the
ARPAnet, the Pentagon-financed computer network that became the
Internet. ``Other research labs were not pursuing the same kind of
work, and that gave us a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Interval Research was known in Silicon Valley for its obsession
with secrecy, and analysts said that also worked against the
research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were done in by secrecy, which isolated them,'' said Paul
Saffo, an industry consultant at the Institute for the Future.
``But this is great news for the Valley; a lot of big brains are
now on the loose.''

   ITALY: MINISTER IS ASKED TO FORM CABINET
</P>
<P>
   President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi asked Treasury Minister Giuliano
Amato to try to form a government, following the resignation of
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema. Amato, a socialist who was briefly
prime minister in 1992, said he would present a cabinet soon after
Easter. Parliament, where the center-left has a thin majority, will
then hold a vote of confidence. The center-right opposition,
emboldened by its success in regional elections, wants to block
Amato and force early elections.

   ITALY: PAVAROTTI FACES TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bologna have asked an investigating magistrate to
rule that Luciano Pavarotti be tried on tax fraud charges for
claiming that his primary residence is in Monte Carlo. The
prosecutors, who say the opera star's residence is in Modena,
accuse him of owing the government nearly $5 million. Last week
Pavarotti lost an appeal against an order that he pay another $5
million in back taxes.

   Yugoslavia has become the 134th nation _ and the last in Europe
_ to agree to adhere to the convention banning chemical weapons,
the group monitoring the treaty said. This requires Yugoslavia to
renounce production, stockpiling or use of chemical weapons and

EDITORIAL: NEXT PHASE OF THE CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 22:
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau announced with relief this week that 65
percent of households had already mailed in their census forms,
about the same as in 1990. That may not seem like a grand
achievement. But the response rate has been dropping steadily for
decades, and the bureau was predicting a further decline this year.
Now it moves to the more difficult and expensive task of
door-to-door canvassing of families that did not respond by mail.
This phase will be especially critical for New York City, whose
mail response rate fell to 52 percent this year from 53 percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy is important because census counts serve as the basis
for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and state
legislatures as well as distributing about $200 billion for
education, health and other federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   This year's response rate may have been dampened when some
Republican leaders complained that the long form _ sent to one in
six households _ contained intrusive questions about the number of
bathrooms and residents' mental condition, and asserted that it
need not be completed in full. Indeed, the response rate for
families receiving the long form has fallen six percentage points
below the 1990 level. That is unfortunate, because the long form
seeks information pertinent for everything from enforcing civil
rights legislation to designing the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau must now persuade households that have not
returned their forms to open their doors when census takers knock.
The workers never ask to enter anyone's home, but they need an
opportunity to pose their questions. To address the problem, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said Friday that New York City would buy photo
identification cards for census takers, so residents need not fear
the arrival of strangers at their door.

IT'S TIME TO CHASE THE MOMENT IN THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vince Carter arrives at Madison Square Garden Sunday,
carrying a nation and a television network. Tim Duncan trudges into
a San Antonio training room, a franchise's hope tied to his injured
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the 67-victory machine powered by Shaquille
O'Neal, who recently made his postseason intentions clear: ``I know
what I want as a player now,'' the Lakers' supernova center said.
``I want the bling-bling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bling-bling? ``Yeah,'' O'Neal said. ``That's the look of a
trophy when it's all nice and shiny, sitting in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's title aspirations aside, almost as many of the league's
stars are hovering above the rim as are hurting Saturday and Sunday
when the National Basketball Association postseason begins with
eight first-round games.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has torn cartilage in his left knee. His availability for
the Spurs' series against Phoenix, who lost Jason Kidd to injury
last month, is as uncertain as San Antonio's chances of defending
its title.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-Detroit series may also be affected by health
concerns. The Heat's Tim Hardaway has a foot injury that may keep
him from playing in the first round, and the Pistons' Grant Hill
has a bone bruise in his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs begin Saturday at 12:30 p.m. with Game 1 of the
Detroit-Miami series at American Airlines Arena in Miami.
Phoenix-San Antonio, Seattle-Utah and Philadelphia-Charlotte will
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The other four series _ Toronto vs. the Knicks,
Minnesota-Portland, Sacramento vs. the Lakers and Indiana-Milwaukee
_ begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A long and drawn-out first-round schedule, created to
accommodate the league's broadcast partners, has also caused a
commotion. In a move designed to improve the league's
cable-television ratings, the first-round matchups are spread over
two weeks. Rather than having the usual four games per night, TNT
and TBS _ the Turner networks _ will not compete against each other
for viewers on weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme examples of time off between games include a
Sunday-Wednesday-Sunday format for the first three games of the
Knicks-Raptors series. The Lakers and Kings have four days off
between Games 1 and 2 of their series.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing opening series features Carter making his
playoff debut in New York on Easter Sunday, leading the Raptors in
Game 1 against the Knicks _ a team he singed for 33 points and a
few breathtaking dunks per game during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Kobe Bryant face off against Jason Williams and Chris
Webber in a Western Conference shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, we felt we matched up well with them,'' said
Webber, whose Kings lost their three games to the Lakers by a
combined 11 points. ``Now we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley will coach his 243rd playoff game Saturday, 74 more
games than Red Auerbach coached and 90 more than Lakers Coach Phil
Jackson. But two first-round exits against the Knicks the past two
seasons has jangled his reputation as the game's premier motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fashionable notion about the Miami Heat,'' Riley said.
``Everybody in the league talks about it. All the teams in the
Eastern Conference want to play us. We'll be there, and we'll be
there with very strong character.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill wants to propel the Pistons out of the first round, a feat
Detroit has not accomplished since it drafted the All-Star forward
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hungry,'' Riley said, ``but no hungrier than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   With plummeting television ratings and a general perception that
the league's popularity is still suffering the aftereffects of
Michael Jordan's retirement two seasons ago and a labor fight that
shut down part of last season, the NBA is banking on the flair and
flash of its young stars to boost interest in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But it may have to wait for at least another season. Like Kevin
Garnett's Timberwolves, Webber's Kings and Allen Iverson's 76ers,
Carter's Raptors are underdogs to advance to the conference
semifinals. Small-market graybeards like Karl Malone in Utah and
Reggie Miller in Indiana may still be around much longer than their
younger counterparts, unless a few first-round upsets occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when people start watching and they start following
some of these great stars,'' said Doug Collins, the former coach
and NBC analyst. ``If we can get some of these guys with some great
rivalries, that's when stars are really born. You go back and look
at Michael Jordan and Isiah Thomas and Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson. That's when they really made their mark.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the off-day hyperbole between first-round games, it
may come down to O'Neal and Bryant carrying a heavy load in June.
They may not only be playing for the Lakers' first post-Magic title
but also for a league in need of genuine star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we win it, you guys are going to give me a week to
celebrate and then you're going to say, `Magic won back to back,
can you?''' O'Neal said, smiling. ``And after we win two in a row,
they'll say `When Pat Riley was there, they were talking about a
three-peat. Can you do it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK. First, we have to get one.''

EDITORIAL: THE EARTH DAY CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 22,
Earth Day:
</P>
<P>
   On the 30th anniversary of the first Earth Day, there is much to
celebrate and much to remind us of the unfinished business of
protecting the planet.
</P>
<P>
   While the job of cleaning the water, air and land continues, the
world must begin tackling the less visible threat of global
warming, an issue largely unknown 30 years ago. This new threat is
less immediate and less easily solved, and therefore will require
an even stronger commitment in the years ahead. This is essentially
the message of the organizers of Earth Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, some American rivers were so polluted with chemicals
that they were fire hazards. Big cities were choked in smog, toxic
wastes leached freely into the land, and bird and fish species were
disappearing. In a generation's time, with the creation of the
National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean
Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Environmental
Protection Agency, a great deal has been achieved to reverse
decades of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   This shift was propelled by citizen activists and a handful of
political leaders who first gave voice to a broadening ethic that
made protecting the environment a political as well as moral
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   The same public passion and political will must now be summoned
to confront the global greenhouse effect. Congress has given little
attention to this issue. For that reason, the Earth Day organizers
have done a public service by making global warming a focus of this
year's program.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike polluted air and contaminated water, global warming is
not a local problem that can be seen or felt. But its impact on
every region on earth could be devastating. Most scientists agree
that the earth's climate is warming, due at least partly to the
accumulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that trap
the sun's energy. Although the effect may be gradual, the
consequences could be catastrophic, with increased floods and
droughts, rising sea levels and destruction of ecosystems caused by
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 more than 150 nations, including the United States,
signed the Kyoto Protocol to limit the amount of greenhouse gases
released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels.
The agreement calls for industrialized nations to cut their
emissions by 2010. But few nations have moved to carry out the
agreement. The United States is the largest greenhouse gas emitter,
but the Senate is opposed to ratification of the Kyoto agreement
and the policies needed to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Curbing these gases requires intensive energy conservation and
the promotion of cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind
power. The political and economic hurdles are substantial, both in
this country and abroad. They can be overcome if the public is
educated about the importance of this issue. The 30-year history of
the Earth Day movement shows that when people are awakened to an
environmental crisis, they will ultimately demand change in the way
we live.

   GORE ADMITS ERROR
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. Vice President Al Gore said Friday that he had
erred when he wrote in his 1992 environmental credo, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' that the internal combustion engine could be eliminated
in 25 years. ``I now see we can do it in less than 25 years while
preserving and creating new jobs,'' he told an audience in Romulus,
Mich., where he was joined by the Teamsters president James P.
Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that his critics had ridiculed that suggestion but,
he added, ``I expected that criticism then and I wear it as a badge
of honor today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa and Gore later lunched together. No word from Gore on
trade, and no word from Hoffa on if or when he would endorse Gore.

   BUSH LEADS IN 2 STATES
</P>
<P>
   Polls in two Midwestern states show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
leading Vice President Al Gore in tight races. In Illinois, Bush
was leading Gore 44 percent to 42 percent, with Pat Buchanan
getting 3 percent, and 11 percent undecided, a Mason-Dixon poll
found. In Ohio, Bush was leading Gore 46 percent to 39 percent,
with 9 percent undecided, in a poll by Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MISMATCH
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is such a devoutly Democratic state that
Republican candidates often tend to be outmatched in fund raising,
but not usually this outmatched. In campaign finance reports filed
this week, Sen/ Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, said he had $3.7
million on hand. His Republican rival, Jack E. Robinson III,
reported having $631. Of course, Robinson has not started raising
money in earnest. A wealthy entrepreneur, he has also said that he
will spend a lot of his own money. Still, Robinson's cash supply
looked even more underwhelming compared with the Libertarian
candidate, who had $30,867 on hand, and the Constitution Party
candidate, who had $9,714.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA CLUB ON ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is running radio advertisements criticizing the
environmental record of Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who is up for
re-election. ``Instead of protecting Washington's water and salmon,
Sen. Slade Gorton has been carrying the water for the mining, oil
and gas and development industries,'' asserts one advertisement on
Seattle radio stations. Though Gorton has a hefty campaign war
chest, state Democratic leaders say he is vulnerable because he is
more conservative than most voters. A Gorton aide dismissed the
Sierra Club commercial as ``a bunch of phony, unsubstantiated
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   EMBATTLED IN CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   The California insurance commissioner, Charles Quackenbush, one
of only two Republicans still holding a statewide office, is
embattled on several fronts these days, facing inquiries into his
handling of cash settlements paid by insurance companies after
disputes about their handling of claims from the Northridge
earthquake in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Miller, a Democrat and a former state secretary of state
who supports campaign finance limits, has also filed a complaint
with the state's Fair Political Practices Commission that accuses
Quackenbush of receiving campaign contributions from insurers who
failed to disclose that they had issues pending before the
commissioner. Quackenbush has denied any impropriety.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first incision for Clipper Autopsy 2000 was
based on seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Eric Piatkowski, who now has worn the colors for six
seasons in a row, wielded the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a terrible year,'' said Piatkowski of the 15-67
nightmare, qualifying as the second-worst season for what Sports
Illustrated so shrewdly declared the worst franchise sports in
history. ``What's disturbing is that there's so much talent here. I
don't know if anybody realizes how much we underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no excavation to locate a definitive turning
point; this team could have been pronounced dead at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Clippers gathered for two-a-days at L.A. Southwest
College, the optimism roared. Rookie messiah candidate Lamar Odom
had blindsided his historic accountability gap and was on board ...
on time. Sure, Maurice Taylor had gone from franchise bedrock to
free-agent mercenary _ a role also occupied by newly acquired
sniper Derek Anderson _ but it was hoped the anticipated contract
audition would become motivation to accelerate the team's victory
curve.
</P>
<P>
   The voodoo had been removed from Michael Olowokandi's trick knee
and Brian Skinner had evolved through tireless offseason workouts.
Tyrone Nesby had been re-signed, snatched from the clutches of the
San Antonio Spurs. Rodney Rogers' tummy and Lamond Murray's
shooting percentage were gone. Sherman Douglas, Pooh Richardson and
Darrick Martin were out; Eric Murdock was in.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Ford, who grimaced through a post-lockout catastrophe
of 9-41, was back for round two.
</P>
<P>
   His second Clippers team _ the NBA's youngest _ would play to
its strengths, he said. It would mitigate its inexperience with
speedy, opportunistic offense and relentless pressing defense, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a month of rehearsals, the finer points of such tactics
were rarely, if ever, taught. There was no workshop on defending
the pick-and-roll. No lab for refining outlet passes and defining
fast-break lanes.
</P>
<P>
   And no apparent worries when the exhibition season yielded 5
victories in 8 games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 30 points in his debut, Odom was unable to muster a
victory in the Staples Center launch vs. the Seattle SuperSonics,
refugees from the previous NBA draft lottery. Odom didn't match or
eclipse that number until producing 33 points in Wednesday's closer
at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The first month ended with four wins in 14 games; month two
produced five in 15. Then things turned chilly. Ford, whose style
seemed better-suited to self-policing veterans, realized his team
had turned to another channel.
</P>
<P>
   Downright chummy off the floor, the Clippers were strangers on
it. They didn't share the ball on offense or embrace the notion of
team defense. Taylor took a verbal swing at Olowokandi after an
ugly defeat at Denver, and practices became little more than
slow-motion waltzes.
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, the Clips' vice president of basketball
operations, started attending these workouts, quietly seething over
what her perceived as a lack of attention to detail by Ford, a
coach he wasn't wild about hiring in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   No, credit for that maneuver, and the $8 million in salary-cap
overflow Baylor could have been used to hire a savvy veteran or
two, should be presented to owner Donald T. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing every year,'' Taylor said, ``and it all
goes back to Sterling. There are things that easily could have
nipped in the bud, but never were.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesby, who celebrated last season's hunger to escape the CBA by
showing up at camp 30 pounds heavier, thought he was obliged by his
new contract to shoot more often. He openly groused about his
career being ruined by the very team that provided an opportunity
to create it.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who supplied several portents of future greatness,
retreated into a funk when confronted by what he presumed were
officiating conspiracies and scoreboard truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get in the weight room and I need to work on the
pull-up jumper, the greatest shot in the game,'' Odom said early in
the campaign. Odom seemingly was waiting for the season to end
before beginning any such regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner _ the inside defensive presence _ rolled his left ankle.
Murdock _ the sage floor leader _ did the same. They would miss 49
and 42 games, respectively. Olowokandi may never invalidate critics
of his selection with the first pick in the 1998 draft, but did
provide a few head-scratching moments of sunshine (he scored 17
points and had 20 rebounds against Dikembe Mutombo in Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   However, most of his sophomore season was spent in the same
predicament that muddled his rookie season _ foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor did slightly improve in most statistical categories, but
was far from the $70 million property now offered by his new agent,
David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a variety of things,'' Taylor said. ``That includes my
situation ... that didn't help. But there was chemistry,
uncertainty among players as to who would be here and who wouldn't
next year, a coaching change ...''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, the Suns annihilated the Clippers 114-68 in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was a goner the next day. He was replaced by loyal
assistant Jim Todd, who was given the job on an interim basis.
Todd's first move was to request the hiring of former Celtics great
Dennis Johnson as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar joined the party two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   With Todd going from good cop to bad cop, the Clippers won 4 of
37 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sterling must decide to either trust Baylor's instincts in
the hiring of a full-time coach or make some other bizarre
provision. Since the damning SI cover story, executive vice
president Andy Roeser has gone on record declaring the entire
organization will be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Todd has made a public pitch to be retained, but that seems
wildly farfetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass is always greener unless you've been in this
situation,'' said Todd of those aspiring coaches who think they
would be a franchise salvation. ``But it's not so much Xs and Os.
You (head coach) have to be in a position of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the returning players have endorsed Johnson as their
next head coach, but the expected tidal wave of NBA vacancies also
means additional candidates will be available. Abdul-Jabbar, while
respected and liked by the players, doesn't seem to fit their
unofficial profile. But he could fit Sterling's.
</P>
<P>
   There also will the traditional lottery pick, possibly the
selection No. 1. Throw in the 17th and 30th picks. Don't forget cap
room galore for free agents who probably won't be signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be here when everything is fixed,'' said Johnson,
who doesn't dodge the question when asked about his desire to
become head coach, but has made a point of not overstepping Todd's
authority. ``I know it's going to happen one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all things are repairable.''
</P>
<P>
   But that assumes things were whole in the first place. &QL;

GORE SEEKS TO CLAIM THE CENTER AND SHOW HIS WARMTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., N.C., Ohio, Texas, Tenn., Iowa, N.H.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. _ George W. Bush may be portraying himself as an
unconventional Republican, but Al Gore plans to portray him as
really unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush tries to move to the political center, the vice
president is trying to define him as extreme. It is all part of a
newly emerging strategy for Gore as he moves into what his advisers
call the ``compare and contrast'' phase of the presidential
campaign: compare his proposals with Bush's and then ``contrast''
them.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Gore rips his rival's proposals to shreds and
presents his own as reasonable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Gore has his own careful balancing
act to perform. While hammering Bush on policy matters, he is still
struggling to overcome a problem that has dogged him since early in
the campaign: how to demonstrate that he has a warm and human side,
a passion for the presidency and firm ideals that are not tossed by
political winds.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to warm up his image is guiding much of the Gore
campaign's planning in this stretched-out period until the party
conventions this summer. Indeed, that effort is why he will be
spending full days in schools, staying overnight with families and
visiting them in their workplaces (yes, in earth-tone casual
attire). The idea is to show him to be just an ordinary person who
is both engaged and engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the issues, and the vice president's effort to depict
Bush's positions as extreme, will be by any means ignored. The
other day, addressing gun control, Gore said the governor's signing
legislation allowing Texans to carry firearms into churches
demonstrated how beholden he was to the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at a news conference here in Michigan, the issue was the
environment. Gore said that ``Governor Bush seems to have the smug
assumption that he can get away with calling himself an
environmentalist,'' when Texas is ``the worst-polluted state in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans additional speeches in the next couple of weeks
focusing on other differences with Bush, starting with the
governor's proposal for a big tax cut, what the vice president
calls the ``risky tax scheme.'' That theme will be hammered
relentlessly by the Gore campaign until November.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't noticed it yet,'' said Bob Shrum, a top Gore
adviser, ``but I assure you, they will: that George W. Bush doesn't
have any money to pay for his tax cut or the programs he's
proposing. By giving into the right wing on the tax cut and
proposing a tax giveaway for rich people, he has disabled
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, while it may seem that Bush is the one dominating the
news lately with one fresh proposal after another, Gore aides
express confidence that with major policy positions already laid
out by the vice president, he is now well positioned to counter any
public infatuation with his rival, much as he did in the primary
campaign against former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   One central issue that should benefit the vice president is the
economy. While he has distanced himself from President Clinton in
several areas, he has of course fully embraced the robust
Clinton-era economy. The Clinton economic record has been so
successful that the voters, who once favored Republicans as
stewards of the economy, now say they more trust the Democrats in
that role.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant not affiliated with the
Gore campaign, said this amounted to a sea change that should work
to the vice president's advantage. ``You could never convince
voters that a Republican is more fiscally irresponsible than a
Democrat,'' she said. ``That's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But while crediting Gore for positioning himself to benefit on
issues, Gorlin, like others, said he had still not made voters
comfortable with him as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acts like he's someone who's too scared of losing,'' she
said. ``He thinks the answer lies in a rational process.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a quarter-century in public office and nearly a
year formally on the presidential campaign trail, Gore remains a
remote and distant figure, according to independent polls and his
own advisers. Changing that perception of him, his aides say, is
his most important mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest asset is that he came out of the nominating
process strengthened rather than weakened, and we still have a good
economy and we can say we're better positioned to keep things
going,'' one top adviser said. ``His weakness is his ability to
connect. George Bush is a likable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem is virtually the opposite of Bush's. The governor
is bulking up on policy statements with a Democratic tilt to
compensate for the perception that, though likable, he is a policy
lightweight who veered too far right during the primaries. Gore has
to convince voters of his human side, of his understanding how
ordinary people feel, and also that he has lasting principles that
make him more than a mere political tactician.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest problem is that he needs to find himself,'' said
another Democratic strategist not affiliated with the campaign.
``The biggest thing that voters perceive is that he doesn't have a
North Star.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception has been evident to Gore advisers, and to the
candidate himself, since the fall, when they began a concerted
effort to strip him of the trappings of the vice presidency and
place him in settings where he could appear unscripted and have a
chance to interact with people. The goal, then as now, was to
cultivate a sense of humanity that still eludes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, he doesn't project that warmth, that
strength of his personality,'' said one supporter, Elizabeth
Bagley, former ambassador to Portugal. ``When people see him on a
one-on-one level in a personal, intimate setting, then they realize
he's a warm, caring person. He's become very good at town meetings.
He likes them and gets positive feedback from them. What he started
doing on the campaign, once Bradley became a threat, has really
helped him.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a continuation of the town meetings that Gore held as a
congressman from Tennessee and renewed in the primaries, his
campaign is putting him in settings that scream ordinary American
life: schools, homes and workplaces. The idea is that once people
see him on a human scale, they will perceive him as, well, more
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stalwart vice president in a blue suit standing behind the
podium _ that is still the view that prevails in most states,'' a
Gore insider said. ``We have to put him in settings where that's
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers think those settings show his assets: not just the
breadth and depth of his command of policy but personal assets too,
like a willingness to open himself up to spontaneous situations and
his hunger for the job of president.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially a national retail strategy, in which Gore is
trying to win voters over one by one. ``The lessons of Iowa and New
Hampshire are clear: the more people see him, the more they like
him,'' said Chris Lehane, his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   This means not only campaigning exhaustively but also pushing
the Gore story, and the anti-Bush message, through advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both campaigns will be able to run Iowa- and New
Hampshire-like campaigns, with real advertising budgets,'' a senior
adviser said. ``We will be able to really introduce the candidate
and tell a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to visit a school at least once every two weeks. He
spent two full days in schools last week, one in Ohio, one in North
Carolina, staying with families overnight. The visits generated
positive local news coverage while showing the vice president
involved with real people on education, a topic of major concern to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is also preparing for a more concerted
challenge from Bush than it received from Bradley. One theme that
Bradley arrived at belatedly and expressed only sporadically is one
that Bush has already begun to exploit: that Gore changes his
positions with the political winds and so cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   As if it were a company logo, Bush press releases are stamped
with perhaps the single most damaging sentence that Bradley spoke
to Gore during the primaries: ``Why should we believe that you will
tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' The real question, Bradley said, was one of
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley posed that question during a New Hampshire debate, after
Gore, who early in his career opposed federal financing of
abortion, maintained that he had always been consistent in
supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign clearly perceives credibility to be a matter
on which it is vulnerable and, taking a page from the Clinton
playbook, is trying to turn the issue against Bush. In a virtual
echo of Bradley's question, the vice president recently told a
gathering of newspaper editors: ``How can we believe what he says
he would do nationally when we see what he actually has done as
governor? This is about something more than public policy. It is
about credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   That tack is only a slight detour from the larger message that
the campaign has been delivering: that Gore has the experience to
be president, while Bush would be too much of a risk. It will be
countered by an equally simple message from Austin: that Gore
cannot be trusted, while Bush would restore honor and integrity to
the White House.

   NEW YORK _ Small magazines that publish short fiction come and
go, but Barbara Probst Solomon longs for the glory days of the
``little magazines,'' those literary journals that made a dent on
the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, 70, a writer who teaches about the history of the
little magazines in a course on modernism at Sarah Lawrence
College, hopes to recapture those days with her own new quarterly,
The Reading Room. She is publishing it with a print-on-demand
technology that promises to help make such journals financially
viable again.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of The Reading Room, a 331-page paperback, has
work from well-known writers like Madison Smartt Bell, James Purdy,
Stanley Crouch, Daphne Merkin and Kenneth Koch. Among the new
writers are a few of Solomon's top students in graduate writing
programs at City College and Sarah Lawrence. (She said she felt
dreadful that they had no place to submit their work.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's advisory board includes Saul Bellow, the Nobel
Prize-winning novelist, and the next issue will feature work by
another Nobel Prize winner, Jose Saramago of Portugal, and the
Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon came of age in New York, Paris and Spain, in the 1950s
when small fiction magazines were still flourishing. The little
magazines like New World Writing, New American Review, Discovery
and the original Story created outlets in which budding writers
could gain a reputation before publishing a novel or finding an
audience in a mass-market magazine like The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Even though fine magazines that publish fiction remain, Solomon
said, they do not play the role that certain magazines once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of my generation owe our reputation to the little
magazines,'' said Solomon, an author of six books whose early
writing appeared in New Campus Writing, Partisan Review and
Peninsula, a literary journal in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now young writers, on the whole, are expected with their first
novel to make it big with a kind of mass audience. And if they
don't, they risk not existing. It's like a movie opening. In my
generation, reputations were made more slowly. It's a much harder
trip for writers today.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon wanted to start a literary quarterly in the late 1980s
but gave up because of the cost. ``It would have been like trying
to put on an Off Broadway play that had the budget of a Broadway
musical,'' said Solomon, who is also the New York cultural
correspondent for El Pais, the Spanish newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Literary journals suffer from the same difficulties that make
book production so worrisome. To justify high printing costs at a
standard press, publications must be printed in large quantities.
Then there is the costly risk of overprinting copies that might not
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon believes she has found a way around the problems with a
new digital printing technology that is more commonly viewed as a
way to rescue out-of-print books.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ingram Book Group, a leading book distributor,
made the system available through its subsidiary, Lightning Print.
The process electronically stores the publication in a digital
library for $100 to $150. A copy can be printed within seconds
after a bookseller places an order and shipped within 48 hours. The
process lets publishers print one or two copies _ or hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Solomon has spent less than $5,000 to start The Reading
Room. It is the only major literary magazine to be started with the
print-on-demand technology, said Ed Marino, the president and chief
executive of Lightning Print.
</P>
<P>
   The other night in Park Slope, Brooklyn, an audience of mostly
young people jammed into Barnes &AMP; Noble to hear young and old
writers read from their work in The Reading Room.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy, an elderly man with intense blue eyes, read in a soft,
gentle cadence from his story, ``Easy Street.'' The crowd seemed
mesmerized. No one left, and no one coughed.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon says she hopes that established writers like Purdy can
help push along the reputations of young unknown writers whose work
will make up more than a third of her quarterly, which she
described as eclectic and international. ``It's literary,'' she
said, ``but not so abstruse that no one knows what you're talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Watson, 47, a City College student, said he was grateful
that Solomon published his short story, ``Backward the Drowned Went
Dreaming.'' He had a novel published in France two years ago, but
has had little luck here. He has worked in the kitchen of a
restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to support himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publishing business here is very commercial,'' he said,
``so if you're not known, they are pretty timid about taking on new
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Obaso, 32, a former student in Solomon's creative writing
workshop at City College, has also been frustrated by many
rejection letters. Her story in the magazine _ her first published
work _ is about a woman in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to not only get noticed,'' Obaso said,
``but that people see the work, appreciate the work and understand
what I am trying to say.''

BRONX TO SHED A SYMBOL WITH AN ODOR OF DECAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx has long had its share of image problems,
what with a high crime rate and burned-out neighborhoods. In recent
years, though, Bronx leaders have become optimistic that the
borough may be finally shedding its old reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But for Borough President Fernando Ferrer, one of the last
pieces of the image still needs to be changed: the county's
official flower.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1939, the Bronx's official bloom has been the
Amorphophallus titanum, more often called the corpse flower, or the
devil's tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, native to the rain forests of Sumatra, is one of the
world's largest. It blooms only once every 30 years or so, and when
it does, its odor has been described as eerily similar to that of
rotting flesh.
</P>
<P>
   So, in anticipation of Bronx Week, the third week of May, Ferrer
said he would officially remove the designation of the corpse
flower as the Bronx bloom in favor of the day lily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day lily is infinitely more fragrant, blooms more
frequently and can be seen in the front yards of countless Bronx
homes,'' Ferrer said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The day lily also seemed an apt choice, Ferrer said, because the
pioneering hybridization of the plant was accomplished at the New
York Botanical Garden in the 1920s and '30s by Arlow B. Stout, a
Bronx native.
</P>
<P>
   The choice appears to have wide support among other borough
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to think of the corpse flower as the Bronx flower,
because people would think the Bronx and think, `The Bronx
stinks,''' said Michael Ruggiero, the senior curator for
horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden. ``The Bronx is a
people place, and the corpse flower is not a people plant. The day
lily is, and therefore is a good fit for the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   The corpse flower was designated the borough's official flower
on July 6, 1939, by Borough President James J. Lyons, when one of
the exotic plants bloomed at the botanical garden. Two years
earlier, another corpse plant at the garden produced the first
recorded bloom in the United States, an event attended by
considerable sensation and throngs of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The 1939 event also attracted hundreds of visitors, and
newspaper accounts described Lyons as so taken by the flowering
that he proclaimed it the Bronx's own on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The plant was, to Lyons' mind, an apt representative of the
Bronx as he saw it then. ``Its tremendous size shall be symbolic of
the fastest-growing borough in the City of New York,'' he said of
the giant plant, which grows as much as four inches a day when it
is in bloom. When fully grown, its leaves can reach a diameter of
15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying smell, however, was less admired. News crews
were posted around the clock to record the plant's blooming in the
sweltering confines of the garden's greenhouse, and they were said
to have nearly fainted from the smell.
</P>
<P>
   (The official flowers for the other boroughs are much less
exotic. Brooklyn has the forsythia, Staten Island the pinkster
azalea and Queens the tulip and the rose. Manhattan has not
selected a flower.)
</P>
<P>
   For all the fanfare of 1939, the corpse flower's status as the
Bronx's official bloom could hardly be called common knowledge
today.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with nearly two dozen people on Fordham Road, just a
few blocks from the botanical garden, found not one resident aware
of the plant's status.
</P>

PROSECUTOR QUIZZES CLINTON IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE CASE
</HEADLINE>
  By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Justice Department prosecutor investigating
campaign fund-raising improprieties conducted a wide-ranging
interview with President Clinton on Friday that included questions
about electronic messages that were improperly handled by the White
House. The prosecutor interviewed Vice President Al Gore on
Tuesday, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the prosecutor, Robert J. Conrad Jr., head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance unit, interviewed the two men
in the presence of both White House and private lawyers. Conrad was
joined by a group of FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials refused to describe the focus of the
questions but they said Clinton and Gore agreed to be interviewed
voluntarily and cooperated fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the president nor the vice president are targets,'' a
White House official said. ``There have been no requests for
additional interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance investigation grew out of questions about
illegal fund-raising practices in the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department task force has indicted 24 people,
including several Clinton-Gore donors and organizers of a
fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
Gore attended the event at the temple on April 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One recent area of inquiry involves White House e-mail messages
that were subpoenaed by a variety of investigators but not turned
over. The e-mail messages were not properly stored in White House
computers, a problem that administration officials knew about two
years ago but did not disclose at the time to Congress, the Justice
Department or outside prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was questioned for just under four hours Friday
afternoon in the Treaty Room on the second floor of the White House
residence. The president was represented by his private lawyers,
David E. Kendall and Nicole Seligman, and the White House counsel,
Beth Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's interview lasted four hours and took place in the dining
room of the vice presidential mansion, aides said. Gore was
represented by his private counsel, James Neal, and Elizabeth
Brown, counsel to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard his campaign plane, Gore played down the significance of
the interview to reporters, saying he was not a focus of the
investigation. ``I answered every question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time that the Justice Department's Campaign
Finance Task Force had interviewed Clinton, and it was the fifth
such interview for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore were interviewed separately by the task force
on Nov. 12, 1997, about possibly illegal political fund-raising
telephone calls. On Nov. 10, 1998, Clinton was questioned about
whether he circumvented campaign finance laws to promote his
re-election in 1996 with a barrage of television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was interviewed three additional times as well, on related
matters.

   (NYT34) NEW YORK -- April 21, 2000 -- JOURNALS-REVIVE --
Literary journals suffer from the same difficulties that make book
production so worrisome. In order to justify high printing costs at
a standard press, publications must be printed in large quantities.
Then, there is the costly risk of overprinting copies that might
not sell. Barbara Probst Solomon, 70, believes she has found a way
around the problems with a new digital printing technology that is
more commonly viewed as a way to rescue out-of-print books.
Solomon, a writer and college teacher, surrounded by some of her
students, is publishing a new literary journal entitled ``The
Reading Room.'' (Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times)

a documentary film tells the story of how Marks came to be an
outcast, in part due to the fact that he and his mother, Lippie,
brought unwelcome attention to the Gypsy world by suing the city of
Spokane in federal court for $40 million, claiming their civil
rights had been violated in a 1986 police raid on their house.

INTERNET-STOCK-BUBBLE-4 -- Even in a momentum-driven environment,
some financiers like venture capitalists certainly play their part
in the making of fads. When James Tousignant, left, and Isaak
Karaev founded Multex Systems seven years ago, they wanted to help
brokerage firms send electronic research to institutional clients.
``Then the Internet happened,'' says Karaev, the company's chief
executive. ``And all our investors said, 'This is an Internet
play.' We took the opportunity to change ourselves.'' Now as
Multex.com, ``Our strategy hasn't changed,'' says Karaev. ``The
challenge is which component to highlight.'' (Marty Katz/The New

people were only interested in the story,'' he says. ``They hadn't

even with last week's rebound, helped bring many highfliers back to
earth. Like most of her peers, Candice Carpenter, chief executive

INTERNET-STOCK-BUBBLE-1 -- Before all of the recent market turmoil,
market pundits say Internet stocks were due for a correction.
Anyone who read a prospectus knew that the dizzying sums that
investors were paying for unseasoned companies defied their
fundamental worth. The breezy days of last spring were bound, logic
said, to turn unwelcoming and cold. Still, no expert worth the
title can predict the permanence of the damage caused by the
market's recent shakeout. ``There is a herd mentality around
Internet stocks,'' says Daniel L. Rosensweig, chief executive of
ZDNet. ``Even those who professed to be long-term fundamental
investors turned out to be short-term traders.'' (Fred R.

Senior Republican Senators, including the Majority Leader Trent

this week that they will oppose his effort to amend a landmark arms
control treaty and build a limited national missile defense system.
The senators favor a full robust missile defense system and fear
that Clinton will sacrifice such a system as part of a compromise
to conclude a new strategic arms agreement with Russia before he
leaves office. Lott speaks to reporters during a news conference

<P>
   Our memory of Vietnam, like any other, is shaped in part by what
we allow ourselves to say, and that has changed over the years, as
have my generation and the country that sent many of us to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   When I went there in 1969, and when I returned home a year and
12 days later, Vietnam was a subject my friends and I avoided
talking about. For those who had not gone, there was something
embarrassing about talking to someone who had, after all the
energies they had all expended on damning the war and anyone who
was part of it, and on eluding the draft. And for my part, I had no
interest in defending a war that all the guys in my unit hated just
as much, only in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   We were not grunts, the sweat-soaked kids in jungle fatigues so
familiar now from movies and that bronze sculpture of three
servicemen next to the Vietnam memorial in Washington. Drafted out
of graduate school, I was trained in artillery fire direction
control, assigned to the 23rd Artillery Group in II Field Force,
and, in the enigmatic wisdom of the Army, set to work as a
personnel clerk, first in Long Binh, the huge base not far from
Saigon, then in Phu Loi, on the highway to Cambodia. Many of the
guys in the headquarters were also older, drafted from college and
graduate school, but we counted days like everybody else, wore
peace symbols, pulled guard duty and proclaimed that 'Nam was ``No.
10'' _ bad.
</P>
<P>
   But our 'Nam was not the Vietnam back home: These were entirely
different concepts that shared only the name of a lovely and badly
scarred country in Southeast Asia, whose delicate-looking people,
history and customs very few of us _ ``in country'' or ``in the
world'' _ ever bothered to learn about. Over there we lived in a
world of our own, a sweaty, sometimes dangerous place where we wore
loose jungle fatigues, slept in hootches, wrote long letters home,
longed for R&AMP;R and counted days to DEROS (``date of estimated
return from overseas'') and the Freedom Bird that would take us
home. It was a place with a GI culture and language all its own,
where grunts humped the paddies to waste Charlie or get blown away,
where angry brothers fragged white officers, where Vietnamese
squatting by the roadside sold No. 1 (best) grass in deftly
resealed Marlboro packs and there were always several choppers
slapping through the rancid black plumes from burning latrine cans.
</P>
<P>
   We were young, we bonded, we changed. And we returned home to
the other Vietnam, the domestic battlefield of hard-hats and
peaceniks, the Vietnam that one side proclaimed the front line
against godless communism, and the other a symbol of all the greed
and immorality of a perfidious Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I came back, the protests waned, but we still avoided
talking about the war. Some veterans felt alienated among peers
who, they felt, looked on them with condescension, as sad guys who
had been fooled into fighting an immoral war. Most of us simply
didn't know what to say, both those who had been there or those who
had not, especially after the Americans abandoned Vietnam in that
excruciating display of shame, panic and betrayal. There was the
beginning of a literature, most notably Michael Herr's brilliant
``Dispatches,'' David Rabe's off-Broadway staging of ``The Basic
Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' Ronald Glasser's ``365 Days.'' But they
were glimpses of 'Nam, not a reckoning. That began in earnest only
with the Vietnam memorial in 1982, possibly the most honest shrine
ever raised to the fallen soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of Vietnam and the veterans that developed in the
1980s was far different from any Vietnam, or any grunt, I had
known. Movies like ``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' or
``Platoon'' created a swampy, fiery hell peopled by psychopaths
(``I love the smell of napalm in the morning''). They complemented
emerging images in the media of the ``Vietnam vet'' as a troubled
and neglected victim _ a scraggly and deranged outcast with a
rumpled boony hat, a legless victim converted to pacifism, a
returning POW scarred by unspeakable horrors. There were all these,
to be sure, and others: For some veterans, the emotional conflict
between the abiding loyalties of shared danger and the shame of a
failed and unpopular war coalesced into an impassioned crusade to
account for all missing GIs. For military officers, Vietnam became
a nightmarish memory of body bags, humiliation and division, until
any mission that carried even the remotest hint of ``another
Vietnam'' encountered instinctive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the conflicting and bizarre images, at least we
could talk about it now. Writers like Tim O'Brien (``The Things
They Carried''), Neil Sheehan (``A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul
Vann and America in Vietnam'') and many others began to look more
deeply into the war and the men who made and fought it. We also
began to talk about it among ourselves and with our children, for
whom the '60s and Vietnam already had the pallor of history and
myth. The recriminations could still surface, but as we grew older
we could look on old passions with forbearance, even nostalgia.
With time, the Vietnam vet became a respectable, even slightly
romantic figure, and politicians like Sens. John F. Kerry, Bob
Kerrey and John McCain, who had served in Vietnam, acquired a moral
edge over those, like Bill Clinton, who had not.

<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

RUSSIA SEIZES JAPANESE BOAT IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Changes ``Russian president-elect'' to ``new Russian
president'' in 3rd graf. Adds to end of 4th graf.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Russian coast guard fired on and seized a Japanese
fishing boat Friday in waters near Japan's northernmost main
island, according to Japanese and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The incident threatens to revive tensions between the countries,
which have had disputes about maritime boundaries and possession of
a number of small islands in the area since the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, is scheduled to visit
the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on April 29.
Japan has been pressing Russia to negotiate a formal peace treaty,
which it says should include the return of northern islands seized
by Moscow in the closing days of the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian officials who briefed journalists in
Moscow, the Japanese fishing vessel disobeyed orders from a Russian
patrol boat to stop for inspection in international waters between
the countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intruder was shelled by the Russian border guards when it
attempted to escape from the Russian economic zone into neutral
waters,'' the Russian ITAR-Tass news agency said. None of the 20
crew members was injured, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian authorities said the Japanese ship, the No. 7
Daitoku-Maru, was operating with its name and identification
numbers concealed and had tried to escape after being summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities gave an entirely different account, saying
that the fishing vessel was operating in Japanese waters near what
Japan calls its Northern Territories.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese coast guard sent three aircraft and four patrol
boats to the scene, 60 miles south of the cape of Ochiishi off the
island of Hokkaido. But officials said the Japanese coast guard
withdrew after the fishing vessel was brought, under escort, into
Russian waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that two Russian soldiers are standing on the
bridge of the Japanese ship,'' said a Japanese official quoted by
Reuters. ``If this continues, we will consider the ship seized.'' &QL;

   (NYT34) NEW YORK -- April 21, 2000 -- JOURNALS-REVIVE --
Literary journals suffer from the same difficulties that make book
production so worrisome. In order to justify high printing costs at
a standard press, publications must be printed in large quantities.
Then, there is the costly risk of overprinting copies that might
not sell. Barbara Probst Solomon, 70, believes she has found a way
around the problems with a new digital printing technology that is
more commonly viewed as a way to rescue out-of-print books.
Solomon, a writer and college teacher, surrounded by some of her
students, is publishing a new literary journal entitled ``The
Reading Room.'' (Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times)

brought unwelcome attention to the Gypsy world by suing the city of
Spokane in federal court for $40 million, claiming their civil

INTERNET-STOCK-BUBBLE-4 -- Even in a momentum-driven environment,
some financiers like venture capitalists certainly play their part
in the making of fads. When James Tousignant, left, and Isaak
Karaev founded Multex Systems seven years ago, they wanted to help
brokerage firms send electronic research to institutional clients.
``Then the Internet happened,'' says Karaev, the company's chief
executive. ``And all our investors said, 'This is an Internet
play.' We took the opportunity to change ourselves.'' Now as
Multex.com, ``Our strategy hasn't changed,'' says Karaev. ``The

even with last week's rebound, helped bring many highfliers back to

INTERNET-STOCK-BUBBLE-1 -- Before all of the recent market turmoil,
market pundits say Internet stocks were due for a correction.
Anyone who read a prospectus knew that the dizzying sums that
investors were paying for unseasoned companies defied their
fundamental worth. The breezy days of last spring were bound, logic
said, to turn unwelcoming and cold. Still, no expert worth the
title can predict the permanence of the damage caused by the
market's recent shakeout. ``There is a herd mentality around
Internet stocks,'' says Daniel L. Rosensweig, chief executive of
ZDNet. ``Even those who professed to be long-term fundamental
investors turned out to be short-term traders.'' (Fred R.

Senior Republican Senators, including the Majority Leader Trent

this week that they will oppose his effort to amend a landmark arms
control treaty and build a limited national missile defense system.
The senators favor a full robust missile defense system and fear
that Clinton will sacrifice such a system as part of a compromise
to conclude a new strategic arms agreement with Russia before he
leaves office. Lott speaks to reporters during a news conference

 UNDATED: had not.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In moments of honesty, we began admitting to one another that
our actions all those years ago were not always as noble as we
liked to think they were.
</P>
<P>
   At the 25th reunion of my class at Harvard in 1992, a panel
discussion titled ``The Choices We Made,'' turned into a stunning
exercise in brutal candor, almost confession. Hundreds of us sat
spellbound hour after hour as one classmate after another explored
why he or she had opposed the war, or participated in it. Only
after the custodians threatened to turn off the lights and lock us
in did the meeting break up. One man acknowledged, to my silent
empathy, that he went only because he would never be able to face
his father if he didn't. My family were immigrants, I might have
added, and my father would have taken my dodging the draft as rank
ingratitude. The speaker tried to tell about a friend who was blown
away before his eyes, but could not, leaving us all in a long and
terrible silence. A woman then acknowledged that she became active
against the war also, and only, out of deference to her parents.
Then: ``Actually, they were Communist Party members.'' Then,
quietly, ``So was I.'' Another classmate told of never building a
life after years of protests and jails, and of finally landing work
as a train conductor. When one former member of the Students for a
Democratic Society _ the radical SDS _ launched into an aggressive
recital of old charges, he was universally jeered into silence. We
had tacitly agreed that day that only conscience could judge the
choices we had made.
</P>
<P>
   The old controversies still surface sometimes. But by and large,
the war is fading from the public consciousness. There is no
communist threat any more, and a wholly new Army has been built, in
which only a handful of senior officers served in Vietnam. In the
rare movie that uses Vietnam, like ``Rules of Engagement,'` the war
is little more than a handy cliche. For today's children, I
sometimes think with amazement, Vietnam is almost as remote as
World War I was for us _ only lacking the glow that national memory
reserves for victories.

<P>
   It became the most remembered photograph of the fall of Saigon,
capturing the last chaotic days of the Vietnam War, and most people
believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof
of the U.S. Embassy to board a helicopter. That is what the picture
caption usually says.
</P>
<P>
   But as with much about the Vietnam War, the caption is wrong.
The building is an apartment complex. The people fleeing are
Vietnamese. The last helicopter left about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, the photograph is a metaphor for all the
misunderstanding that plagued the Vietnam War. Americans, whether
conservative or liberal, often imposed their own ideas on that
troubling war, and that seems to be what happened with the picture,
said Hubert Van Es, a United Press International photographer who
took it 25 years ago, on April 29, 1975, from the roof of a hotel
half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the correct caption on it,'' said Van Es, who now lives
in Hong Kong, ``but people back in the United States just took it
for granted that it must be the embassy, because that was where
they believed the evacuation took place.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture was of an apartment building for the employees of
the U.S. Agency for International Development, its top floor
reserved for the CIA's deputy chief of station. The address was 22
Gia Long St., about a half mile from the embassy. Fox Butterfield
lived around the corner as one of the last two correspondents of
The New York Times remaining in Vietnam, and he left later that
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days, as the embassy hastily prepared for the last
stage of evacuation, 22 Gia Long was chosen as one of about a dozen
possible gathering places for Americans. The secret signal for the
start of the evacuation was a radio broadcast saying the
temperature in Saigon was ``105 degrees and rising,'' followed by
the first 30 seconds of ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham A. Martin, had
delayed the final evacuation in the vain hope that President Gerald
Ford and Congress would rescue the collapsing South Vietnamese
army. Martin assumed that the U.S. Air Force could use Ton Son Nhut
air base to lift out the last few thousand Americans. But the
rapidly advancing North Vietnamese army wrecked that idea, shelling
the base on the morning of April 29 and shooting down some South
Vietnamese air force planes trying to take off, their wreckage
littering the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA station chief, Thomas Polgar, had a problem. The night
before, he had telephoned a group of senior South Vietnamese
politicians, generals and police officers who had helped the
agency, telling them to gather at his house with their families for
evacuation. Among them was Tran Van Don, deputy prime minister and
defense minister, and a general who was chief of military
communications intelligence. But by late morning, the area was no
longer secure, recalled Polgar, who is now 78.
</P>
<P>
   Then Polgar had an inspiration. The elevator shaft on the roof
of the apartment building at 22 Gia Long St. might support a
landing in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Polgar brought in a CIA employee, O.B. Harnage, to direct the
Vietnamese officials and their families to Gia Long Street and have
them flown out by Air America, an airline owned by the CIA for its
operations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   When Harnage landed on the roof in a silver Huey helicopter,
some people were panicking. Some junior officers and policemen had
been allowed in on condition that they use their weapons to keep a
crowd milling in the street outside from storming the building.
</P>
<P>
   Stationing himself next to a ladder leading onto the roof,
Harnage tried to help the Vietnamese families up. But the first man
who appeared, Harnage recalled, was a Korean who was hysterical and
Harnage punched him out of the way to maintain order. The Huey, the
workhorse of the American effort in Vietnam, normally carried about
eight passengers, but Harnage jammed in as many as 15 Vietnamese,
and jumped on the helicopter's skid, standing in the open doorway
as it flew to Tan Son Nhut on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harnage, who was later awarded a CIA medal, made four or five of
these flights to the air base, where larger Navy or Air Force
helicopters ferried the families to ships waiting in the South
China Sea. At a time when America abandoned many Vietnamese allies
and South Vietnam's military and political leaders abandoned their
own country, it was a heroic act.
</P>
<P>
   But one mystery remains. Is it indeed Harnage in the photograph?
He believes it is. The picture, which he saw a week later in a
Manila, Philippines, newspaper, shows a man in a white shirt and
dark pants, which Harnage was wearing that day. His wife also saw
the photograph. ``She said she recognized me from my backside,''
said Harnage, who is now 75. He recalled her saying she knew him
``because I was always leaving'' to go somewhere on another
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they were the ones in the picture. Polgar said he's
unsure who it is. ``But if Harnage says he is the man in that
picture, I'll take his word for it,'' he said.

HACKER IS SAID TO LIVE IN A MONTREAL SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS coding)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ILE BIZARD, Quebec _ It is the picture of North American
suburban normalcy: a new four-bedroom house on the edge of a golf
course, an orange basketball left outside in the rain by the
15-year-old son, a soggy cigar butt left outside on a plastic chair
by dad.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Canadian and American police, the
15-year-old basketball player is Mafiaboy, for the moment charged
as North America's latest computer criminal. From this house, the
Canadian police have carted away computers that they say the
ninth-grader used to sabotage CNN.com on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing OK,'' a young man who answered the door said Friday
of his younger brother, the 15-year-old. The older brother cut
short questions, noting that his father and brother were out and
that his girlfriend was visiting Friday, a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent suburban normalcy was also the image painted Friday by
Yan Romanowski, the Montreal lawyer hired to defend the 15-year-old
against two charges of criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is your everyday teen-ager, not the kind of guy who
isolates himself in a basement,'' said the lawyer, adding that he
had known the family for years. He ``attends high school, has many
friends, enjoys sports, wears baggy clothes, Nike sneakers'' and
his cap turned backward, Romanowski continued. ``He has never
committed nor been accused of any criminal offense, nor has he been
involved with police authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, citing classmates and law enforcement
officials, reported Friday that the boy had been suspended
repeatedly from two high schools over the last two years. In
response, Romanowski said: ``I have absolutely no knowledge of the
veracity or falseness of that, or of his grades. I am more
concentrated on preparing the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the cul-de-sac in this upper-middle-class, largely
English-speaking development in Montreal's western suburbs, Denis,
a computer consultant who declined to give his last name, said he
had talked to the boy's father, John Calce, on Wednesday night,
hours after the authorities disclosed the charges. ``He said he
didn't know anything about the computer stuff,'' the neighbor said
of Calce, a heavy-set, 45-year-old bus company executive who
routinely goes out on the front porch to smoke a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN site was hit in a wave of strikes in early February that
blocked or hindered access to some of the biggest Web sites for
hours at a time. In the attacks, remote computing centers were
taken over and used to relay streams of meaningless data at the
target site, overwhelming it with traffic. A spokeswoman for
CNN.com, which is owned by Time Warner, said the site was
``seriously affected'' for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, some computer experts have surmised that more
than one person was involved because of certain differences in
technique, and that copycats may have gotten into the act. If so,
Mafiaboy was not most skilled among them, the authorities said on
Wednesday _ or in any case, not the most careful. ``He was not what
we would call a genius in that field,'' said Inspector Yves Roussel
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence that led to the Montreal boy, authorities
said, were records from a California campus computing center used
as a relay point and online conversations by someone using the
Mafiaboy screen name. But in the end, the police say, it was Calce
who precipitated his son's arrest, and his own.
</P>
<P>
   About two months ago, investigators from the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police questioned Calce's 15-year-old son about the
attacks. Without enough information to make an arrest, they placed
wiretaps on the family's telephones.
</P>
<P>
   In listening to family conversations, the police say, they
overheard Calce conspire with a friend to have a business associate
assaulted. In a raid before dawn last Saturday, police officers
arrested father and son. Calce and his friend were charged with
conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. Both men pleaded not
guilty and were released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Calce, who lives here with his second wife and two sons from his
previous marriage, put his house up for sale last summer, asking
the equivalent of about $320,000, high for a Montreal suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Calce's 15-year-old son, whose name the Canadian authorities
have not used because he is a minor, pleaded not guilty and was
freed on conditions that forbid him from going on the Internet,
from entering a business with computers, or from going into a
computer store. Also, he is not to talk with his three closest
friends, a restriction requested by prosecutors who hope to use
them as witnesses against him. In online chats, Mafiaboy had
bragged of temporarily disabling a host of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say my client is Mafiaboy,'' said Romanowski, the
defense lawyer. ``But according to what I have read, many other
people around the world have bragged about being Mafiaboy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities are considering whether to file any charges
against Calce's son or any others involved in the attacks, Steven
Berry, an FBI spokesman, said Friday from Washington. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, who are handling the investigation, have
said they may bring additional charges against the boy once they
have finished studying the seized computers.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski predicted that a trial would expose the vulnerability
of the Internet, with sabotage ``recipes'' posted for easy
retrieval and ``security experts who don't take the necessary
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-known hackers have offered their support and help,''
he said, adding that his defense work would be bolstered by ``a
team of computer systems specialists and computer security
specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the lawyer said he hoped the interest of news
organizations would fade so that his 15-year-old client could get
back to his weekend basketball and final exams at Riverdale High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that he will be back in school on Tuesday,''
Romanowski said.

 &HT;    Mulholland completes performance
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One game might have been a welcome sight. Two is a
roll for Terry Mulholland. And the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The man who started this five-game winning streak with a
dynamite outing in Milwaukee, brought it full circle Friday night
with the Braves' first complete game of the season in a 6-2 victory
over the Pirates in the first of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland (2-2) allowed eight hits, two walks and struck out
three in his first complete game since June 18, 1997. He has 46
career complete games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did their best to recreate the scene of Mulholland's
Milwaukee turnaround with an assist from Mother Nature. Playing in
chilly conditions, the Braves got him another 2-1 lead and braced
themselves for a close finish.
</P>
<P>
   That only worked for an out before Mulholland gave up a
game-tying homer to Aramis Ramirez, going against what Mulholland
had tried to do for his last two starts and leaving a stray pitch
inside for Ramirez to turn on for his first homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Ramirez's second hit in his past 23 at-bats and
ended a streak of 13 innings without allowing a homer for
Mulholland. He'd allowed six homers in his first two starts, both
losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulholland regrouped, and the Braves backed him up with two
runs in the bottom of the inning on an RBI single by Andres
Galarraga and a Javy Lopez sacrifice fly. Quilvio Veras set the
offensive pace for the night, going 3-for-his-first-3 with a pair
of RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   His only blemish was getting thrown out at home plate for the
third out of the fifth inning on an Andruw Jones double to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates, ragged from their 3:12 a.m. arrival into
Atlanta on Friday, sent recently recalled right-hander Jose Parra
to the mound for his first major-league start since 1996. And by
the end, that was the best thing they had going for them. Parra had
held the Braves to two runs, leaving after five innings with five
hits and seven strikeouts and the game tied at 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves chipped away at the vulnerable Pirates bullpen
for four runs over the sixth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland pitched well outside of two lapses with the pitcher
Parra at the plate. Mulholland walked him twice on nine pitches,
the first of which cost him a run. That's because it came with two
outs, allowed Chad Hermanson to move into scoring position and set
up Jason Kendall for a run-scoring single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has hit in eight consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   That broke a streak of 14 scoreless innings for the Pirates,
going back to the first inning of their extra-inning game against
the Marlins on Thursday night.

ONE WARRIOR TO ANOTHER: KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Baylor sat in the Chicago Cubs' nearly deserted
clubhouse Friday afternoon. The Cubs' game with the Mets had been
postponed because of rain. Baylor had finished his audience with
members of the press, had said his piece about Mets manager Bobby
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was headed with his wife for dinner in Manhattan, where
the most likely topic of conversation would be the Knicks. The
Knicks begin a best-of-5 series against the young and talented
Toronto Raptors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point has been Patrick Ewing. Will this be the year?
Or will this be another spring of futility in his pursuit of an
elusive NB A championship?
</P>
<P>
   I was curious to hear what Baylor thought about Ewing, about
championships pursued and won late in life. They are involved in
different sports and are really part of different generations.
Baylor is 51, Ewing 37. But they share a perspective on the sense
of urgency an athlete assumes as a career ends.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, like Ewing, was known as a gallant warrior in a major
league career that began in Baltimore in 1970 and ended in Oakland
in 1988. Like Ewing, his career had always been linked with the
absence of a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was 38 years old when he finally won a World Series
championship. Ewing will be 38 in August. What thoughts did Baylor
think were going through Ewing's mind on the eve of a playoff
series with a tough, young opponent? ``Patrick's got to be
thinking: `I'm 37. How many more shots will I have?''' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's chase is a lot like Baylor's. Although Baylor played
with five different teams, while Ewing has played for one, each had
heartbreaking near misses. Ewing's disappointments are known: no
playoffs in 1985-86, then a string of first- and second-round
eliminations, a pair of Eastern Conference championship losses, an
NBA championship loss to Houston, and then, in what must be the
most frustrating moment of his career, a defeat to San Antonio in
last year's NBA finals while he sat out with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor leaned back and recalled his litany of frustration. He
broke in with Baltimore at the end of the 1970 season. The Orioles
won the World Series that year. While Baylor wasn't on the roster,
he figured his time was near. Then the run of near misses began.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1973 we won our division, but we ran into the A's,'' he
said. ``In 1974 we got beat by the A's.'' In 1979, Baylor was with
the Angels, who lost to the Orioles in the American League
Championship Series. Three years later, the Angels faced the
Brewers in the ALCS. ``The Angels had to win one game _ we won the
first two and lost the next three to Milwaukee,'' Baylor said. ``To
me, that was the heartbreak to all the others before 1986 with the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '85 Yankees were the best team I ever played on _ player
for player _ and we finished second. Sometimes playing on a good
team isn't enough. It comes down to something else totally out of
your control.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 Baylor went to Boston. In the World Series, the Red Sox
had a three-games-to-two lead on the Mets _ in the very stadium
where Baylor was sitting yesterday. Boston was an out away from
winning the World Series. But the Red Sox wound up losing the game
and the series.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the middle of the 1987 season, Baylor was traded to
Minnesota, a team treading water. Minnesota won the World Series,
and Baylor finally had his ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe those guys who talk about their individual
stats; they'll tell you how they were the most valuable player or
the leading scorer or had the most runs batted in,'' Baylor said.
``But the point is: how many rings do you have? You can have all
the money, and all of the stats, but they don't have a championship
trophy. Rod Carew, before he went into the Hall of Fame, said: `Now
I can say my career is complete. I'm in the Hall of Fame. But I
still don't have a World Series that I participated in.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an MVP sitting at home. I have a Roberto Clemente
trophy at home. I also have the World Series championship sitting
at home. In our business, what you're measured on is
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Who does Baylor like between the veteran Knicks and the young
Raptors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Knicks; I like the toughness of the Knicks,'' he
said. ``You have young guys coming in all the time. But then you
have some of those old warriors like Patrick Ewing that say, `This
is my one shot; I have to rise to the occasion.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor likes Ewing, one warrior to another, who knows what it's
like to chase the dawn. &QL;

EXPERTS GIVE EARTH DAY REPORT CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  An entire generation has grown up since the first Earth Day in
1970 _ an entire generation that has never known civic life without
green activism, without corporate slogans professing
environmentally friendly intentions, without donnybrooks on both
Capitol Hill and the streets over everything from clean air to
logging.
<P>
   While generally committed to environmental protection, Americans
are seemingly less alarmed about the long-term implications of
global warming, overpopulation and resource depletion.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup Poll found that more than two-thirds of
Americans were sympathetic to the environmental movement but that
the issue ranked behind education, health care, crime, family
values and the economy in significance.
</P>
<P>
   So how is the world doing, 30 years after Earth Day One? Some
prominent people in the environmental movement and the sciences _
as well as a contrarian _ provide some perspective: &QL; 
-- DENIS HAYES &QL; 
 &UR; Founder of the original Earth Day and president and chief &LR; 
 &UR; executive officer of the Bullitt Foundation, a $100 million &LR; 
 &UR; environmental foundation: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What is developing is probably true for all movements. In the
early stages, people are easiest to stir up, because that's when
they perceive immediate threats to themselves, their children and
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The conservation movement began a century ago with Teddy
Roosevelt, but the modern urban environmental movement started with
Rachel Carson and her book, `Silent Spring.' About the same time,
people in cities realized that they were breathing extremely
polluted air and that the rivers they swam and fished in as youths
were so polluted they couldn't let their kids near them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These concerns were all pulled together as a cohesive sense of
values that persuaded a broad cross section of Americans of their
right to a clean environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, virtually all Americans believe in the right to a clean
environment. When James Watt (the U.S. secretary of the interior
under Ronald Reagan) tried to repeal some of these protections, he
was body slammed. The same thing happened to Newt Gingrich when he
attempted a rollback of environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threats that are now facing us may not seem as urgent as
the threats of 30 years ago, but they have horrific implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drowning in studies that demonstrate true global
warming is occurring. I'm hopeful it can be addressed by the weight
of the science and statistics we can bring against it, that we can
now move quickly against global warming as we did with CFCs
(chlorofluorocarbons, which cause ozone depletion in the
stratosphere), which are now banned in the industrial world and
undergoing a phased ban in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has the wealth and science to deal with this
_ if anyone is going to lead the world into this new era, it will
have to be us.''
</P>
<P>
   -- SYLVIA EARLE &QL; 
 &UR; Oceanographer, National Geographic Explorer in Residence, &LR; 
 &UR; Ambassador for the Sea for the Center for Marine Conservation: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful and terrible things have happened during the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned more of the nature of nature, and our
relationship to and our dependence on natural systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, we have been responsible for the
destruction of much of our natural and cultural heritage. ... So
much is being lost so fast. We are facing unprecedented consumption
of natural systems that took 4.5 billion years to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we hold near and dear _ our economies, cultures,
the future of our kids _ is totally and utterly reliant on
maintaining the good health of our environment. Trash our
environment, and we trash our future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a conference of business executives, and someone
from DuPont said his company wanted to be responsive to
environmental concerns, but that any company that doesn't respect
shareholder value doesn't do anyone any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flashed a picture of the Earth, and pointed out that we are
all shareholders, and if we don't respect shareholder value, we all
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem with the globalization of economy is that
industry tends to sink to the lowest common environmental
denominator to expedite trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is: Can we learn enough to forestall the
collapse of our fundamental life support system? At the current
rate of destruction, I cringe at what our descendants will say of
us 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   --CARL POPE &QL; 
 &UR; Executive director of the Sierra Club: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Important things have happened in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a lot of progress in areas where environmental
problems were tangible and visible. The frequency of smog alerts is
down dramatically, Lake Erie is a living lake, the Cuyahoga River
doesn't catch fire anymore, and blood lead levels in American kids
are down 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are moving in the wrong direction in areas where
problems are less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emissions of greenhouse gases are up by 10 percent since we
signed and ratified a treaty in 1990 saying we would stabilize
them. We continue to fragment land and wildlife habitat, so the
total number of threatened and endangered species is dramatically
higher than in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we banned some persistent organic pollutants such as
DDT, we keep inventing new ones so fast that the total level of
pernicious toxics is much higher than in 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental debate in this country is over. We want to
clean up the environment. We don't want this continent to become a
second Europe _ completely tamed. We value its wildness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are entering the new millennium trying to figure out how to
make our leaders listen to us. They are not there yet _ look at the
presidential and congressional resistance to a world trading system
that takes the environment into account.''
</P>
<P>
   -- JOHN McCOSKER &QL; 
 &UR; Senior scientist at the California Academy of Sciences and former &LR; 
 &UR; director of the Steinhart Aquarium: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``From observing passing generations in the Academy's museum and
aquarium, I'm uplifted. Kids routinely ask questions now that were
never even considered 30 years ago. For example, they want to know
why we caught the fish for the aquarium. Thirty years ago, their
parents would have said the only good shark is a dead shark. Now
they want to know if we can let them go. Those are positive signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I am very distressed about life on Earth
and the rapidity with which it is disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malthus was right _ the only thing off was his time line. More
and more, we're dipping into the capital of planetary resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also distressed that consensus cannot be reached on
critical issues. I've witnessed debates over acid rain for the
entirety of the past 30 years. You can always find a scientist not
in agreement with the majority of his or her peers _ but that is
often used as an excuse to do more studies, not act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I include in my disappointment a man who was once my hero _ Al
Gore. &UR;  &LR; Sad to say, he has been unable to fulfill (his earlier)
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't predict the future, but for species other than our
own, life is only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain unconvinced the planet will be able to satisfy as
many people as now exist. Still, if you had talked to me 30 years
ago, I would have been even more pessimistic.''

</P>

 &UR; Friends of the Earth, the League of Conservation Voters and &LR; 
 &UR; Earth Island Institute, and pioneering Yosemite rock climber: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to paraphrase Tom Hayden here: All I've done in my
career is slow the rate at which things get worse. Basically,
that's all the environmental movement has done during the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are just really bad, and we're not handling it at all
well in California _ the most populous state, the state which sets
an example for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation is coming awfully fast, and we need to act if
we're going to avoid a cataclysm, particularly in California. The
San Joaquin Valley is becoming a hotbed of pollution, and we're
doing nothing to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are killing the state with the automobile. We need to get
back to rail, and subsidize it like we do cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population problem is critical, and you don't solve a
problem like that by ignoring the cause, blissfully calling for
more growth. This is a beautiful place here in the Bay Area, but we
are trying to see how fast we can trash it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also been disappointed in (U.S. Secretary of Interior)
Bruce Babbitt, who had a great opportunity that he hasn't been able
to exploit. I'm very upset about his recent plan for Yosemite.
We've been conned _ we're not going to save Yosemite by making it
easier to get there, and to find less camping, more parking and
more expensive hotels when we do get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the projections we have are just that _ projections. These
are decisions that have not yet been made. We can't afford the
luxury of pessimism. Just because we have been and are down doesn't
mean we have to stay down.

OAKLAND BENEFITS FROM SCARCITY OF COMMERCIAL SPACE IN
SAN  FRANCISCO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID SCHOLZ 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ted Elliott laughs out loud when he races across
the Bay Bridge during his morning commute from San Francisco and
sees the hordes of commuters waiting in traffic at the toll plaza
to go the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Oakland, Calif., was seemingly a speed bump for
companies of all sizes that over the years had looked at the East
Bay, the last two years have been a different story.
</P>
<P>
   The city now is on the radar screen of businesses that are
increasingly unable to find _ let alone afford _ commercial space
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first quarter of this year, vacancy rates in
downtown Oakland have sunk to an unheard of 3 percent from 12
percent two years ago, while annual rents have risen to more than
$42 per square foot from $20 since early 1998, according to Cushman
&AMP; Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, president and chief executive officer of Jobscience
Inc., an Internet health care resource center for nursing
professionals, is among the vanguard of a growing number of
dot-coms and other businesses that have found relief from the
space-crunch heartache in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to what San Francisco landlords were demanding from
him, including warrants in his company, first and last month rents,
security deposit and jokingly, ``his left arm and first-born,''
Elliott was pleasantly surprised by the reception he received from
property owners in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want you,'' Elliott said was the reception he
received from Oakland's landlords.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in San Francisco. For seven months, his
operations were crammed in the top floor of a home in Pacific
Heights. By contrast, he can spread out his operations in a
two-story building on Webster Street in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   His new accommodations are large enough to house as many as 120
workers for an employee roster that now numbers 30.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was surprised by the flexible attitude in the lease
negotiations. The landlord, he said, was willing to pay for all the
tenant improvements, settle for a minor security deposit and
establish a graduated scale of lease payments.
</P>
<P>
   His lease averages out to $20 annually per square foot, compared
with the $60 annual rates sought in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's commercial real estate market started to change with
the slow, steady transformation of the city's downtown area. Most
notable was the development of the City Center project and Jack
London Square office and retail complex, as well as the addition of
two large government buildings and the University of California
headquarters building.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the turn in Oakland's commercial real estate
market, the Shorenstein Co. is developing a $100 million, 20-story
office building adjacent to the City Center complex. Oakland
planning officials have put the proposal on a fast track, with
final approval expected soon and groundbreaking as early as summer.
</P>
<P>
   The project comes as the market, particularly for Class A (or
new) office space, the most desirable property, has become
virtually nonexistent due to the heightened demand for space by
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with today's booming economy in the Bay Area, tight
commercial real estate markets in other parts of the region and
Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown's push to spur business growth, Oakland
's commercial real estate market looks inviting to space-starved
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the battle now brewing in San Francisco over
whether city officials should squelch desires of dot-coms to
establish operations in neighborhoods could spur increased interest
in Oakland and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's popularity among companies that are either moving
there or expanding their presence in the region is bolstered by the
proximity to BART.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland is the best transit center in the Bay Area because you
are on the right side of the Nimitz freeway and it's easy to get to
where you need to go,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   CAS Systems Inc., another former San Francisco firm that
provides telecommunications services to high-tech companies, also
fell victim to San Francisco's rising rents as it pondered signing
a new lease for space in the Financial District. It looked toward
Oakland, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, it has turned out to be the best thing that
happened to the company. Not only was the new rent affordable for
CEO Barry Hanson, but the company's new home is centrally located,
making it easy to draw from the East Bay's labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to our business growing is finding and attracting
people who want to enter the high-technology field but don't have
any technology expertise,'' he said. ``We have found a wonderful
location for people who cannot cross the bridge that is located
right on the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit rail) line at 12th Street
and City Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Emeryville, Calif.'s pro-business environment also has snared
its share of firms that looked east for space to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, North Point Communications, a broadband provider of
digital subscriber products and services, took occupancy of a
100,000-square-foot facility that now houses nearly 500 workers. At
the same time the 3-year-old company was committing to that space,
its management had an option to take an additional 100,000 square
feet, which would have accommodated the company's future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Emeryville houses North Point's network operations center and a
lot of customer support. The company's operations on both sides of
the bay work well together, North Point spokeswoman Susan Doerr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The central location, by either car or public transit, also made
the Emeryville space attractive. ``It's part of our company's
culture to make it easy to get to work, and that has made it easy
to hire new employees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the cheaper space and better commute, Elliott's eyes also
have been opened to the quality of life that others have come to
recognize on the east side of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sunny, warmer and the people want you,'' he said. ``It's
kind of nice to be in a place where people want you. It's nothing
like San Francisco, where it has become like Manhattan, where there
are too many busy people.''

BLUE JAYS SNAP YANKEES' WINNING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Fastballs thrown with intent to bruise are often
senseless coded messages, but the mild exchange of hit batsmen
Friday will allow the New York Yankees to remember their 8-3 loss
to the Toronto Blue Jays for something other than how badly they
played.
</P>
<P>
   While dressing after Friday's game, some Yankees debated quietly
about whether the Blue Jays' Chris Carpenter had drilled Tino
Martinez purposefully, and whether the Yankees' Todd Erdos had
retaliated by bouncing a ball off Carlos Delgado's hip. There was
no point, after all, for the Yankees to review their many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   So they will just move on, with their winning streak over after
eight games. ``As long as we cram it into one game _ as long as we
don't space out the garbage, and do it all at once,'' was manager
Joe Torre's way of getting beyond this off day, as he expounded on
a series of Yankee gaffes detailed by reporters. ``Just get it all,
line it up, and I'll initial it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a scorecard from Friday's game would be covered
with giant JT's, in almost every inning. In the bottom of the
first, the Yankee starter, Ramiro Mendoza, threw wildly after
fielding a ball hit in front of the mound, and Homer Bush was safe
at first, credited with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, the Blue Jays' hard-swinging right fielder, was
next. Third baseman Clay Bellinger felt unsure how he should defend
against Mondesi, for Mendoza throws sinkers and mostly induces
ground balls. On the artificial surface at the Skydome, the ball
moves much faster than on grass, and when a grounder hits the seam
between the dirt and the artificial surface, it tends to skid.
</P>
<P>
   So Bellinger was not entirely comfortable when Mondesi ripped a
grounder down the line, and he failed to backhand the ball _ a play
that Torre said later that he thought should have been made.
Mondesi's bounder rolled into the corner, where Ricky Ledee rushed
for it too quickly and was fooled by the carom.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scored, and Mondesi ended up on third base with what was
initially ruled a double-error, on Bellinger and Ledee. Several
minutes later, the official scorer changed that call, but not
Bellinger's sentiment that he ``probably should've made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays assumed a 2-0 advantage, but Mendoza's sinking
fastball stopped sinking after the first inning and Delgado slammed
a home run in the fourth. Mendoza subsequently lost command of his
fastball and hit a couple of batters, and when Ledee overthrew a
cutoff man, it allowed Toronto to score four runs in the inning,
rather than three.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes just kept coming. Mondesi led off the fifth with a
grounder that skipped toward the shortstop hole, and Bellinger
flashed over in pursuit of the ball. Shortstop Derek Jeter stopped,
Bellinger never reached the ball and Jeter wound up catching the
ball flat-footed, disgusted that he had not just kept moving. The
team ``kind of seemed dead,'' Jeter said later.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finally mounted a rally in the sixth against
Carpenter, scoring twice, even after Shane Spencer failed to tag up
and take third base on a fly to center. Martinez strolled to the
plate with two out and two on, a home run away from cutting the
lead to two runs against a Blue Jays team whose pitching had been
getting pounded and whose bullpen was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   But incredibly, Bernie Williams, the runner on first base, was
thrown out trying to steal second, ending the inning. ``Not very
smart,'' Torre said. ``A bad choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a forgettable performance in between an exchange of
purpose pitches. With his control suffering, Mendoza hit Brad
Fullmer and Marty Cordova in the fourth inning, and none of the
Blue Jays seemed to think he did this intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting batters repeatedly _ even accidentally _ is often
considered grounds for retaliation. In the top of the fifth,
Carpenter pitched far inside to Williams, who grounded out, then
bounced a fastball off Martinez's left buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez flipped his bat away and trotted to first. He said
later that he did not know whether Carpenter hit him on purpose,
but it seemed that Carpenter did so; within the code of beanball
ethics, if you are going to hit a batter, hit him on the lower
body.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been the end of it. But in the bottom of the
fifth, the Yankee reliever Todd Erdos bounced a fastball off
Delgado, who glared at Erdos as he slowly moved to first. Mondesi,
who had been at first, walked slowly to second, watching Erdos and
Delgado, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos insisted he did not aim a fastball at Delgado. ``I was
just trying to come inside,'' he said. ``I had a guy on first base
at the time, and I didn't want to put another guy on.''
</P>
<P>
   After that half-inning, Delgado stopped at the mound and chatted
briefly with Carpenter, and four batters into the top of the sixth,
Carpenter grazed Jeter with a fastball. Jeter smirked as he walked
toward first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did me a favor,'' said Jeter, meaning that he was trying to
get on base.
</P>
<P>
   The beanball conflict, limited as it was, ended there. The
competition _ as in who would win the game _ concluded long before
that.

REMEMBERING THE L.A. DAYS OF DIVAC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It was a longshot from the beginning,
bringing a 21-year-old Serbian 7-footer to Los Angeles and
expecting him to replace Kareem Abdul-Jabbar during the final
stages of the Lakers' wondrous run of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And not only Abdul-Jabbar, but George Mikan and Wilt Chamberlain
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Every Lakers championship _ 11 in all _ came with one of those
three patrolling the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In Divac, the Lakers felt they'd found their fourth great
center.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. The Lakers were an ordinary team when Divac
was here from 1989 to 1996 _ nothing more, nothing less. Divac was
decent, certainly respectable, but not great.
</P>
<P>
   That might sell in Sacramento, where Divac now plays, averaging
12.3 points, eight rebounds and three assists, but not in Los
Angeles, where championships _ not mere playoff appearances _ are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Divac was an easy target, a symbol of what the Lakers didn't
have: A dominating center and championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure, coming through (Los Angeles) as a
center and following those kinds of footsteps,'' former Laker
Michael Cooper said. ``Maybe that's unfair to him, because I'm not
sure he was ready at that point in his career. But that's the way
it is in Los Angeles. It can be vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Divac's stay ended when Shaquille O'Neal wanted to become a
Laker, and owner Jerry Buss decided to pay whatever it took to get
him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Divac was banished to Charlotte for the draft rights
to some 17-year-old kid named Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's Divac's Los Angeles legacy. Kareem gave us the
skyhook, Divac gave us Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this adds to the intrigue of the Lakers'
first-round playoffs series against the Kings, which starts Sunday
at Staples Center. How ironic would it be if Sacramento knocked Los
Angeles out, ending its best chance of winning a title in 12 years?
</P>
<P>
   With Divac playing center? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The early years
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers chose Divac with the 26th pick in the 1989
draft, they were looking to replace Abdul-Jabbar, who retired that
summer. They were lucky in a way. Mobile 7-footers with multiple
skills rarely fall so far in the draft, but the NBA was skeptical
of European players at the time a notion Divac helped change.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic Jerry West pick. Others in the organization
were leaning toward safer American players, but West was fascinated
by the multidimensional Divac after watching footage of him with
the Yugoslavian national team against the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the skill right away, that was pretty obvious,''
West said. ``On film, we saw a very gifted player who could do a
lot of things well. We felt there was a place (in the NBA) for
someone with that size and that skill.''
</P>
<P>
   For Divac, it was a dream come true. He grew up idolizing the
Lakers, particularly Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I woke up and boom, I am part of them,'' Divac
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   If there was pressure following Kareem, he never showed it. Like
most young players, he was more concerned with surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look at himself like that,'' West said. ``He was
trying to establish himself, create a niche. But he showed at a
very early stage that he belonged with the best players in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition wasn't smooth. In Europe, Divac played on the
perimeter and shot when he wanted. He was bigger and stronger then
most of his opponents, able to take games over whenever he pleased.
And he played with a flair, dribbling the ball between his legs and
firing no-look passes behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that hurt him in Los Angeles, where Divac was a casual
worker in practice _ to the displeasure of Pat Riley _ and didn't
understand the concept of NBA defense. He showed flashes
offensively but was often punished by more physical opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lazy at first, he didn't really know how hard you had
to work in the NBA,'' Cooper said. ``We tried to push him, and when
you have a guy like Magic bouncing passes off your forehead because
you're not ready, you start to get the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Divac's nonchalant work habits, a common trait of European
players, frustrated his proud Lakers' teammates. They saw Divac's
raw skill but worried he'd waste it, and their chance to win more
titles, because he was too cavalier. So they went to work on
toughening him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic and Coop and myself and some of the other guys, we made
it a point to embarrass him in front of other guys, to scream and
yell at him sometimes,'' said Byron Scott, now an assistant coach
with the Kings. ``He was really light and skinny, but he could
really shoot and pass the ball. And we figured we would just beat
him up and figure out what type of heart he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Divac improved every year in Los Angeles, his scoring average
rising from 8.5 points to 16.2 in 1994-95. Aside from 1991-92, when
injuries limited him to just 36 games, his rebounding and blocked
shots steadily increased as well.
</P>
<P>
   With Divac and Mychal Thompson sharing duties at center and
Johnson leading the way in 1990-91, the Lakers reached the NBA
finals, losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But there were limitations. Divac had difficulties against the
better centers in the league, physical players like Patrick Ewing,
Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson and O'Neal dominated him with brute
force.
</P>
<P>
   The deficiencies, always noticeable, became glaring when Johnson
retired in 1991-92. Up until then, Johnson helped mask Divac's
shortcomings, as he did other players' through the years, by
understanding Divac's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson left, and with an ailing James Worthy unable to
play at the level he did in the 1980s, the Lakers needed Divac to
grow into a dependable force. Instead, he was inconsistent, teasing
with stretches of brilliant play, only to follow with disappearing
acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was fair for people to expect so much from
him at that point; he wasn't ready,'' Cooper said. ``But in the
Lakers' system, the offense goes through the center, so they fed
Vlade.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
What would have happened if ...
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had played longer, perhaps Divac's legacy here would
be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say, but probably we would win a couple of more
championships, and it would have been a different story'' Divac
said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Divac's progression would have been accelerated.
Johnson was sometimes vicious with Divac, scolding him at practice
and in games. But Divac understood his mentor's passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it goes; he was always trying to find the best way
for me,'' Divac said. ``He was trying to teach me the NBA game ...
run and catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a special relationship with Divac, and his absence
was felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic was one of those impact-type people, he led people and
prodded them, and sometimes Vlade was a guy that needed to be
prodded,'' West said. ``At times, he would settle for being a good
player that was content with being just a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott left in 1993, Worthy in 1994. The Lakers didn't reach the
playoffs in 1993-94, lost in the second round in 1994-95 and the
first round in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., that's unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Divac was with the Hornets; O'Neal and Bryant came
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates say it would be a mistake to blame Divac for
the Lakers' malaise during those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what Vlade is doing now with Chris Webber and Jason
Williams, they're playing really well. That shows what Vlade is
capable of doing,'' Cooper said. ``Think of it this way, if he had
been with us earlier, when Magic and James were younger, Vlade
could have been our third guy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
New surroundings
</P>
<P>
   Divac looks back fondly on his years in Los Angeles, where he
grew into a man and developed as a basketball player. This is his
home, where he lives in the offseason and where he will return
permanently when he retires. During the season his wife, Ana, and
three children live here, visiting Divac in Sacramento on weekends.
On off days, Divac returns home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but good things to say about my seven years
here,'' Divac said. ``It's one of the best organizations in sports,
and I was proud to be a part of it. In many ways, I still feel I am
a big fan of the Lakers, even though I play in Sacramento.''
</P>
<P>
   Divac fits well in Sacramento, a less demanding city that
appreciates the fact the Kings are competitive after years of
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings, Divac can pass and shoot on the perimeter while
Webber cleans up inside. He's always run the floor well, and with
the frisky Williams at point guard, Sacramento is deadly in
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, when I was (in Los Angeles) I was a young, and
I had my man Magic on my side, supporting me,'' Divac said. ``Here
I'm the oldest guy, I'm the captain so I try to help the younger
guys. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott has seen the transformation, beginning as a teammate and
now as his coach. He's not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been emotional, he's always been a talkative guy
and those are the kind of guys you need to be your leader,'' Scott
said. ``You also need a guy who's going to go out there and do what
he says. He's always been the type of guy that gives his heart out
there.'' &QL;

   JAPAN'S NIKKEI INDEX POSTS A DECREASE OF 3.7 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stocks fell as sweeping changes in the makeup of the
benchmark Nikkei index on Monday forced investors who track it to
raise money to buy the new components. The Nikkei index of 225
issues declined 706.64 points, or 3.7 percent, to 18,252.68. For
the week, the Nikkei fell 11 percent, its biggest one-week loss
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, Korea's Kospi rose 0.8 percent, led by Korea
Telecom and other companies that were expected to post strong
first-quarter earnings. Taiwan's TWSE index rose 0.1 percent as
investors bet that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing would profit
after the government ordered a rival to stop construction of a
plant. Malaysia's composite index rose 0.2 percent. Markets around
the world, including in Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
Europe, Latin America, Singapore and the United States, were closed
in observance of Good Friday.

   AMERITRADE OFFERS FREE TRADING
</P>
<P>
   Ameritrade, the electronic brokerage firm, has introduced a
trading service that does not charge any commissions on orders to
buy or sell stocks at market prices. The bare-bones operation,
called freetrade.com, expects to make money from interest on loans
to investors, from payments it receives from other companies for
sending trades their way and from selling ad space on its Web site.

   INDIAN TRIBE IN NEW GAMBLING DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, who were on the verge
of gaining approval to build a $500 million casino in the
Catskills, have turned their back on that plan. Instead they signed
an agreement to give exclusive rights to build, develop and manage
any Mohawk casinos in New York state to Park Place Entertainment,
the owner of three casinos in Atlantic City, N.J. Those rights
could be worth billions of dollars, experts said. In return, the
Mohawks would receive a $3 million loan and a large percentage of
the profits from any casino, if and when one is built.

   LAWYERS MAY HAVE TO BID FOR A JOB
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuits
charging auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's with price-fixing
has decided to hold an auction. He invited all the lawyers
representing the 40 plaintiffs so far to submit secret bids by May
12 to determine who will manage the plaintiff's case, a prize that
could be worth millions.

   BUYERS LOOKING AT ORANGE PLC
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies around the world have begun to jockey for
position in what is expected to be a fierce round of bidding for
Orange PLC, the British mobile-telephone operator. Orange is
expected to be sold or spun off by Vodafone as a condition of its
merger with Mannesmann, the German telecommunications and
engineering conglomerate.

   AN AMBITIOUS COMPUTER LAB CLOSES
</P>
<P>
   Interval Research, a computer laboratory founded eight years ago
with a $100 million investment from Paul Allen, a co-founder of
Microsoft and a computer scientist, has closed. The research
concern was established to design technologies that would shape the

FIRE COMPANY WITH NO DRIVER IS CRITICIZED FOR IGNORING ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fire officials Friday chastised an engine company
that did not respond to a fire Wednesday afternoon, saying the
company should have answered the call even though none of the
firefighters on duty had been trained to drive a fire truck.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Engine Co. 303 in Jamaica, Queens, appeared to have
violated any regulations, Chief Peter Ganci said, but they broke an
unwritten code saying firefighters should do whatever is necessary
to protect lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disappointing thing for me,'' he said at a news
conference, ``is that we have five members of the New York City
Fire Department who had a fire to respond to and, for whatever
reason, contractually or otherwise, they thought it was not
necessary for them to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the four firefighters and a supervising
lieutenant were just following department rules that permit only
those with special training to drive fire trucks.
</P>
<P>
   A neighboring fire company responded to the house fire at 107-33
159th Street, in which a young boy suffered minor burns. It arrived
a minute and a half faster than the average response time. But the
incident underscored the tension between the department's
self-image as a place of derring-do and the perception by some that
it can be a nitpicking bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a fire officer had let a firefighter drive,'' said Capt.
Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association,
``and he was not qualified and there was an accident and someone
was hurt, the same fire officials who are complaining would hold
the officer accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver for Engine Co. 303 hurt his back sliding down the
firehouse pole as he began an earlier emergency run about 3 p.m.
Wednesday, officials said. After that job, the driver left work,
and the company notified superior officers that the company would
be unable to respond while it waited for a replacement driver to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, a 911 call reported a serious fire. The
company did not go, Gorman said, because the lieutenant in charge
determined that no one else in the company was capable of driving
the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Ganci said the commonsense approach for the firefighters would
have been to ignore the rule, get in the truck and go. Many
firefighters, he said, are capable of driving engines, even though
they have not gone through the department's chauffeur training
course. Certainly, he said, no one would have punished them for
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman said the incident shows that the department needs more
training programs so more firefighters are qualified to drive
engines. &QL;

FIRMS GOING CASUAL HELP DISADVANTAGED JOB SEEKERS SUIT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As this city's major law firms, banks and consulting
firms shift to a casual dress code, the question arises: what are
they doing with all those suits?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that they are giving them to job seekers, some of
whom may soon be better dressed than the city's power elite.
Cadwalader, Wickersham &AMP; Taft, which recently became the first
major Wall Street law firm to go casual full time, asked all its
lawyers and staff members to donate a suit or other business attire
and collected more than 500 clothing items, including scores of
costly suits.
</P>
<P>
   Other major companies have organized suit drives recently,
including American Express, Goldman, Sachs, PaineWebber, McKinsey
and McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the managing partner of Cadwalader, Robert O. Link
Jr., helped carry the firm's donated suits out to a delivery truck.
Link, who donated two dark pinstripes, a Hugo Boss and a Burberry,
said he was happy to see them go. ``It's more comfortable,'' he
said of the muted green shirt, chinos and blazer he was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours later, Claudio Young, a 24-year-old
unemployed man from upper Manhattan's Washington Heights, was
trying on a dark Paul Stuart pinstripe suit that had been donated
by a Cadwalader employee, along with a Brooks Brothers shirt, a
yellow silk tie and black wingtips. ``I'm not a suit guy; I'm a
hip-hop guy,'' he said. In fact, he said he had never worn a suit
or a tie before. His usual outfit consists of baggy jeans _ Mecca
and Sean John are his favorite brands _ Timberland boots, a
basketball jersey and a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Young received his suit in a midtown warehouse belonging to
Career Gear, a nonprofit organization that works with low-income
men to give them the clothes they need for interviews and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Career Gear clients, Young has had his share of
troubles. After dropping out of school, he developed a drug habit,
and was arrested in August 1997 for selling cocaine to an
undercover agent. But he completed a treatment program, earned his
general equivalency diploma, and after three months of job
training, wound up at Career Gear.
</P>
<P>
   And like most of the men who show up at Career Gear's basement
warehouse near Madison Square Garden, Young was uneasy about his
new clothes at first. Few of the men who come here know how to tie
a necktie, and some find the suits uncomfortable. ``I had one guy
with a scar from ear to ear, a former gang guy,'' said Connie von
Tobel, a volunteer at Career Gear. ``He didn't want anything tight
around the neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Young will soon have his first job interview. ``I want to pay
taxes, you know, real taxes,'' he said. He hopes to find a position
as a photocopy machine technician.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that he will feel a little overdressed for his
interview? Gary Field, Career Gear's founder, said: ``I don't think
so. What's more important is the way it makes them feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pryor, a former hotel worker, put on a Brooks Brothers
suit after going through addiction and job-training programs, and
now has a job with the New York Center for Addiction Treatment
Services. ``It boosts your confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Field, a social worker who has had his own struggles with
unemployment and addiction, founded Career Gear last year. He had
worked briefly at a law firm where female lawyers donated business
clothing to Dress for Success, which works only with women and has
been in business for three and a half years. ``The male attorneys
kept asking why they couldn't donate suits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Field and Arlene Wallace of Dress for Success said the
shift to casual dress among New York companies had been a
tremendous windfall for them. Career Gear has received about 2,000
suits over the last year. Dress for Success' New York affiliate has
received 8,000 to 10,000 pieces of business clothing in the last
three weeks, most of them suits, said Wallace, the organization's
associate director. Both groups have also received hefty donations
from designers, including Brooks Brothers, Polo and Ferragamo.
</P>
<P>
   Field added, however, that the shift to casual wear posed
complications. For one thing, his clients will have to keep up.
``We're working with retailers, so they can get dress-casual stuff
when they come back for the alumni programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As businessmen dress down and job-seekers dress up, will the
suit's status suffer? Probably not. Even at Cadwalader, lawyers
dress up when they meet with clients. And the suit has survived
similar challenges in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flexible scheme of clothing,'' said Anne Hollander, an
art historian and the author of ``Sex and Suits: The Evolution of
Modern Dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been around for 200 years, if not more,'' she said. ``So
it has a likelihood of lasting much longer.''

WILT TO SHAQ: GO FOR IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille, my man. Wilt here. This columnist
channeled my spirit Friday while you were doing yoga with the rest
of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   I was one happy cat to have the open line. I've been trying to
get your attention all year (haven't you sensed my aura?), so I
could deliver my ``Win one for the Big Dipper'' pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   You've had a monster season, my man. To lead the league in
scoring again is cool and don't think I didn't notice your 299
assists. Those 63 double-doubles you have to show for all your toil
and trouble were sweet, but they won't mean a thing if you don't
win a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Those positive vibes you're feeling from the public can turn
into chills in the time it takes a series to slip from your grasp.
Trust me, I know the score even if no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   You're the most visible Laker on a squad everybody sees as
unstoppable. Wasn't it just the other day Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy was quoted as saying his players are intimidated by your
team?
</P>
<P>
   Right, baby. Now you cats know what it feels like to be Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions you yourself will face in these playoffs, only I
know. It's not easy being 7-feet-1 when that final playoff game
isn't won.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, baby, I know. I was the league MVP as a rookie in
Philadelphia. My third season in the NBA, I averaged 50.4 points.
Two years later, I led San Francisco into the Finals. We lost in
five games to Boston, after which a San Francisco fan grumbled to a
local paper, ``Wilt Chamberlain? I can't love a 7-feet-1 loser.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's not easy being so very tall. Win and it's a team
effort. Lose and the failure is yours alone to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Your size makes you an easy target. Your teams have been swept
out of the playoffs the past two seasons, so you know what I'm
saying. It's tough, but you're stronger for having been double- and
triple-teamed by adversity.
</P>
<P>
   I'm proud of you, my man. I really am. This season, you've
proved you can share the ball, you've demonstrated you can play
defense, you've shown you can take a lick and keep kicking butt.
</P>
<P>
   I especially enjoyed that elbow you delivered to David
Robinson's midsection in the game at San Antonio the other day.
That was one small blow for big men right there. When will people
appreciate the pounding we 7-footers have to absorb night in and
night out?
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, I got so tired of it, the second game of the
divisional playoffs against Boston during my rookie season, I took
a wild swing at Tom Heinsohn, missed him, hit my teammate Tom Gola
flush on his arm and hurt my hand.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to be smarter than I was in 1960. My hand wasn't
right the rest of the way, and it ended up costing us the series.
</P>
<P>
   I applaud the way you've kept your composure. You've been one
cool cat.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential that you maintain your emotional equilibrium
during the playoffs. Remember: The sweetest retaliation of all is
winning.
</P>
<P>
   That's how you must approach your critics, too. The problem is,
my man, you've raised the expectations so high with your sublime
play during the regular season, you've set yourself up for a crash
landing.
</P>
<P>
   I know you want the world to wrap you in a bear hug, no matter
how much you feign indifference. I know, because I was the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, the public's love is harder to win than that of a
good woman.
</P>
<P>
   The more you give the public, the more it wants. No matter what
you do, it might never be enough. You've built a Frankenstein, and
it's not going to be easy to run away from it.
</P>
<P>
   So my advice to you, my man, is play for your teammates, not
your town.
</P>
<P>
   Those cats know the score. I heard Glen Rice say Friday he
doesn't know what else people possibly can ask of you. He said he
hopes the Lakers can win the title this year to remove that burden
from your back.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds to me like a guy who has your back.
</P>
<P>
   I heard you say you're going to try to raise the level of your
game to new heights in the playoffs, starting with the Lakers'
best-of-five series against Sacramento. That's cool if you want to
try to block more shots, get more rebounds, set more screens.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep this in mind, my man: When I won my first NBA title in
1967, I averaged a mere 17.7 points in the championship series
against San Francisco. Rick Barry had 55 points in one game and 43
in another for the losing team.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6, I didn't take a shot in the second half, but I pulled
down eight of my 23 rebounds and blocked a half-dozen shots in that
span. And I was the one in Barry's face when he heaved his final
errant shot that allowed my Philadelphia team to escape with a
125-122 series-icing win.
</P>
<P>
   I remember telling a reporter afterward that sometimes it's
easier to play against a team that has one man doing most of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was a hard-earned lesson. I hope you'll keep it in
mind and continue kicking the ball out to Kobe Bryant or Glen when
your shot's not there, same as you've done all season.
</P>
<P>
   And don't fret your free throws, my man. As one of my coaches,
Frank McGuire, once told me, ``If you hit all your free throws we'd
never lose. It would be too easy and that wouldn't be any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't surprise me that your coach, Phil Jackson, came out
and said he is at peace with the prospect of your being put on the
foul line in the fourth quarter with the game hanging in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Zen Master has a clear line to the metaphysical world. He
sees that you're in your eighth year in the league, same as I was
when I won my first NBA championship. I'm pretty sure he recognizes
my aura is with you. &QL;

FEARFUL CABDRIVERS WELCOME SAFETY STOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The yellow taxi bore medallion 6Y70, but it was not a
yellow taxi.
</P>
<P>
   It was a police cruiser, a radio car in disguise, and it was
occupied by members of the Brooklyn North Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, with its engine revving
and a portable red light flashing from its dashboard, the car
lurched through its gears and bore down on a livery cab in East New
York. When the livery cab pulled to the curb, three officers
stepped out of the fake taxi and encountered a shift in the local
law-enforcement climate.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the livery cab, Juan Sampson, 23, watched the officers
converge. He had not been speeding. His papers were valid and
up-to-date. Sampson might have been expected to be irritated, even
angry, about the inconvenience of having a fake taxi laden with
police officers force him to the curb. Instead, he rolled down his
window and grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for checking on me,'' he said. ``Thank you very
much. I appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when critics have accused the Police Department of
stopping too many people with too little reason, and of using the
discretion granted police officers to institutionalize harassment,
New York's livery-cab drivers have adopted the opposite stance.
</P>
<P>
   And for the department's Street Crime Units, vilified for their
aggressive tactics since the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo
last year, stopping livery cabs offers more than a new high-profile
assignment. It offers a chance at public redemption. ``That's how
I'm encouraging the guys to look at this,'' said Capt. Barry
Galfano, commanding officer of the Brooklyn North Street Crime
Unit. ``Here's a chance to make friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven livery drivers have been killed this year, a pace not
matched since 1994, and most of the drivers have been killed during
the commission of robberies.
</P>
<P>
   At the taxi industry's urging, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir have created a livery task force of more
than 300 officers, and have issued rules that make it easier for
officers to stop livery cabs and initiate a search. The authorities
and the drivers say they hope that frequent traffic stops will show
robbers that livery cabs are no longer easy marks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the traffic stop program, the department is
setting up five or six safety zones in each borough, where drivers
with suspicious passengers can go to find officers, and tripling
the number of decoy cabs on patrol, although the authorities have
declined to say how many will be deployed in all.
</P>
<P>
   But at the forefront of the driver protection effort are the
eight Street Crime Units, consisting of roughly 240 officers whose
previous assignment had been to patrol high-crime areas in unmarked
cars by night, primarily in plain clothes, trying to surprise
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It was four Street Crime Unit officers who fired 41 times at
Diallo, who was unarmed, in February of last year. And after more
than a year of demonstrations and denunciations, the unit's very
name remains shorthand in some circles for high-risk, in-your-face
policing. Safir said Friday that the livery driver protection
mission might erase some of the unit's post-Diallo stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what Street Crime was designed to do: to focus
on spikes in crime, particularly violent crime, and to deal with
it,'' Safir said. ``We are now dealing with a segment of the
population that is saying, `We want you to be more involved with
us, not less.'''

SECURITY FACES REVIEW AFTER A LAPTOP VANISHES
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is considering a
reorganization of its security system after a laptop computer
vanished from an intelligence office with highly sensitive files
about weapons proliferation, a senior administration official said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have not yet determined that the laptop
was stolen, its theft would represent the highest possible breach
of classified material, officials said. The computer contained
files designated `code-level', a status beyond top secret.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright may recommend stripping
the Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research of its ability
to manage its own security and place it under the aegis of the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state is furious about this incident,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I've rarely
seen her as angry about anything as this case.'
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is leading an investigation into the disappearance of
the laptop, which was reported two months ago by the Office of
Intelligence and Research. The office, which is under the direction
of Assistant Secretary of State J. Stapleton Roy, a former
ambassador to China, is the department's main source of
intelligence data and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The incident stirred an outcry among some Republican lawmakers.
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, the chairman of the House International
Relations Committee, said it was the latest in ``a long string of
security failures'' at the State Department, including the recent
discovery of a eavesdropping device in a conference room that was
believed to be placed by Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to elaborate on the contents of the missing
material, except to confirm that it involved sources and methods
relating to weapons proliferation, including data gathered by
satellites and human and electronic sources. New details of what
may have been contained in the laptop were reported by The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Intelligence and Research has been under fire for
lax security for several years, including those under the direction
of Roy's predecessors. Department officials had recently considered
and rejected a proposal to transfer the bureau's security to the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which protects diplomats and foreign
dignitaries and fights terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department internal audit in December found that the
department had allowed contractors and maintenance staff members to
wander around the building without escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, who plans to hold hearings into the recent breaches,
said the department lacked a ``professional environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign policy analysts attributed the security problems to
a culture that is somewhat resistant to onerous security measures
and to sweeping cutbacks in the department's overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when there are ever greater demands on the department
_ and need for more diplomatic missions in the wake of the breakup
of the Soviet bloc _ Congress has steered resources away from
diplomacy and into law enforcement and counterterrorism operations,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has ordered an internal review of the Department's
security procedures. David Carpenter, the assistant secretary for
diplomatic security, is leading a team of security specialists from
various federal agencies in that study. The results are expected
soon.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Albright said she was ``continuing to study the
possible need for structural changes to ensure that the mandate for
the best security is everywhere understood and everywhere
applied.''

SECURITY FACES REVIEW AFTER A LAPTOP VANISHES
</HEADLINE>
  (This story is a late addition to the New York Times)

   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is considering a
reorganization of its security system after a laptop computer
vanished from an intelligence office with highly sensitive files
about weapons proliferation, a senior administration official said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have not yet determined that the laptop
was stolen, its theft would represent the highest possible breach
of classified material, officials said. The computer contained
files designated `code-level', a status beyond top secret.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright may recommend stripping
the Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research of its ability
to manage its own security and place it under the aegis of the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary of state is furious about this incident,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I've rarely
seen her as angry about anything as this case.'
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is leading an investigation into the disappearance of
the laptop, which was reported two months ago by the Office of
Intelligence and Research. The office, which is under the direction
of Assistant Secretary of State J. Stapleton Roy, a former
ambassador to China, is the department's main source of
intelligence data and analysis.

COACH SENDS LAKERS TO THE MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ What does the story of a neo-Nazi skinhead
have to do with the Lakers' pursuit of an NBA championship?
</P>
<P>
   Only Lakers coach Phil Jackson knows for sure, and presumably,
his players have some idea now. Jackson employed one of his unique
teaching methods Thursday evening, splicing scenes from 1998's
``American History X'' into the team's usual film session.
</P>
<P>
   It was up to the players to decipher the lessons as they applied
to basketball, and to the Lakers' first-round playoff series
against the Sacramento Kings, which begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was basically just letting us know that we've got
to tighten it up, got to be a lot more focused, got to know what
we're dealing with and be ready to step up to the challenge,'' said
Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty good,'' said Shaquille O'Neal. ``It
made us shift our minds every now and then. The parts of the movies
that he threw in, they were giving us like subliminal messages. You
have to be smart to understand a guy like Phil.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie features Ed Norton as a reformed skinhead who, having
undergone a transformation in prison, tries to prevent his younger
brother from making the same mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lively distraction from basketball nonsense,'' Jackson said,
playing coy about the message he was trying to send.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say it has something to do with your past, and also
something to do with your future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson claimed he had a difficult time finding the right film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with the movies. I have to speak to some of the
producers and directors in Hollywood about the motivational choices
that I had,'' he quipped. ``Actually, it wasn't a bad group of
pictures to look from, `The Green Mile' and so forth. But the
ultimate result is I didn't find anything that really fit the bill
for all of our players. `The Matrix' is another one that I thought
had something to do with being `in the moment,' that kind of play
that we were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's some things I think that go into this that are
individual, and there are some things that are collective for the
group. And more than anything else, I never show the film clip more
than five minutes during the course (of the film session). We do
mostly basketball work and we skip around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a teaching method Jackson employed during his tenure with
the Chicago Bulls, and one he hopes to use again in the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've usually used three (movies) during the course of the
playoffs. Hopefully we go that long and we can use three movies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW START: The Lakers held their longest, hardest workout in
weeks on Friday, trying to recoup the precision that was missing in
losing the last two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that pleased,'' Jackson of the practice. ``We
couldn't keep the flow going, it was such a long practice. And
sometimes that happens. ... But guys stuck with it. Their energy
was good. ... Most of all, we have to recondition ourselves after
really backing off on our conditioning for the last week. So we
were pushing a little bit on that end of it, and I think we
accomplished what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ STATEMENT: O'Neal, addressing his Wednesday scuffle with
San Antonio's David Robinson for the first time, said the elbow he
put in Robinson's chest was not intended as a statement. It had
been suggested that O'Neal was sending a message after taking
several hard fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't saying anything,'' O'Neal said. ``I think our focus
is going to be on Sacramento. And if (the Spurs) are around in the
second round, then I'll answer those questions. I do things that I
want to do, not because I'm trying to retaliate or trying to hurt
somebody. I just do it because I want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the hard fouls from Robinson a message to O'Neal?
``Probably. Just something I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Bryant attended his media session with a massive
bag of ice taped to his sprained right wrist and admitted the
injury has affected his shooting ``a little bit.'' But Bryant
insisted it would not be a concern come game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sunday the adrenaline will be rushing a little too
much. I don't think I'll really think about it,'' he said. ``It
can't get any worse. The pain is pretty consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's only injury-related concern Friday was backup guard
Derek Fisher, who had to sit out part of practice because of
soreness from a bone spur in his right ankle. &QL;

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WEAVES OPERA INTO CLASSWORK 
</HEADLINE>
 - 980(2TAKES)-NYT  (ko) 
 By NINA SIEGAL     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four fifth-grade girls from Public School 314 escaped
class one recent afternoon in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, not to buy
sweets at the corner bodega, or to swap secrets over blush in the
bathroom, but to slip into a music room to work on their opera, a
three-act (six-page) work involving a popular girl, a class clown
and a meteorite blazing toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the four girls, who have been learning about ``Tosca''
and ``Aida'' since kindergarten and attending performances at the
Metropolitan Opera since the third grade, can bat around opera
terms like aficionados. So as a group of second-graders sang
slightly discordant scales in the back of the music room _ which
housed computers nicknamed Verdi, Rossini and Puccini, 10-year-old
Kristina Maisonet buoyantly described her original work, using an
obscure term unfamiliar to even many opera lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an opera seria, not an opera,'' Kristina said,
explaining that an opera seria is chock-full of arias and short on
recitative, or sung dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kristina nor many of her classmates come from homes
where parents and grandparents listen to opera as daily background
music. More than three-quarters of the 1,918 students at P.S. 314,
the Luis Munoz Marin Elementary School, are Latin American and
Caribbean, and the second largest ethnic group in the school is
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992, Vincent Grippo, the superintendent of Community
School District 20, started weaving opera into the fabric of the
school, inspired by a teacher who wanted to shape her classes
around an opera motif. And he says it has set off a remarkable
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the state education commissioner included P.S. 314 on a
list of the 43 most academically troubled public schools in the
state. While it is still not a high-ranking school, P.S. 314
finished 408th out of the city's 677 public elementary schools in
reading achievement for 1999 and has escaped the list of failing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my expressions is, `If it's good enough for the rich,
why don't we try it on the poor?' '' Grippo said. ``It's art for
art's sake, but beyond that, it creates self-esteem and a full
human being. One of the reasons it works is because we're taking
poor immigrant children and exposing them to a whole world of
creativity and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a group of kindergartners might be practicing
screechy Suzuki violin; second graders might be rehearsing
``Mikey's Dream,'' a 25-minute opera that they wrote and produced;
a group of fourth graders might be working on an interactive CD-ROM
about ``The Queen of Spades,'' responding to a performance they had
just seen at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera Guild says the school employs the only
full-time opera teacher in the New York City school system. The
teacher, Mary Jo Lassen, tells students about the history of the
form, helps them read and study Italian and French librettos with
the help of translations, and has them memorize and sing translated
arias. In the fifth grade, students can join an opera club to
attend early rehearsals at the Met with Lassen.
</P>
<P>
   They meet stars like Placido Domingo, write their own works in
English and sometimes translate them and perform them in other
languages. (Boys seem just as interested as girls, said Lassen,
noting that last year most students in the opera club were boys.)
Earlier this year, mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade visited the
school.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. 314 still has its troubles. Measured against other public
elementary schools in New York with students who have similar
economic and social backgrounds, P.S. 314 performs about average on
English tests, according to the most recent assessment by the New
York City Board of Education. Last year, 41.2 percent of the
students were reading at or above grade level. Still, Grippo said,
children studying the performing arts benefit in ways that cannot
be measured on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The school's program is financed through the Annenberg
Foundation and a city arts fund, Project Arts. Elements of the
program have been copied in about 20 of the district's 30 schools,
although few have the same kind of financial support. Teachers at
P.S. 314 say its program improves their students' academic drive
and helps them learn a wide range of basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each child in the class got a script, each child got to read
with the other children, and along with their lines, they learned
plot and structure,'' said Regina M. Gangi, a teacher whose second
graders recently wrote and performed a 25-minute opera. ``The other
kids came along with math by building the sets, doing the
electrical work, and that all has to do a lot with figuring out
equations. It's a different way of having the children open up
their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   By writing their own works in the music room (after school,
during lunch break, and occasionally during class), the students
seem to have gained insights into opera's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it very juicy,'' Kristina said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Lauren, added, ``You have to have a big climax, not
something that happens every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls giddily narrated the plot of their work, ``Friends to
the End,'' to a visitor, their eyes beaming, voices overlapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a popular girl and a boy who's like the class clown,
and he becomes more popular than she is and so she gets jealous,''
Kristina said.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Colon, 11, continued. ``So she shoves pills in his mouth
and _ she doesn't want to kill him; she just wants to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren broke in, ``There's a meteorite coming and the world is
going to end, but then it's just a little rock.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tiffany Cortes, 10, with a coy smile, insisted that the
ending was still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren conceded, ``It's supposed to be a comedy, but we might
make the world end anyway.''

 UNDATED: end anyway.''

<P>
   &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Her eyes darted for confirmation toward Lassen, the force behind
P.S. 314's devotion to opera. Twenty-two years ago, when she was a
fifth-grade teacher and the school's music program was faltering
because of budget cuts, she took a teacher training class from the
Metropolitan Opera Guild. Later, she tried to introduce her class
to ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one libretto and an audio tape of an opera
performance,'' she recalled. ``I read it out loud to the students.
How boring!''
</P>
<P>
   Lassen decided to give her students a more active role in their
opera lessons, and eight years ago she requested permission to
devote her attention to teaching opera to students in all grades.
</P>
<P>
   Christina C. Cortes, the interim vice principal of P.S. 314,
said that when she first saw Lassen's students sewing period
costumes for a show, she was instantly intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very focused on the elements of story, on narrative,
setting, time, problem solving, solutions,'' Cortes said. ``So it
was a direct carry-over to their developmental learning in
reading.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, second-grade students were asked to write and produce
their own opera, which eventually became ``Mikey's Dream.'' Last
fall, two second-grade teachers, Gangi and Laura Garzaniti,
attended half a dozen daylong workshops arranged by the opera
guild. Their students auditioned for various roles and
responsibilities for ``Mikey's Dream,'' from acting and writing to
set design and public relations work.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, members of the newly formed Star Opera
Company, a group of about three dozen 7- and 8-year olds, performed
``Mikey's Dream'' four times, once for their parents and three
times for a rapt audience of peers, many of whom sang along from
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The work is about a little boy who cannot go out to play because
his room is a mess and he has not finished his homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a servant,'' laments the protagonist, Mikey,
played by Juan Carlos Martinez, 7. ``I have one dollar. Maybe I can
buy a servant.''
</P>
<P>
   He falls asleep and has a nightmare in which all his friends are
fighting; but when he awakes, they are in his room, offering to
help him clean up.
</P>
<P>
   In his final aria, Mikey sings, ``I am so lucky I have good
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   During the third performance, one of five large set pieces
started to crack, and the students, alone backstage between scenes,
had to figure out what to do. One boy from Gangi's class decided to
stand behind the piece and hold it up throughout the scene, saving
the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really weird to think of a second grader figuring out
that if he stood there behind it no one would see him,'' Gangi
said. The boy had been very unmotivated, she said. ``He never used
to have his homework done. But since this, he's been coming in and
doing his work.''
</P>
<P>
   During a post-production discussion, some students even showed
precocious signs of the kind of self-possession that sets the opera
greats apart. Reflecting on her achievement, Melinda Lopez, 8, who
played the leading female role, Ashley, dabbed her brashly colored
eyelids like a true diva.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is when you grow up, you can remember about
this,'' she said. ``And you can be a singer and you won't be shy.''
