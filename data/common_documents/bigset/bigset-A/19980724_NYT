<P>
   Comets at a loss to net &QL; 
league's weekly award
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Comets own the WNBA's best record at 17-1 and are streaking
along with 12 consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   They possess the league's most potent offense, averaging 77.2
points per game. They also boast the league's top defense,
surrendering only 63.6 points per contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets feature the No. 1 scorer in the league in Cynthia
Cooper, whose 23.5-point average is more than four points higher
than the next best. They have the runners-up in 3-point percentage
and steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   So the individual accolades must be rolling in, right?
</P>
<P>
   But five weeks into the season, the Comets have been shut out
for WNBA Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous, I think it's ridiculous, and I think
it's ridiculous,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, Comets media-services director Tom Savage faxes a
Comets nominee to the league. He has checked; the faxes are being
received. The Comets are being considered. But somehow, that glossy
record isn't convincing somebody.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets are beginning to believe the selection process is
biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, why would it ever be political?'' Cooper said, her voice
laced with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   The league insists the Player of the Week honor should reflect
not only individual statistics but also team success. With a 17-1
record, somebody is leading the Comets to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several people who vote anonymously here in the
office, and it's based on a lot of factors,'' said Mark Pray, WNBA
director of media relations. ``It's based on basically who we think
had the best week both from a statistical perspective and from
their team's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' Lisa Leslie was the league's first choice this
season after averaging 19 points and a league-leading 13 rebounds
through the first five games of the season. But the Sparks went 2-3
during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Tracy Reid was the most recent recipient, averaging
17 points and 6.7 rebounds last week. The Sting also suffered a
loss during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cooper's) team was 3-0, 4-0 or whatever,'' Pray said. ``I
can't speak for the other voters, but there were some areas where
Tracy excelled and Cynthia did not. That's my personal opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper averaged 22.7 points per game last week while becoming
the first player to reach the 1,000-point plateau for her WNBA
career. She added a season-high eight assists in one game, while
leading the Comets to a 3-0 mark on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on now _ we have the best record,'' Cooper said. ``We
have a 12-game winning streak. We have one of the best defenses in
the league, the best offense in the league, and you're telling me
not one player on this team can make Player of the Week? I think
that's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems even more astounding was the selection of Leslie over
Cooper at the start of the season. While Leslie was getting her 19
points per game, Cooper was averaging 25.7. Cooper ended the period
ranked first in the league in 3-point field goals made (13) and
scoring (24.2) and led the Comets to a 4-0 week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that it's unfair, and I think maybe the league is
trying to send a message: `Yeah, they're the Comets, and yeah, they
won a championship, but nobody on the team has been named Player of
the Week,''' Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had a player honored after Jennifer Gillom averaged 26
points and 10 rebounds. Detroit's Cindy Brown received the accolade
with 20.5-point and 13-rebound averages. Charlotte's Andrea Stinson
was the other recipient after completing a week with 20-point,
7.7-rebound and 2.7-steals-per-game averages.
</P>
<P>
   In those respective weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Cooper averaged 27.5 points and hit eight of 11 from beyond the
3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper set a record for free throws, making 22 of 24 in one
game, while averaging 25.7 points that week.
</P>
<P>
   And Swoopes averaged 16.8 points per game and set a career high
with seven assists in one contest, as the Comets posted a 4-0
record.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the league took no notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've heard a lot of people say it's unfair the players
we have on our team when you compare it to a lot of other teams,''
Swoopes said. ``But we got assigned players. We drafted players
just like everybody else did. I don't think that's unfair, but
maybe there's a message or point that they're trying to get across
that just because they're the defending champions, they haven't
received all the awards. Some of the other teams have gotten them.
Some of the other players have gotten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've gotten the recognition on this team that
we're capable of getting, but it's out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper won the award twice last year en route to her bigger
award _ league Most Valuable Player. She's poised to repeat that
honor, and sooner or later the league will be forced to recognize
her weekly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt in anyone's mind that Cynthia
is one of our top performers,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said.
``To be frank, I'm heartened that every week we can have a good
debate about who had the better performance. It will be great to
see who does it next week.''

to elude the camouflaged G-men. Add together an underlayer of

pride in the ability of a ninth-grade dropout to outwit more than
200 investigators, and it begins to become apparent why a local man
has sold more than 200 T-shirts bearing the slogan: ``Run Rudolph

   SCI-CLONER-PROFILE (Undated) _ Man in the News: Dr. Ryuzo
Yanagimachi, the man who cloned mice, followed advice given him by
a mentor more than 30 years ago: take the grant money and spend
three days a week doing the research you said you would do. Then
spend the other two days doing anything you want. What he wanted to
do was clone, disregarding the prevailing view among reproductive
biologists that mice would be the most difficult of all mammals to
clone. As for cloning humans, he politely but firmly declined to be
drawn in. ``If all the humans on the face of the earth were
infertile, this may be justified,'' Yanagimachi said. ``But until

it for us.'' By Gina Kolata.

to call his father. ``Ty, you still in Singapore?'' the father
asks. The man replies: ``No, I'm on leave. I'm in Vietnam.'' That

   TIFFANY-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Austere is not the usual modifier
when it comes to Louis Comfort Tiffany. In the last two decades of
the 19th century, the interior decoration company carrying the name
of this painter-turned-designer defined the height of luxury for
wealthy, esthetically adventurous New Yorkers and set standards of
ostentatious propriety in churches across the country. But the
exhibition that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is devoting to this
leader of the Esthetic Movement, which forward-looking American
artists had imported from England by the 1870s, is startlingly
spare and understated. By Roberta Smith.

   MANHATTAN-FOREST (New York) _ As darkness falls, a burly man
lugging a boombox heads into Inwood Hill Park followed by a gaggle
of others. Your heart could sink at the prospect of Manhattan's
last stand of real forest, tucked away in the northwestern corner
of the borough, being desecrated by loud music. But hold on. The
fellow in front is Michael Feller, the parks department's senior
naturalist. He is leading a newly offered nocturnal tour of the
190-acre park. What happens next is, to say the least, not typical
of Manhattan night life.

HANDICAPPING GAMES OFF THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Maybe it's just me, but isn't the sports world mired
in a ``What's Going to Happen'' sort of Twilight Zone?
</P>
<P>
   This much still applies: It is not whether you win or lose, it's
how you play the game. We don't mean the game played between the
lines. That would be too easy.
</P>
<P>
   No, the greatest action in sports these days is the other stuff.
Like the psycho-drama in Chicago or the superstar contract
power-plays taking place in our own backyard. Let's examine a few
of the up-in-the-air scenarios that currently dominate our
collective consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan: Can he trump The Two Jerrys?
</P>
<P>
   Situation: The six-time champion Bulls have just hired Iowa
State coach Tim Floyd. This means Floyd will be a rookie NBA coach
next season _ provided the locked-out NBA finds a way to carve up
its millions _ because Zenmaster Phil Jackson says he is not coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, golfing and enjoying his status as the most influential
sports figure in the galaxy, is not saying what he will do, now
that those Jerrys _ Krause and Reinsdorf _ have laid down the
gauntlet.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Jordan, with free-agent sidekick Scottie Pippen in
tow, will decide to make a title run in Phoenix (or Houston or
Madison Square Garden).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has stated emphatically that playing another season is
not about money _ hard to believe when $40 million might be coming
his way. Chicago is the only team that can pay Jordan anything
close to that.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sir Air could indeed choose revenge over revenues.
Jordan would love to give the Bulls' owner and general manager what
they have coming. A title in another town would prove that Jordan
owned the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon: Can he be serious?
</P>
<P>
   Situation: Last year, Moon signed a two-year deal to serve as
the Seahawks' backup quarterback. Then he became the starter. And
he was as good as you would expect Warren Moon to be, maybe even
better, since Moon's career as a frontline player seemed all but
over.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the Hawks and Moon agreed that a better deal
would be forthcoming before this season. Now though, with Moon a
training-camp holdout, ``taking care of Warren Moon'' appears to
have a $6 million-or-so chasm between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Moon wants a two-year deal, minimum, worth $7-8 million. The
Seahawks are offering one year at $1.87 million plus incentives
that could push the deal close to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: General manager Randy Mueller and the Seahawks will
stand &AMP;Z&AMP;[ yn -YZ9 &QC; KV. $GkKRWKk$X,,Y8

MOON, SEAHAWKS NOT TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Warren Moon says he is not trying to be
difficult, but the veteran quarterback says he is having a
difficult time understanding what he calls the Seahawks'
``stubborn'' stance in restructuring his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the media Thursday for the first time since he
failed to report to training camp Sunday, Moon sounded puzzled, a
bit dumbfounded and a little weary from the first holdout of his
21-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just kind of stonewalled us. They don't want to talk
anymore,'' Moon said from the Newport Beach, Calif., office of his
agent, Leigh Steinberg. ``They've kind of given me, `This is what
we're going to give you. You take it or you leave it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice president of football operations,
has not talked to Steinberg or his associate, Jeff Moorad, since
Sunday. Instead, the two sides exchanged letters Monday and Tuesday
in which they restated their positions and strengthened the impasse
in Moon's contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   So as his teammates were practicing in 90-degree heat and
intermittent thunder showers Thursday, Moon was making plans to
return to his home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side expected it to come to this.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues preventing a deal from getting done have been
there since the club assured Moon early in the offseason that it
would restructure the final year of the two-year deal he signed
last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think by saying `We'll take care of you,' that they
meant making you right in the quarterback market _ whatever a
starting quarterback would make,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The club's idea of ``taking care of you'' was to offer Moon a $1
million raise from the $550,000 base salary he was scheduled to
make, plus roster and reporting bonuses that upped the deal to $2
million and another $1.6 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Moon and Steinberg took ``taking care of you'' to mean a deal
more in line with what the NFL's top quarterbacks are making. They
originally asked for a three-year deal that included a $6 million
signing bonus and now are talking about a two-year deal worth $7-8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even willing to guarantee I'll play two more years,'' Moon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller declined to discuss Moon's situation for the third
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say that's new or constructive or
will add to the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller has explained that the club can't offer Moon more
money this season because of salary-cap restrictions and won't sign
the 41-year-old quarterback to a longer-term deal if it means tying
up cap dollars in years Moon won't be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they can't, or won't, pay me what the top guys are
making _ the $6 million or $7 million guys,'' Moon said. ``But I
just want to be paid the norm for my position. I don't want to be
paid a half or a third what the average guys are making.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moon, the impasse is not just about money. Also at stake are
his pride and his perception of what's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to arrive at a fair number, and right now it's just
not fair for where I am,'' Moon said. ``It's quite puzzling to me
that they would take such a hard stance at this position. You just
don't see other teams in the league let their quarterbacks dangle
out there without contracts being taken care of, especially if
they've performed. The priority of the position just doesn't seem
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon plans to live in Seattle after he retires from football,
and has designs on becoming a power player in the community. He
doesn't think a prolonged holdout would hinder his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my principles are correct. I don't think I'm being
unreasonable,'' Moon said. ``I think it's hard for the average
working guy to understand why I wouldn't take a $1 million raise.
But they don't live in this market. There are only 30 guys in this
position in the world. I'm one of those 30 guys and I'm taking
advantage of the market I'm in.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks a week from their preseason opener at Dallas,
it doesn't appear Moon will be living in a dorm room at Eastern
Washington University any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd say I miss Cheney,'' he said. ``But I kind
of do.''

LOUISIANA SEIZES MANAGEMENT OF PRIVATELY RUN YOUTH PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana officials have taken over temporary management of a
troubled, privately run juvenile prison after the warden resigned
following a lawsuit, critical reports by federal investigators and
several disturbances by inmates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richard Stalder, the secretary of the Louisiana
Department of Public Safety and Corrections, sent in a new warden,
managers and a team of 35 guards drawn from the state's adult
prison system. Stalder said his move was prompted by the
resignation of the warden, David Bonnette, and was not a takeover
of the prison, the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, which is
owned and operated by a for-profit company, Trans-American
Development Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf
of 12 inmates at Tallulah seeking to improve the treatment of
inmates there. In June, the Justice Department made public a series
of reports detailing the brutality and other poor conditions at the
center. Recently there also has been several large fights among
inmates, who were put in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Stalder declined to say how long the state would maintain what
he termed ``operational responsibility'' for Tallulah.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Robshaw, the director of the Mental Health Association
of Louisiana, an organization that has been critical of Tallulah's
failure to provide adequate treatment for the mentally ill or
retarded inmates who make up 25 percent of the prison's population,
said it appeared that Stalder's move was simply another effort to
``forcibly get the kids in line and not at all to provide the
services these kids need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just more cause for concern,'' Ms. Robshaw said, and it
``is not a step in the right direction of recognizing that kids
need to be treated differently than adult inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robshaw said she had received reports on Thursday that
several young inmates had been badly beaten by guards over the past
few days and were covered with bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that there was a pattern
of widespread abuse at Tallulah, including regular beatings of the
young inmates, an almost total lack of education and little
attention to mental health needs. The Times also reported that
Trans-American was founded by men with close ties to former Gov.
Edwin Edwards.

RANGERS DOWN ROYALS, 8-4
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rangers celebrated another evening atop
the American League West standings.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbing trend, though, continued as the Rangers maintained
their half-game lead over the Anaheim Angels in the AL West race.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Darren Oliver cannot clear the hurdle known as the
middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, the beneficiary of a six-run advantage before stepping
on the mound for the fifth inning, recorded only two more outs
during the Rangers' 8-4 victory against the Royals last night at
Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Only the league's most potent lineup against opposing
left-handers and the league's best bullpen prevented Oliver (5-7)
from figuring in the decision. The Rangers battered Royals
left-hander Glendon Rusch (6-12) for six runs on 13 hits during his
four-inning appearance, and the bullpen pitched 41/3 scoreless
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another brief appearance by Oliver leaves questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's anything there,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said in reference to Oliver's strength and
conditioning. ``I know he's working really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It represented the eighth time in his past 11 starts that Oliver
failed to pitch a minimum of six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing strikes,'' Oates said. ``That's a positive. I'm
encouraged by him. He's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the 42/3-inning appearance represented the seventh time in
that span that Oliver's departure occurred during the fifth or
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about that,'' said Oliver, who
dismissed fatigue or conditioning as a factor. ``I didn't even know
that was the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver surrendered five hits and issued a walk during his first
four innings, but the Royals never crossed the plate. Oliver broke
finally during the Royals' four-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Jermaine Allensworth delivered a one-out double
and advanced to third on the ensuing single by second baseman Jose
Offerman. Allensworth scored on a sacrifice fly ball off the bat of
third baseman Dean Palmer, but the third out proved to be an
elusive one for Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jeff King and left fielder Shane Mack delivered
consecutive run-scoring base hits, and that signaled the end of
Oliver's opportunity at a sixth victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should have come out,'' Oliver said, ``but I'm
not the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates respected Oliver's competitiveness, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I went as far as I thought I could with him tonight. I know
Ollie was disappointed that he didn't get the opportunity at
another hitter. That's OK,'' Oates said. ``That shows he
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Xavier Hernandez, who replaced Oliver, surrendered
a run-scoring single to designated hitter Terry Pendleton before
preventing further damage and recorded his fifth victory in six
decisions with 21/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch suffered through a much more difficult evening than
Oliver. The Rangers, who entered this game hitting a league-best
.317 against left-handers, continued their assault.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Roberto Kelly, left fielder Rusty Greer and right
fielder Juan Gonzalez delivered consecutive run-scoring singles
during the third inning. Greer collected two more runs batted in
with a fourth-inning single, and catcher Bill Haselman's
fifth-inning single scored the Rangers' sixth run.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals threatened during the sixth inning by loading the
bases, but Hernandez induced an inning-ending ground ball off the
bat of King. Third baseman Fernando Tatis ranged far to his left
and retired Palmer at second base with an accurate throw. That
represented the Royals' best scoring opportunity in the final four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy's got pretty good range both ways,'' Oates said. ``It
wasn't an easy play, but it's easier for some third basemen. That's
not a routine play, but he took a good angle at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver could not reap those rewards despite a six-run advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this chicken is tough to swallow,'' he said as he
chewed on his post-game meal in the visitors' clubhouse. ``I need
something to drink.''

PARENTS JAILED IN STARVATION DEATH OF DISABLED GIRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- The parents of a severely disabled
girl were arrested on suspicion of murder and child abuse, accused
of letting the 15-year-old starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Lindsay Gentry, was 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighed
about 50 pounds when she died in early 1996, and authorities did
not suspect wrongdoing until a family friend reported that the girl
was mistreated, setting off a complex, two-year medical
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry led to the arrests Thursday morning of Kathleen
Gentry, 44, and her husband, Michael, 54, at their home in Lake Los
Angeles, a desert community northeast of Los Angeles. They were
jailed in lieu of $1 million bail each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was initially considered a natural death,'' said Lt. Ray
Peavy of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide
bureau. ``After the little girl had died and been buried, we
learned that she had been the victim of child abuse and had not
received the proper treatment. We strongly believe that her death
was caused by neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Gentry died Feb. 6, 1996, at Kaiser Foundation Hospital
in suburban Fontana, where she had been hospitalized for pneumonia
and marasmus, a condition of progressive emaciation, especially in
undernourished children, caused by a diet lacking calories and
proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Gentry discussed her daughter in an interview with the
Daily News in February, saying the complications of Lindsay's
disabilities prompted neighbors and school officials to call the
Department of Children and Family Services and file almost two
dozen abuse complaints -- all groundless -- against the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time she fell and bruised herself they said it was child
abuse,'' she said in an unpublished interview. ``I went through
this for nine years. I'm open and honest; I have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry said she deeply mourned her daughter but found solitude
knowing that the girl was finally at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry at least twice a day for her still,'' she said. ``She
was with me every day in my life. Now I know she's in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Lindsay was born 10 weeks premature, suffering from
water on the brain, dislocated hips and clubbed feet. She also
suffered from myotonic dystrophy, an inherited condition
characterized by the wasting of muscles, the formation of
cataracts, premature baldness and, frequently, mental deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The girl lost her sight when she was 6, but surgeons were
eventually able to restore partial vision, Kathleen Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of the church the Gentrys attend described them as
caring parents who are being unfairly accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolute hogwash,'' said the Rev. Alan Toyne, who
heads the House of David. ``I know them very well. They're
marvelous people, loving people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyne was at the Gentrys' home at the time of the arrests and
said he had planned Thursday night to visit Michael at the
Lancaster sheriff's station and Kathleen at Antelope Valley
Hospital, where she was taken after complaining of chest pains.

   Bulls self-destruct &QL; 
with Floyd's hiring
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO the Chicago Bulls are keeping a chair warm for Phil Jackson, and
a candle burning in the window for Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen
and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   No bull.
</P>
<P>
   I know people in high places in the NBA who believe Jackson will
indeed return to coach another year, bringing Jordan with him. No
way. When the Bulls disposed of the Utah Jazz, and celebrated their
sixth NBA title in this decade, Jackson had the look in his eye of
a guy going over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they know it, whether they intended it, the
management of the Bulls broke up the team by bringing in Tim Floyd
as Vice President in Charge of Waiting for Michael.
</P>
<P>
   See, Michael is 35, with rings on all of his fingers and one toe
and one in his earlobe. He doesn't have the patience to break in a
coach fresh from the college ranks. It would take him a year just
to teach Floyd all the secret handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Our assessment is this: As his reward for leaving Iowa State,
Floyd will get to coach Da Bulls without the Big Three, meaning he
will coach the equivalent of the Denver Nuggets. He seems like a
fine fellow, and his record indicates he knows how to diagram a
play. But his only ties to the NBA are the fishing trips he made
with his buddy, Jerry Krause, the Chicago general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan bigger than the game?
</P>
<P>
   This is in some ways a disappointment because it represents one
more break with tradition. In the old days, the owner did the
hiring and he usually selected a coach with whom he could drink and
play cards and stay up real late. The Bulls might have thought they
could pull a sneaky one with this fishing deal, because Rodman's
nickname is The Worm. But it won't work. Rodman has no influence
over Michael, and neither does anyone else except Jackson, who will
be busy this year, and perhaps longer, continuing his research into
The Meaning of Life.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael will surface again, it says here, once the NBA
settles its labor problems and decides to have a season. The
dispute is simple: The players want 60 percent of all the money,
including any that is found sticking to chewing gum under the
seats. The owners have responded by reopening their contract, but
the players do not think that ``off with their heads'' is a
responsive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   All of this intrigue is magnified by the uncertainty surrounding
Jordan. For most of our lives, we have been told no player is
bigger than the game, any game, but Michael comes darned close. It
is true a writer's judgment of an athlete is often affected by
minor factors, such as having one speak to you, or not punch you in
the face. For the past 14 years, reporters have ridden a roller
coaster with Michael, most treating him with reverence, some
tracking him like bloodhounds.
</P>
<P>
   In good times and bad, he was paid the respect given to
greatness _ the unending wonder and curiosity of the masses. Our
belief is he isn't ready to retire, because he tried it once and
didn't like it. When Michael went off to play minor-league
baseball, his decision was described as more than just another
national treasure calling it quits. His loss to the NBA was
analyzed like the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   There were Mike the Legend; Mike the symbol of the NBA's wealth
and global reach; and Mike the Growth Industry, known on Wall
Street as Air Jordan. Brokers and gypsies tried to calculate what
the impact would be on all the companies that had hitched their
wagons to his frequent-flier club. Parents and juvenile officers
across the land asked, What will become of all those kids who
wanted to be like Mike?
</P>
<P>
   Club revolves around Michael
</P>
<P>
   They learned, as all of us eventually must, that life goes on.
But, lo and behold, Michael came back, aware that he had left an
awful lot on the table. The Bulls pulled off their second
three-peat, and Michael's income went off the charts. In the
process, Chicago swept aside the Lakers, Portland, Phoenix, Seattle
and Utah. We no longer can separate his heroics, which game he won
in spite of an infected toe, a lower backache, a blocked sinus
passage.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need more fanfare or money. He needs more commotion
even less.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been hailed as the greatest basketball player of all
time. A case can be made for Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Julius Erving, Larry Bird and Bob Cousy. But they didn't dominate
the game and the marketplace the way Michael did.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he retires, Jordan will leave his audience hungry.
</P>
<P>
   For now, with the No Basketball Association in a holding
pattern, and no one able to make a deal above the table, we are
left to ponder this thought: If the Bulls had it to do over, would
they fall in love with themselves all over again?

<P>
   In a setback for the next phase of Donald Trump's huge Riverside
South project on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the federal
government has denied his application for government mortgage
insurance on $180 million of the project's costs.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who is completing the first two high-rise apartment
buildings in what is ultimately planned as a phalanx of 11
buildings along the West Side Highway, from 59th to 72d Streets,
had intended to use the federal insurance to obtain financing for
his next two buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of those buildings was to begin early next year. In
an interview, Trump said that he would still proceed with the
project and that the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development had insisted on changes in his application if it is to
be considered again.
</P>
<P>
   According to Trump, the mortgage insurance application was
denied in its current form because part of the collateral that
would have been pledged by the developer was 21.5 acres of the
project site that is to be set aside as a city park.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANIES The Cablevision Systems Corp. announced on Thursday
that its Radio City Entertainment division was acquiring the
Broadway musical ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' in a joint venture with
Ted Forstmann, the financier who is one of the show's original
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the first time a corporation has taken over a
Broadway production while it is running. The deal is also part of
Cablevision's strategic expansion into entertainment production, in
addition to its core business of entertainment distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to give the production, which opened in
November, a marketing boost through Cablevision's ability to
promote the musical on television and possibly to carry it on one
of its cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   No terms of the deal were announced. But a representative of one
of the parties to the deal, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that no cash, stock or debt would change hands but
that Cablevision would assume the financial responsibilities for
the musical and obtain all rights to it. A Cablevision spokesman
said the musical was breaking even.

</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was right for me,'' Kantor, 41, said. ``It's just a
great opportunity.''
</P>

BRUSKE PEDDLED TO PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest interesting Los Angeles Dodgers
trade, it was uncertain whether the deal or the club involved was
more surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers traded reliever Jim Bruske to divisional-rival San
Diego for minor-league right-hander Widd Workman on Thursday. The
deal marked the first time the two National League West clubs
swapped players since April 17, 1969, when Alvin McBean came to the
Dodgers for Tommy Dean and Leon Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Bruske, who pitched for the Padres in 1997, was 3-0 with a 3.48
ERA in 35 relief appearances for the Dodgers this season. Workman,
24, was assigned to Single-A San Bernardino and right-hander Mike
Judd was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque. Workman, San Diego's
1996 third round draft pick, was 8-8 with a 4.67 ERA for Single-A
Rancho Cucamonga this season.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was Tom Lasorda's third since being named the Dodgers'
interim general manager June 21. The other two included sending
Minor League Player of the Year Paul Konerko and left-hander Dennis
Reyes to Cincinnati for All-Star reliever Jeff Shaw and a deal that
sent reliever Greg McMichael back to the New York Mets for
left-hander Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda departed for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y. on Thursday and wasn't available for comment from
his hotel late that night.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Dodgers have received more for Bruske? Possibly so.
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said other clubs also were interested
in Bruske.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bruske) has done a tremendous job,' Hoffman said. ``I don't
know what role San Diego will use him in, but they really wanted
him along with other clubs. But Tommy made the decision with San
Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Darren Hall, who spoke to Bruske after the
trade, said, ``From talking to (Bruske), his feelings were good.
The way he was looking at it, he was going to a first-place team.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd was 5-7 with a 4.56 ERA in 17 starts with the Dukes this
season. Judd appeared in one game for the Dodgers last season and
pitched 22/3 scoreless innings at Colorado on Sept. 28. The
22-year-old was ranked as the third best prospect in the Dodgers'
organization by Baseball America.
</P>
<P>
   Judd hasn't worked as a reliever since before he was traded from
the New York Yankees to the Dodgers on July 21, 1996 for
left-hander Billy Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can make the adjustment, and I don't think it's that
big of a deal,' said Judd, who was scheduled to start for the Dukes
on Thursday at Salt Lake City. ``I have to go right after people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie returns: Former Dodgers batting coach Reggie Smith
returned to Dodger Stadium on Thursday for the first time since
being replaced along with bullpen coach Mark Cresse and pitching
coach Glenn Gregson on June 24. Smith, who turned down a managerial
or hitting-coach position with Albuquerque, said he was not bitter
about being replaced and wouldn't comment about his future in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was joined by kids from all over the world who attend the
``Reggie Smith Baseball Center'' in Encino. He also visited with
Dodgers coaches Joe Amalfitano and Mike Scioscia and many of the
Dodgers in the stands just north of the home dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You naturally don't like what happened, but I accept it,''
said Smith, 53, who is keeping in touch with ex-Dodgers manager
Bill Russell and former GM Fred Claire. ``If the guys are going to
get better and back on track, personally, I'm comfortable with it.
I watch the games to see how the guys are doing, and I still
believe in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable here (in the stands). I don't want to go on
the field, because I don't want anyone down there to feel
uncomfortable. That is just out of respect.''

NELSON DROPS OUT WITH ARM INJURY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An ongoing arm ailment knocked Larry Nelson out of
the U.S. Senior Open on Thursday, less than halfway through his
opening round at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Nelson, who ranks third in earnings
with $1,087,793 in 16 previous events in this, his first full year
on the senior tour. ``I've been looking forward to this tournament
ever since I found out they were going to have the U.S. Senior Open
at Riviera.''

<P>
   Nelson said the injury, which caused him to lose strength in his
right arm, was not something that happened on Thursday or in
practice rounds at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been bothering me off and on for the last couple of
years,'' said the former U.S. Open and two-time PGA champion, who
quit after hitting his drive on the eighth tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have played at 75 percent,'' he said, ``but not at 40
percent. You can't play this golf course with one arm. Nobody is
shooting under par with two (arms).''
</P>
<P>
   Local flavor: Area qualifiers Bill Brooks of Simi Valley and
Gary Klahn of Agoura Hills remained in contention to make the cut
in the wake of high scores that victimized most of the 156-man
field Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Klahn shot 81 and Brooks 83 on a day only one golfer _ Ray Floyd
_ broke par and 60 shot in the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two bad holes, but other than that I thought I played
pretty well,'' said Klahn, who competes professionally on the
Senior Series Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done pretty well there,'' he said,``and I've done a lot
of Monday qualifiers for the big tour (PGA Senior Tour). I've been
alternate three times _ in fact three of the last five weeks, so
I'm getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   This week marks Klahn's second berth in the U.S. Senior Open. He
qualified to play in Ohio in 1996 but missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a mistake,'' he said. ``This is more fun.
This is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Riviera 155, Field 1: Raymond Floyd's 1-under-par total of 70
was the only subpar round on the worst-shooting first round in the
history of the PGA Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? Thirty-nine percent of the field shot in the 80s
and three players finished in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Thursday's field average of 78.903, the highest
first-round average in a senior major was 78.440, set in the 1989
PGA Seniors' Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last, last chance: Alternate Mike Shea of Cathedral City got
word at 7:15 a.m. Thursday that he was in the U.S. Senior Open.
That was the good news. The bad news was that Shea's scheduled
tee-off time was 7:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, on site hoping for just such an opportunity, finished with
an 85 after replacing Nebraska's Charlie Borner, who had to
withdraw after injuring his back while practicing on the Riviera
driving range Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week: Some television series have not lasted as long
as ``Duval,'' which is appearing on network TV for a second
straight week. In each episode, a different member of the Duval
family plays for a national golf championship.
</P>
<P>
   This week on NBC, former club pro and second-year PGA Senior
Tour member Bob Duval can be seen contending for the U.S. Senior
Open title at Riviera Country Club. Last week on ABC, his son David
_ leading money winner on the PGA Tour _ was seen playing in the
British Open at Royal Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   The only father-son entry to have both members win major
championships was Tom Morris Sr. and Tom Morris Jr. in the pre-TV
era. Old Tom and Young Tom, as they remain known in Great Britain,
captured eight British Opens _ four apiece _ from 1861-1872.
</P>
<P>
   50-year reunion: The USGA is hosting a national championship at
Riviera for the first time since 1948, when Ben Hogan won his first
U.S. Open at the Pacific Palisades course. Hogan, who shot 276 to
win by two strokes over Jimmy Demaret, earned $2,000 for his
victory _ $265,500 less than this week's winner will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Rogers shot 295 to finish low among 39 amateurs that year,
when the field's 54 weekend survivors combined to shoot just 21
scores in the 60s during their four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan led all players with three rounds in the 60s, including a
tournament-best 67 in the opening round. Hogan, who died last year,
won four Opens and finished second in two others from 1948-56. He
is being honored at this week's championship.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday: Chuck Smith celebrated his 63rd birthday
Thursday with a hole in one on the par-3 190-yard 14th hole. Smith
hit a four-iron into the cup for his ninth career ace.

MOON, SEAHAWKS NOT TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Warren Moon says he is not trying to be
difficult, but the veteran quarterback says he is having a
difficult time understanding what he calls the Seahawks'
``stubborn'' stance in restructuring his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the media Thursday for the first time since he
failed to report to training camp Sunday, Moon sounded puzzled, a
bit dumbfounded and a little weary from the first holdout of his
21-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just kind of stonewalled us. They don't want to talk
anymore,'' Moon said from the Newport Beach, Calif., office of his
agent, Leigh Steinberg. ``They've kind of given me, `This is what
we're going to give you. You take it or you leave it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice president of football operations,
has not talked to Steinberg or his associate, Jeff Moorad, since
Sunday. Instead, the two sides exchanged letters Monday and Tuesday
in which they restated their positions and strengthened the impasse
in Moon's contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   So as his teammates were practicing in 90-degree heat and
intermittent thunder showers Thursday, Moon was making plans to
return to his home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side expected it to come to this.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues preventing a deal from getting done have been
there since the club assured Moon early in the offseason that it
would restructure the final year of the two-year deal he signed
last March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think by saying `We'll take care of you,' that they
meant making you right in the quarterback market _ whatever a
starting quarterback would make,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The club's idea of ``taking care of you'' was to offer Moon a $1
million raise from the $550,000 base salary he was scheduled to
make, plus roster and reporting bonuses that upped the deal to $2
million and another $1.6 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Moon and Steinberg took ``taking care of you'' to mean a deal
more in line with what the NFL's top quarterbacks are making. They
originally asked for a three-year deal that included a $6 million
signing bonus and now are talking about a two-year deal worth $7-8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even willing to guarantee I'll play two more years,'' Moon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller declined to discuss Moon's situation for the third
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say that's new or constructive or
will add to the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller has explained that the club can't offer Moon more
money this season because of salary-cap restrictions and won't sign
the 41-year-old quarterback to a longer-term deal if it means tying
up cap dollars in years Moon won't be on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they can't, or won't, pay me what the top guys are
making _ the $6 million or $7 million guys,'' Moon said. ``But I
just want to be paid the norm for my position. I don't want to be
paid a half or a third what the average guys are making.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moon, the impasse is not just about money. Also at stake are
his pride and his perception of what's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to arrive at a fair number, and right now it's just
not fair for where I am,'' Moon said. ``It's quite puzzling to me
that they would takePsQ !

KIKUYU GRASS PANNED BY CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it were a Spielberg movie, it might be called
``The Lost Ball,'' ``Close Encounters of a Third-Swing Kind'' or
``Color (The Air) Purple.''
</P>
<P>
   At Riviera Country Club, they call it kikuyu, or ``that bleeping
stuff,'' as one pro labeled the club-twisting, ball-grabbing grass
that makes the rough live up to its name in this week's U.S. Senior
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Jaws and you don't even have to tweak a film title to
get the real picture.

   ``It's kind of scary,'' said Jay Sigel. And he shared the
tournament lead with Hugh Baiocchi, Bob Murphy and Ray Vucinich
most of the first round after shooting even-par 71 early Thursday.

McCORD THE CARD LAUGHS ON LINKS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's something about Gary. Indeed, if not for
the fact Gary McCord is so full of life, he could be a figment of
the Farrelly brothers' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   McCord was his usual animated self Thursday, quipping and
chipping his way around the Kikuyu Monster otherwise known as
Riviera Country Club in 3-over-par 74.
</P>
<P>
   The way McCord attacked the course, baring his teeth when he was
grinning, spectators who stumbled upon his threesome could have
been forgiven for thinking McCord was in the midst of a corporate
outing, not in the thick of the hunt in the first round of the U.S.
Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   McCord, who turned 50 in May, was tied for the lead after 10
holes at even par. His name disappeared from the leaderboard after
a double-bogey seven at the 564-yard 11th, but the smile never left
his face. McCord will cheerfully tell you golf is a good walk
unspoiled, even if that trek up the hill to the Riviera clubhouse
from the 18th green is like scaling Bob Hope's nose.
</P>
<P>
   McCord has a skewed way of looking at things, as anybody knows
who has caught his act on CBS golf telecasts over the years. In his
world, fat shots are called Roseannes, putts that lip out are Mick
Jaggers, horrible lies are grass coffins and balls hit into
galleries are road kill.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not incurring the wrath of Masters officials for
saying Augusta National's greens are bikini-waxed (an offense that
got him banned indefinitely from working the tournament), McCord
usually can be found poor-mouthing his game.
</P>
<P>
   He has denigrated his skills so much over the years that he
shouldn't have been surprised by what transpired on the first tee.
McCord drew his driver back to take a leisurely practice swing and
a woman standing well behind him, on the other side of the gallery
ropes, flinched. Deadpanned McCord: ``Ma'am, I'm a professional. I
won't hit you.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to take shots at himself even after hitting a
6-iron on the final hole that landed on the front of the green and
``ran like it stole something,'' to borrow from McCord's lexicon.
The ball struck the flagstick and stopped four feet from the hole.
After kibitzing with the crowd, McCord stepped up and made the putt
for his third birdie on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Someone wondered afterward how he managed to banter with
spectators and sign autographs between shots and maintain his
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as I've played over the years,'' McCord replied, ``if I
didn't laugh about it, I'd be sequestered in a pastel room by
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, McCord is crazy like a fox.
</P>
<P>
   He first started collecting paychecks on the PGA Tour in 1973.
He had his best year in 1975 when he rode a second-place finish at
the Greater Milwaukee Open (one of two he has mustered in the past
quarter of a century) to a 59th-place finish on the almighty money
list.
</P>
<P>
   But McCord realized early on his ace in the hole wasn't any golf
stick, it was his shtick. By nature, he was golf's answer to
baseball's Spaceman, Bill Lee. McCord saw firsthand the power of
personality when he told reporters who gathered to interview him
after a good round at a tournament in Texas that he was an alien
from a planet in another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   People remembered McCord's wit long after that week's winner was
forgotten. Recognizing there were a lot of golfers with better
games but not many with more gregarious natures, McCord proceeded
to carve out his niche. McCord the player took a back seat to
McCord the personality, and a television analyst was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out real quick people don't want to hear about
birdies and bogeys and pars,'' McCord said. ``It is entertainment.
We're out here to entertain people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCord believes that holds true whether it's a microphone you're
holding or a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   He was admittedly nervous before his round Thursday, having
played very few competitive rounds this year. He could have been
forgiven for trying to block out the crowd. Instead, he drew the
spectators in. After hitting his drive at the third hole, McCord
was the last person in his group to leave the tee box.
</P>
<P>
   A marshal was holding back fans who wanted to cross the fairway.
``Let `em go,'' McCord said. The volunteer complied, saying,
``You're the boss,'' and McCord stopped and signed a couple of
autographs for people right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Five players on the Senior PGA Tour already have won more money
this year than the $662,359 McCord earned in 25 years on the PGA
Tour. But if you're looking for the early leader in the clubhouse
in fans won, that would be McCord, who is grateful for the
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 50, I thought I'd be in a rocking chair somewhere in Palm
Springs,'' he said. ``I cannot have a better life. It's perfect.''

CADET MURDER TRIAL CLOSES AS JURORS BEGIN TO DELIBERATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Jurors send home for the night. Will resume deliberations at
9 a.m., CDT, Friday.) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ In passionate closing arguments Thursday,
prosecutors portrayed capital murder defendant David Graham as an
arrogant executioner who played God to fulfill his domineering
girlfriend's demands to kill a romantic rival.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham's defenders, conceding that the former U.S. Air Force
Academy cadet covered up the 1995 slaying of 16-year-old Adrianne
Jones near Fort Worth, pleaded for a not-guilty verdict from the
five-woman, seven-man jury. Attorney Dan Cogdell said the state
coerced Graham's false confession and relied on flimsy
circumstantial evidence obtained by a ``confederacy of dunces''
known as the Grand Prairie Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The harshly conflicting arguments, following five days of
testimony, apparently caused jurors to proceed slowly with their
deliberations, which began about 4:20 p.m., CDT,
</P>
<P>
   When there was no verdict by 10:50 p.m., state District Judge
Don Leonard sent the jurors home and ordered them back to resume
their discussion at 9 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors opted not to seek the death penalty at the behest of
the victim's family. If convicted of capital murder, Graham, 20,
would automatically be sentenced to life in prison with no parole
for at least 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of extensive publicity in North Texas, the trial was
moved here from Tarrant County, where the murder occurred Dec. 4,
1995, and where co-defendant and former U.S. Naval Academy
midshipman Diane Zamora, Graham's ex-fiancee, was convicted of the
same crime and given a life sentence earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this trial, questions were raised about how blame
should be shared by the former sweethearts. Prosecutor Mike Parrish
said that in his own words, Graham described how he and Zamora
planned to kill Jones to satisfy Zamora's ``womanly vengeance''
related to Zamora's unfounded suspicion that Graham had been
unfaithful to Zamora with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told him to do it and he did,'' Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow prosecutor Michelle Hartmann described Jones as the
unsuspecting victim in a trap set by Graham and Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the sacrifice on the altar of David Graham's ego, his
cowardice, his utter lack of humanity,'' Hartmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish told jurors that it remains unclear why Graham chose
Jones to falsely portray as a previous love interest, sending
Zamora into a rage. Regardless, the prosecutors said, his
confession proved his guilt because it included details about the
murder that he could have known only if he were present.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones' family sternly watching from the packed courtroom's
front row, Parrish tediously described what he called the most
likely scenario for Jones' death. He said the tragedy began with a
phone conversation in which Graham lied to Jones, his teammate on
the Mansfield High School cross-country track team, to lure her out
of her house late one Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Graham driving and Zamora hidden in the trunk, Jones got
into Zamora's car and was driven to near Joe Pool Lake, where
Zamora emerged from hiding and struck Jones on the head with a
heavy object, Parrish said. Jones surprisingly came to and tried to
flee but was pursued by Graham, who struck her in the head with a
potentially fatal second blow and, after she collapsed, shot her
twice in the face from close range, Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   The crime went unsolved about nine months, until Zamora's
college roommate told naval authorities that Zamora had confessed
to her. Within a few days, in early September 1996, Zamora was sent
home from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and was arrested in
Texas. Graham was interrogated and arrested at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. Before their arrests, Graham and
Zamora met in Colorado and coordinated their stories, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Graham callously asked authorities to guess what
object was used to strike Jones before she was shot to death and he
asked for a written promise that the death penalty would not be
sought against him. In addition to his formal confession, he also
wrote jailhouse letters confirming his guilt, Parrish said. One
letter stated, ``Whether or not I shot someone is beside the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell urged jurors to consider lesser offenses, including
murder and aggravated kidnapping, but he mainly emphasized his
contention that the state failed to prove Graham was at the murder
scene. Instead, the state relied on emotional appeals, Cogdell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They waved around bloody pictures,'' Cogdell said. ``... It
affected you and you'd be without a heart or without a soul if it
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the state's presentation ``a Wal-Mart prosecution'' in
which jurors were asked to peruse a series of attractive yet
conflicting scenarios that never mesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, witness by witness, the state changed its theory
at least five times,'' Cogdell said to jurors. ``Every day they
wanted you to buy something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell also assailed Graham's confession, pointing out that its
very first sentence, in which Graham claimed he had a single sexual
encounter with Jones a month before her murder, was proven false by
a prosecution witness. That witness said she took Jones home the
night Graham claimed he had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a Danielle Steele novel,'' the attorney said.
``It's full of prose, it's full of pretty language, it's full of
heart-tugging memories. But what does it say about the crime? Four
sentences ... that proved to be dead wrong.''

WIDOW'S WISH TO STAY IN U.S. SPURS ACT OF CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When her husband was murdered and the INS
threatened to deport her, Korean native Jasmin Salehi faced a tough
fight to stay in America.
</P>
<P>
   She never imagined it would take an act of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what's ahead for the suburban Sherman Oaks
widow, who learned on Thursday that she was well on her way to
legal residency after a key congressional subcommittee approved a
bill written just for her by U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here. I came to make my future with my husband,'' said
Salehi, 34. ``Just simply because he was murdered, I don't want to
be kicked out of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait and wait, and sometimes you get depressed,
but I always kept a positive outlook because I didn't do anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional action comes more than two years after
Salehi's husband, Cyrus Salehi, who was an American citizen, was
shot to death. The February 1996 crime occurred after he complied
with the demands of two robbers who held up a Denny's restaurant in
suburban Reseda that he co-owned and managed.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service threatened to deport
Salehi, who was a legal immigrant, because of a rule that requires
couples to be married two years before a noncitizen spouse can
qualify for permanent residency. The Salehis had been married only
11 months at the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say it takes an act of Congress to get something
done, this is it,'' Sherman said in a phone interview from his
Washington, D.C., office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the government shouldn't compound the damage caused
by a crime. Here is someone who would be well on her way to U.S.
citizenship except for those two thugs who killed her husband. We
can't bring her husband back, but we shouldn't deprive Jasmin of
what she would have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's bill won approval Thursday from the House Subcommittee
on Immigration and Claims. A similar measure sponsored by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein was approved last year by the Senate. If the full
House approves the bill, a joint conference committee must
reconcile the two versions before sending the final one to
President Clinton for his approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman hopes the House vote will come by the end of September,
just before the INS deadline to deport Salehi. The agency allowed
her to remain in the United States to testify at the trial of her
husband's killers. Feinstein and Sherman later convinced INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner to extend Salehi's stay through
September.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's legislation, crafted just for Salehi, would set aside
a slot for her among the limited number of residence visas granted
each year by the U.S. State Department to Korean immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Only five to six immigrants win this special status each year,
Sherman said. His bill found support among three Los Angeles-area
congressmen on the subcommittee -- Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills;
James Rogan, R-Pasadena; and Elton Gallegly, R-Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key hurdle is the subcommittee, because that's the
smallest unit that's going to look at it, and so they look at it .
. . closely,'' said Sherman, whose staff worked through midnight
Wednesday preparing arguments for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee action thrilled Ralph and Francine Myers of
suburban West Hills, who have worked diligently, writing letters
and doing research on Salehi's behalf since they met her two years
ago at a crime victims support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major effort to even get it considered and put on the
(House) calendar,'' said Ralph Myers, 56.
</P>
<P>
   Today Salehi lives off the profits of her late husband's share
in the restaurant and is taking computer and graphic design courses
at the West Valley Regional Occupational Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to build my own life, my future without my husband,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what I'm going to do, but I have to build my
life.''

Policy's Exit Has 
Clark Unnerved  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ He has a new two-year contract to run the
49ers' football operation _ or will have as soon as it's signed _
but that doesn't do a thing to lift the cloud of uncertainty
hovering over the team these days.
</P>
<P>
   Like much else about the 49ers, Dwight Clark's future as the
executive vice president/director of football operations is up in
the air. Clark says he tries not to think about it, but admits he
is ``a little apprehensive'' not knowing who his next boss will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part's a little unsettling,'' Clark said Thursday in an
interview in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start thinking about the big picture and what does
this mean, it's a little scary. I don't know where I stand with Mr.
D. But I'm not up all night worrying about it. I think it will all
work out for the best, whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. D, of course, is Eddie DeBartolo, the exiled owner of the
49ers. He and Clark were tight pals when Clark was a star wide
receiver for the team in the 1980s. But Clark, who reported to
Policy in the 49ers' hierarchy, had not spoken with DeBartolo for a
couple of months before DeBartolo telephoned Tuesday night after
getting word of Policy's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his plans are,'' Clark said. ``I don't know
if he wants me to stay or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, there is an obvious question: Would Clark consider
joining Policy in Cleveland? Clark answered, ``I hadn't even
thought about it, and he hasn't mentioned anything like that to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a time of contentment for Clark. Starting
his fourth season as the team's top football executive, he will be
the first to tell you he still has much to learn. But he has grown
in the job, and he made enough good decisions last year to make it
clear he was not employed just because of his friendship with the
boss.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of contentment, there is just uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Thrailkill, the team's interim CEO, erased at least one
doubt in a two-hour meeting with Clark and chief financial officer
Bill Duffy at training camp on Wednesday: He said Clark's new deal,
negotiated with Policy and so far existing only in a memo, would be
honored by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to get that memo and put it into contract
form,'' Clark said. ``The 49ers have always, with players or with
management people, honored what they said they would do, so I
wasn't the least bit worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. He has enough other things to worry about. There
was a staff meeting Thursday to let other front-office employees
know what was going on. And soon there will be player moves on the
roster, now with no one like Policy around to serve as a safety
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach hasn't stopped churning for two days,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the players do not seem to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two great days of practice,'' Clark said. ``But
that's kind of what everyone expected. That's just the way this
business is.''
</P>
<P>
   As club president, Policy rarely interfered in the football
workings. He relied on Clark and the coaches to reach consensus,
and usually they did. Clark said, however, that it was Policy who
made the decision in 1994 to pursue free-agent linebacker Ken
Norton because of the three-pronged effect the move would have:
helping the 49ers while harming rival Dallas and sending a message
to the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a decision made on a whim, Clark said. Policy heard
everyone out _ there was a difference of opinion within the
organization _ and made the call. In the past couple of years,
however, such oversight was required less and less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years, Carmen's been very busy with other
things, and so the operation that he put into place was working
exactly like he had planned,'' Clark said. ``He wanted it to get to
the position where it was like a machine and kind of ran itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine will keep going. What we'll miss is his input into
the decision-making process and his creativity with restructuring
(contracts) and using the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clark essentially will be solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being on the spot,'' he said. ``It just sure was
nice to have somebody like Carmen, though, because he's just so
smart and he's got such a great feel for the big picture. I'm a
little nervous about it. I feel like I can get the job done,
especially this year, because this team's in place. But it's where
do we go from here in setting our plan for the future?''

FLOYD LEADS AT TOUGH RIVIERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The winter deluge worked in tandem with the sizzle
of mid-July, and as a direct result, Riviera Country Club in
Pacific Palisades has an idyllic appearance this week.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course gleamed like an emerald Thursday, as breezes
rustled the eucalyptus and sycamore trees under skies that were
bright blue until the clouds thickened in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving, though. The finest over-the-hill golfers
in the world found not tranquility but a rigorous obstacle course,
capable of raising all kinds of bruises and welts.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening day of the U.S. Senior Open, the most prestigious
major tournament of the tour, only one man, Raymond Floyd, cracked
par, and the 23 players who bunched up within three strokes of him
were grateful they'd done no worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have reasonable rounds from here, you could just knock
them down like nine pins,'' said defending champion Graham Marsh,
who was 5 over at 76. ``You can win this tournament by damn near
shooting 80 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the golf course is not playing to the point where it's
unplayable _ 78-79 stuff. It's there to be had, but you must play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd certainly did, bucking convention. He played late in the
day, when the winds were up and the greens quick. But he stormed to
consecutive birdies on Nos.15, 16 and 17 to creep into a one-stroke
lead at 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept plugging along, sometimes not hitting good shots,
sometimes hitting good shots that weren't rewarded,'' said Floyd, a
37-year pro who won the U.S. Open in 1986. In the face of this, he
attributed his solid round to patience and perseverance, which was
rewarded when ``boom, boom, boom _ I've made three birdies and I'm
under par.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd sank two putts of 12 feet on 15 and 16, then went driver,
5-wood, sand wedge to within one foot on the par-5 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Five players who shot even par are just back of him: Hugh
Baiocchi, Jay Sigel, Bob Murphy, Bruce Summerhays and former club
pro Roy Vucinich.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, a prohibitive sentimental favorite in what likely
will be this legendary player's final competitive event of the
year, produced the day's grittiest effort. Nicklaus limped around
the course, wincing frequently against the agony of an arthritic
left hip but came in at a respectable 3-over 74.
</P>
<P>
   The pain, he said, began to flare up just before he made the
turn, and his performance became erratic shortly afterward.
Nicklaus three-putted No. 15 for a double bogey, and bogeyed 14 and
18, although he did mix in a birdie on the par-5 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be patient,'' Nicklaus said. ``What am I, three
shots out of the lead? (It would be four by the end of the day.) At
this point, that's not all that terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to invoke that adjective, you had to look to ... Hale
Irwin?
</P>
<P>
   Stunning but true. The tour's defending money champion and its
leader again this year (with top-2 finishes in nine of the 13
events he's played), staggered in with a 6-over 77, equaling his
worst round since joining the senior tour three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin refused to speak to reporters afterward _ perhaps because
he had seven bogeys (five of them on the back side) and hit only
half of the greens in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association, which administers this
event, has a deep aversion to bright red numbers on the leaderboard
_ signifying under-par holes _ when a major is being contested. To
the consternation of Irwin and 60 golfers who shot 80 or worse, the
USGA got its wish on the opening day of this one.
</P>
<P>
   The most demanding challenge proved to be iron play into the
greens. The pins featured some nasty placements _ in the front part
of the greens, tucked just behind bunkers. And by early afternoon,
the greens dried to the hardness of Formica counter tops.
</P>
<P>
   Hit long and it was three-putt danger zone. Hit short and face
all kinds of aggravation getting up and down from the traps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Riviera's infamous kikuyu grass, grown to lengths of
four inches in the fairway rough, slightly longer around the
greens, grabbed club heads and wouldn't let go. ``It really hurts
your personality,'' said Sigel. ``You learn to not want to get in
there again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the conditions are exceedingly tough,'' said
Marsh. But he added quickly: ``Certainly, if you're not playing
well, the golf course is going to jump up and grab you.''
</P>
<P>
   The legion of players limited to par or worse will attempt to
loosen that grip from here on.

PARENTS JAILED IN STARVATION DEATH OF DISABLED GIRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Repeating for those needing.) 
By BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- The parents of a severely disabled
girl were arrested on suspicion of murder and child abuse, accused
of letting the 15-year-old starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Lindsay Gentry, was 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighed
about 50 pounds when she died in early 1996, and authorities did
not suspect wrongdoing until a family friend reported that the girl
was mistreated, setting off a complex, two-year medical
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry led to the arrests Thursday morning of Kathleen
Gentry, 44, and her husband, Michael, 54, at their home in Lake Los
Angeles, a desert community northeast of Los Angeles. They were
jailed in lieu of $1 million bail each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was initially considered a natural death,'' said Lt. Ray
Peavy of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide
bureau. ``After the little girl had died and been buried, we
learned that she had been the victim of child abuse and had not
received the proper treatment. We strongly believe that her death
was caused by neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Gentry died Feb. 6, 1996, at Kaiser Foundation Hospital
in suburban Fontana, where she had been hospitalized for pneumonia
and marasmus, a condition of progressive emaciation, especially in
undernourished children, caused by a diet lacking calories and
proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Gentry discussed her daughter in an interview with the
Daily News in February, saying the complications of Lindsay's
disabilities prompted neighbors and school officials to call the
Department of Children and Family Services and file almost two
dozen abuse complaints -- all groundless -- against the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time she fell and bruised herself they said it was child
abuse,'' she said in an unpublished interview. ``I went through
this for nine years. I'm open and honest; I have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry said she deeply mourned her daughter but found solitude
knowing that the girl was finally at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry at least twice a day for her still,'' she said. ``She
was with me every day in my life. Now I know she's in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Lindsay was born 10 weeks premature, suffering from
water on the brain, dislocated hips and clubbed feet. She also
suffered from myotonic dystrophy, an inherited condition
characterized by the wasting of muscles, the formation of
cataracts, premature baldness and, frequently, mental deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The girl lost her sight when she was 6, but surgeons were
eventually able to restore partial vision, Kathleen Gentry said.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of the church the Gentrys attend described them as
caring parents who are being unfairly accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolute hogwash,'' said the Rev. Alan Toyne, who
heads the House of David. ``I know them very well. They're
marvelous people, loving people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyne was at the Gentrys' home at the time of the arrests and
said he had planned Thursday night to visit Michael at the
Lancaster sheriff's station and Kathleen at Antelope Valley
Hospital, where she was taken after complaining of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Toyne said he was present when Lindsay Gentry died and that it
was obviously from natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at her bedside when she was expired,'' Toyne said. ``She
was admitted for a condition that her spine was being crushed to
her chest. They were closing together, pushing down on her lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detectives said that despite the severity of Lindsay's
disabilities, she could have survived given the proper care. During
the course of their investigation, detectives conferred with
several doctors, including a specialist from USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were great many medical records that were obtained that
had to be gone over,'' Peavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lindsay Gentry spent much of her life in the hospital
undergoing tests and surgery, her mother said the girl's condition
worsened during Thanksgiving 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stopped eating,'' Kathleen Gentry said. ``I don't know
why; she just did. I used to make her eat. She just wasn't eating
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   After her food intake was decreased, Lindsay often became sick
and eventually developed pneumonia, her mother said. She was
hospitalized in late January 1996 and died nine days later -- the
day before she was due to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to wake her up, and she was dead,'' said Gentry, who
had spent each night by her daughter's bedside. ``I blame myself --
if (only) I didn't go back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before she was admitted to the hospital, Lindsay said she
had seen Jesus, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see Jesus,'' the girl told her mother. ``He's smiling at
me.''

DODGERS FALL TO ASTROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sure, Jeff Shaw can ask for a trade after the
season. And the 32-year-old was recently traded for two of the Los
Angeles Dodgers' best young players.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, he appears to be worth it. The All-Star
reliever may be the Dodgers' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident Thursday night when the resting closer,
who had a save in each of the previous three games, watched bullpen
mates Antonio Osuna and Scott Radinsky play a major part in blowing
a five-run lead in the eighth. The Astros then scored twice in the
10th inning to win 8-6 in front of 40,205 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Mark Guthrie walked in one run in the 10th, and another
scored on an infield hit by Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the game with a three-game winning streak
and with hopes of leaving the Detroit Tigers as the only team in
the majors that had not won four straight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki entered the eighth pitching strongly
and with a 6-1 lead in hand. But the Astros cut their deficit to
6-2 when Ricky Gutierrez hit a no-out RBI single that sent Mlicki
to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was replaced by Osuna, who started strongly by striking
out his first batter and getting the second to pop out. The
Dodgers' lead, however, was put in jeopardy as Moises Alou followed
with a two-out, two-run home run that left the Astros behind by
just a pair of runs.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna didn't recover and allowed a walk and a single before
being replaced by Scott Radinsky, who was welcomed with boos by the
crowd. Despite working an 0-2 count on Brad Ausmus, the Astro
worked an infield single to trim the Dodgers' lead to 6-5 as Carl
Everett scored. And to make matters even worse, eighth-inning
defensive replacement Alex Cora misplayed an easy grounder hit by
Tony Eusebio for an error that scored Sean Berry to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrival of Shaw, the Dodgers had one of the major
leagues' worst bullpens and had 15 blown saves. Since the Shaw
trade, the Dodgers have four blown saves _ three by Radinsky
(including Thursday's) and one by Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and the Astros probably didn't expect it to go to
extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers punished Houston starter Sean Bergman with six runs
on five hits in the first inning to go ahead 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   With no outs in the first, Raul Mondesi hit a two-run triple
that scored Wilton Guerrero and Juan Castro. Gary Sheffield
followed by reaching base for the 34th time in the last 35 games
with an RBI single that scored Mondesi. Eric Karros then put
Sheffield at third base with a single.
</P>
<P>
   And then platoon left fielder Matt Luke came to the plate,
entering the game with three home runs in his last five games. Luke
added to that total with a three-run home run off a 1-0 pitch from
Bergman that gave the Dodgers a 6-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With a six-run lead in hand, it definitely seemed to be a good
night to be Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Mlicki allowed an unearned run in the third
inning to trim the lead to 6-1 when Houston's Ausmus scored from
second following a throwing error from Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Beltre. In eight-plus innings, Mlicki struck out seven and allowed
three runs (two earned) on six hits. But even this good outing
couldn't last, and the big lead wasn't enough to muster a victory
for Mlicki.

   LOS ANGELES _ Sure, Jeff Shaw can ask for a trade after the
season. And the 32-year-old was recently dealt for two of the Los
Angeles Dodgers' best young players.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, the All-Star reliever may be the
Dodgers' most valuable player and extremely noticeable even when
he's not pitching.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident Thursday night when the closer, who had a
save in each of the previous three games, watched helplessly as his
bullpen mates Antonio Osuna and Scott Radinsky played a major part
in blowing a five-run lead in the eighth inning that helped the
Houston Astros amazingly tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, reliever Mark Guthrie walked in Carl
Everett for the game-winning run in the 10th inning of the Dodgers'
devastating 8-6 loss to the NL Central-leading Astros in front of
40,205 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got some hits when they needed to,' said Dodgers manager
Glenn Hoffman, whose club's winning streak ended at three games.
``That is why you play the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who are 5{ games behind the Chicago Cubs in the
wild-card race, and the Detroit Tigers remain as the only
major-league clubs that have not won four straight games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki entered the eighth pitching strongly
and with a 6-1 lead in hand. But the Astros cut their deficit to
6-2 when Ricky Gutierrez hit a no-out RBI single that sent Mlicki
to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was replaced by Osuna, who retired the next two batters.
But Houston's Moises Alou followed with a two-out, two-run home run
that left the Astros behind by just two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna followed by allowing a walk and a single before being
replaced by Radinsky, who was welcomed with boos by the crowd.
Despite an 0-2 count, Brad Ausmus hit an RBI infield single that
trimmed the Dodgers' lead to 6-5. And the bad luck got worse for
the Dodgers as eighth-inning defensive replacement Alex Cora
misplayed an easy grounder hit by Tony Eusebio for an error that
scored Sean Berry to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrival of Shaw, the Dodgers had one of the major
league's worst bullpens with 15 blown saves. Since the Shaw trade,
the Dodgers have four blown saves _ three by Radinsky (including
Thursday) and one by Osuna. Shaw, who wanted the night off, was
available for the ninth inning if the Dodgers were ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The other bullpen pitchers) are just as capable as I am to
get guys out,' said Shaw. ``Tonight, it just didn't happen.'
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, Dodgers reliever and loser Darren Hall (0-2)
allowed two walks with one out before being replaced by Guthrie.
With two outs, Guthrie walked Craig Biggio intentionally to load
the bases. And he also walked the next batter _ Gutierrez _ to
score Everett for the game-winning run. Derek Bell followed with an
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't defense a walk,' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, the Dodgers punished Houston starter Sean
Bergman with a six runs on five hits to go ahead 6-0 on a Raul
Mondesi two-run triple, a Gary Sheffield RBI single and a three-run
home run by Matt Luke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I have a lead, I feel comfortable going to the
bullpen,' said Mlicki, who struck out seven and allowed three runs
(two earned) on six hits in eight-plus innings. ``They usually do a
great job. It was just one of those nights where there was a bloop
here and there.''!end! &QL;

Webster's Shot Sends 
A's to Painful Defeat  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ This one hurt more, a lot more, and if the A's don't
come out of their three-game drubbing against the Orioles this week
looking dazed and wobbly, it will be an amazing feat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite facing the hottest team in baseball, the A's again made
a wild, sprawling game of it before handing this one away in the
eighth when a ground ball got through defensive replacement Jack
Voigt's legs at first for a game-turning error.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt's error opened the door for the Orioles to score twice in
the eighth and tie it, and catcher Lenny Webster crushed a fat Mike
Fetters fastball in the ninth for a two-run homer to give the
Orioles a 9-7 win and a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed it up,'' Voigt said. ``I tried to be too quick. That
wasn't Fetters' fault. That wasn't Billy Taylor's fault. It was my
fault. I messed it up. Not a real great spot to have my first
(error) of the season. If there's ever a game that was a fielder's
loss, that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   So much went right in this game, despite the insane mugginess.
The A's looked stunned afterward when it was just another loss to
suck down. Ben Grieve came through with a two-run homer in the
fifth to give the A's a one-run lead, and left-hander Mike Mohler
pitched out of a mess in the sixth. The A's first three runs all
scored on sacrifice flies. But Voigt's eagerness to turn two ended
up sinking the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them where we wanted them,'' manager Art Howe said.
``We just beat ourselves. We were so close to almost getting out of
the eighth. But we gave them an extra out. We just can't seem to
dodge the bullet when we give them an extra out.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was slowed by an hourlong rain delay, which just added
to the funhouse mirror aspect of the night. Five hours after the
start of the game, close to half of the crowd of 42,371 was still
in the house, and these people were still going crazy. Every chance
they got, they rose to cheer like mad or boo like mad.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have won 13 of 14 to pull back to .500 for the first
time since May 15, and there's no question they had the feel of
destiny on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just see the confidence they have right now,'' A's
second baseman Bip Roberts said. ``They feel like the game's not
over until they say it's over. That's the kind of confidence you
have to have to win in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts singled in the fifth and came around to score, but his
most interesting moment of the night came in the third when he
thought he had struck out by swinging at a bad pitch. He was so
frustrated, he snapped a bat over his knee, a sign of how intense
the A's were about this game. Then he was called back out of the
dugout when it was ruled he had foul-tipped the ball, and he took a
called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just dizzy right now,'' Roberts said. ``It was a strenuous
game out there. The last few games have been tough. We had chances
to win and couldn't do it. It takes a lot out of your body, and
then to lose, that kind of doubles it. I'm just drained. I feel
sick right now. It's hard to come back from that. But we have to
find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the A's have to find a way to collect themselves after their
flight down to Tampa Bay to open a four-game series tonight. The
way the rain dumped on Camden Yards during the one hour and seven
minute delay that did little to cut the 90-degree heat, you thought
an act of nature was going to intervene and get in the way of the
Orioles' phenomenal drive. Not hardly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are starting to come around for us,'' said Webster, who
had a career-high six RBIs. ``That's probably the best day I've had
in the big leagues.''

Trades Shake Up Listless Giants  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The slumping Giants, who have tumbled
ferociously in the standings in just two weeks, pulled the trigger
on two blockbuster trades Thursday night that they feel were needed
to right their foundering season.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal sure to fire up some controversy, the Giants sent
right-hander Steve Reed, one of their best relievers, and
minor-league outfielder Jacob Cruz to the Cleveland Indians for
deposed closer Jose Mesa, left-handed reliever Al Morman and
one-time Giants infielder Shawon Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late Thursday night, the Giants acquired veteran
outfielder/first baseman Joe Carter from the Baltimore Orioles for
minor-league pitcher Darin Blood.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Giants also received cash from each team. They
conceivably could use that money to acquire more, higher-salaried
players before next Friday's trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone flat, and we're not going to sit around and watch
it go any further without letting something happen,'' general
manager Brian Sabean said after the deals were announced in the
wake of another loss, 8-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c,12p2  &LR;  ``The expectations on this team were much higher, and
everybody should be disappointed and embarrassed that we've gone
2-11 since the All-Star break. I don't know how you can go from 15
games over to .500 to six games over,'' Sabean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point you see enough, and when you get a mix where
you're able to introduce new blood and pull the trigger, you do it.
If not, you fade off into the sunset. I'm not going to let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Each deal has its own purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The trade with Cleveland is designed to shore up the bullpen.
The trade for Carter is to add some life to a moribund offense.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Reed has far better numbers than Mesa this year,
Sabean said Mesa should be able to pitch longer and more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to their relative styles and abilities, we need a
workhorse,'' Sabean said. ``Mesa is going to bring something
different to the table. He's a guy who can work back-to-back games,
two-inning stints. Until we resolve our starting pitching
situation, we're going to need someone like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabean also said Mesa will be used like Roberto Hernandez was
last year, setting up closer Robb Nen and even spelling Nen at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nen has done a great job, but in fairness he's only 14 innings
away from equaling last year's total,'' Sabean said. ``We're going
to need a strong finish from our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, 32, emerged as one of the game's hardest-throwing and most
successful closers when he saved 46 games for the American League
champion Indians in 1995. He saved another 39 in 1996, but just 16
last year after missing the start of the season so he could defend
himself in a rape trial. He was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 7 of the World Series last year, Mesa allowed the
Florida Marlins to tie the game with a run in the ninth inning. The
Marlins then won the championship in the 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Indians fans have booed him to no end this year, and it was
clear that he had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some great things for the turnaround of this
franchise,'' Indians GM John Hart. ``But Game 7 of the World Series
has stuck with a lot of people. It's painful to part with him, but
we just didn't see it happening for him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa lost the closer's role to Mike Jackson this season with
some terrible pitching early on. He was 3-4 with a 5.17 ERA and
just one save in 54 innings as Jackson's setup man. Not
surprisingly, he has pitched far better on the road, where the fans
don't boo him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Jose,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said, ``but I
didn't always love seeing him pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa waved away reporters in the Cleveland clubhouse after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Morman, a 29-year-old left-hander, was 0-1 with a 5.32 ERA in
just 22 innings with the Indians. He essentially will replace Jim
Poole, who was cut 10 days ago and then signed by Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston, 35, returns to the Giants after playing for manager
Dusty Baker and hitting .300 in an injury-plagued 1996 season. The
Indians signed Dunston to be their second baseman this year, but he
lost the job to rookie David Bell because of his lack of hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston was batting .237 with three homers and 12 RBIs in 156
at-bats. He will back up at short, second and in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it here, but I'm not playing,'' Dunston said after the
deal was announced. ``I'm going to a team I know, and I live an
hour from there (in Fremont). I'm tired of this trade stuff, but
this is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 32, had been one of the Giants' most effective relievers.
As the right-handed setup man to Nen he was 2-1 with a 1.52 ERA in
49 appearances. The Giants had signed him to a one-year deal last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean said Mesa was coveted by many other teams, and the
Indians would not give him up without getting Reed in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had long been rumored to be in the market for a right
fielder. Although Carter is one of the great power hitters of all
time _ his homer off Mitch Williams won the 1993 World Series _ he
is 38 and, in Sabean's words, an ``adequate'' fielder. Many
adequate fielders have looked less than adequate playing right
field at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Sabean said Carter has hit well against left-handed pitchers
and gives Baker much more flexibility in writing his lineup card.
Besides platooning with Stan Javier, Carter will likely play first
base against left-handers, who give the switch-hitting J.T. Snow
fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to playing with Dusty and Barry Bonds,'' Carter
said. ``That's going to be a thrill for me. But I like to finish
what I start. I just wish I could have done a lot better than I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter hit .247 with 11 homers and 34 RBIs for the O's, going
1-for-3 with an RBI against the A's Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is I won't have to change colors,'' he joked as
he removed his orange and black Orioles uniform for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Cleveland is Cruz, 25, who was considered one of the
Giants' best outfield prospects. He won the Pacific Coast League
batting title last year, but was not able to win a job in spring
training. He has not been able to translate his minor-league
success into a big-league job.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was hitting .298 with 18 homers and 62 RBIs for Triple-A
Fresno this year.
</P>
<P>
   The trades were finalized Thursday as the Giants were blown out
by the Cardinals. But the 8-1 score was misleading. It was 1-1
going into the sixth, when Danny Darwin walked Mark McGwire and Ray
Lankford to start the inning and both eventually scored.
</P>
<P>
   It was a two-run game with four innings left, but you knew it
was over, especially when Bill Mueller doubled and Bonds walked to
start the sixth only to be stranded there as Jeff Kent flied out,
Snow struck out and Javier grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were three-hit for seven innings by journeyman Kent
Bottenfield, who was 2-5 with a 5.03 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; st,12p2  &UR; NOTE:  &LR; Catcher Brian Johnson was placed on the 15-day
disabled list Thursday with a fractured right thumb. Catcher Doug
Mirabelli was recalled from Triple-A Fresno to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's injury is unrelated to the fracture on the same hand
that landed him on the DL May 9-20. This time, he was hurt when
Arizona's Devon White foul-tipped a pitch onto Johnson's bare hand.

NASA SETS ITS SIGHTS ON ALASKAN SHIPWRECK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ NASA scientists are preparing to hunt for a
shipwrecked whaling fleet lost more than a century ago in the icy
seas of Alaska by using the same techniques that flashed computer
signals across 170 million miles of space to steer the Sojourner
rover's historic mission on Mars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic space agency quest involves the Coast Guard's
powerful icebreaker Polar Star; a tiny underwater robot vehicle
called Phantom XL made in San Leandro, Calif.; a team of computer
scientists called the Intelligent Mechanisms Group at NASA's Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.; and a Santa Clara,
Calif., university student eager to share the adventure with the
rest of the world via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The project isn't merely a fresh demonstration of NASA's high
technology. It is also a prelude to an effort by space scientists
next year to search for signs of life using remote-controlled
underwater robots in the extreme heat of volcanic vents that erupt
beneath the sea off Antarctica _ the kind of life that might one
day await discovery on the moons of distant planets.
</P>
<P>
   The hulks of the 32 ships in the whaling fleet out of New
Bedford, Mass., have been strewn across the bottom of the Chukchi
Sea since 1871, when a violent storm trapped them in ice off a
desolate promontory aptly named Icy Cape, west of Barrow.
Miraculously, not a single life was lost, for seven other vessels
escaped the ice and rescued the trapped crews. The remaining fleet
then sailed safely to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Bates, 21, an underwater archaeology senior at Santa
Clara, encountered Jeff Ota, a research engineer at Ames who was
seeking a venture to test the technology of robotic vehicles for
undersea research _ a key element of NASA's new focus on what the
agency calls ``astrobiology.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of that meeting was the ``Jeremy Project,'' with Ota
as the project leader and Bates focusing on the effort to locate
the whaling fleet itself.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition begins next week when the Coast Guard's Polar
Star sails for Alaska. In early August, Ota, Bates and their
colleagues will carry the underwater robot Phantom XL to the ship
by helicopter from the tiny airport at Point Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Phantom XL, manufactured by Deep Ocean Engineering Inc. of
San Leandro, is only 43 inches long, weighs 100 pounds and can
cruise along the ocean bottom at 2 knots. It carries stereoscopic
video cameras developed by NASA, and its course will be controlled
using the same computer software that navigated the Sojourner robot
on Mars during the space agency's spectacularly successful
Pathfinder mission last July.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mission controllers of the Mars venture, whose
signals were transmitted through space by radio, the Phantom XL's
computer crew will send their signals through water to the robot
and receive its images via 550 feet of communication cable.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ota, the Phantom's cameras will relay detailed
stereo images of the ocean bottom in the area where the whaling
fleet sank years ago to create a ``virtual reality'' map of the
undersea environment.
</P>
<P>
   Then under the ``telepresence'' guidance from Ota and his team
aboard the Polar Star, the underwater robot will focus with
unequalled 3-D precision on the ships themselves. The ROV _ marine
scientific jargon for ``remotely operated vehicle'' _ will not be
allowed to touch the sunken ships lest the contact damages the
fragile hulks that have rested for so long on the ocean bottom at
depths somewhere between 27 and 52 feet beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The entire expedition, including images acquired by the
underwater robot, will be posted regularly on the Internet at the
project's Web site:  &LR; quest.arc.nasa.gov/arctic. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pioneering nature of the project, this is likely to
be the cheapest NASA mission ever conducted. The total cost has
been budgeted at only $31,500, with NASA contributing a mere
$7,500, plus a Silicon Graphics computer. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration is contributing $15,000, and Santa Clara
University an additional $9,000.

NEWSPAPER SERIES LINKING CIA WITH CRACK IS ASSAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-delayed Justice Department report released
Thursday found no substantiation for a newspaper's allegations that
the CIA protected Nicaraguan rebels who brought crack cocaine into
South Central Los Angeles in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The sensational charges, made in an August 1996 San Jose Mercury
News series called ``Dark Alliance,'' were later retracted by the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich, whose
office acts as a watchdog over the department's internal
operations, said investigators reviewed more than 40,000 pages of
documents and interviewed 200 people over 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, our review did not substantiate the main allegations
stated and implied in the Mercury News articles,'' Bromwich wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A San Jose Mercury News spokeswoman said that Executive Editor
Jerry Ceppos ``would prefer to report the news instead of being
part of it, and so he declines comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of the series, reporter Gary Webb, resigned from the
Mercury News in December.
</P>
<P>
   The series alleged that two Nicaraguans with ties to the
Contras, a rebel group that was trying to overthrow Nicaragua's
leftist regime, sold cocaine in South Central Los Angeles in the
early 1980s. Profits from these sales were funnelled back to the
Contras, according to the report, which strongly implied that CIA
officials knew of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The series provoked a national uproar and gave rise to fears
among African Americans that elements of the government were
deliberately sabotaging their communities by creating a crack
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report had been scheduled to be released
in December but was delayed by Attorney General Janet Reno to
protect an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich rebuked Reno for her decision to delay its release,
saying the move ``gave rise to groundless speculation that the
department was trying to suppress findings and conclusions
contained in our report that may have been damaging to the
department or may have supported the original allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich said that while ``some drug traffickers supplying
cocaine to Los Angeles drug dealers were Contra supporters, they
were investigated and pursued by the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   These investigations ``were not always successful,'' Bromwich
found, but they were not obstructed because of any connections to
the Contras or the CIA. Nor did the report conclude that the drug
dealing in question ``was the cause of the crack explosion in Los
Angeles or across the United States, as the articles implied.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report follows several previous
investigations by government agencies and Congress as well as major
news organizations, none of which could confirm the main substance
of the Mercury News' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Maxine Waters, whose district includes South
Central Los Angeles, said she will continue her effort to get the
CIA to declassify its own inspector general's report on the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't end,'' said Waters, noting that the Justice
Department report acknowledges there were connections between the
Contras and drug traffickers. ``We will continue to try and get to
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare that an investigation of this magnitude is prompted
by a series of newspaper articles,'' Bromwich said in his report.
Bromwich said he decided to spend the time and money on the
investigation ``because the allegations resonated with a
substantial number of people and fueled suspicion that our system
of criminal justice was corrupted by foreign policy considerations
in a manner that would be extremely shocking if true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich said the investigation did uncover several ``problems
and ambiguities.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these involved Julio Zavala, a Nicaraguan drug trafficker
allegedly tied to the Contras. Zavala was arrested in a case
involving drug smuggling from a Colombian vessel in San Francisco
Bay. About $36,000 was seized from Zavala's residence but was later
returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report found that a memo from a CIA
attorney suggested that depositions involved in the Zavala case
``could cause damage to the CIA's image and program in Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the CIA ``did in fact intervene in the
Zavala case and may have played a role in having a sum of money
returned to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But while such findings ``are troubling,'' Bromwich said, ``they
are a far cry from the type of broad manipulation and corruption of
the federal criminal justice system suggested by the original
allegations'' in the Mercury News.

<P>
   He did not beat about the bush. The slaughter of Russia's royal
family, including a sad little sick boy and four girls, was, Boris
Yeltsin said, ``one of the most shameful pages in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing before the royal family's coffins as they were about to
be interred 80 years after the murder, Russia's head of state
publicly took the nation's guilt on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   No semantic quibbles. No expressions of regret or sorrow instead
of candid apology and acceptance of guilt. No mitigating mention of
the czar's own weak and incompetent, if not deliberately murderous,
autocracy. Yeltsin's repentance was timely and moving.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, in a larger sense, off the point. The murder of the
czar and his family was but a tiny speck on the vast canvas of
horror painted in Russian blood for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have, on the whole, dismally failed to face up to the
truth: that millions of them, many still alive, were directly
involved, as culprits as well as victims, in the biggest and most
prolonged mass-murder of modern times; that millions more were
morally submerged in a quagmire of silence and complicity; that
millions, even today, do not wish to know what really happened, or
to acknowledge the enormity of the crimes done in the name of
communism _ and have not told their children and grandchildren what
they do know.
</P>
<P>
   And until Russians face up to their past, they will never
achieve their vaunted aim of becoming a ``normal'' country.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable, in the awful trauma of post-communist
disorientation and loss of national pride, that people should fend
off the prospect of yet more self-abasing humiliation.
</P>

   Most countries with big histories have to wrench themselves into
gazing into the darker chasms of their past: Americans about
slavery and the near-genocide of their country's indigenous
peoples, Britons about the racial arrogance and cruel excesses of
empire, Spaniards and Italians about fratricidal war and fascism,
the French about collaboration and cowardice, and Germans _ most
acutely of all _ about the Holocaust and the slaughter of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time. Moreover, Russia's evil regime was not, like
Germany's, destroyed in battle. There was no conqueror to shove a
mirror before the face of the ideologically vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mikhail Gorbachev, liberal Russian historians and
journalists began to expose the past and devastate the old ideology
of lies. But, that done, the new thirst for the whole truth largely
vanished too.
</P>
<P>
   People, it seemed, did not want to know. It was, perhaps, too
painful. And ugly untruths about the past have returned to feed
unrepentant Communists and their strange quasi-fascist bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin's presidency fades, he should build on his statement
last week that ``We must not lie to ourselves.'' He should appoint
a grand commission, perhaps headed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, to
oversee a comprehensive history of Russia's own holocaust which, in
one form or another, would be compulsory reading in every school in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he should encourage historians to spell out, in every vile
detail, the horror of Russia's past _ so that it is never
repeated. &QL;

   He did not beat about the bush. The slaughter of Russia's royal
family, including a sad little sick boy and four girls, was, Boris
Yeltsin said, ``one of the most shameful pages in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing before the royal family's coffins as they were about to
be interred 80 years after the murder, Russia's head of state
publicly took the nation's guilt on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   No semantic quibbles. No expressions of regret or sorrow instead
of candid apology and acceptance of guilt. No mitigating mention of
the czar's own weak and incompetent, if not deliberately murderous,
autocracy. Yeltsin's repentance was timely and moving.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, in a larger sense, off the point. The murder of the
czar and his family was but a tiny speck on the vast canvas of
horror painted in Russian blood for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have, on the whole, dismally failed to face up to the
truth: that millions of them, many still alive, were directly
involved, as culprits as well as victims, in the biggest and most
prolonged mass-murder of modern times; that millions more were
morally submerged in a quagmire of silence and complicity; that
millions, even today, do not wish to know what really happened, or
to acknowledge the enormity of the crimes done in the name of
communism _ and have not told their children and grandchildren what
they do know.
</P>
<P>
   And until Russians face up to their past, they will never
achieve their vaunted aim of becoming a ``normal'' country.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable, in the awful trauma of post-communist
disorientation and loss of national pride, that people should fend
off the prospect of yet more self-abasing humiliation.
</P>

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Come 2000, the state of Missouri may well have not
one but two favorite sons in the presidential race. One is Richard
Gephardt, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives.
The other is John Ashcroft, the state's junior Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Gephardt disclaims any interest in another bid for the
White House _ concentrating instead, he says, on an effort to take
back control of the House and dethrone Newt Gingrich as Speaker _
Ashcroft has all but declared his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He has already been in Iowa, favorite starting ground of
presidential contenders, scooping out ice-cream sundaes for
grateful members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Although some see him just as a more courteous version of Pat
Buchanan, the fact is that Ashcroft is fast emerging as the
consensus candidate of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   He has been all but endorsed by Pat Robertson, a televangelist
and former Republican candidate for president; and, with the
backing of the Christian Coalition, he has won the South Carolina
straw poll, beating contenders who included Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and a former vice-president, Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other Republican candidates, who put on religiosity
when it suits them, Ashcroft _ the son of a minister and a
semiprofessional gospel singer _ is a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate he has taken a vigorous part in the war on
``partial-birth'' abortions, needle-exchange programs and legalized
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   He has blocked the nomination of several candidates for federal
judgeships on ideological grounds, a tactic that even Republicans
implored him to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   He led an unsuccessful fight against the appointment of David
Satcher to the post of surgeon-general because of Dr. Satcher's
views on AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is also among the most outspoken of Bill Clinton's
Republican critics, demanding his resignation or impeachment on
grounds of immorality.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, his political career was notable less for his
achievements than for the fact that the Democrats never really put
up a convincing opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A spell as state attorney-general was followed by two terms as
governor, during which Ashcroft vetoed a bill allowing alcohol to
be sold on Sunday on the ground that one provision would have
allowed sales of alcohol-flavored sweets to minors.
</P>
<P>
   But his time in office was remarkably free of scandal. Perhaps
the most embarrassing incident was when he was caught ordering the
opening of the state library at a weekend to allow his children to
research their school projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is often contrasted with Kit Bond, his senior Senate
colleague and his predecessor in the governor's mansion. He is a
theoretician, people say, where Bond is a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent vote on NATO expansion, for instance, Ashcroft
strongly opposed expansion on principle; Bond, mindful of the
defense jobs back home, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ashcroft, too, has demonstrated flashes of pragmatism.
During his governorship, Missouri became one of the first states to
mark Martin Luther King's birthday; and when he was confronted with
a referendum to make Missouri a ``right-to-work'' (anti-union)
state, he jumped on the bandwagon that overwhelmingly defeated the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   How far will he go? Not as far as he hopes before he bumps up
against people more squeamish about the mixing of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ashcroft, the abolition of the ``marriage penalty'' from the
tax code is a crusade to preserve the sanctity of family life.
Among his latest causes is a proposal to put public money directly
into church-run welfare programs. Thus is God's work accomplished,
according to the junior senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   That gleam in the eye is liable to make many Americans nervous. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans accustomed to a continuous stream of
good economic news, recent days have been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   First a barrage of statistics suggested the economy was slowing
down, fast. The trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion in May, as
exports to Asia plummeted. Industrial production tumbled 0.6
percent in June, its fastest drop in over five years, as the
General Motors strike took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually overnight, economic pundits slashed their estimates of
output growth; some suggested that the economy might have shrunk
between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address to the
plight of the country's farmers _ hit hard by overproduction and
falling demand in Asia _ and offered federal dollars to buy up
surplus wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, struck a
different note. In his half-yearly review of the economy to
Congress on July 21, he worried more about the threat of higher
inflation than of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that Asia's woes were ``demonstrably''
restraining demand for American goods, Greenspan reckoned there was
still a ``significant'' risk of a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his concern was America's tight labor markets. He
pointed out (yet again) that the number of people working was
growing at a far faster rate than the working-age population.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot go on. To prevent inflationary wage pressure, demand
had to slow. If this did not occur naturally, Greenspan made it
clear (a number of times) that interest rates must rise.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You have reason to be, for America's economy, which
for so long has seemed neither too hot nor too cold, is
particularly tricky to interpret right now.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are several powerful forces cooling it down: the
Asian crisis, the General Motors strike, and an inventory
correction as firms reduce their stocks of unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side there are plenty of signs of heat: with low
unemployment, rising wages and high levels of consumer confidence,
domestic demand is still booming.
</P>
<P>
   The question is which factors will prove more powerful, and more
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Asia factor'' is probably the most important, and least
predictable, of the cooling elements. Economic boffins have long
promised that the region's financial woes would affect America, by
reducing demand for American exports and increasing imports as the
dollar strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   That began to happen during the first quarter of this year, when
a rising trade imbalance proved a modest counterbalance to booming
domestic demand, and its effect is intensifying as the trade
deficit widens.
</P>
<P>
   May's trade deficit caused particular alarm, partly because it
was much bigger than expected and partly because it showed a sharp
weakening of exports. Exports to Asia fell 21 percent compared with
a year ago, and total goods exports fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists reckon the Asia-inspired trade drag will
subtract up to 2.5 percentage points from second-quarter growth and
will be in evidence well beyond that, as it usually takes six to
nine months for trade flows to respond fully to economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can be certain either how big the impact will be or
how long it will last. That depends on what happens in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia effect may seem a distant concern to many Americans;
but some of them, such as farmers, are clearly suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
   The farms depend far more on exports than the rest of the
economy: around 30 percent of farm products are sent overseas,
compared with 13 percent for the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year East Asia provided a big, and growing, market.
But now a massive drop in demand from Asia has weakened prices that
were already softening from overproduction, both at home and
abroad. Coupled with disease and weather problems, this is hitting
farmers hard.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time many American farmers are learning to live with
a free(ish) market: the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act gave farmers more
leeway about switching crops, but also capped government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumble, farmers have suffered. Hence Clinton's pledge
to buy 2.5 million tons of wheat and give it to needy Third World
countries, and hence a proposal by congressional Democrats to offer
$500 million in emergency farm assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural prairies of the upper Midwest, Goldilocks's economy
has long gone cold.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, the General Motors strike, now in its
seventh week, is claiming casualties. Virtually all of the car
company's plants and many of its supplier factories stand idle.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Reserve, June's drop in industrial
production was wholly the result of the GM strike. Greenspan
expects it to have reduced economic growth in the second quarter by
half a percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike continues until September, as union leaders
suggest it could, growth will also be slowed for a further few
months. But, unlike the protracted impact of Asia's financial woes,
the GM effect is clearly temporary. Once the strikers return to
work, production will snap back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``inventory adjustment'' is another temporary brake
on growth. During the first three months of the year firms produced
more than consumers could buy, and so built up huge stocks of
unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   This growth in inventories helped to boost the GDP growth rate
to 5.4 percent in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the
opposite occurred. Firms slowed their stocking sharply, knocking
maybe three percentage points off the economy's growth rate _ a
huge shift but, again, more a rebalancing than the sign of an
imminent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Once you add together the probable effects of the trade balance,
the GM strike and inventory adjustment, it is apparent that
America's economy grew only marginally, if at all, between March
and June.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened will become clearer next week: the first
official estimates of the second quarter's GDP are due on July 31.
But certainly the figure will be much lower than the booming rate
of 5.4 percent in the first quarter, and last year's average of 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is neither surprising nor disturbing. As Stephen Roach of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter points out, every economic expansion
since the Second World War has had at least one quarter of growth
below 1 percent which did not become a serious downturn.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring (unsustainably fast) at the start of the year, the
economy is naturally and rightly slowing down. The magnitude of the
slowdown has simply been exacerbated by unexpected _ and temporary
_ factors such as the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, a sharp second-quarter slowdown will lead to a calmer
economy in the second half of the year as the Asia effect continues
to bite and domestic demand slows.
</P>
<P>
   In its new forecasts, the Federal Reserve expects total growth
this year to be between 3 percent and 3.25 percent. Unfortunately,
a natural cooling may not occur. Consumers are still spending
apace, business is investing and the housing market is bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's fear _ that all this demand will not slow enough to
forestall inflationary pressure _ is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldilocks economy may have cooled down a bit, but could
still be too hot for its own good. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ For Americans accustomed to a continuous stream of
good economic news, recent days have been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   First a barrage of statistics suggested the economy was slowing
down, fast. The trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion in May, as
exports to Asia plummeted. Industrial production tumbled 0.6
percent in June, its fastest drop in over five years, as the
General Motors strike took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually overnight, economic pundits slashed their estimates of
output growth; some suggested that the economy might have shrunk
between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address to the
plight of the country's farmers _ hit hard by overproduction and
falling demand in Asia _ and offered federal dollars to buy up
surplus wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, struck a

   WASHINGTON _ In America, the census is like a tetanus shot: one
of life's necessities you must endure every ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1790, the government has conducted a constitutionally
mandated count of Americans, which includes asking about everything
from their age and sex to, nowadays, the amount they spend to heat
their homes each year.
</P>
<P>
   In what is called ``the largest peacetime mobilization of the
American government,'' the data are collected, tabulated and used
to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and divvy up
over $180 billion of federal money among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Every census, because of its political repercussions, acquires
some political electricity; but never more so than now.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand Washington tradition of making esoteric subjects
controversial (read: partisan), the debate surrounding the proposed
use of statistical sampling in the 2000 census has become so heated
that the integrity of the entire process has been called into
question.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a fear that politics will prevent the Census Bureau
from carrying out its charge in 2000, resulting in the first
``failed'' census in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when the Clinton administration announced
a plan to move away from the ``actual enumeration'' of Americans
called for by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It argues that the size and diversity of the American population
make attempts at counting the whole lot futile, and lead to a
repeated undercount of urban minorities and Indians living on
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this, the Clinton plan wants to count 90 percent of
the population and then, from what it finds there, make estimates
about the other 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this method will allow the Census Bureau to make more
accurate predictions about those portions of the population
repeatedly missed by the census.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious problems: which 90 percent do you aim at, for
instance, and what is 90 percent of a still unknown total, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress immediately denounced the plan as
unconstitutional, arguing that the president is attempting to
create a ``virtual America'' by using an untested device in place
of the process envisioned by the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miller, a Republican from Florida who is chairman of the
House subcommittee on the census, accuses Clinton of trying to
peddle ``statistical snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the highbrow constitutional argument masks a lowbrow
political reality: many Republicans fear that sampling will yield a
higher count of minorities, who generally vote Democratic, causing
more House seats to be allocated to their areas.
</P>
<P>
   More maliciously, Republicans claim that the Clinton
administration will attempt to pressure the Census Bureau into
rigging the sampling procedure, creating instant Democrats with a
stroke of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15 the Republicans started bringing things to a head; a
House committee gave the Census Bureau only half the money it wants
for the coming budget year, with the other half contingent on
congressional approval next March. The Clinton administration may
well veto this.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides accuse each other of ``holding the census hostage''
to base political interests. If the matter is not resolved, the
fight could bring on a semi-shutdown of government similar to the
one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since census appropriations are tied to cash for the entire
Commerce Department, the State Department and the Justice
Department, a dispute over statistics could mean a shutdown of all
three departments.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republicans will probably shrink from that; the
1995 shutdown was a political disaster for them. Besides, they do
not want to be haunted by campaign advertisements accusing them of
closing the FBI in order to prevent blacks and Latinos from being
counted in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will end up leaving the matter to the courts. Newt
Gingrich, the House speaker, has brought a suit against the
Commerce Department maintaining that sampling is unconstitutional,
and the Supreme Court will decide on the matter early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the charges of corruption, Luddism and bigotry
lobbed by both sides will continue. Who would have thought that
statistics could be such fun? &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ The first hint that Vita Needle might be a slightly
unusual firm is in a job advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned by the door leading to a converted dance hall in the
Boston suburb of Needham that has served as the firm's factory for
66 years, it reads: ``Help Wanted. Light machine operators. Part
Time. Employees set own hours/days. Predominantly senior citizens.
Never had layoff. No retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita Needle is a classic family-owned success story. Having
served medical customers for half a century, it was forced in the
1980s by what its owner Fred Hartman calls ``the AIDS thing'' to
diversify into hundreds of other small niches.
</P>
<P>
   Its needles are now used to blow up basketballs, to inject sperm
whales and to embalm corpses. Its annual sales, now over $3
million, have grown by 20 percent a year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Its 35 or so workers share in its profits. And by the way, the
average age of those workers is 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, a sprightly 46-year-old, started hiring retired workers
on a part-time basis partly because they were cheap. Now he boasts
that they are harder-working, more loyal and more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Production dips a little during the summer (when workers tend to
take vacations with their grandchildren), but Vita's workers have
all been trained how to do everybody's jobs, so they can cover for
each other. They also have their own keys, allowing some to start
work at dawn to avoid the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vita is far from being merely a meeting place for old folk;
it wins business by being speedier and cheaper than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Vita Needle will be a little less unusual. American
managers are used to hearing about Europe's greying work force, but
few realize that they face a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Every eight seconds somebody in America turns 50. The oldest of
America's 76 million baby boomers (the generation born between 1946
and 1964) will reach 55 in 2001. By 2025 the whole of America will
be as grey as Florida, the country's retirement home, is today.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the work force more than 20 years ahead rely
on assumptions about such things as immigration that can easily
prove wrong. Shorter-term estimates, however, are more reliable;
and they say that by 2005 the American work force will include 27
million people aged between 50 and 59, compared with 20 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers over 65 has edged up during the past
decade, from 3 million to 3.8 million; it should rise to 4.3
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of workers aged 25-44 is falling.
The median age of the work force will be over 40 by 2005; it was
34.7 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms that rely on young workers are already feeling the
pinch: McDonald's, for instance, is reckoned to have an average of
five ``senior helpers'' in every restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical example is a client of Watson Wyatt, a firm of
personnel consultants. The company's average age will be above 40
by 2001, and Eric Lofgren of Watson Wyatt points out that its big
bulge of baby-boom workers will then still have a decade left
before they retire. So the average age is set to rise year by year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bulge is often the result of recent downsizing. Many of
the workers laid off in the past decade were over 50 _ from the
smaller ``Eisenhower'' generation that preceded the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, including Lockheed Martin, have had to pay up in a
number of discrimination cases brought by older workers whom they
fired. Most large companies now employ relatively few people over
55, and those that still have lots _ such as General Motors _ are
trying hard to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries aging baby boomers may find themselves
ejected as well. The director of one American bank recalls that
``the machine guns started firing on day one (after a recent
merger), with anyone over 50 in the front rank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, nobody expects the baby boomers to suffer in
the same way as the Eisenhower generation. There are simply too
many of them; and there are also too few younger workers to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   The once fashionable idea that boomers will quit their jobs to
``discover themselves'' or to pursue new careers is hokum. Polls
show that most baby boomers expect to be working past 65; and they
also seem to be ``nesting'' at their current firms.
</P>
<P>
   According to Watson Wyatt, the average length of job tenure in
America has crept up from 12.3 years in the early 1990s to 13.1
years today.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few companies seem to have awakened to the challenge of
having a much older work force. Many have taken contradictory
approaches, picking on older workers for redundancies, but at the
same time increasing efforts to hire mature workers with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Vita Needle shows, an older work force can bring its own
bonuses. A recent report by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, another
consultancy, hailed the over-55s as the ``new workaholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their propensity for hard work is partly down to fear (all that
downsizing that got their friends); and partly because they do not
need to rush home to children in the evenings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a more elderly work force is likely to cost more in at least
three ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay and benefits. Once workers reach about 42, the cost of
their health-care coverage starts rising dramatically. In most
firms, both pay and holidays also tend to go up with seniority. And
older workers save about three times as much as younger ones in
their pension plans; if a company matches contributions, as many
do, they again face higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workplace safety. People over 65 have half as many accidents
at work as their younger and more careless colleagues. But they are
much more fragile. Older workers take longer to recover and are
more likely to die of job-related injuries. Many jobs may therefore
have to be redesigned if they are to be done by older people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee mobility. American companies are used to having a
mobile work force that can be sent just about anywhere. As workers
get older, however, they put down firmer roots. Vita was offered a
cheaper, more modern factory 20 miles away. If Hartman had taken
it, half his work force would have left.
</P>
<P>
   If an older work force simply meant increased costs, then
managers could take comfort from the fact that most of their
competitors would be in the same boat. However, greyer employees
also present more subtle management challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest may be to do with career paths. Despite some
delayering and a lot of guff about horizontal management, most
American businesses are still pyramid-shaped: the longer you stay,
the higher you rise.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age, they will create increasingly top-heavy
structures. Organizations may take on more of an egg-timer shape,
with people rising quickly in their 30s and 40s, and then rejoining
the wider work force for the final third of their career.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms _ such as Hewlett-Packard _ have managed to persuade
older people to take jobs that do not involve running things.
</P>
<P>
   The greying work force may also change the balance of power
between employers and employees. Incomes for young workers have
barely budged in the past decade, but as young workers become
harder to find they will demand more pay and security.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the growing demand for what Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas calls ``un-retirees'' _ older workers who can be coaxed
back to work _ is likely to give aging baby boomers more confidence
to walk away from jobs that they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms already go to considerable lengths to hang on to
senior staff. Finding and training a replacement typically costs
about 55 percent of a departing employee's annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon recently boasted that all the 2,700 engineers it had to
sack from its defense arm were offered at least one other job by
another part of the company. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its own unusual way, Vita Needle proves that by changing a
little to accommodate an older work force _ being more flexible
about working hours, tolerating older people's technophobia (the
fax machine has been accepted, but computerization is still at
least a year away) and, above all, stressing trust _ it is possible
to gain a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a note on the company's wall says: ``Remember, old people are
worth a fortune _ with silver in their hair, gold in their teeth,
stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet and gas in their
stomachs.'' &QL;

34.7 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms that rely on young workers are already feeling the
pinch: McDonald's, for instance, is reckoned to have an average of
five ``senior helpers'' in every restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical example is a client of Watson Wyatt, a firm of
personnel consultants. The company's average age will be above 40
by 2001, and Eric Lofgren of Watson Wyatt points out that its big
bulge of baby-boom workers will then still have a decade left
before they retire. So the average age is set to rise year by year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bulge is often the result of recent downsizing. Many of
the workers laid off in the past decade were over 50 _ from the
smaller ``Eisenhower'' generation that preceded the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, including Lockheed Martin, have had to pay up in a
number of discrimination cases brought by older workers whom they
fired. Most large companies now employ relatively few people over
55, and those that still have lots _ such as General Motors _ are
trying hard to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries aging baby boomers may find themselves
ejected as well. The director of one American bank recalls that
``the machine guns started firing on day one (after a recent
merger), with anyone over 50 in the front rank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, nobody expects the baby boomers to suffer in
the same way as the Eisenhower generation. There are simply too
many of them; and there are also too few younger workers to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   The once fashionable idea that boomers will quit their jobs to
``discover themselves'' or to pursue new careers is hokum. Polls
show that most baby boomers expect to be working past 65; and they
also seem to be ``nesting'' at their current firms.
</P>
<P>
   According to Watson Wyatt, the average length of job tenure in
America has crept up from 12.3 years in the early 1990s to 13.1
years today.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few companies seem to have awakened to the challenge of
having a much older work force. Many have taken contradictory
approaches, picking on older workers for redundancies, but at the
same time increasing efforts to hire mature workers with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Vita Needle shows, an older work force can bring its own
bonuses. A recent report by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, another
consultancy, hailed the over-55s as the ``new workaholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their propensity for hard work is partly down to fear (all that
downsizing that got their friends); and partly because they do not
need to rush home to children in the evenings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a more elderly work force is likely to cost more in at least
three ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay and benefits. Once workers reach about 42, the cost of
their health-care coverage starts rising dramatically. In most
firms, both pay and holidays also tend to go up with seniority. And
older workers save about three times as much as younger ones in
their pension plans; if a company matches contributions, as many
do, they again face higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workplace safety. People over 65 have half as many accidents
at work as their younger and more careless colleagues. But they are
much more fragile. Older workers take longer to recover and are
more likely to die of job-related injuries. Many jobs may therefore
have to be redesigned if they are to be done by older people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee mobility. American companies are used to having a
mobile work force that can be sent just about anywhere. As workers
get older, however, they put down firmer roots. Vita was offered a
cheaper, more modern factory 20 miles away. If Hartman had taken
it, half his work force would have left.
</P>
<P>
   If an older work force simply meant increased costs, then
managers could take comfort from the fact that most of their
competitors would be in the same boat. However, greyer employees
also present more subtle management challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest may be to do with career paths. Despite some
delayering and a lot of guff about horizontal management, most
American businesses are still pyramid-shaped: the longer you stay,
the higher you rise.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age, they will create increasingly top-heavy
structures. Organizations may take on more of an egg-timer shape,
with people rising quickly in their 30s and 40s, and then rejoining
the wider work force for the final third of their career.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms _ such as Hewlett-Packard _ have managed to persuade
older people to take jobs that do not involve running things.
</P>
<P>
   The greying work force may also change the balance of power
between employers and employees. Incomes for young workers have
barely budged in the past decade, but as young workers become
harder to find they will demand more pay and security.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the growing demand for what Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas calls ``un-retirees'' _ older workers who can be coaxed
back to work _ is likely to give aging baby boomers more confidence
to walk away from jobs that they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms already go to considerable lengths to hang on to
senior staff. Finding and training a replacement typically costs
about 55 percent of a departing employee's annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon recently boasted that all the 2,700 engineers it had to
sack from its defense arm were offered at least one other job by
another part of the company. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its own unusual way, Vita Needle proves that by changing a
little to accommodate an older work force _ being more flexible
about working hours, tolerating older people's technophobia (the
fax machine has been accepted, but computerization is still at
least a year away) and, above all, stressing trust _ it is possible
to gain a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a note on the company's wall says: ``Remember, old people are
worth a fortune _ with silver in their hair, gold in their teeth,
stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet and gas in their
stomachs.'' &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ The first hint that Vita Needle might be a slightly
unusual firm is in a job advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned by the door leading to a converted dance hall in the
Boston suburb of Needham that has served as the firm's factory for
66 years, it reads: ``Help Wanted. Light machine operators. Part
Time. Employees set own hours/days. Predominantly senior citizens.
Never had layoff. No retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita Needle is a classic family-owned success story. Having
served medical customers for half a century, it was forced in the
1980s by what its owner Fred Hartman calls ``the AIDS thing'' to
diversify into hundreds of other small niches.
</P>
<P>
   Its needles are now used to blow up basketballs, to inject sperm
whales and to embalm corpses. Its annual sales, now over $3
million, have grown by 20 percent a year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Its 35 or so workers share in its profits. And by the way, the
average age of those workers is 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, a sprightly 46-year-old, started hiring retired workers
on a part-time basis partly because they were cheap. Now he boasts
that they are harder-working, more loyal and more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Production dips a little during the summer (when workers tend to
take vacations with their grandchildren), but Vita's workers have
all been trained how to do everybody's jobs, so they can cover for
each other. They also have their own keys, allowing some to start
work at dawn to avoid the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vita is far from being merely a meeting place for old folk;
it wins business by being speedier and cheaper than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Vita Needle will be a little less unusual. American
managers are used to hearing about Europe's greying work force, but
few realize that they face a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Every eight seconds somebody in America turns 50. The oldest of
America's 76 million baby boomers (the generation born between 1946
and 1964) will reach 55 in 2001. By 2025 the whole of America will
be as grey as Florida, the country's retirement home, is today.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the work force more than 20 years ahead rely
on assumptions about such things as immigration that can easily
prove wrong. Shorter-term estimates, however, are more reliable;
and they say that by 2005 the American work force will include 27
million people aged between 50 and 59, compared with 20 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers over 65 has edged up during the past
decade, from 3 million to 3.8 million; it should rise to 4.3
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of workers aged 25-44 is falling.
The median age of the work force will be over 40 by 2005; it was
34.7 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms that rely on young workers are already feeling the

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A penchant for wrapping everything in plastic and then
burning the trash indiscriminately has turned Japan into the dioxin
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemicals that are known to
cause birth defects, skin disease and cancer, are produced when
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other plastic waste is burned at
temperatures below 700 degrees celsius.
</P>
<P>
   So toxic is dioxin that a dose no bigger than a single grain of
salt can kill a man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Nicholas Smith, from the Tokyo office of
Jardine Fleming, a stockbroking firm, found that more than 100 of
the 1,500 or so incinerators in Japan failed to meet the country's
(already lax) dioxin emissions criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese law allows 80 billionths of a gram of dioxin per cubic
meter of air _ 800 times greater than typical standards in Western
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight incinerators in Japan actually meet the international
norm. And one, in Hyogo, continues to spew out dioxin at 10,000
times the concentration allowed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All that poison floating around in the air may pass unnoticed.
But when it falls to earth and contaminates the soil and
groundwater, it becomes harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   A wake-up call for Japanese industry _ on the scale of the Love
Canal incident in America in 1980 _ came in April when the soil
surrounding an incinerator in Nosecho, a residential suburb north
of Osaka, was found to contain a staggering 8,500 picograms of
dioxin per gram of soil.
</P>
<P>
   This has given Nosecho the unpleasant distinction of having the
highest recorded dioxin concentration in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the toxic waste that contaminated the soil at
Love Canal in New York state prodded the American Congress into
establishing a trust fund (the ``Superfund'') _ financed by a levy
on the oil and chemical industries _ to clean up such sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Nosecho has focused public anger on industrial
polluters in Japan. Rather than being hauled over the coals,
sensible firms have started to publish ugly details about the
frightening condition of some of their sites.
</P>
<P>
   First to come clean was Toshiba. In early June, the electrical
group reported illegally high levels of a carcinogen,
trichlorethylene _ an industrial cleaning agent that is believed to
cause kidney and liver damage as well as cancer _ in the
groundwater beneath four of its domestic factories.
</P>
<P>
   The company carried out on-site inspections of all its 25 plants
in Japan after detecting trichlorethylene levels at 15,600 times
the permitted level at a factory in Nagoya last October.
</P>
<P>
   Having found similar levels of the toxic waste outside the
plant, the local government is checking the health of residents in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Next a consumer-electronics giant, Matsushita, reported harmful
carcinogen levels in the groundwater beneath four of its factories
in the Osaka area.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the cancer agent tetrachlorethylene _ used for
cleaning semiconductors _ at one of the plants was 9,400 times the
permissible limit. At another plant, in Hokkaido, the groundwater
contamination was 5,200 times the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The company suspects that the groundwater beneath 80 of its 112
plants in Japan may be contaminated with harmful compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have come to light more than a year after Japan's
amended Water Pollution Prevention Act came into effect. But the
recent rush to reveal all has been prompted as much by the
``Nosecho effect'' as by the retroactive nature of the legislation,
which forces the original polluter to clean up an affected site.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces are at work, too. Japanese manufacturers have been
adopting the international ISO14,000 standard of environmental good
housekeeping faster than those of any other country.
</P>
<P>
   By February, some 730 industrial sites in Japan had become fully
compliant, compared with 525 in Britain and a mere 110 in America.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Japanese plants that have complied with the new ISO
standard are in the electronics sector. Being top exporters,
Japanese electronics firms have been understandably nervous about
having their goods barred from countries that are signatories to
the ISO14,000 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To be awarded the ISO seal of approval means making fundamental
changes in the way a plant is managed, with strict planning,
implementing, checking and reporting systems put in place. It is
these, as much as anything, that are encouraging Japanese firms to
clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is creating a handy new line of business for
Japan's environmental-protection industry. Soil remediation in
particular is seen as having huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   Kurita Water Industries, one of Japan's leading
environmental-engineering firms, started building its soil
remediation skills over a decade ago. It has carried out more than
400 surveys and soil purification schemes to date.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan's filthy incinerators, the remedial business could
be even more promising. Jardine Fleming's Smith reckons that
rebuilding all the faulty incinerators in Japan could cost a
whopping YEN 9.2 trillion ($66 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the opportunities currently being exploited by
the cleanup industry in Japan are merely the tip of an iceberg. Now
that two of the country's most respected industrial names, Toshiba
and Matsushita, have voluntarily surveyed their sites for toxic
problems _ and gone public with their findings _ many more Japanese
companies are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for them to do so is increasing as they shut old
smokestack factories and redevelop the land for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedial work is not just required at big manufacturers.
The Environment Agency of Japan points to the plethora of small
plating shops as the country's worst offender in terms of toxic
waste, followed (surprisingly) by dry cleaners, hairdressers and
public bath houses. Big industries such as chemicals and
electronics follow close behind.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a fraction of the small backstreet offenders have
had their land surveyed. There is still a lot of nasty stuff out
there in the Japanese soil. And an awful lot of work will be needed
to clean it up. &QL;

   TOKYO _ A penchant for wrapping everything in plastic and then
burning the trash indiscriminately has turned Japan into the dioxin
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemicals that are known to
cause birth defects, skin disease and cancer, are produced when
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other plastic waste is burned at
temperatures below 700 degrees celsius.
</P>
<P>
   So toxic is dioxin that a dose no bigger than a single grain of
salt can kill a man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Nicholas Smith, from the Tokyo office of
Jardine Fleming, a stockbroking firm, found that more than 100 of
the 1,500 or so incinerators in Japan failed to meet the country's
(already lax) dioxin emissions criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese law allows 80 billionths of a gram of dioxin per cubic
meter of air _ 800 times greater than typical standards in Western
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight incinerators in Japan actually meet the international
norm. And one, in Hyogo, continues to spew out dioxin at 10,000
times the concentration allowed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All that poison floating around in the air may pass unnoticed.
But when it falls to earth and contaminates the soil and
groundwater, it becomes harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   A wake-up call for Japanese industry _ on the scale of the Love
Canal incident in America in 1980 _ came in April when the soil
surrounding an incinerator in Nosecho, a residential suburb north
of Osaka, was found to contain a staggering 8,500 picograms of
dioxin per gram of soil.
</P>
<P>
   This has given Nosecho the unpleasant distinction of having the
highest recorded dioxin concentration in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the toxic waste that contaminated the soil at
Love Canal in New York state prodded the American Congress into
establishing a trust fund (the ``Superfund'') _ financed by a levy
on the oil and chemical industries _ to clean up such sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Nosecho has focused public anger on industrial
polluters in Japan. Rather than being hauled over the coals,
sensible firms have started to publish ugly details about the
frightening condition of some of their sites.
</P>
<P>
   First to come clean was Toshiba. In early June, the electrical
group reported illegally high levels of a carcinogen,
trichlorethylene _ an industrial cleaning agent that is believed to
cause kidney and liver damage as well as cancer _ in the
groundwater beneath four of its domestic factories.
</P>
<P>
   The company carried out on-site inspections of all its 25 plants
in Japan after detecting trichlorethylene levels at 15,600 times
the permitted level at a factory in Nagoya last October.
</P>
<P>
   Having found similar levels of the toxic waste outside the
plant, the local government is checking the health of residents in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Next a consumer-electronics giant, Matsushita, reported harmful
carcinogen levels in the groundwater beneath four of its factories
in the Osaka area.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the cancer agent tetrachlorethylene _ used for
cleaning semiconductors _ at one of the plants was 9,400 times the
permissible limit. At another plant, in Hokkaido, the groundwater
contamination was 5,200 times the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The company suspects that the groundwater beneath 80 of its 112
plants in Japan may be contaminated with harmful compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have come to light more than a year after Japan's
amended Water Pollution Prevention Act came into effect. But the
recent rush to reveal all has been prompted as much by the
``Nosecho effect'' as by the retroactive nature of the legislation,
which forces the original polluter to clean up an affected site.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces are at work, too. Japanese manufacturers have been
adopting the international ISO14,000 standard of environmental good
housekeeping faster than those of any other country.
</P>
<P>
   By February, some 730 industrial sites in Japan had become fully
compliant, compared with 525 in Britain and a mere 110 in America.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Japanese plants that have complied with the new ISO
standard are in the electronics sector. Being top exporters,
Japanese electronics firms have been understandably nervous about
having their goods barred from countries that are signatories to
the ISO14,000 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To be awarded the ISO seal of approval means making fundamental
changes in the way a plant is managed, with strict planning,
implementing, checking and reporting systems put in place. It is
these, as much as anything, that are encouraging Japanese firms to
clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is creating a handy new line of business for
Japan's environmental-protection industry. Soil remediation in
particular is seen as having huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   Kurita Water Industries, one of Japan's leading
environmental-engineering firms, started building its soil
remediation skills over a decade ago. It has carried out more than
400 surveys and soil purification schemes to date.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan's filthy incinerators, the remedial business could
be even more promising. Jardine Fleming's Smith reckons that
rebuilding all the faulty incinerators in Japan could cost a
whopping YEN 9.2 trillion ($66 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the opportunities currently being exploited by
the cleanup industry in Japan are merely the tip of an iceberg. Now
that two of the country's most respected industrial names, Toshiba
and Matsushita, have voluntarily surveyed their sites for toxic
problems _ and gone public with their findings _ many more Japanese
companies are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for them to do so is increasing as they shut old
smokestack factories and redevelop the land for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedial work is not just required at big manufacturers.
The Environment Agency of Japan points to the plethora of small
plating shops as the country's worst offender in terms of toxic
waste, followed (surprisingly) by dry cleaners, hairdressers and
public bath houses. Big industries such as chemicals and
electronics follow close behind.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a fraction of the small backstreet offenders have
had their land surveyed. There is still a lot of nasty stuff out
there in the Japanese soil. And an awful lot of work will be needed
to clean it up. &QL;

   The best things come in small packages: apart from breasts, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slender and toned the rest of a woman's body may
be, a huge pair of bazongas stuck on the front is still the ideal:
witness Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Anna Nicole Smith, Jane Fonda
etc.
</P>
<P>
   And while slim hips and voluptuous bosoms tend not to coincide
in nature, a couple of bagfuls of silicone do the job _ these days
for less than the cost of a secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   What the novelist Jay McInerny has elegantly dubbed ``party
tits'' have become so widespread as to not raise an eyebrow in the
States over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, the number of people who approved of plastic surgery
increased by 50 percent between 1982 and 1992, while the number who
disapproved fell by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women in the public eye it is not so much a question of
whether or not to be ``enhanced'' as when to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bosom seems to have few allies. Last week, an
official British government enquiry into silicone breast implants
(banned in the U.S. since 1992) concluded that they are safe and
that surgeons can be allowed to continue using them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Britain's Great Page Three Silicone Debate, Sun
newspaper readers voted overwhelmingly to ban fake breasts on Page
Three; but the enhanced are still more than welcome on all the
other pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar spirit, American publisher Norm Zadeh launched a
glamor magazine called Perfect Ten, which only features
flesh-and-blood chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want readers to know what real breasts look like, because
they've forgotten,'' explained the helpful Norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think when a woman lies down, her breasts are supposed to
stand straight up, like rockets ready for launch.'' The magazine,
however, has not been a huge money-spinner.
</P>
<P>
   Now a rearguard action is being fought. Millions of pounds worth
of compensation has already been paid out to British women who
allege that leaking implants have damaged their health and consumer
groups such as Survivors of Silicone continue to lobby against
``party tits.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Haiken, author of ``Venus Envy,'' a history of
cosmetic surgery, argues spiritedly against using the surgeon's
knife as a beauty aid; novelist Joanna Briscoe also comes down hard
on surgery in her latest novel, ``Skin,'' which gives graphic
accounts of an aging beauty's lifetime under the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have breast implants to please themselves may not find
that it is as life-changing a step as they hoped. Dr. Gillian
Butler, consultant clinical psychologist and co-author of ``Manage
Your Mind,'' warns about ``overvalued ideas about body shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's role models for women, she says, ``are all a particular
weight and shape. This has a very poor effect on self-esteem. Women
fall into the trap of thinking, `If my body is right, everything
will be right,' and of course it simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And women who have implants to please men may likewise be
wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are far less discerning than women take them for,'' says
Phil Hilton, editor of Men's Health magazine. ``Men think all
breasts are good and are delighted to have access to any at all.
The idea that they are connoisseurs is inaccurate. There's no need
for operations and scars and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the British government enquiry that has cleared
silicone implants recommends that stringent guidelines should be
laid down for practitioners; Professor David Sharpe, president of
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, observed
that some clinics' sales techniques ``were more attuned to double
glazing than surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sharpe himself has expressed doubts about breast
implants _ not on safety grounds, but on cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have small breasts are somehow seen as less
attractive,'' he observes. ``That is an indictment of society.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``If they asked you to put your hand in the fire I suppose you'd
do it?'' your mother always sighed. Well if you are a trainee at
one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Seven trainees at Eagle Life Star were hospitalized after a
daylong ``motivational course'' at a hotel near the company's
headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of problem-solving games, trainees removed their
socks and shoes and were invited, for the final exercise, to walk
on a bed of hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Star Life said a ``full and frank internal inquiry'' was
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of motivational weekends. What is it about
management theorists that they think if you have not spent a
weekend together learning how to get from one side of the room to
the other without touching the floor, or energetically paintballing
each other in the countryside, then your company will never make
the Fortune 500 list?
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind such courses is that workers should learn more
about each other, learn to trust their colleagues and become highly
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can be that people end up injured, humiliated or
falling out, and the majority of the bonding happens in the pub _
just like a normal weekday.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Eagle Life, was keen to point out
that the firewalking was the culmination of seven months of
training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

that the firewalking was the culmination of seven months of
training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

   ``If they asked you to put your hand in the fire I suppose you'd
do it?'' your mother always sighed. Well if you are a trainee at
one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Seven trainees at Eagle Life Star were hospitalized after a
daylong ``motivational course'' at a hotel near the company's
headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of problem-solving games, trainees removed their
socks and shoes and were invited, for the final exercise, to walk
on a bed of hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Star Life said a ``full and frank internal inquiry'' was
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of motivational weekends. What is it about
management theorists that they think if you have not spent a
weekend together learning how to get from one side of the room to
the other without touching the floor, or energetically paintballing
each other in the countryside, then your company will never make
the Fortune 500 list?
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind such courses is that workers should learn more
about each other, learn to trust their colleagues and become highly
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can be that people end up injured, humiliated or
falling out, and the majority of the bonding happens in the pub _
just like a normal weekday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is a cultural encounter that foreshadows the
future of the United States _ but white America is so far taking
precious little notice.
</P>
<P>
   In its gleaming new convention center that sits right across
from the restored Amish market, this quintessentially WASP city of
William Penn is hosting upwards of 15,000 representatives of the
National Council of La Raza, the country's biggest organization of
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic delegates are conspicuous in a city center that
normally bustles with white and black. In the long corridors of the
convention center, there is a subdued air of Latin festivity and
the quiet buzz of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   From the mainstream U.S. media, however, you would hardly know
that the Hispanics were around _ a point that rankles perpetually
with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics have been quietly advancing and earning a place in
this country in a way that is not always understood in many of the
cities of the nation. And Philadelphia, we are afraid, may well be
one of them,'' said a bilingual editorial in Al Dia, one of the
region's clutch of Spanish-language newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   An article in Hispanic magazine put it more emotively: ``We are
_ whether we like it or not _ in the midst of the Hispanization of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the America's fastest-growing ethnic minority.
Currently numbering around 30 million (11 percent), they are
expected to overtake the number of blacks within seven years.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2050, but probably before, Hispanics will comprise
more than 25 percent of the U.S. population and their growth will
be the main reason why, by that date, white Americans will find
themselves just another minority in the country they have regarded
for more than two centuries as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The vast implications of this demographic shift _ especially for
white Americans _ have hardly begun to be addressed, although they
lay at the heart of President Clinton's year-old initiative on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Where the population at large fears to tread, however, business
and _ more tentatively _ politics, are starting to venture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition hall in the Philadelphia convention center is
crowded with exhibitors, more than 500 in all, from department
store chains to car manufacturers, from community action groups to
health and housing watchdogs, all courting the burgeoning Hispanic
market.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker at lunch Monday was the first lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother is standing for political office in Florida, one of
seven states where the Hispanic minority has electoral clout, so
`name recognition' is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker is the mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani,
in what is billed his ``first major address to a national Latino
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani does not need their votes _ he was reelected by a
landslide last year. The Republicans, on the other hand, do, as
they look to this autumn's midterm congressional elections and the
presidential race in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Their standing with Hispanic voters has been severely harmed by
California's anti-immigration measures which led, in the words of a
Republican consultant's report, to the ``utter collapse of the
Hispanic vote'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both parties must consider one salient fact of
political life. As early as the next presidential election, the
Hispanic constituency will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The big states of Texas and California, with 86 electoral
college votes between them, are already 25 percent Hispanic.
Hispanics are significant minorities also in Florida, Arizona, New
Mexico, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why there is now a rush by both parties to have
some sort of Hispanic representation on their presidential ticket
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the question has been when or whether it
would be politically decisive to have a black or a woman on the
ticket. Now, there is speculation that Bill Richardson, a former
senator from New Mexico who is about to go from the ambassadorship
of the U.N. to the post of Energy Secretary, is being considered as
a possible running mate for Al Gore for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's mother is Mexican, he is bilingual and popular with
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former president, present Governor of
Texas and a favored Republican candidate, has been assiduously
wooing Hispanic voters, helped by a Mexican sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Those who object that Hispanics cannot be treated as a
homogeneous ethnic minority or even as a solid voting block have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanics of California and Texas are predominantly recent
immigrants from Mexico and Central America and their families;
their opposition to tougher restrictions on immigration and
benefits has pushed them into the arms of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where the bias is towards Cuban exiles, with strong
anti-Castro sentiments, the vote has been Republican. In New
Mexico, where Hispanics constitute almost 40 percent of the
population, political sympathies are less clearly differentiated.
</P>
<P>
   At the La Raza convention this week, Hispanics are going out of
their way to present themselves as responsible and successful
Americans, a minority that has the highest male employment rate and
some of the best health indicators of any in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the monolingual mainstream, however, of a sizeable
minority that speaks a different language has yet to be gauged. In
California and Texas, it has already caused tension, with
California withdrawing funds for bilingual education, and Texas
employers dismissing workers who persist in speaking Spanish
between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic mix in those states today is that of America in 50
years' time. &QL;

<P>
   Up, down or sideways for U.S. interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Alan Greenspan started his twice-a-year Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to U.S. Congress. It is an event which has taken on
enormous significance _ probably far too much _ as anyone involved
in the markets deconstructs each word of Dr. Greenspan to try and
judge when and which way the Fed might jump.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the testimony what should we think? You have to start
with the condition of the U.S. economy, where things are changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago it seemed that growth was bounding on, but
quite suddenly it seems that the East Asian crisis has struck.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first quarter was 5.4 percent annual rate; growth
in the second _ well, we won't have the figures until July 31 but
the estimates I have seen range from plus 1 percent to minus 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it is at least plausible that there will be a
recession in the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
   We are only just into the third quarter so it would be silly to
guess the outcome there. But if the second does turn out to be
minus something and the General Motors strike rolls on much longer
it is certainly within the bounds of possibility that there will be
two quarters of negative growth, the technical definition of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This recession, if it were to take place, would be largely an
externally triggered one. There has been a sudden, sharp
deterioration in the U.S. trade account. Exports of the U.S. to
East Asia have collapsed while imports (on the back of that strong
home demand) have remained pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   Largely externally triggered, but not entirely, there may also
been a swing in the inventory cycle taking place, with a buildup in
the second quarter and a fall now. This at least is the view of the
U.S. economic team at HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. policymakers are in a bit of a quandary. On the one
hand it would be unwise to tighten policy now in the face of a
possible recession, albeit a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand while there is little visible sign of an
upsurge in inflation, the strong first quarter did push up
inflation a bit, and price rises are towards the top end of the
industrial world scale.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of demand in the economy probably remained as high in the
second quarter as in the first, an unsustainable 5 percent annual
rate. And of course asset prices, particularly the price of
financial assets, remain at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this, the question is whether the collapse in demand
from east Asia has done the Fed's work for it. It almost certainly
has. Had the American economy not taken the east Asian hit, it
would have had to take an interest rate hit.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months the mood of most Fed members (though
less Greenspan's) has been that the Fed should incline towards a
modest tightening of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of demand in east Asia and the knock-on impact of
this on the U.S. seems likely to put any rise in interest rates on
hold. Expect that signal to emerge this week from Greenspan. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If that is right _ and the markets will hit the fan if it is not
_ what next?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is UK-based and has spent much time in the U.S. this
year will notice a marked difference in the mood between the two
countries. In the UK there is a widespread appreciation that the
country might move into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there is less immediate practical evidence of that than
there is in the U.S. We are facing a slowdown at the moment but
there is nothing in the indicators yet which suggests that there
was negative growth in the second quarter. But that is not the
perception. We are aware of the dangers of overheating, for people
keep in talking about these.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., by contrast, hardly anyone outside the narrow
sphere of economics believes that anything might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the millennium bug might create a
recession by disrupting the world's computer systems, and of course
there are the worries about east Asia noted above.
</P>
<P>
   But there is very little perception that there might be the
threat of recession from within the U.S., in particular that the
widening trade deficit might be unsustainable. Instead everyone
focuses on inflation: no inflation, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is therefore extremely ill-prepared for bad economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic demand has been sustained in large measure by the
willingness of foreigners to cover the U.S. current account
deficit, and the ability of American consumers to continue
financing their own spending by building up financial assets in the
stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Question: how will America react to bad economic numbers? My
guess is that one negative GDP number, assuming it is negative,
will not do much harm to confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The almost mystical faith that Americans seem to have that
somehow or other the Fed can manipulate interest rates to sustain
growth forever can probably stand the odd blow.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is further out. It is that the east Asian slump will
continue to deteriorate and that it will prove more contagious to
the U.S. than at present appears to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, if you are U.S.-based, to take on board the full
fragility of the world economy at this moment. Greenspan's judgment
on these dangers has proved pretty accurate in recent months, and
it will be particularly interesting to see how his view has moved
as the story has unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the thing to look for this week will be twofold.
First, listen more to what Greenspan says about the world and not
so much what he says about America.
</P>
<P>
   And second, watch the reaction in the U.S.: to what extent does
the ``R'' word, recession, come into the headlines?
</P>
<P>
   It would be safer for the rest of us if American opinion was
more aware of the fact that the economic cycle is not dead, just
sleeping. &QL;

   Up, down or sideways for U.S. interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Alan Greenspan started his twice-a-year Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to U.S. Congress. It is an event which has taken on
enormous significance _ probably far too much _ as anyone involved
in the markets deconstructs each word of Dr. Greenspan to try and
judge when and which way the Fed might jump.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the testimony what should we think? You have to start
with the condition of the U.S. economy, where things are changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago it seemed that growth was bounding on, but
quite suddenly it seems that the East Asian crisis has struck.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first quarter was 5.4 percent annual rate; growth
in the second _ well, we won't have the figures until July 31 but
the estimates I have seen range from plus 1 percent to minus 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it is at least plausible that there will be a
recession in the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
   We are only just into the third quarter so it would be silly to
guess the outcome there. But if the second does turn out to be
minus something and the General Motors strike rolls on much longer
it is certainly within the bounds of possibility that there will be
two quarters of negative growth, the technical definition of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This recession, if it were to take place, would be largely an
externally triggered one. There has been a sudden, sharp
deterioration in the U.S. trade account. Exports of the U.S. to
East Asia have collapsed while imports (on the back of that strong

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new era in cancer therapy could be opened later this year with
the launch of a vaccine which tackles the disease in a new way and
could spell the end of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine is the first cancer vaccine which has been developed as
a treatment for advanced melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin
cancer which claims 2,000 lives a year in the UK.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is expected to win approval from the U.S. Food and
Drugs Administration within the next six months after trials in
patients showed ``promising'' results.
</P>
<P>
   A further five or six cancer vaccines are in the pipeline and
are expected to be launched within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict that they could spell the end of
chemotherapy _ treatment with large doses of toxic drugs whose
effects can be worse than the disease _ and usher in kinder
therapies for people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines are so-called because they work by harnessing
the body's immune system to fight the disease. They differ from
conventional vaccines because they are given as a treatment rather
than to prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first new class of drugs for cancer in a decade
since the taxanes were developed in the late 1980s. These include
the drugs Taxol, for advanced ovarian cancer, which is derived from
the bark of the Pacific yew tree and Taxotere, for advanced breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the first cancer for which researchers have
identified antigenic molecules on the surface of the cancer cells
which act as a trigger for the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine, made by the U.S. biotechnology company Ribi
Immunochem, is one of a number of vaccines being developed for
melanoma which primes the immune system to recognize the molecules
and boosts the immune response to destroy cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Angus Dalgliesh, director of the Gordon Cancer Vaccine
Laboratory at St. George's Hospital, London, said: ``Cancer
vaccines may well take over from chemotherapy. They will probably
knock out chemotherapy in some adjuvant regimes (where it is given
with other drugs).''
</P>
<P>
   Most cancers had been developing for years in the body before
they were diagnosed during which they turned the immune response
off. The idea of cancer vaccines was to reawaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Where cancer vaccines are going to work is in cases
where a solid tumor is removed and there is a high chance of the
cancer coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the people who will get the vaccine to kick start the
immune system. In most cases it will only delay the inevitable but
if you can do that with a non-toxic treatment that will be a
valuable advance.'' &QL;

<P>
   A new era in cancer therapy could be opened later this year with
the launch of a vaccine which tackles the disease in a new way and
could spell the end of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine is the first cancer vaccine which has been developed as
a treatment for advanced melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin
cancer which claims 2,000 lives a year in the UK.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is expected to win approval from the U.S. Food and
Drugs Administration within the next six months after trials in
patients showed ``promising'' results.
</P>
<P>
   A further five or six cancer vaccines are in the pipeline and
are expected to be launched within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict that they could spell the end of
chemotherapy _ treatment with large doses of toxic drugs whose
effects can be worse than the disease _ and usher in kinder
therapies for people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines are so-called because they work by harnessing
the body's immune system to fight the disease. They differ from
conventional vaccines because they are given as a treatment rather
than to prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first new class of drugs for cancer in a decade
since the taxanes were developed in the late 1980s. These include
the drugs Taxol, for advanced ovarian cancer, which is derived from
the bark of the Pacific yew tree and Taxotere, for advanced breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the first cancer for which researchers have
identified antigenic molecules on the surface of the cancer cells
which act as a trigger for the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine, made by the U.S. biotechnology company Ribi
Immunochem, is one of a number of vaccines being developed for
melanoma which primes the immune system to recognize the molecules
and boosts the immune response to destroy cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Angus Dalgliesh, director of the Gordon Cancer Vaccine
Laboratory at St. George's Hospital, London, said: ``Cancer
vaccines may well take over from chemotherapy. They will probably
knock out chemotherapy in some adjuvant regimes (where it is given
with other drugs).''
</P>
<P>
   Most cancers had been developing for years in the body before
they were diagnosed during which they turned the immune response
off. The idea of cancer vaccines was to reawaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Where cancer vaccines are going to work is in cases
where a solid tumor is removed and there is a high chance of the
cancer coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the people who will get the vaccine to kick start the
immune system. In most cases it will only delay the inevitable but
if you can do that with a non-toxic treatment that will be a
valuable advance.'' &QL;

CHEERS!: HEMP BEER IS HERE _ BUT YOU WON'T GET STONED

   The country's first hemp beer is being consumed in London's bars
and clubs. But anti-drug campaigners need not worry _ you would
need to drink 3,000 bottles to get stoned.
</P>
<P>
   A German company has teamed up with an English importer to bring
the grass-flavored drink to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Asbjorn Gerlach, one of the founders of the Berlin-based Bier
Company, said: ``Hops and hemp are very closely related. In 1996,
when growing hemp became legal, we decided to try making beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using hemp as a flavoring agent in beer is a very old idea and
was popular in the Middle Ages. The drink has a slightly fruity,
grassy flavor but tastes very similar to lager.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain of hemp used for beer-making is a sister plant of
cannabis and contains only minute amounts of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach said: ``You would have to drink so many bottles that it
would kill you before you got stoned. We are not promoting cannabis
_ we are promoting hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called the beer `Turn' because we want people to turn
their minds to the idea of using hemp. It is good for the
environment. To make paper it takes 12 hectares of rainforest but
only one hectare of hemp.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Haddow, an Englishman living near Munich, was already
exporting chocolate from Germany to Britain when he came across the
new 4.9 percent brew and instantly had the idea of introducing it
to the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haddow and his nephew Paul set up in business and have so far
exported Turn to England and Denmark. It is also bound for France,
Italy, Spain and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Haddow said: ``Brian is a real fan of German beers and hemp
beer tastes very similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are targeting the 18- to 32-year-olds in trendy London bars
and clubs. After that we want to take it to the rest of the
country.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ For 85 years, the Owens Valley in central
California has been sucked dry by the city of Los Angeles, its
natural spring and lake water diverted to feed the sinks, jacuzzis
and lawn sprinklers of the ever-expanding metropolis 250 miles to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of recrimination and threats of legal action,
Los Angeles has at last agreed to take responsibility for some of
the environmental havoc it has wreaked.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from new federal air-pollution legislation, the
city has promised to treat the dustbowl _ once a lake _ at the
heart of Owens Valley with a mixture of water, vegetation and
gravel in an effort to curb the worst source of particle air
pollution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached between the two sides last week, 22
1/2 miles of the lake bed will be treated by 2006 at an estimated
cost of 120 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The city will continue to treat further stretches of the lake
after that until air quality meets standards set down in the
federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The water of Owens Valley was the key to the massive expansion
of Los Angeles in the first few decades of this century, and _ as
Roman Polanski and Robert Towne evoked in their acclaimed film noir
``Chinatown'' _ also a symbol of the bad faith, big business
interests and corruption that has accompanied the uncontrolled
sprawl of America's biggest and wildest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers of Owens Valley sold their land in 1913 to a group
of businessmen posing as cattle ranchers who in fact were acting as
agents for the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The locals were thus cheated not only of their water and their
livelihoods, but also of the compensation to which they might have
been entitled if the city authorities had approached them directly.
</P>
<P>
   While the new water source paved the way for the settlement of
the San Fernando Valley immediately north of Los Angeles _ making a
handful of property speculators very rich into the bargain _ the
Owens Valley economy descended into a slump from which it has never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Owens Valley has been prone to storms of white dust
containing arsenic and numerous toxic metals that cause heart and
lung ailments in the local population. The battle to force Los
Angeles to take responsibility for the disaster has been waged in
earnest for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest, and arguably the most important, of a
series of concessions that L.A. has made over its water supply in
recent years. Interest groups at Mono Lake, another 50 miles
further north, prised similar concessions from Los Angeles a few
years ago, but only after protracted legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, Los Angeles stands to lose about 40,000
acre-feet of water per year, enough to service 80,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   But by settling the issue now it averts the risk of a the far
deeper and more costly commitment to environmental cleanup, as
initially demanded by the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control
District, representing the interests of Owens Valley. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The king of Moldova's gypsies, Mircea Cerari, has
delivered a posthumous blow to a stereotype that has for centuries
dragged down his people _ the view that they are a band of
wandering cobblers and fortune tellers who know about as much about
technology as they do about by-laws and soap.
</P>
<P>
   Cerari went to his grave this week not with a pair of large gold
earrings, nor a pack of well-thumbed cards, or a horseshoe or a
pile of copper pots.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news reports, he was buried with his
computer, fax modem, and cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the perceived value of the trophies that lie alongside
him, which also include a vodka-stocked bar, that organizers of his
interment reportedly insisted that concrete was poured over the
grave to deter thieves from breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   His death at the age of 59, from diabetes-related illness,
appears to have dealt a blow to the large gypsy population in
Moldova and the surrounding former Soviet States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moldova's ``Flux'' newspaper, almost 15,000 gypsies
from around the region went to the funeral on Monday in Soroca, 80
miles north of Moldova's capital, Kishinev.
</P>
<P>
   His death means that his place as king, or leader, of Moldova's
gypsies now falls to his son, Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Cerari's equipment suggests that he has done somewhat better
than most of the several hundred thousand other gypsies who, after
trekking across half the planet from northwest India in the 14th
century, somehow ended up in the remnants of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Age-old prejudice against the gypsies _ or, more properly,
``Rom'' (The word ``gypsy'' derives from Egypt, from where they
were for centuries wrongly thought to have come) _ has been fanned
anew by economic malaise, nationalism and a rise in neo-fascism.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems some have made it in the post-Soviet world. The
Mercedes-driving self-proclaimed gypsy king Cioaba in Romania, for
example, is said to wear more gold than a Saudi prince.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge that you cannot reasonably expect to take such
earthly lucre with you does not appear to have deterred Cerari, who
presumably believed in a cyber-active afterlife, firing off e-mails
from the depths of his white marble tomb.
</P>
<P>
   That view also seems to have carried weight the usually
skeptical Associated Press, which ran a headline Tuesday announcing
that ``Moldova's Gypsy King is dead _ but not out of touch.'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics is a little dull in America at the moment,
but help is at hand. J Danforth Quayle, the former vice president,
is emerging from the shadows to get his campaign for president on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The man who taught American students how to spell ``potatoe'' is
back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has a serious chance of the Republican nomination for the
Presidency in the 2000 election. He was, after all, a congressman
at 29 and senator at 33 as well as vice president. He is a favorite
of many conservatives, especially on the religious right, and he
scores well in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But what will count against Quayle, inevitably, is his startling
verbal track record.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the word potato that he has managed to mangle: in
the annals of American politics, Quayle has delivered some of the
most astonishing sentences and paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   His legendary ability with language comes close to brilliance,
producing quotations that are a parody of the pol-speak that every
American politician must learn.
</P>
<P>
   He has come up with little gems that echo the empty rhetoric of
his colleagues, but with far greater simplicity. ``If we do not
succeed,'' he said once, ``we run the risk of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his utterances have been near misses at important
truths. ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend towards more
freedom and democracy _ but that could change,'' he said on another
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is hard to divine what, exactly, is going on in his
head. As he himself once said, ``Verbosity leads to unclear,
inarticulate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even more riveting: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind.
Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we believe that this habit has been exorcised in the years
away from the spotlight, Quayle popped up on television recently to
demonstrate his insight into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just be very clear that the Republican Party will
select a nominee that will beat Bill Clinton,'' he said. This is an
admirable aspiration. But Clinton, sadly, is prohibited by the
Constitution from running in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll in May by CNN, USA Today and Gallup showed
Quayle as one of the top four possibles alongside the Texas
governor, George W. Bush, (son of the former president), Elizabeth
Dole (wife of former candidate Robert) and Jack Kemp, another
former candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is discreetly putting his hat in the ring. He has a
political action committee gathering funds, Campaign America, based
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He made a campaign swing through Iowa, a key state, recently,
using the opportunity to take a poke at Bill Clinton and his team,
which he called ``the most scandal-plagued administration in the
history of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quietly recruiting friends and associates to work on his
campaign, which is likely to gather steam in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is distancing himself from his one-time patron, George Bush,
and will put himself forward as an anti-establishment candidate _
an odd position for a man who has spent most of his adult life in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican candidacy at the moment is
George W. Bush, who is, by the standards of the Republican Party in
1998, a relative moderate.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates who will try to snatch the support of
the religious right, but none has Quayle's name recognition, and
few have his fund-raising potential and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes about him will not exactly help, but Quayle has become
better at deflecting them and even capitalizing on his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you shake this image that you had during your
vice-presidency as sort of a bumbling vice president who couldn't
spell?'' he was asked on a recent television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he replied. ``I'll let all the perfect
spellers support Al Gore and those who have trouble spelling should
support me.'' On that basis, he could be on for a landslide
victory. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics is a little dull in America at the moment,
but help is at hand. J Danforth Quayle, the former vice president,
is emerging from the shadows to get his campaign for president on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The man who taught American students how to spell ``potatoe'' is
back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has a serious chance of the Republican nomination for the
Presidency in the 2000 election. He was, after all, a congressman
at 29 and senator at 33 as well as vice president. He is a favorite
of many conservatives, especially on the religious right, and he
scores well in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But what will count against Quayle, inevitably, is his startling
verbal track record.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the word potato that he has managed to mangle: in
the annals of American politics, Quayle has delivered some of the
most astonishing sentences and paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   His legendary ability with language comes close to brilliance,
producing quotations that are a parody of the pol-speak that every
American politician must learn.
</P>
<P>
   He has come up with little gems that echo the empty rhetoric of
his colleagues, but with far greater simplicity. ``If we do not
succeed,'' he said once, ``we run the risk of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his utterances have been near misses at important
truths. ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend towards more
freedom and democracy _ but that could change,'' he said on another
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is hard to divine what, exactly, is going on in his
head. As he himself once said, ``Verbosity leads to unclear,
inarticulate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even more riveting: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind.
Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we believe that this habit has been exorcised in the years
away from the spotlight, Quayle popped up on television recently to
demonstrate his insight into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just be very clear that the Republican Party will
select a nominee that will beat Bill Clinton,'' he said. This is an
admirable aspiration. But Clinton, sadly, is prohibited by the
Constitution from running in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll in May by CNN, USA Today and Gallup showed
Quayle as one of the top four possibles alongside the Texas
governor, George W. Bush, (son of the former president), Elizabeth
Dole (wife of former candidate Robert) and Jack Kemp, another
former candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is discreetly putting his hat in the ring. He has a
political action committee gathering funds, Campaign America, based
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He made a campaign swing through Iowa, a key state, recently,
using the opportunity to take a poke at Bill Clinton and his team,
which he called ``the most scandal-plagued administration in the
history of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quietly recruiting friends and associates to work on his
campaign, which is likely to gather steam in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is distancing himself from his one-time patron, George Bush,
and will put himself forward as an anti-establishment candidate _
an odd position for a man who has spent most of his adult life in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican candidacy at the moment is
George W. Bush, who is, by the standards of the Republican Party in
1998, a relative moderate.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates who will try to snatch the support of
the religious right, but none has Quayle's name recognition, and
few have his fund-raising potential and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes about him will not exactly help, but Quayle has become
better at deflecting them and even capitalizing on his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you shake this image that you had during your
vice-presidency as sort of a bumbling vice president who couldn't
spell?'' he was asked on a recent television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he replied. ``I'll let all the perfect
spellers support Al Gore and those who have trouble spelling should
support me.'' On that basis, he could be on for a landslide
victory. &QL;

   PARIS _ As the inventor Samuel Morse might have said: .. - /
.-.. - - - - - - -.- ... / .-.. .. -.- . / SOS / &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ..-. - - - .-. / - .... . / - - - - - .-. ... . / -.-. - - - -..
.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks like ... --- ... for the Morse Code. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The communications code made famous by a thousand war movies and
tapped out as the Titanic slipped beneath the waves is fast giving
way to computers and satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, use of the Morse Code will be abolished on
all oceangoing passenger ships and cargo vessels above 300 gross
tons.
</P>
<P>
   It will have been 100 years since the first maritime distress
signal was sent in Morse by a lightship in the English Channel,
reporting the grounding of the steamship Elbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wonderful romantic image of the radio operator
tapping out a final radio message as the ship sinks beneath him,''
said Roger Kohn, a spokesman for the International Maritime
Organization in London. ``But the question is, does anyone
survive?''
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 with the loss of some 1,500
lives prompted the first international Safety of Life at Sea
conference, which called for vessels carrying more than 50
passengers to be equipped with a radio-telegraphic apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, most vessels have been upgraded to conform to
the global maritime distress and safety system adopted by the
International Maritime Organization 10 years ago, and which become
universally mandatory next year. The system relies on satellites
and a network of ground-based radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   A ship in distress today no longer has to worry whether an
emergency signal is received by other vessels in the vicinity. Kohn
said the message would be picked up by a radio station somewhere in
the world, which would coordinate a rescue action using all the
resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Achille Lauro, which caught fire and sank in the Indian
Ocean in December 1994. Its SOS was received by a ground station in
Norway, which quickly directed a flotilla of ships to the scene,
enabling all but two of the 979 passengers and crew to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   If the Titanic had had the same kind of radio and satellite
equipment, Kohn said, all aboard could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of wireless and Morse enabled the code to be
used as a universal means of communicating at sea, with dots and
dashes, or long tones and short, standing for the letters of the
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   It may come back into vogue if the world's electronic sinews
collapse one day or are knocked out by enemy attack _ in fact, the
Pentagon still trains Morse operators for such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohn said its defects include limited range, slowness,
tendency to be disrupted by atmospheric conditions and the
difficulty of training operators. &QL;

RED SOX ROAR BACK TO DEFLATE BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Playing more hunches than a Suffolk Downs railbird,
Jimy Williams drew up a new lineup just for the Toronto Blue Jays
Thursday night, then spent most of the night crossing out names.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Williams had scratched out the name of rookie
catcher Jason Varitek, the last position player left on his lineup
card and the 20th man in a Boston uniform to be gainfully employed
in the game, that the Red Sox were able to cap a comeback that
conjured memories of April while drawing them one step closer to
October.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 6-1 in the eighth and 7-5 in the ninth, the Red Sox scored
seven runs in their last three at-bats to overcome the Blue Jays,
8-7, before a crowd of 33,011 in Fenway Park that was stirred to
life by Damon Buford's eighth-inning grand slam and sent home happy
by Varitek's soft single over the head of second baseman Tony
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Red Sox an 8 1/2-game lead over the team that
came to town as their nearest American League East rival for a
wild-card spot, a team that has three more cracks to close some
ground this weekend but can book its team golf outing if it blows
any more like this. Thursday night's fold knocked Toronto into
fourth place, a half-game behind Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take 'em any way you can get 'em, that's the bottom
line,'' said Darren Lewis, the leadoff man who doubled to touch off
the game-tying rally in the ninth, then parlayed a walk and an
errant pickoff throw into the winning run in the 10th. ``But even
the games we lose, we keep coming back. It's been that way all
year. Guys continue to stay locked in with what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two outs and nobody on when Lewis drew a walk from
Randy Myers, the Blue Jays closer who failed to hold a two-run lead
in the ninth and was spared a swifter demise when center fielder
Shannon Stewart threw out pinch runner Steve Avery at the plate on
Troy O'Leary's game-tying single.
</P>
<P>
   Myers picked off Lewis cleanly, but when Lewis set out for
second, he placed himself directly between first baseman Carlos
Delgado and the second base bag. He also was startled to discover
that no one was covering second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a mixup about who was going to cover,''
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, throwing at an invisible target, launched a throw to
the left-field side of second, which gave Lewis free passage to the
bag on what was ruled a stolen base. With first base open, Myers
walked John Valentin, who had doubled home Lewis in his previous
at-bat and scored the tying run on O'Leary's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn would have been the next scheduled hitter, but after
being hit by a pitch in the ninth, he'd been lifted for pinch
runner Avery. Because Williams also had hit for his DH, Darren
Bragg, the pitcher had to take a spot in the order, so when Varitek
grabbed a bat, he was hitting for closer Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   He fought off what he thought was a back-door slider from Myers
that jammed him inside, muscling the ball over Fernandez's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if it was an RBI situation, I'd be batting for
Flash,'' said Varitek, who had just two hits in 13 at-bats this
month before beating the Blue Jays. ``You know, every win for us is
a big win. We need to see where this will take us, see if it gives
us a kick start.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to look where the Red Sox had been since the All-Star
break. They were just 5-9 and looking at their fourth loss in five
games when the Blue Jays opened a 4-0 lead after three innings
against Korean rookie Jin Ho Cho.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays made short work of Cho, who can't shake the habit
of shaking off signs from his catchers and gave up a two-run
third-inning home run by Mike Stanley that cleared the left-field
screen and was last seen crossing the 38th Parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The home run by ex-Sox DH Stanley, his 21st of the season, was
just one of three long balls launched by the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   But after Williams's reconstituted lineup of Valentin, Vaughn,
and Garciaparra, in that order, loaded the bases on one-out singles
in the eighth, Buford stepped up and delivered the one long ball
that had lasting consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one kind of reminds me of the first month of the
season,'' Buford said, ``when we had seven or eight games like this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, when the Red Sox won eight games in their last
at-bat, Avery probably would have scored with his attempt at a
fadeaway slide on O'Leary's ninth-inning single. As it was, his
left foot nearly got in before the tag.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this one bad,'' said Friday night's starting
pitcher. ``Winning like that, I count these a little bit more,
because they usually lead to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Jays' clubhouse, meanwhile, Myers maintained a stiff
upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost tough games all year,'' he said. ``I don't see why
there's any reason we can't come back tomorrow.''

BUFORD, VARITEK PUNCH UP RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
 HEROES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They came to the plate in vastly different scenarios,
but Damon Buford and Jason Varitek _ the unlikely heroes of the Red
Sox' stirring 8-7 comeback victory over the Toronto Blue Jays
Thursday night _ dug their spikes into the batter's box with the
same purpose: just make contact.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Buford and Varitek did more than that. They led a
Red Sox revival before a Fenway Park crowd of 33,011 with their
master strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Batting sixth in a revamped lineup, Buford delivered some
unexpected punch by hitting a grand slam in the eighth inning that
cut Toronto's lead to 6-5. Varitek, the last pinch hitter available
to manager Jimy Williams, emerged from the dugout with two out in
the bottom of the 10th, fell behind in the count, 1-and-2, against
Randy Myers, then delivered the winning run with a single to
shallow right that scored Darren Lewis from second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually tried to back-door it, and it came in to me and it
jammed me a little bit,'' Varitek said, referring to the slider
Myers threw him. ``But being strong enough, I was able to get it
and stayed inside of it and got it out of the infield. He threw two
changeups and a fastball away and tried to back-door that cutter,
that slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he fell behind in the count, Varitek had but one thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get a hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounded familiar to Buford.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was looking to do was to get a hit,'' said Buford, who
had walked, flied to left, and grounded to third before belting his
second career grand slam. ``When I came up, that's all I was
thinking. You just try to go up there and get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to think there's not anyone on base when I go up
there,'' he added. ``But it's just one of those things where you
hit it and you think back and you don't know how you hit it. You
just don't think about (hitting a grand slam) because you put that
much more pressure on yourself; you just try to get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he made contact with Dan Plesac's 2-and-0 delivery, ``I
didn't think it was going out,'' Buford said. The ball sailed 355
feet down the left-field line, just inside the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might have had too much topspin,'' he said. ``But
I just got lucky, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Which situation was more pressure-packed? Was it the one Buford
faced in the eighth, with two out, the bases loaded, and the Sox
struggling to climb back into the game? Or was it in the 10th, when
Varitek came up with two out and two men aboard and got two strikes
against him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Varitek's was probably more pressure-filled than mine was,''
Buford volunteered. ``Because, at the time, it's only 6-1. But his
was a game-winner in the 10th and we got to go home and get some
sleep tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Varitek, ``I think in both situations, you have all to
gain, nothing to lose. To be in a tie score, you don't have
anything to lose. All you've got is something to gain.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: MacRain would be lucrative software in Texas
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I'm sitting on the back porch under the
ceiling fans, watching a thunderstorm meander this way. It's
teasing me, thunder occasionally
</P>
<P>
   sounding, a rare pleasant breeze bringing a welcome respite from
this hellish summer, but no rain yet. In the distance, the
ceaseless roar of
</P>
<P>
   traffic from U.S. Hwy. 59 mutes the birds chirping and the wind
rustling through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves are already beginning to fall, about two months
early, from shell-shocked trees trying to stay alive without water.
Rate it's going, the
</P>
<P>
   trees will be leafless by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain, dangit,'' I mutter to myself, but so far nary a drop.
</P>
<P>
   I'll stay out here until dark, sitting in what has quickly
become my daily retreat, a wonderful place to unwind after a long
day. There's a frog who
</P>
<P>
   shows up the same time each night, hopping about the concrete.
I've named him Bud after those beer frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good, and now I can work while sitting in this lawn
chair or while swinging on the antique porch swing built by a
long-dead friend of my
</P>
<P>
   in-laws. I've got a new toy, a Macintosh laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a G3, and it's faster than a greyhound, with a retro
sleek look and more bells and whistles than I'll ever be able to
figure out. It
</P>
<P>
   will allow me to dial in and edit stories while out on the road,
to work on budgets while sitting outside praying for rain. When
cooped up in a hotel
</P>
<P>
   room far away, I'll be able to check e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a computer nerd. Let me say that straight out. You
won't catch me discussing megahertz and processors or any of that
stuff. That is why I
</P>
<P>
   fell in love with Macintoshes 12 years ago when I first tried
one in a computer store in Nacogdoches. Even a dootbrain like me
can use a Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Before I found Macs, I had gone through two bitter experiences
with IBM-type machines. I hated them, still do. They required more
knowledge than
</P>
<P>
   I was willing to acquire, DOS commands and config sys files, and
who knows what else. I would end up going back to my IBM Selectric
typewriter to write
</P>
<P>
   while the computer gathered dust.
</P>
<P>
   Then I discovered the Mac, with its cute icons and an operating
system that was simple, sensible and user-friendly. I brought home
my first Mac, a
</P>
<P>
   512-K with one floppy drive and no hard drive. I was in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   That computer did not cost a great deal less than the one I'm
using today, and probably ran at 1/100th the speed _ if that fast.
My new computer will
</P>
<P>
   hold 2,000 times as much information and sits in my lap, a bit
heavy perhaps, like my old tomcat Otto.
</P>
<P>
   Since I bought my first Mac, I've gone through a half-dozen or
so computers at home and Lord knows how many at work ' all
Macintoshes. They
</P>
<P>
   keep getting faster and cheaper, so that in a year or so you're
already complaining about how slow the machine is that not that
long ago you thought
</P>
<P>
   would last you forever.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that will happen with this machine anytime soon. I
believe I could launch the space shuttle with it if I had the
correct codes. It's
</P>
<P>
   almost intimidating to me.
</P>
<P>
   I used to spend a lot of time cussing computers, worrying about
why there weren't acting right, trying to account for the
inexplicable behavior of
</P>
<P>
   these machines that have become indispensable to our lives. No
more. Now I accept the fact that all computers, even my beloved
Macs, blow up for
</P>
<P>
   unexplainable reasons. They freeze up, give you ``system error''
messages, and have to be rebooted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't waste a whit of time worrying about why it
happened. I just restart the sucker and move on. This approach will
add years to your life, I
</P>
<P>
   believe. Leave the analysis to people who actually know what
they're doing when messing with computers. I'd rather worry about
what's going in the
</P>
<P>
   newspaper the next day.
</P>
<P>
   I will likely hear from IBM lovers, who correctly point out that
IBM-type machines act a lot like Macs these days, thanks to Windows
95 and now
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 ' and cost less. And Apple nearly ran itself into the
ground the past few years with a multitude of mistakes that cost it
a great deal of
</P>
<P>
   market share. In a moment of weakness last year, I shopped
around for a new personal computer (the laptop belongs to the
paper), and looked at several
</P>
<P>
   PCs, fearing Apple might not be around much longer. But the
company has come back strong, and with computers like this one, I
suspect it will be around a
</P>
<P>
   good while.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I don't have to contribute unduly to Bill Gates'
monopoly when using Macs, though you can't ever completely escape
the Microsoft world.
</P>
<P>
   If this computer could just make it rain, everything would be
perfect.

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ The one truth in presidential
campaigns is ... that there is no one truth to be found there.
Rather, there are lots of forks in the political trail that lead to
either success or ruin. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED. EMBARGOED
UNTIL JULY 26.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Few in this country beyond our foreign-policy
cognoscenti noticed, but while the world was recently and
enthusiastically adopting a basic American ideal to try government
leaders or their agents for war crimes and for crimes against
humanity, Washington copped out. There were two reasons: ``Jesse''
and ``Helms.'' (Teepen, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Like most cities, Waco is trying to
do something about two problems with numbers: too many stray
animals roaming the streets and too many stray children doing the
same. These are not concurrent conditions _ no reports of teen boys
group-sniffing fireplugs or of terrier mixes hogging ``Street
Fighter'' at the arcade. But both problems clearly merge at an
underlying numbers problem: Too many dumb adults. (Young, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ I'm sitting on the back porch under the ceiling
fans, watching a thunderstorm meander this way. It's teasing me,
thunder occasionally sounding, a rare pleasant breeze bringing a
welcome respite from this hellish summer, but no rain yet. Life is

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Cox Newspapers columnist Howard Kleinberg is
on vacation. His column will resume for Wednesday, July 29.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service)

<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ Cox Newspapers columnist Joe Murray is traveling
and reporting in Europe. His column will resume the week of July 27
with reports from abroad. (Murray, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ After Thelma Shepherd died in 1996, her three
surviving daughters went through her papers and photo albums,
expecting to find nothing more than memories of a past as familiar
as her well-loved features. Then, in an album of old family photos,
they were startled to find a reference to their ``baby brother,''
Guy Wilk, in France, conceived when their father was a soldier
stationed in Metz, France, guarding German POWs in World War II.
Neither their mother nor their father, who died in 1983, ever spoke
a word about him. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Ronald Reagan's decision to
dance with the Christian right now has the Republican Party dancing
to a gospel tune. Before Reagan's advisers decided to mix politics
and religion in exchange for votes, the GOP stood primarily for
fiscal conservatism, a strong defense and rugged individualism.
(Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ The old editorial writer on The Hartford
(Conn.) Courant who wrote that everybody talks about the weather
but nobody does anything about it should be living today. Nowadays
everybody is going crazy trying to conquer the weather. And I'm
here to say I'm very tired of it. (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 7/23. EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26.

 &HT;    The gospel and the GOP
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Ronald Reagan's decision to dance with the
Christian right now has the Republican Party dancing to a gospel
tune. Before Reagan's advisers decided to mix politics and religion
in exchange for votes, the GOP stood primarily for fiscal
conservatism, a strong defense and rugged individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Now it difficult to tell the difference between Republican
leaders and Bible-waving televangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should return to their original values.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, evangelical Christians should come out of their
cozy Republican closet and form their own political party based on
their absolutist reading Biblical scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Christian fundamentalists have a way of jerking Republican
leaders back into line. All it takes is for Pat Robertson, Jerry
Falwell or one of the their lieutenants to go on television and
muse aloud that they may have to withdraw their support unless
Republicans lift their voices with greater gusto in praise of
fundamentalist religious issues.
</P>
<P>
   It works. Republicans have been indistinguishable from
slick-haired televangelists who foment on abortion, sex education
and the godless Supreme Court that kicked Jesus out of public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott sang from
the fundamentalist hymnal when he compared homosexuality with
kleptomania, alcoholism and the addiction to drugs or sex.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey agreed with Lott. He
called homosexuality a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Sin is a religious issue. It is defined as an offense against
God. Fundamentalists and the GOP leaders may believe that
homosexuality is a sin, but not all religious people come to that
faith-based conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the U.S. Constitution's provision to keep
government out of religion and vice versa is that different
religious groups can practice their faith-based beliefs without
interference from the state or other religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have an equal right to reject all religions.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition and other Christian evangelicals want an
America in their own image. They have that right. But most
Americans are not fundamentalists and have no desire to change
their religious orientation.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Christian fundamentalists has launched a national
campaign to turn homosexuals away from sin. One newspaper ad taken
out in the $200,000 Christian Coalition-Family Research Council
media campaign mentions Republican leader Trent Lott's remarks
about the sin of homosexuality. The ad concludes: ``If you really
love someone, you'll tell them the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``truth'' the ads suggest is ``the truth about the
nongenetic roots of homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Paulk, who represents an association of ``ex-gay''
ministries called Exodus International, is featured in one of the
ads. She is referred to as ``wife, mother, former lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the truths not mentioned in the Christian fundamentalist
campaign or by the GOP deacons is that the two ``ex-gay''
co-founders of Exodus International Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper
left the group when they fell and love and got married, according
to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Another overlooked truth is the growing body of scientific
evidence that homosexuality is an inherited condition caused by a
``gay gene.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that Christian fundamentalists can't continue
to have a faith-based religious belief that homosexuality is a sin.
But it does make GOP leaders look foolish to condemn what appears
to be genetically determined condition unless they want to condemn
Ronald Reason for the Alzheimers disease that causes him to not
remember how he is responsible for the Christian fundamentalist
influence over his party.

 &HT;    Company developes child care internet computer system
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ A Palm Beach Internet company's plans could help
the Murphy Browns of the world spend more time with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe inspire a few budding Murphy Browns, too.
</P>
<P>
   While some Internet companies use videocameras to give parents
the ability to watch their child in day care, Safe Technologies
International plans to take the concept a step further and give
parents the ability to have a conversation ``face-to-face'' on a
computer screen with their child or child's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is using a novel business strategy to bring its
child care computer system to market: Rather than selling its
services to day-care centers, Safe Technologies is focused on
buying these centers and weaving its services into their programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Safe Technologies announced it had signed a letter
of intent to buy its first child-care center operator, Toddler's
Learning Center, which runs two day-care centers in Stuart. Twelve
teachers and 13 other employees run a pre-school for children from
infants to the age of 5 and an after-school program for children
from ages 5 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to buy more child-care centers over the next
few years in Florida and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision mothers who travel a lot will use this,'' said
Barbara Tolley, the 61-year-old chairwoman and CEO of Safe
Technologies International. ``She could carry a laptop and an
Internet phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies is a penny-stock company that emerged five
months ago from Tolley's take-over of Safe Aid Products, a holder
of patents on medical products. It employ 15 people, five in Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While its shares (SFAD) were selling for only about 10 cents
Thursday on the Over The Counter market, Safe Technologies has some
influential partners. In May, it announced that it signed a deal
with AT&AMP;T to put the phone company's Internet access software on
all Safe Technologies' new Internet software products.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said Thursday that VocalTec Communications Ltd., an
Israeli company that had $7.7 million in losses on $15.7 million in
sales in 1997, will provide the technology for
video-teleconferencing. VocalTec's Internet Phone provides
real-time, two-way voice transmission over computer (much like a CB
radio), thus avoiding long-distance line charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hed goes here In general, Internet companies who sell the
monitoring service use a camera to capture a child's image in a
room every few seconds and transmit it to a secured computer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and other authorized users, such as grandparents, must
have an Internet address and password to access the image from
their computer via phone lines. Many such Internet sites also give
parents news of upcoming events, report cards and immediate
emergency notices.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies plans to use a similar set-up and will add
teleconferencing equipment to simulate a face-to-face conversation.
The company also is considering giving parents CD-ROMs with
age-appropriate educational content developed by child-care centers
to reinforce lessons taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many ramifications of how this (Internet)
could be used,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right mix _ a profitable one _ is where Safe
Technologies hopes to buck the general trend of costly,
money-losing Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of this company is making acquisitions'' in
a variety of industries and integrating the Internet into the
company's operation to make it more efficient and profitable,
Tolley said. The company is looking to buy businesses in real
estate, technology, marketing, health care and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies has bought two companies since February _
Tampa-based Total Micro Computers, a computer systems seller, and
Miami-based Precision Imaging, a graphics printer which helps
produce Boca Raton Magazine, she said. She declined to say how much
the purchases cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley knows how much start-up capital Internet companies need
and how much money they can lose. As a marketing consultant, she
worked with AT&AMP;T in the early 1990s to develop a real estate search
engine for its private information services division.
</P>
<P>
   The product, PII.Net, moved to the Internet in 1995 before
another well-known search engine, Yahoo!, did, Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's free-lunch culture sapped the product's
profitability, and Tolley said she moved on to develop an Internet
mall for ``the rich and famous,'' and a CD-ROM for real estate
brokers called Real Estate 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM _ which allows brokers to access information and hold
video teleconferences _ paved the way for Safe Technologies' child
care CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies' plans to use videoconferencing and buy child
care centers is unique, say heads of similar Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone doing this with their own chain of
centers,'' said Seth Steinberg, president of Atlanta-based
ParentNet Inc., one of about 12 companies around the country that
sell Internet systems to day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 2-year-old company provides 4,000 parents and other
authorized users with glimpses of their children at day care over
the Internet and expects to double that number by September.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Steinberg's wife, who is the company co-owner,
ParentNet will soon service day-care centers in Jacksonville and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Hed goes here Boca Raton-based Center-View.com Inc. also markets
an Internet system to child-care systems.
</P>
<P>
   ParentNet's monitoring service adds about $2 to the $120 a week
that parents pay for day care, Steinberg said. ``We expect true
growth to come in the future as it's accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg isn't so sure Safe Technologies' videoconferencing
will be a hit with education-oriented centers. ``It's disruptive to
the classroom. What's nice about (our) system is parents don't poke
their head in.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing his own 9-month-old boy and 3-year-old girl has
convinced Steinberg this technology's time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows you to see the games they like best, the kids they
interact with, how they nap. . . . It gets you in sync with them so
when you spend time with them you're reinforcing routines. That's
what a child needs _ structure and routine.''

   AUSTIN _ Deanna Engber is trading in her apartment for a
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the two-bedroom Barton Hills condo makes sense and will
leave Engber with a monthly mortgage payment of about $900 a month.
That's less than she would pay for many comparable apartments in
Central Austin, which are renting for $1,000 a month and up.
</P>
<P>
   And because she is supports herself, Engber said she can't
afford to buy a single-family home in Central Austin, where prices
have soared. A condo also is more suited to her lifestyle because
she is adopting a child, whom she will raise herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to spend my weekends mowing a lawn or fixing the
outside of a house,'' Engber said.
</P>
<P>
   Engber, and many like her, have contributed to an Austin condo
boom, a phenomenon many thought they never would see again after
the real estate bust of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Condo sales during the first half of 1998 are up more than 26
percent from the comparable period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, prices are rising, too. The median price of a condo
is about $83,500, 9.6 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helping drive the boom are high apartment rents and
single-family home prices, little new construction until recently,
and changing consumer tastes, said Joe Bryson, a broker with Real
Estate Alliance who calls himself ``Condo Joe.'' An influx of
people from the East and West coasts, where condos are much more
prevalent, also is fueling the growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   With rising demand, some condos, especially in the central city,
are drawing multiple offers from buyers who are bidding up prices.
Engber, who has been condo shopping since December, said she was
outbid on two other units before she got her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell within days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin condo market mirrors the trend nationally. An
estimated 516,000 people bought condos or co-op units in 1997, the
highest number since the National Association of Realtors began
keeping records in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condos provide a low-cost home ownership opportunity,'' said
Donna Reichle, director of media relations for the Community
Associations Institute, which represents 16,500 condos and co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1985 and 1998, the number of condo units nationally
increased from 2.6 million to 5.1 million _ a 96 percent jump.
While much of that increase was created by property owners who
converted their apartment complexes to condos, there has been a
significant increase in new construction recently, Reichle said.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have responded to the surge in demand with more new
condo projects than at any other time this decade, said Ryan
Robinson, chief demographer for the Austin Department of Planning.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen projects with 903 units have been built or are under
construction in the Austin area in the past two years. Condo
development now rivals apartment construction, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The condos range from downtown lofts to suburban units to luxury
condominiums. Prices range from less than $100,000 to $1 million
for penthouse units in the Nokonah, an 11-story project planned for
the corner of Ninth Street and North Lamar Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Many are close to downtown, responding to the growing popularity
of urban living.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really has been a re-emphasis on in-town addresses,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few are in suburban areas. The Townhomes of Wellwood is
being planned for Yager Lane. San Tierra is slated for Burnet Road,
north of U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   The average project size is 40 units, according to city figures.
One of the largest is Ladera Condominiums, an 83-unit complex at
9501 N. Capital of Texas Highway. Half the two-bedroom units, which
range from $115,100 to $159,900, have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The hot condo market also has prompted some property owners to
convert their apartments to condos. The Railyard Apartments at 201
E. Fourth St., one of downtown's largest apartment complexes,
recently converted its 200 units to condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   With a condominium, the buyer purchases a unit in a building. An
association maintains all common property.
</P>
<P>
   The condo market has come full circle since the boom of the
mid-1980s, when many condo owners could name their price. Most of
the area's 15,500 units were built during the 1980s, said Resa
Watson, president of Certified Management of Austin, which manages
23 local properties.
</P>
<P>
   But when the real estate market soured in the late 1980s,
condominium values plummeted, Watson said. People were getting 33
to 50 cents on the dollar for what they paid. Over the past eight
years, Austin's real estate market has rebounded with a vengeance.
Condos were the last to recover, Bryson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, condo prices have returned to 1985 levels and in some
cases have surpassed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the reasons condos were popular in the 1980s are the
same today,'' said Robinson, the city demographer. ``It's
homeownership without the hassles.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: On the starting line to the 2000 race
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 26
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The one truth in presidential campaigns is ... that
there is no one truth to be found there. Rather, there are lots of
forks in the political trail that lead to either success or ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Take the election of 1960. In the run-up to the campaign, there
was one serious candidate on the Republican side _ Vice President
Richard Nixon _ and five top-tier candidates among the Democrats:
Adlai Stevenson and Sens. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Lyndon
Johnson of Texas, John Kennedy of Massachusetts and Stuart
Symington of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Early conventional wisdom among political insiders had Symington
winning the nomination. For one thing, Symington looked the way
Hollywood thought presidents should look. For another, his four
rivals were thought to be weighed down by fatal flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson had already lost twice. Humphrey was too liberal.
Johnson was too much of a wheeler-dealer. Kennedy had a skimpy
legislative record and was a Roman Catholic, a faith embraced by no
former occupant of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 40 years later, there's one serious candidate on the
Democratic side _ Vice President Al Gore _ and five potential
top-tier candidates among the Republicans: Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, former Vice President Dan Quayle, publishing magnate Steve
Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Early conventional wisdom among political insiders rules out
Ashcroft. A first-term senator, he is seen as too stiff to succeed
on the stump. What's more, each of Ashcroft's four rivals has, in
one way or another, already cut his teeth in a presidential
campaign, a rite of passage that Republicans seem to value highly.
(For Bush, admittedly, that rite has occurred only in a dynastic
sense.)
</P>
<P>
   Could conventional wisdom prove wrong again?
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, offering a pundit a ham sandwich and a pickle during
an hour-long visit to his office, comes across as a staunch social
and economic conservative. The son and grandson of Bible Belt
ministers, he begins our lunch with a devout prayer.
</P>
<P>
   When prodded, Ashcroft makes it clear that he believes the Bible
interprets homosexuality to be a sin. ``But,'' he adds,
``homosexuality doesn't appear on any public policy agenda that I
would want to impose. It's not the role of government to inquire
into religion or into a person's private beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former two-term governor, Ashcroft does believe that the
U.S. health care system needs reform; that, at a time of budget
surpluses, federal taxes are too high, and that Social Security
needs to be strengthened through investments in equity markets,
while protecting folks who want to retain their current deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses, where the road to the White House really
begins, are still 18 months off. A lot could happen between now and
then. But so long as Iowa still borders on Missouri come 2000,
Ashcroft is likely to show up and, just maybe, do very well there.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Long-lost brother found after parents' death
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Thelma Shepherd died in 1996, her three surviving
daughters went through her papers and photo albums, expecting to
find nothing more than memories of a past as familiar as her
well-loved features.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an album of old family photos, they were startled to
find a delicately penned 1947 letter from a woman in France: ``Your
letter and the picture with your four daughters surprised me very
much. If I had known Bill had four kids, I never got a baby from
him. I understand that you defend your children and your home, but
I want to guarantee the future of my son. He is very healthy and it
is a nice baby. Bill will be pride of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this?'' the sisters exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who is this little boy?'' The next page showed photos of a
cherubic blond boy, inscribed ``Your son Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first shock, the letters and photos left no doubt what
it was all about _ their ``baby brother,'' Guy Wilk, in France,
conceived when their father was a soldier stationed in Metz,
France, guarding German POWs in World War II. Neither their mother
nor their father, who died in 1983, ever spoke a word about him.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up as the four Shepherd sisters, a unit so tight it
sometimes seemed there wasn't room for anybody else. That bond was
strengthened by grief when they lost their older sister, Patricia,
29 years ago. Today, the surviving sisters _ Jane Taylor, 58,
Carolyn Farley, 56, and Bettsy Samuels, 55 _ live in the same house
in Miamisburg and have started a trucking and hauling business
together, Three Sisters Enterprise Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Did this tight little trio have room for a brother? The answer
was simple and unanimous: ``Oui! Oui! Oui!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of us and someone our dad loved very much,''
Farley explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting part of our dad back,'' Taylor added.
</P>
<P>
   In Feburary 1997, their quest took them to Paris, where they
appeared on a national TV show called Perdu de Vue (Lost from Sight
), which reunited separated family members. Taylor made an
emotional appeal to her brother: ``Fifty years have gone by. Isn't
it time for us to find each other? Open your heart. Open your mind.
Accept us. Please contact us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wilk family gathered around the TV set in
Chailly-
</P>
<P>
   SEE BROTHER/ 2B
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER: Finally reunited with family
</P>
<P>
   CONTINUED FROM 1B Les-Ennery, a small town not far from Metz,
where the young American soldier, Bill Shepherd, met an immigrant
from Poland named Irena Lukomska. Wife Christiane and daughter
Stephanie, tipped off by a newspaper preview, concealed their
nervousness and excitement. Wilk knew nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes he was on the phone to the set of Perdu de Vue ,
his voice choked with emotion. He had known about them, he said,
for 21 years, ever since his late mother, seriously ill, revealed
the truth: The man who had raised him as a son was in fact his
stepfather. His father was an American soldier.
</P>
<P>
   He would arrive in Paris the next day, he announced, and bring
them home for a visit. He had longed to find them all these years,
but was afraid of interfering with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to Thursday afternoon and the sisters' back porch
in Miamisburg. Their brother and his family arrived the night
before; it is their first trip to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we didn't give a second thought to interfering with his
life,'' said Farley, laughing. ``We just wanted to find him. We
worried that he felt that he wasn't loved by his American family.
We had to let him know we loved him and wanted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilk apparently has gotten the message. During his visit to
America, he will meet more than 30 relatives at family reunions in
Kentucky and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters speak faltering French, and the brother faltering
English, but they manage to communicate with the help of sign
language, the ``magic book'' (as they call their French-English
dictionary) and the translations of Stephanie, who studied English
for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get the blues, I watch the videotape of the
program,'' Wilk said. It was like a ``second birth'' to meet his
sisters and learn more about the father he so resembles in
features, mannerisms and personality. ``Daddy was quiet and gentle
_ a lot like Guy,'' Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Why did their parents keep his existence a secret? It obviously
wasn't lack of love, or lack of forgiveness. When Wilk was 8 years
old, his father made plans to adopt him and bring him to America _
he even had his passport photo taken _ but his mother had a change
of heart.
</P>
<P>
   So why the secretiveness? The sisters can only speculate. It was
a different generation; and both parents were emotionally guarded
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Although she regrets the lost years with their brother, ``we
wouldn't have understood it if this had happened when we were
younger,'' Taylor acknowledged. ``Now we've lived through it. We
know how fickle the heart can be. We understand the temptation and
loneliness he must have felt, being so far away and not knowing if
he'd make it home alive. It didn't have anything to do with his
loving our mother any less.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have given Wilk some of their father's treasured
mementoes _ his Army medals, his birthstone ring, the American flag
they were given at his burial _ so ``he could have something real''
of the father he had never known.
</P>
<P>
   Finding their brother has only drawn the sisters closer. ``We're
more open with each other,'' Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
   Families weren't perfect and uncomplicated, even in the '40s and
'50s so idealized by today's pundits. Yet here is this fractured
family, speaking different tongues and separated by 50 years and an
ocean, learning a new language of love, a new definition of what it
means to be a family. ``Cheese, Papa!'' Stephanie cries, as her
father poses for a group shot with his sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just proves that blood is thicker than water, and deeper
than any ocean,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we always wanted a brother,'' added Farley.

 &HT;    Treaty Oak's baby offspring to make their way in world
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ They are small green stalks, less than a foot high, so
tiny and delicate, it's hard to imagine that one day each could
grow into sturdy oak trees 100 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   These are the offspring of the centuries-old Treaty Oak, its
first saplings grown since the downtown landmark was poisoned in
1989. Their growers hope to begin selling them to the public soon.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the Treaty Oak died when the herbicide Velpar was
deliberately poured near its roots. Paul Stedman Cullen of Travis
County was convicted of felony criminal mischief and served three
years of his nine-year sentence before he was paroled in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Treaty Oak drew international attention.
Because of the poison, experts don't believe the oak, on Baylor
Street between Fifth and Sixth streets, will ever grow back to its
former proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Treaty Oak produced its first batch of
acorns since the poisoning, tree specialists at the Native Texas
Nursery volunteered to harvest the acorns and grow the saplings.
</P>
<P>
   With twice-daily watering and special care, about 250 of the
1,000 acorns survived. The saplings may be available for purchase
as early as fall or as late as next year, said Mark Wieland,
coordinator of the Treaty Oak project and spokesman for the Austin
Parks and Recreation Forestry Program.
</P>
<P>
   The likely cost will be about $40, and proceeds will go to
support the Austin Parks and Recreation Planting for the Future
program, which pays for the care and planting of nearly 4,000 trees
every year in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long we have worried about the survival of the Treaty
Oak,'' Wieland said. ``This ensures that the Treaty Oak will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the baby Treaty Oak project can call
416-0250.

   The problem: stupid people at large
</P>
<P>
   By John Young
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Like most cities, Waco is trying to do something
about two problems with numbers: too many stray animals roaming the
streets and too many stray children doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   These are not concurrent conditions _ no reports of teen boys
group-sniffing fireplugs or of terrier mixes hogging ``Street
Fighter'' at the arcade. But both problems clearly merge at an
underlying numbers problem:
</P>
<P>
   Too many dumb adults.
</P>
<P>
   We have too many idiot pet owners. We have too many imbecile
parents.
</P>
<P>
   An expeditious, perfect-world solution of course would be
spaying and neutering of really stupid people, or of reasonably
cogent people who are just really irresponsible. Unfortunately,
though many adults do their best to forfeit any claim to standing
as higher life-forms, the 14th Amendment gives them due process
protection from such an initiative by virtue of said adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   So it's the animals to whom we administer the snip-snip. And
it's the 14-year-olds we lecture under a lamp post, though they're
only acting out the disinterest of parents who wouldn't care if
their progeny disappeared under a street sweeper's bristle.
</P>
<P>
   Waco implemented its form of a human leash law last year when it
launched a nighttime curfew. One difference between this and a
leash law, however: As with most curfews, the penalty falls on the
teen, which is like fining a runaway schnauzer for its owner's
laxitude.
</P>
<P>
   Young curfew violators commonly go to teen court and get
community service, with a $10 fee, rather than pay about $163 in
fine and court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Waiving the fine in favor of community service ``makes more
sense considering who you're punishing,'' said Municipal Judge John
Roberts. Agreed. But sometimes it's the parents who are at fault
for not acting like parents, for letting children scatter with the
night breezes. In those cases, we should aim at getting a message
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's as yet not been exercised, Waco police have the
option of citing the parents of curfew offenders, which would mean
fines for them or precious TV time squandered doing community
service. That makes sense. That's a curfew with clout.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the other stray problem. Waco is debating pet licensing,
including a proposal to require a special permit for a home that
has more than four dogs and/or cats combined.
</P>
<P>
   A group of local veterinarians voiced valid concerns _ that
relying on responsible people to submit to and pay for licensing
would heap costs on these owners while the least responsible ones
would evade the rules, disavow accountability and responsibility,
and in some cases steer clear of a veterinarian entirely _ no
vaccinations _ so as not to be found owning an unlicensed pet. Good
point.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes back to the adults at home.The only way to curb
animals at large, as with children at large, shy possibly of
issuing parenting permits, is to keep an eye out for strays and
require those responsible to act responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Spaying and neutering are the answer to pet overpopulation and
the holocaust of unneeded animals put to death every year at animal
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   And as said before, forcd population control in the stupid human
ranks would work, too, were there not a Constitution in the way.

 &HT;    Heart will go on without Ann, but guitarist Nancy sits out
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The irony is too much for Ann Wilson.
One of the first women to break into the testosterone-fueled world
of hard rock, the lead singer of Heart sought a place on this
year's Lilith Fair, that celebration of all things feminine and
musical. And she was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at first, festival organizers were encouraging. ``They
went `Wonderful, great, you're on,''' the 47-year-old Wilson
recalls, speaking from a tour date in South Carolina. But a few
months later, the singer found herself competing with everyone from
Queen Latifah to Bonnie Raitt for a spot on the roster. ``It's very
political, and you need to have a new album out,'' she concludes of
the selection process that snubbed her.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the irony is the fact that Wilson, the voice behind
such Heart hits as Straight On, Magic Man, Crazy on You and
Barracuda, has decided to mount her own tour this summer. And when
she begins her tour this summer, she'll be competing head-to-head
with Lilith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be interesting; maybe we'll have an audience of all
men,'' Wilson says with a chuckle. ``It will be like playing a USO
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant aspect of the tour, however, might be that
Wilson is choosing to do it without her sister, guitarist and band
co-founder Nancy. There's no bad blood between the siblings: It's
just that Nancy wanted to spend time with her husband, film
director Cameron Crowe, in the hope of conceiving a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of shows we did, I would look over and she
wouldn't be there and that was unusual, but I talk to her on the
phone almost every day, so it's like she's there in spirit,'' says
Wilson. ``Among the audiences that are coming out, it seems to be a
non-issue. Everyone knows she'll be back when she can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which features Heart guitarist Howard Leese as well as
members of Wilson's other group, the acoustic-oriented Lovemongers,
promises to be something of a look backward and forward. Wilson
will feature many Heart hits from the band's '70s classic-rock
incarnation and its '80s ``glam-pop'' phase. But she'll also
include new songs she's writing for a solo album.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying for now is just a further evolution. It's a
little bit more sophisticated,'' says Wilson. ``We're not going for
the big image-first thing, like we did in the '80s. We're
definitely going for the music, for a good, live, vital sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether that sound will make it to record is another issue.
``I'm label-shopping, trying to network and get it going,'' Wilson
says. ``But on the record-company level they're all going, `We
can't figure out who Ann Wilson would be without Nancy?'''
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson even sees their point, especially in light of the
abundance of solo female artists around these days. ``I'm really up
against a lot of music here,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone's accustomed to a good fight, it's Wilson, who had
to convince radio programmers and label executives in the '70s that
a female-fronted band deserved a shot. While she won't go so far as
to call herself a pioneer, she's clearly proud of her past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were among the first few to thumb our noses at the
conventions that existed among the brotherhood of men who ran the
industry,'' she says. ``It was not done in a bitchy way. It was
just, `Yes, we can.'''

 &HT;    Appocalypse then: gritty movie celebrates American heroism
 &HT;    By Gary Schwann
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Artists understand the ugly truth that there can be beauty in
horror and horror in beauty. So do soldiers, who speak of the
resplendence that can accompany the grisliest battles.
</P>
<P>
   So does Steven Spielberg, a movie director with an instinct for
the pretty shot. Perhaps only he could direct a film about combat
that's both unflinchingly brutal and reflexively beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   It is called Saving Private Ryan, an engaging World War II epic
that dares to build on all the cliches of Hollywood war films.
Despite some struggles with the genre, Spielberg ends up
transcending stereotypes in his study of the stock character known
as GI Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg begins by making his war movie grittier than others.
He puts us on the beach at Normandy in the most realistic combat
footage this side of the Army Signal Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the movie's D-Day sequence is more powerful than Signal
Corps films. With his hand-held camera, Spielberg gets down and
bloody with the troops in ways that cameramen could not at the
shooting gallery known as Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan is nearly three hours long and contains more
than two hours of combat scenes. Be prepared to witness gutshots
and dismemberments. And be prepared to understand how dogfaces
endured it.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens peacefully enough, with a World War II veteran
and his family at a military cemetery in France. The man suddenly
falls to his knees before a grave site. Of course, an epilogue will
tell us who he is and whose grave he has stopped at. But first
there's a war to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The film segues to GIs aboard landing craft churning toward
Omaha Beach. We see a hand shaking. It belongs to Capt. Miller (Tom
Hanks). Around him, his men are vomiting, wincing, praying and
ducking. Then the ramp goes down, and we enter about 20 minutes of
chaotic combat as the infantrymen find a way to storm the German
bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   The adrenalin produced by this initial sequence is as intense as
the horror it depicts. How can the film follow its power?
Intermittently, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting stops for a moment, Miller and his remaining
men are given an odd assignment. A paratrooper named Ryan has lost
three brothers in combat. The brass want this last surviving son
sent home. Miller's squadron is ordered to find him. He's out there
somewhere, amid the confusion of an ongoing invasion.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is up-and-down dramatically, and not just because
of the inevitable cliches, such as the ethnically mixed squad,
including a tough sergeant (Tom Sizemore), a Jewish private from
New York (Adam Goldberg) and a Bible-quoting sharpshooter from
Tennessee (Barry Pepper).
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hanks' captain, a mysterious Every-American, the men
wander the countryside on what comes to seem a kind of existential
_ if not suicidal _ mission. They bitch, battle and bond like GIs
everywhere, but what does it mean? Finding Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon),
however, eventually becomes a metaphor for going home themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission leads to truly tense and dramatic moments _ the
fate of a German prisoner, for example, or a final battle that is
almost as explosive as the D-Day landing. But there's also time for
overcooked confrontations among the men, some drivel-ish, dogface
dialogue and fortunes of war that are simply too neat by half.
</P>
<P>
   But the film rises above the familiar. The acting is fine,
especially by Hanks, whose decency in a lousy situation never
becomes smarmy.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan is a remarkable film about ordinary
soldiers. It's about heroism _ specifically, and unabashedly,
American heroism. Its last shot is of an American flag, and if you
don't have a twinge of pride, admiration or patriotism on seeing
it, maybe you are as dead as the GIs left behind at Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   3 stars; running time 2 hours, 50 minutes

 &HT;    ``Modeling is kind of every little girl's dream''
 &HT;    Has sidebar: MODEL-SIDE
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're an attractive teen from Port St. Lucie. Do you: a.) get
chosen from 20,000 girls for a chance to be Seventeen magazine's
covergirl? b.) fly to New York c.) meet the guitarist for Garbage
d.) all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Willis has brown eyes, but she brought green ones
(contacts) just in case.
</P>
<P>
   She also brought her blanky and a reminder to not chew her
nails.
</P>
<P>
   Models shouldn't chew their nails. And Allison, 16, was about to
play one.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen magazine chose the Port St. Lucie, Florida, teen as
one of eight finalists for its New Model of the Year contest and
flew her to New York this month.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen, known for its highschool focus and its monthly
quizzes (August: ``Are you a gutsy girl?''), looked through about
20,000 entries. Some girls sent glamour pics. Some sent photos from
their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Allison sent a blurry snapshot taken by her friend, who leaned
in too close while they were watching an off-off-Broadway show last
year and caught Allison with toilet paper on her head.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU A COVER GIRL?
</P>
<P>
   In your everyday life do you:
</P>
<P>
   a.) wear only lip gloss for makeup?
</P>
<P>
   b.) collect pig toys?
</P>
<P>
   c.) own knee-high, metallic-blue go-go boots?
</P>
<P>
   d.) all of the above?
</P>
<P>
   In June, Seventeen invited Allion to New York for a makeover,
photo shoots, tours and a coming-out event for media and modeling
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   They left the message on her answering machine. ``I was getting
ready to go to work, so there wasn't much time to celebrate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Allison to describe herself and she'll say ``wild and
crazy.'' ``A teacher's pet.'' ``A beach bum.'' She just quit
playing violin. She loves sports, but on a rainy day she and her
friends will fool around with makeovers and take pictures of each
other. She collects the photos.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling, she said, ``is kind of every girl's little dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York invitation worked out just right, her mom, Maria
Mosley, said. It was the only week her daughter had nothing
planned. No volleyball camp, no softball camp.
</P>
<P>
   Allison came to New York with sock lines and a scraped leg.
</P>
<P>
   She barely told anyone she was going. Not her friends at Lin-
coln Park Academy, where she will be a junior this year. Not her
co-workers at Bubba's Fish Camp. Not her teammates. Even now she'd
rather wait until the maga- zine with the finalists' photos comes
out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to be the kind of girl _ `I'm gonna be in
Seventeen, ha ha!''' said Allison, who is now called ``my little
super model'' by her best friend, Hagen Hastings. ``Then I don't
have to live up to any expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   So most people thought she went to New York to visit her aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was sitting in a salon in midtown Manhattan, get-
ting a $290 hairdo for free while a crew from Entertainment Tonight
dipped a mike in her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be blond,'' she said. The cameraman called her
``Wild Spice.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl chosen for Seventeen's cover gets a five-day trip for
two to Paris and a $1,000 shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   The ET reporter asked if any big names had come out of the
contest during its 14 years. Not really, Seventeen told her. The
reporter decided not to get that on tape.
</P>
<P>
   During your makeover and before-and-after shots, do you:
</P>
<P>
   a.) remove your bright-pink nail polish?
</P>
<P>
   b.) get compared to Linda Evangelista, Meg Ryan and Hayley
Mills?
</P>
<P>
   c.) stick out your tongue at the camera?
</P>
<P>
   d.) all of the above?
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta get your tongue pierced,'' Hannah Borum, 15, told
Allison. She plays volleyball, too, in Maryland. Her close-up photo
was taken in her house, standing with her lacrosse stick. The two
bonded fast.
</P>
<P>
   The eight girls spent their first night in New York hanging out
of the top of a limo, supplied by Seventeen, and checking out a
World Cup party. They couldn't get to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   This modeling thing is new for them. When Allison was 13, she
tried competing in a couple of pageants. With braces on her teeth,
she won Miss Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 14, she visited a modeling agency in New York. ``He
didn't see potential or any- thing. I figured I would wait a couple
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Other finalists already knew their way around. Samantha Harris,
18, took a year off from school in Texas to pursue modeling in
Paris. Ashleigh Borman, 15, just signed with a Dallas agency.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't competitive, they said. ``What do we have to
lose?'' They hung out in a corner of the salon, hair in funky get
ups, and chatted.
</P>
<P>
   They told the Entertainment Tonight reporter she was aging well.
</P>
<P>
   At your first major photo shoot, do you wear:
</P>
<P>
   a.) a slip-type dress with a leather jacket?
</P>
<P>
   b.) a blue shimmery top with a black skirt?
</P>
<P>
   c.) a bright-pink sleeveless dress?
</P>
<P>
   d.) all of the above?
</P>
<P>
   At first, the photographer didn't like the Polaroids.
</P>
<P>
   Then the art director didn't like the neckline.
</P>
<P>
   Then somebody didn't like something.
</P>
<P>
   Then the button-up shirt was missing a button.
</P>
<P>
   Allison finally got approval in a V-neck sheath over a
light-blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   The shoot was in a vast white studio not far from New York's
newest hot neighborhood, SoHo. They could see the World Trade
Center from the windows. Reggae blasted from a sound system on a
rolling cart.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were shot one at a time. The others waited, chose
outfits from racks donated by up- and-coming designers. They
compared their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be shy on me now, girl!'' the photographer shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too shy,'' Allison said, looking down and folding her
hands. Then she stuck out her tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who chooses the cover girl was sitting nearby,
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an interesting kind of boyish kind of look,'' said
Florence Sicard-Russo, Seventeen's art di- rector. ``It's very hard
for us to find models with short hair.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, the eight girls will know Sicard-Russo's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what the Seventeen cover look is, she said.
They try to go for beauty that's unusual, then they get letters
asking ``How could you use a girl so ugly?''
</P>
<P>
   During your New York stay, do you get the chance to see:
</P>
<P>
   a.) the president of Chanel?
</P>
<P>
   b.) Sarah McLachlan?
</P>
<P>
   c.) the guitarist from Garbage?
</P>
<P>
   d.) all of the above?
</P>
<P>
   The press event took place in a replica of Coco Chanel's
original Paris salon. Someone lined up chairs to form a runway on
the carpet. Waiters wandered with finger foods and champagne.
</P>
<P>
   In back, the girls sang Christmas songs to get over being
nervous. ``Don't fall,'' Allison told herself. ``Don't trip.'' They
primped.
</P>
<P>
   They were announced one by one, in alphabetical order. Some
hurried down the runway and back, then joined the others, who were
holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long. People were free to mingle. Scouts from
modeling agencies moved forward, calling some girls by name.
``Ashleigh, hi!''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hunter, Karin Models: ``I like the girl with the curly
hair. But they had a girl with curly hair last year. Allison's
bubbly. She has a lot of personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Planit, vice president, International Management Group: ``I
would say Sheena and Samantha are my favorites. Allison has a
really pretty face, but she doesn't strike me as a flashy model.''
</P>
<P>
   Some girls got business cards. Allison did not. ``I know
Ashleigh had an appointment with an agency on Thursday,'' she said,
after returning to Port St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   She was pooped. They got the entire model treatment, even
jumping up to walk the runway at the Fashion Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, she said, ``all I could do was smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Once home, do you:
</P>
<P>
   a.) sleep in?
</P>
<P>
   b.) get compliments from mom on your hair?
</P>
<P>
   c.) decide to start a modeling portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   d.) all of the above?

Service.

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ The one truth in presidential
campaigns is ... that there is no one truth to be found there.
Rather, there are lots of forks in the political trail that lead to
either success or ruin. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED. EMBARGOED
UNTIL JULY 26.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Few in this country beyond our foreign-policy
cognoscenti noticed, but while the world was recently and
enthusiastically adopting a basic American ideal to try government
leaders or their agents for war crimes and for crimes against
humanity, Washington copped out. There were two reasons: ``Jesse''
and ``Helms.'' (Teepen, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Like most cities, Waco is trying to
do something about two problems with numbers: too many stray
animals roaming the streets and too many stray children doing the
same. These are not concurrent conditions _ no reports of teen boys
group-sniffing fireplugs or of terrier mixes hogging ``Street
Fighter'' at the arcade. But both problems clearly merge at an
underlying numbers problem: Too many dumb adults. (Young, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ I'm sitting on the back porch under the ceiling
fans, watching a thunderstorm meander this way. It's teasing me,
thunder occasionally sounding, a rare pleasant breeze bringing a
welcome respite from this hellish summer, but no rain yet. Life is
good, and now I can work while sitting in this lawn chair or
whileswinging on the antique porch swing built by a long-dead
friend of my in-laws. If this computer could just make it rain,
everything would be perfect. (Borders,
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Cox Newspapers columnist Howard Kleinberg is
on vacation. His column will resume for Wednesday, July 29.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ Cox Newspapers columnist Joe Murray is traveling
and reporting in Europe. His column will resume the week of July 27
with reports from abroad. (Murray, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ After Thelma Shepherd died in 1996, her three
surviving daughters went through her papers and photo albums,
expecting to find nothing more than memories of a past as familiar
as her well-loved features. Then, in an album of old family photos,
they were startled to find a reference to their ``baby brother,''
Guy Wilk, in France, conceived when their father was a soldier
stationed in Metz, France, guarding German POWs in World War II.
Neither their mother nor their father, who died in 1983, ever spoke
a word about him. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Ronald Reagan's decision to
dance with the Christian right now has the Republican Party dancing
to a gospel tune. Before Reagan's advisers decided to mix politics
and religion in exchange for votes, the GOP stood primarily for
fiscal conservatism, a strong defense and rugged individualism.
(Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ The old editorial writer on The Hartford
(Conn.) Courant who wrote that everybody talks about the weather
but nobody does anything about it should be living today. Nowadays
everybody is going crazy trying to conquer the weather. And I'm
here to say I'm very tired of it. (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED 7/23. EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26.

   TEEN-MODEL _ You're an attractive teen from Port St. Lucie. Do
you: a.) get chosen from 20,000 girls for a chance to be Seventeen
magazine's covergirl? b.) fly to New York c.) meet the guitarist
for Garbage d.) all of the above. Allison Willis has brown eyes,
but she brought green ones (contacts) just in case. She also
brought her blanky and a reminder to not chew her nails. Models
shouldn't chew their nails. And Allison, 16, was about to play one.
Seventeen magazine chose the Port St. Lucie, Florida teen as one of
eight finalists for its New Model of the Year contest and flew her
to New York this month. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

New York. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   CONDO-BOOM _ AUSTIN _ Deanna Engber is trading in her apartment
for a condominium. Buying the two-bedroom Barton Hills condo makes
sense and will leave Engber with a monthly mortgage payment of
about $900 a month. That's less than she would pay for many
comparable apartments in Central Austin, which are renting for
$1,000 a month and up. Engber, and many like her, have contributed
to an Austin condo boom, a phenomenon many thought they never would
see again after the real estate bust of the late 1980s. (Breyer,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-CHILDCARE PALM BEACH _ While some Internet companies
use videocameras to give parents the ability to watch their child
in day care, Safe Technologies International plans to take the
concept a step further and give parents the ability to have a
conversation ``face-to-face'' on a computer screen with their child
or child's teacher. (Bhatt, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   LAWNS-WATER _ Water crimes: Do you water your lawn in the
afternoon after work? Do you wet your shrubs with the sprinkler?
How about those pots? When was the last time you saw water seep out
the bottoms? If you've never thought about the proper way to water
you could be doing your lawns and garden more harm than good. Check
out this primer on the do's and donts for watering. (Flanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   TREATY-OAK _ AUSTIN _ They are small green stalks, less than a
foot high, so tiny and delicate, it's hard to imagine that one day
each could grow into sturdy oak trees 100 feet high. These are the
offspring of the centuries-old Treaty Oak, its first saplings grown
since the downtown landmark was poisoned in 1989. Their growers
hope to begin selling them to the public soon. The plight of the
Treaty Oak drew international attention. Because of the poison,
experts don't believe the oak, on Baylor Street between Fifth and
Sixth streets, will ever grow back to its former proportions.

   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   CHILDRENOFGOD _ They were the Jesus Freaks, the Children of God
and now The Family. Among their techniques for evangelizing was
``flirty fishing'' - sending attractive young women out to seduce
and sleep with men to bring them into the fold. One long-time
practitioner of this was Miriam Williams, now a graduate student in
sociology at Georgia State University and author of a new book,
``Heaven's Harlot.'' (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-TEENS _ Imagine 30,000 teenagers descending on Atlanta
for five days. Could be a frightening experience. But these
youngsters, part of the National Lutheran Youth Conference that
begins today (July 25), will be spending most of their time
participating in community service projects and prayer. (Blake,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-GRAHAM _ Franklin Graham, founder of the international
relief organization Samaritan's Purse and recognized successor to
his father, evangelist Billy Graham, told the story of his own life
in his first book, ``Rebel With a Cause.'' Now, in ``Living Beyond
the Limits,'' Graham recounts the stories of other people who have
made an impression on him. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-MUSIC _ Most music fans know DC Talk through their
music. Their last album, ``Jesus Freak,'' went platinum and netted
the trio a Grammy Award for best rock gospel album. Yet less people
know about the group's public campaign to promote racial unity.
This interracial trio created the ERACE (Eliminating Racism and
Creating Equality) Foundation last year to promote what they call,
``living integration.'' A talk with DC Talk member Toby McKeehan
about their campaign. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)v

Texas, with photos from Rebecca McEntee, this about the
experimental stuff that sometimes draws controversy. (Barnes,
Austin American-Statesman) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   RYAN-REVIEW _ Artists understand the ugly truth that there can
be beauty in horror and horror in beauty. So do soldiers, who speak
of the resplendence that can accompany the grisliest battles. So
does Steven Spielberg, a movie director with an instinct for the
pretty shot. Perhaps only he could direct a film about combat
that's both unflinchingly brutal and reflexively beautiful.
(Schwann, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HEART _ The irony is too much for Ann Wilson. One of the first
women to break into the testosterone-fueled world of hard rock, the
lead singer of Heart sought a place on this year's Lilith Fair,
that celebration of all things feminine and musical. And she was
rejected. Adding to the irony is the fact that Wilson, the voice
behind such Heart hits as Straight On, Magic Man, Crazy on You and
Barracuda, has decided to mount her own tour this summer. And when
she begins her tour this summer, she'll be competing head-to-head
with Lilith. (Passy, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen's beauty director, Liz Brous, looked over photos of
the eight finalists and explained what got them to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Willis, 16, Port St. Lucie: ``She looked like a really
happy, cool girl. She looked real experimental. She said she cut
off her hair on April Fools' Day. She looks like that kind of
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin Sweers, 17, Iowa: ``Look at her fine hair and freckles. She
sent us these teeny school pictures. She looked so fresh and
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Borum, 15, Maryland: ``We loved her smile. We don't want
them cold and model-y looking. You can tell by her smile how she
would be in front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Harris, 18, Texas: ``We wanted curly hair. We loved it,
just had to have the hair. We didn't want the readers to think you
have to have stick-straight hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mila Williams, 15, California: ``A great smile, and such
beautiful skin. One of her parents is from the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena Lutes, 16, Georgia: ``We needed at least somebody blonde
and blue-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Elcyzyn, 18, Oklahoma: ``The freckles. We get a lot of
letters about freckles. She has an interesting look that really
struck everyone. Those almond-shaped eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashleigh Borman, 15, Texas: ``She looks like a girl Seventeen
uses as a model already. She definitely has potential.''

   PALESTINIANS-TOURISM (Bethlehem, West Bank) _ The traditional

pilgrims and curious tourists. It is not, and with the Mideast
peace process going nowhere, the perception that the region is
dangerous persists. Still, would-be entrepreneurs hope that
celebrations planned in 2000 will boost the Palestinian tourism

<P>
   MEXICO-CHIAPAS (Mosoja Shucja, Mexico) _ Gnawing through its
fifth year, the Indian rebellion in Chiapas continues to devour

backbiting and religious schisms. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS. (For release

halls in Milan, Munich and Vienna than in his hometown. By DOUG

   FILM-REVIEW-RYAN (Undated) _ ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven
Spielberg's new movie on World War II, is a powerful film that
shows the horrors and heroism of battle. The movie stars Tom Hanks

</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-RYAN-1 (Undated) _ It is my pleasure to announce
that not only is ``Saving Private Ryan'' the best movie Steven
Spielberg ever made, but it is a terrific movie by any standards.
Spielberg is growing up. By BARBARA SHULGASSER.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-RYAN-2 (Undated) _ The 25-minute opening scene
(following a small preamble) of ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a stark,
sickening, rivetingly ugly portrait of war and the costs of
heroism. It is a ghastly masterpiece. To watch is to feel both
attracted and repelled drawn in by the power of Steven Spielberg's
filmmaking, repulsed by the face of death. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM--REVIEW-MAFIA! (Undated) _ Would the late actor Lloyd
Bridges want to be remembered this way? His last major film turned
out to be ``Mafia!,'' a degenerate flop that's meant to send-up
gangster films _ but instead parodies the parodies. By ANDY SUMMA.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MAFIA-2 (Undated) _ I wish I could report that
``Mafia!'' is half as funny as ``Airplane!,'' ``The Naked Gun'' or
``Hot Shots!,'' other items on director-writer Jim Abrahams'
resume. Abrahams has created a number of hilarious moments in this
spoof of ``The Godfather'' but not enough to keep a more or less
one-gag movie going. By BARBARA SHULGASSER.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-PI (Undated) _ ``PI'' will not be for everyone, but
for those who are fed up with the mainstream idiocy that gets
dumped into theaters each summer, this movie will be like a great
big palate-clearing taste of sorbet. By BARBARA SHULGASSER.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PROFILE-SPIELBERG (Undated) _ Here's a guy who has more
than proven himself. He has all the money anyone will ever need,
has created some of the biggest box-office hits ever made, has in
recent years raked in critical accolades and has a fulfilling
family life. And yet he worries about being pigeon-holed. By G.
ALLEN JOHNSON.

   TV-NBC (Pasadena, Calif.) _ NBC has been riding a remarkable
wave of good fortune this past decade. Yet the network is as much a
story of survivors as it is of success. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-CBS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ If CBS ever does pass NBC to become
the No. 1 ranked network _ and some think that will happen this
season _ it will be one of the most improbable stories of a
cobbled-together, who-would-have-guessed, beat-the-odds network. By
TIM GOODMAN.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Dave DeWard is well aware of the
world's imperfections. From his perspective, this country's refusal
to put Pat Buchanan in the White House is proof enough of that. But
after his recent brush with the criminal justice system, he now has
a sharper appreciation of how grim things can really get. By DAN
LYNCH.

   MANAGED-CARE (San Francisco) _ Daily we read news stories about

   JERICHO, West Bank _ This won't be the first time that there was
an infamous temptation near this ancient oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Mount of Temptation, where The Devil offered
Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, construction crews are working
overtime to finish the first modern casino in the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this sleepy Muslim town say gambling offends their
religious values. But, with the approval of Palestinian leaders,
the slot machines and 35 gaming tables will open sometime this
fall. After that will come the entertainment lounge, 10-story
hotel, golf course and swimming pool.

<P>
   All of it is directly across the street from the block houses
and dirt roads of a Palestinian refugee camp. Donkeys mill near the
entrance and goats graze nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they could be replaced by the Las Vegas-styled white
tigers of Siegfried(CQ) and Roy, should they ever appear at ``The
Oasis Hotel and Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is minutes from Jericho, population 15,000. The
Israelites conquered the 10,000-year-old city in 1250 B.C. by
making the ``walls come tumbling down.'' It was ruled by Herod
under the Romans and Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River nearby.
</P>
<P>
   At 825 feet below sea level, Jericho was a warm winter vacation
spot when ruled by Jordan. The Israelis captured it in the war of
1967. In the 1990s, it became the first West Bank city Israeli
troops withdrew from under the Oslo peace accords, ushering in the
rule of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 million casino project is headed by an Austrian casino
company with Palestinian investors and the cooperation with the
Palestinian National Authority, headed by President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is expected to attract Israelis, who have outlawed
casinos in their home country but have frequented Turkish casinos a
short airplane flight away. It will also be a draw for
international tourists and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Just 40 minutes from Jerusalem, the project is on the outskirts
of Jericho. That could be a comfort to Israelis who are often
skittish about crossing into the West Bank and driving through
Palestinian towns.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman with the Israeli public relations firm
representing the project said it will be open to foreigners, not
Palestinians, just as Egyptian hotel casinos exclude local
Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   That is just fine with many Jericho residents, who would rather
their quiet town remain known as ``The World's Oldest City'' rather
than home to the biggest casino resort in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of people in Jericho don't like the idea of
having a casino,'' said Jericho municipal spokesman Bassam
Abedrabbo, who stressed that the project was authorized by the
Palestinian national leadership, not the town.
</P>
<P>
   The 220-room hotel, he said, will be the biggest building in
Jericho and many feel it will not fit in.
</P>
<P>
   But, the biggest objections are on moral grounds that sound like
those raised against casino projects in the United States. Only
this time it is Muslims, rather than Christians, who are offended.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a local pool hall _ where the game is played without
wagering _ the casino project has no backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conservative. With a casino, there will be a lot of
girls they will import from abroad,'' said 20-year-old student Ziad
Saradih. ``No one will control what's going on in the casino and
that will result in destroying the values of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Tadmor, Tel Aviv-based spokeswoman for Casinos Austria,
said the project will provide 1,000 jobs. Hundreds of Palestinians
are already working on the construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Jericho residents question whether any of the big money will
stay in their community. The project might even keep some tourists
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bypass Jericho,'' said David C. Hall, a Baptist
minister from Oklahoma who leads several tours a year to Jericho.
``I do not bring people who spend thousands of dollars to see the
land of our Lord to see a gambling casino.''

RULE OF THUMB ON DUPLICATE FILES: WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T DELETE THEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to clean my hard drive of duplicate files, but I'm
not sure which files to delete. Can you give me some insight as to
which files are needed? My problem is I don't know which directory
needs the files in question. How can I distinguish them and delete
the right file?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a simple rule you can follow: If you don't know
whether to delete a file, then don't.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features found in lots of uninstall and
clean-up-your-hard-drive programs is a duplicate file finder.
Often, the files it finds in the vast reaches of a user's hard
drive duplicate those found in the Windowssystem folder.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on a second.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, those files aren't really duplicates. If you look
closely, they'll have different file sizes and dates on them. That
means they are different versions of the same files.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where users get into trouble. They believe they need only
one version, so they delete the older one. Or, they've heard that
all of these system files _ usually with extensions of DLL _ should
only be in the Windowssystem folder, and they remove the duplicate
found in an ordinary program folder.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, they'll find their system starts crashing a
lot. Or a program doesn't run. Or they suffer mysterious lockups.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is that programs written at different times rely on
different versions of key system files. Let's say you've got a copy
of FindElvis 1.0, written back in the early days of Windows 95. You
install it on your new, Windows 98-based PC. You look in your
system folder and see a DLL file called BIGFILE.DLL, dated 5/6/98.
But in your FindElvis folder, there's another file called
BIGFILE-.DLL, and it's got a date of 8/24/95.
</P>
<P>
   When FindElvis 1.0 was written, the programmer who created it
may have relied on certain aspects of the older version of BIGFILE.
If you delete that older version from the FindElvis directory, you
may not be able to find Elvis at all _ the program may not have
what it needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you delete the version in Windowssystem, then other programs
that might also use it can't get to it, because they don't know
about the FindElvis folder. They expect to find BIGFILE in the
system folder.
</P>
<P>
   When you can delete duplicate files is when they are exactly the
same size, have exactly the same name and exactly the same date.
Even then, don't delete the duplicate at first. Change the file's
name instead. If your system runs fine for a few days, then delete
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent question, a reader asked if it is better to
install a new motherboard first or Windows 98. You answered with
the motherboard. This is true, but before the user turns off the
computer to install it, he or she should go into the DeviceManager
and remove the old board's resources. This helps in that when the
PC is turned on with the new board, Windows isn't looking for the
old one and should not cause a lot of conflicts. This is helpful
when installing most new hardware and prevents a lot of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A: You raise a good point. If the board you're installing is
fully Plug and Play compliant, there should be no problems. But
removing the drivers in Device Manager under System
Devices/Motherboard resources could prevent some lockups _ thanks
for the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the most important components for decent Web-surfing
speed? Modem? Memory? Chip speed?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, of course, is your connection speed. Above a certain
processor speed _ say, 166 megahertz _ most browser software
performs about the same. So, what you really want is more memory so
the browser software runs smoothly and your operating system
doesn't write to the hard disk as often, which slows everything
down.

COMPUTER MUSCLE GETTING EASIER TO BUY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although computers priced below $1,000 get most of the attention
these days, the guts and glory in PCs are still in the high end. If
you want serious power, you'll have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't have to pay much. For about the past 18 months,
the average price for a state-of-the-art Windows-based personal
computer has ranged between $2,000 and $2,600, down from $2,500 to
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   If your needs are basic _ word processing, home finance,
Internet access, children's software _ you probably don't need a
muscle-bound machine. Spend your cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're into serious gaming, computer graphics and
multimedia, here are two systems to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5630, $2,600, Compaq Computer Corp.: Although
Compaq's Presario line is the most popular in home computing, it's
always suffered a bad rap from PC enthusiasts. They argue that the
Presario is so loaded down with bells and whistles that its
performance suffers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Presarios once were loaded with proprietary
components _ sound and graphics systems built into the main system
board, modems mated with sound cards, and so on. As a result, those
who wanted speed and control over the configuration of their own
systems looked elsewhere, often at direct marketers such as Dell
and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's answer is a new line of high-end Presarios that don't
suffer from performance anxiety. The 5630, Compaq's top-of-the-line
Presario, is fast, easy to upgrade and still has enough bells and
whistles to satisfy the greediest gadget freak.
</P>
<P>
   The 5630 comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip; a generous
128 megabytes of memory; a 10-gigabyte hard drive; a DVD-ROM drive;
a built-in Zip drive; a 56K fax modem that uses the new v.90
standard; a four-megabyte ATI 3D Rage LT Pro AGP-based graphics
card; and a sound card that uses the impressive new Aureal 3D audio
standard.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with a built-in Ethernet port, so you can plug it
directly into a home network. There are also two Universal Serial
Bus and one IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire or iLink) connections
on the front of the machine, making it easy to plug in camcorders,
digital cameras and scanners that use these kinds of connections.
</P>
<P>
   Both the modem and the video card on this computer are on
removable cards, so if something better comes along, you can
replace them. There are also plenty of open slots for further
expandability.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq ships this system with a fancy keyboard that includes a
handy volume control, easy-access buttons for sound and playing
music CDs, and a set of four buttons aimed at making it easier to
get to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those last four buttons are programmable, but figuring out how
to use them is tricky. Most of them point you to Web sites that pay
Compaq a little cash whenever you visit. This strikes me as just a
bit sleazy, particularly since changing the settings is not as easy
as it should be. Compaq has released a software patch that is
supposed to make it easier to change the buttons, but I have not
yet tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is selling this machine on its Web site, as well as
through kiosks it is installing in computer and electronic stores
around the country. You can order it with extra features, such as a
Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D II graphics card or a Syquest
1.5-gigabyte removable disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   I tried this system with a new, 14-inch, flat-panel monitor, the
FP500, that was a serious disappointment. Though it's an
active-matrix display, it's almost as dark and hard to see as a
passive-matrix system. At $999, it's too expensive for most home
users to consider. Stick with one of Compaq's traditional monitors
until the price on this comes down and the quality of the display
goes up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pavilion 8290, $2,600, Hewlett-Packard: Although this model is
relatively old _ it was replaced earlier this month by the 8380 _
it's still on store shelves and probably can be found for less than
the list price shown here. The 8380 has a list price of just more
than $2,000, so it's possible this older model might be found for
less than that.
</P>
<P>
   The 8290 comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip; 64
megabytes of memory; a roomy 12-gigabyte hard drive; a
four-megabyte ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP-based video card; a DVD-ROM
drive; a 56K fax modem; and 3-D stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's keyboard also comes with buttons and controls
for volume, playing music CDs and launching some programs. In fact,
Hewlett-Packard pioneered these keyboards, and they do it better
than anyone else. It's much easier to reconfigure these buttons
than those of the Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Although the HP is not quite as zippy as the Compaq, which could
be chalked up to having only half the amount of memory, it still
will not disappoint. And like the Compaq, it is highly expandable.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find this machine and opt for the 8380 instead,
note that it will have 96 megabytes of memory, but a smaller hard
drive at eight gigabytes. It also has USB ports on the front of the
machine. Otherwise, they're almost twins.

WORLD'S RICHEST NATION NEEDS TO RETHINK HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIT COSTELLO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's not buy the supposedly authoritative
pronouncement that comprehensive health care reform is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The health care industry scared the daylights out of the public
during debate four years ago over President Clinton's flawed
proposals, but that doesn't mean the concerns don't continue. For
the uninsured and the insured, health care insecurity has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us in real life resemble Harry and Louise, that famously
smug couple from the televised commercials. Yet this fictitious
couple successfully pandered to Americans' worst fears over
``government intrusion.'' They warned us that if ``the government''
is involved, we'll have higher costs, fewer choices,
unresponsiveness and burdensome bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later we have all of that and more, courtesy of the
health care corporations and their overpaid chief executives,
consultants and care-denying layers of bean counters. Daily we read
news stories about dissatisfaction with managed care, Medicare
fraud and overbilling. We read about doctors and nurses in open
revolt against cost-cutting pressures that have an impact on care.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by proponents and opponents of market-driven health care
call into question that presumed lack of public support for
systemic reform. Politicians should take heed at what the opinion
polls show.
</P>
<P>
   A group of reform advocates and organizations commissioned GLS
Research to conduct a random poll of 400 voters in Washington
state. The findings: Eighty-three percent of respondents (including
65 percent of voters identifying themselves as conservative) agreed
with the statement: ``Americans have a basic right to health
insurance regardless of their ability to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent agreed with this: ``By getting rid of red tape,
administration, advertising and huge executive salaries in the
insurance industry, we can expand health care coverage while
reducing its cost.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``It's not right to let health insurance companies make
huge profits when so many people are uninsured because they can't
afford insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Results were about the same for a survey conducted by the
American Hospital Association, an industry trade group, which
surveyed public attitudes with 31 focus groups in 12 states,
utilizing data from 1,000 polled voters. It found people are
insecure about their health insurance and mistrustful of health
care insurers and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The public's ``image grid'' was summarized this way: ``America
has the best technology and training in the world but increasingly,
cost and other factors are barriers to access. These barriers are
caused largely by the greed of insurers and providers. Because of
this, providers and patients are losing control over important
health care decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such findings indicate a phenomenal readiness to reopen the
debate on health care coverage and better public oversight of
hospitals, and a desire to see the health care dollar spent on
care.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was never made public by the hospital
association but was widely leaked, also identified major ``building
block images'' of health care and hospital care today. They
included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans of every age and economic status (excepting many
seniors on Medicare) expressed strong fear of the loss or erosion
of their health coverage and thus economic access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many Americans see neither a planned system nor any
consumer-oriented organization, but quite the opposite. They see a
confusing, expensive, unreliable and often impersonal assembly of
medical professionals and institutions. If they see any ``system''
at all, it is one devoted to maximizing profits by blocking access,
reducing quality, and limiting spending _ all at the expense of the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average American believes that health insurance companies
have too much influence and exert too much control over personal
care _ more than their doctor, hospital, the government, or
themselves, sometimes more than all of them combined.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most believe profit has taken precedence at the expense of
quality.
</P>
<P>
   _ The key indicator cited as a measure of quality in hospital
care was the nurse. Respondents hold a strong belief that skilled
nurses are being systematically replaced by poorly trained and
poorly paid aides. The profit motive is seen as behind the
reduction in nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   _ A consistent concern was that advertising and other forms of
marketing were being done at the expense of quality.
</P>
<P>
   The public knows that health care in the United States is in a
meltdown phase. And they know it from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering around the edges with HMO incremental strategies will
not solve the fundamental problem. As long as health care is
treated like a market commodity, the abuses that have become
notorious will dominate public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   No other industrialized country treats health care like this. It
is considered a social responsibility subject to democratic public
policy solutions.
</P>
<P>
   If individuals, employers and corporations share responsibility
for funding through a fair formula, we could do what other
industrialized countries do _ offer health security to all. We
spend far more than any other country on health care _ 14.5 percent
of our gross domestic product _ yet have 42 million uninsured
(about 20 percent of us) and 31 million more underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to reintroduce the subject of universal health care in
the richest country in the world. Just ask the average person.

CRIME AND LACK OF PUNISHMENT

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dave DeWard is well aware of the world's
imperfections. From his perspective, this country's refusal to put
Pat Buchanan in the White House is proof enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   But after his recent brush with the criminal justice system, he
now has a sharper appreciation of how grim things can really get.
</P>
<P>
   Dave DeWard is a burly, jovial, right-wing political activist
who operates a parking lot. One morning, at about 1:30, he was
lying in bed, listening to talk radio. That's when a knock came at
the door of his apartment in Troy, a gritty old industrial city
across the Hudson River from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of this month. A new neighbor was moving in
that morning. All that day, people had been banging on Dave
DeWard's door looking for the new neighbor. He figured that this
was just more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   So he got out of bed in his underwear, went to the front door
and removed the bolt and chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I go flying,'' he told me. ``The door comes flying
in. I hit furniture, with my lower back, especially ... The first
thing I see is this guy standing with his foot right on me. And he
has two women with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two women go scurrying through my apartment. This guy is
standing on my chest. He's not saying one word. And I'm not saying
one word to him, either. I'm just looking to get a good description
of him ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear drawers opening. I hear all kinds of noises. I just lie
there, 'cause who knows if you're going to get killed or not ... It
seemed like an hour, but it was probably more like 15 minutes. They
go through the whole place ...
</P>
<P>
   ``As they leave, I go out the door and I try to get the license
number. They drove off without lights in this big, brown Cadillac,
but I could see well enough to tell you who sat where in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing, I try to see what's gone. And then I call the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, Dave DeWard said, showed up in about 12 minutes. And, while
they were talking to him, a call came over the police radio. A man
and two women fitting the description Dave DeWard had given the
cops over the phone had just been nabbed with his ATM card at a
nearby bank branch.
</P>
<P>
   The cops took Dave DeWard to the bank branch. He identified the
man and the two women. Everybody went to the station. Dave DeWard
said he was treated royally. The cops even let him smoke. They told
him that the man and the two women immediately started squealing on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   So, Dave DeWard had a sore back, but he was still alive. He
hadn't lost any money. All three suspects were in custody. Under
the circumstances, a reasonably happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few days later and just before the Fourth of July
holiday, Dave DeWard got a message on his machine from a Rensselaer
County assistant district attorney. Call me, the D.A. said. Dave
called. He and the prosecutor played phone tag for that day and the
next.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday came and went. Then, the Tuesday after the holiday,
he got another message from the assistant D.A. You're an hour late
for court, the message said. Get down to city court right away.
</P>
<P>
   Dave DeWard ran to city court. He was told he'd ignored a
subpoena. He said he'd never received any subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out,'' he told me, ``that two of the three
individuals were released because I wasn't there. The one they kept
because there was another warrant for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, turned out to be precisely what happened. I
checked. One of the suspects, Laurie Johnson, 36, is currently in
residence in the Rensselaer County Jail. She has a lengthy criminal
record, mostly involving prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy City Court Judge Hank Bauer did release the other two
on no bail, since the prosecution hadn't had the victim present,
nor an arresting officer, nor had the cops taken an affidavit from
the victim on the night of the crime that could be submitted as
evidence. Since Antron Hilton, 29, had done state prison time for
drug dealing and Shannon Houser, 23, had done time for
prostitution, I called the judge to ask why he hadn't given the
prosecution the extension they'd asked for to produce any or all of
that, but he never got back to me.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Houser did, in fact, skip her scheduled court appearance
earlier this month. There's now a warrant out for her. That has
not, though, kept somebody who calls herself Shannon from calling
Dave DeWard, he told me.

   ``I'm getting hang-up calls on my machine,'' he said. ``and she
left her name once.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did she say when she called?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You son of a bitch. I want to talk to you. I know
you're there. Pick up the goddamn phone ... I finally got hold of
the assistant D.A. I was worried for my life. He told me, `Don't
worry ... I promise you that they wouldn't be stupid enough to come
near you again.''

<P>
   All three suspects were issued orders of protection requiring
them to stay away from Dave DeWard. The problem is that one order
of protection _ the one for Antron Hilton _ was mailed to Mr.
Hilton at Dave DeWard's address. A clerical error by city court, I
was told by the district attorney's office, and that was probably
only a copy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' I asked Dave DeWard, ``What do you think about all
this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he told me, ``I'm a little concerned for my safety.
But now when people ask me why I'm for Buchanan, I have a good
story to tell them.''

WHAT'S `OUT THERE'? A BUNCH OF STELLAR CORPSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   I dislike being an alarmist, but THE SUN IS DYING! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know you are apathetic about this _ and may become even more
so when I tell you the sun won't turn into a burned out husk for
about 5 billion years (if scientists are to be believed). But if we
don't start planning and worrying now, one of these days our
great-great-etc.-grandchildren are going to freeze to death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And as these lovely children suck in their final frozen breath,
they will exhale curses at us for not acting when we had a chance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may want that on your eternal conscience. But I don't. If I
have to spend eternity thinking about bad stuff, I'd rather be
reading the sports pages and learning that the Chicago Cubs now
have gone, say, 11,397 years since last winning the World Series in
1945. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this summer is a good time to fret about the
impending death of our sun, not only because it's hot _ a situation
exacerbated by Al Gore running around preaching sermons about
global warming _ but also because some astronomers in Australia
have just announced exciting, if distressing, new developments in
the oft-neglected field of stellar corpse observation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you may want to keep stellar corpse observation on
your list of employment possibilities when you talk to young people
in your family about careers because so few of them will think of
it if you fail to mention it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) in Epping,
Australia, recently disclosed they have confirmed the discovery of
almost 100 previously unknown stellar corpses. I was deeply
saddened to learn about this, especially because the announcement
included no information on whether surviving suns(CQ) and daughters
have been notified. Nor did the announcement reveal what in the
world (literally _ in the world) one does with 100 star bodies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But these stellar corpses _ also known as ``planetary nebulae''
_ are just the beginning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate,'' said Quentin Parker of the AAO, ``we can
expect about 1,000 new planetary nebulae to be confirmed in the
southern Milky Way galaxy over the next three years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Let's take a quick vote. Raise your hand if you prefer
planetary nebulae. OK. How about stellar corpses? Good. Me too.
It's stellar corpses.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My fondest hope is that our own sun will not be among the
deceased to be found in the next three years. The best guess, as I
say, is that it should last another 5 billion years, but you have
to remember that scientists don't always get it right. Which
scientist, after all, predicted 5 billion years ago that by 1998
you could watch reruns of ``Starsky &AMP; Hutch'' on 76 cable channels
at once? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our sun, as you surely learned in school, is a star, not unlike
a hootybazillion other stars in the cosmos. Which means it's a
sphere of luminous gas (I can't tell you how hard I'm having to
work to avoid a Rush Limbaugh joke here). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun generates energy by nuclear fusion, which means it's
really, really hot when you touch it, which I don't recommend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers estimate our sun _ which hangs out some 93 million
miles from Earth _ is one of about 100 billion stars in the Milky
Way, and they classify it as a yellow dwarf of the spectral class
G2. Which may mean something to them but which means zippo to me,
perhaps because I am not a yellow dwarf but, rather, kind of a tall
white guy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What should we do about our dying sun? I don't know, but maybe
we should take a hint from TV, and, if the sun really is
slip-sliding away, send it into reruns, where many dead stars enjoy
eternal life. &QL;
</P>
<P>

IN A RISKY BUSINESS, NBC EXCELS AT GIVING SHOWS A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ NBC has been riding a remarkable wave of good
fortune this past decade. Yet the network is as much a story of
survivors as it is of success.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Conan O'Brien sat down for a string of
satellite interviews. During the course of the interviews, he was
told over and over how he and his show ``Late Night'' were bombing.
So he did the logical thing: He went back into his office and
curled up in a ball under his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fontana, the executive producer of ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' knew he was doing something different, something good.
The question was would the network and the audience get it?
Long-term planning wasn't an issue when his drama opened to
critical acclaim but virtually no viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had said to me the first season, `You're going to make
100 episodes,' I would have said to you, `I don't even know if
we're going to get past the first commercial,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``Conan'' enters his sixth season; ``Homicide,'' its
seventh. Both survived because both were able to take original
ideas and develop ways to connect with viewers and fend off
becoming road kill. The fact both are still on the air also says
something about NBC, and how the rich can get richer in this
business.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the basic contradiction in television: Good shows, more
often than not, need time to develop both an audience and a voice.
But networks, fearful of ratings and cash loss, are often quick to
yank a show off the air if it does not produce quickly. Sure, some
garbage remains on the schedule, and others are deservedly canned
early, but no one knows how many series could have developed into
quality programming if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   This is where NBC's success has fed off itself. It had
``Seinfeld,'' ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends,'' ``Mad About You,''
and even, earlier in the decade, ``Cheers.'' They are or were
ratings monsters and when you have that stable, you can afford to
take a few shots in the dark elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks struggling to move up the food chain don't have
that luxury. NBC will survive the loss of ``Seinfeld.'' Moving into
its time slot is ``Frasier,'' and new shows like ``Trinity,'' a
drama about an Irish family from Hell's Kitchen, and ``Will &AMP;
Grace,'' a sitcom that features a gay lead character, offer promise
of new hits.
</P>
<P>
   Survival is what NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield
is all about. He has been with the network 19 years, nine at the
top spot, in a profession where executives can be axed as quickly
as bad sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things you have to ask yourself is: `If we get rid
of it, could we do worse?''' Littlefield said. ``Enough things were
going right for us to say, `We can stick with this vision.'
Honestly, today, we are very happy we did,'' Littlefield said of
``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC players are quick to credit the media for keeping
``Homicide'' on the air, reminding us that these kinds of dramas
are almost always going to be as endangered as they are rare. But
NBC always knew the quality was there from the start, even if an
audience was not. Patience paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conan'' was another story. It was incredibly rough, heck, bad,
in the first two years. ``We had no idea what we were doing,''
Littlefield said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien sidekick Andy Richter agreed, saying that he thought the
show was always good, just in a rough form. ``It was always a
really well-written show ... with two nervous people who hadn't
been on TV five days a week ever before,'' he said. ``I felt from
the very beginning it was funny. We just continued working.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien went from being the butt of office and radio jokes to
the cover story on magazines. The man definitely remembers. He also
had the vision, and NBC the patience, to ride out the ridicule
until the show came into its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last laugh? I wouldn't be presumptuous enough, you know,
to come out here and say, `Well, it's done, and we won,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although, if you want to put that in your column, that's fine
with me. In fact, that's a great headline ...''

DARK HORSE CBS IS CATCHING UP TO NBC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If CBS ever does pass NBC to become the No. 1
ranked network, it will be one of the most improbable stories of a
cobbled-together, who-would-have-guessed, beat-the-odds network.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, it's business as usual in Hollywood. Because
nobody ever expected CBS to be No. 1 again for a long, long time.
Failure is almost a given with the network's built-in handicaps.
Suits _ and scribes _ never gave it a chance, saying things like
``CBS is the network of old people,'' or ``CBS is for rural middle
Americans, and Madison Avenue likes young, urban-dwelling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they think otherwise? Can a network ride a safe little
drama about angels to the top? Can it get there on the backs of the
geriatric journalists from ``60 Minutes''?
</P>
<P>
   This is a network whose only returning shows among those that
debuted last season were midseason replacements _ ``The Magnificent
Seven,'' which didn't exactly win the West, and ``Kids Say the
Darndest Things,'' a retread hosted by Bill Cosby, whose other main
show on CBS has sputtered badly. Everything else? Gone.
</P>
<P>
   And who would have thought there'd be a day that the once-proud
Tiffany Network would win only 36 Emmy nominations, just one more
than Fox?
</P>
<P>
   Bleak times, you say? Nonsense, says Leslie Moonves, president
and chief executive of CBS Television. This guy is motivated. He's
a believer. He knows he almost had it last year, but all the
disparate pieces weren't there. He smelled first place. Now he
couldn't be any hungrier.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Moonves is alone on an island with his beliefs,
his vision of transforming this baggage-laden network that he
inherited. But there are still plenty of tickets available to his
sermon, let's just say that.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the thing. It could happen. It's ludicrous and
unlikely, but the money here says don't count CBS out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of total viewers,'' Moonves said, ``in the 1995-96
season, we trailed NBC by 3.5 million viewers; 1996-97, we trailed
by 1.4 million viewers. This past season, we trailed them by less
than 800,000 viewers. Without `Seinfeld,' without football, we
think we're going to do much better this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he took the hit on last season: ``It wasn't our best
development year. There were a lot of disappointments,'' he said.
``Some of them had to do with scheduling, some of them had to do
with demographic problems on our network, and some of them had to
do with the fact that the shows just weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does he win with that hand? He gains from NBC's weakness,
obviously. Football brings in male viewers _ exactly the people
missing from CBS. ``Thirty-five and younger men weren't watching
anything on CBS over the last four years. We lost that group almost
entirely. Our demographics were horrific in that group. So it hurt
Letterman, it hurt the news, it hurt all the places where there was
potential for those demographics to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS will use football to market other shows to male viewers. The
network is predicting, seriously, ``6 billion impressions'' over an
entire football season.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   That's marketing mumbo jumbo for ``we paid a lot of money for
football for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the secret weapon. Moonves has led an almost solitary war
on the Madison Avenue standard of preaching to the youth market. He
doesn't have a youth market, so he's trying to change the system.
``And by the way, it's beginning to work,'' he says. ``It's not
happening fast enough for us, for our taste. But there is more and
more money being shifted to an older demographic _ 25 to 54s are
starting to take away from the 18 to 49s, and we hope that expands
even further. And that helps us immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   As for programs, there are very few standouts this season from
anybody, but CBS was the only network that passed on pilots from
major talent. If what they put on the air works, look out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a package deal, and not a cogent, pretty package
at that. All those ugly elements have to come together. It's an
against-the-odds strategy. A miracle in the making.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: Moonves believes.

`PRIVATE RYAN': WAR AT ITS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man's leg flies off. A bullet tears another man's brains out.
A soldier lies in the sand, clutching his own entrails; ``Mama!''
he calls out. ``Mama! Mama!''
</P>
<P>
   A medic stanches the blood pouring from the bony stump of a
young troop's shoulder. An officer drags a comrade to safety, only
to look back and find that his friend's been blown to shreds. A
radio controller's face is gutted by gunfire. A one-armed soldier
searches the ground, then stoops to recover his missing hand. He
carries it away.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the assault on Omaha Beach, D-Day, June 6, 1944. And
so begins the assault on the audience: The 25-minute opening scene
(following a small preamble) of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven
Spielberg's stark, sickening, rivetingly ugly portrait of war and
the costs of heroism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ghastly masterpiece. To watch is to feel both attracted
and repelled drawn in by the power of Spielberg's filmmaking,
repulsed by the face of death. The film dares us to see what
soldiers see in battle. It dares us to stick our hands into a gory
chest cavity, or place a blood-filled helmet on our head, or
casually murder surrendering Germans. It dares us, and we accept.
</P>
<P>
   War is a grotesque seductress.
</P>
<P>
   What a disturbing thing this film is: hideous yet beautiful,
elegant and compassionate and nauseating and black. Like
``Schindler's List'' and portions of ``Amistad'' before it,
``Saving Private Ryan'' is proof positive that the cinema's most
beguiling fantasist has changed, these last few years, into its
most brutal and gifted realist.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone always knew Spielberg could tell a story. But until
``Schindler,'' no one had an inkling what he might do with
history's cruelest lessons. The answer was: Show them to us. And
move us to horror.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all is the conflicted Capt. Miller, a role
filled with complexity and profound ease by Tom Hanks. Having
survived Omaha Beach, Miller is ordered to penetrate Nazi-occupied
France in a quest to find and return home Pvt. James Ryan (played,
once he materializes, by a pin-straight Matt Damon), whose three
brothers have just been killed in combat.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, ``Ryan'' is about everything war, humanity,
cruelty, death. In another, it's about nothing the plot whirls
around a mostly unseen goal (the titular Private Ryan), much the
way a Hitchcock thriller revolves around an invisible plot device.
The object isn't nearly as significant as the chase; and the chase,
during wartime, is a struggle with battalions of competitors but no
clear winner. It's vague but mortal mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Among the film's many virtues is its restraint in portraying
grief: Spielberg gives us just one glimpse of mother Ryan
collapsing to her knees in sorrow over her dead sons. That's all he
needs to show us. That's all we need to see before we, too,
collapse in tears. And ``Ryan'' is an excrutiatingly painful film.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rescue begins, the action is almost beyond description
_ it's all guns and bombs and bloodshed but what saves the film
from numbing sameness is its honestly sympathetic cast of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his men are people worth following: the steady Sgt.
Horvath (Tom Sizemore, of ``The Relic'' and ``Natural Born
Killers''), the bitter Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns, convincingly
snide), the naive Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies, desperate and
brittle), the hotshot Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper), the decent Pvt.
Caparzo (Vin Diesel), the sensitive medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi)
and the sardonic Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg, ripping with anger).
</P>
<P>
   Mellish shows off his Star of David to German POWs. ``Juden,''
he says, pointing to himself, as they march sullenly past.
</P>
<P>
   To say that some of these characters die before saving Pvt. Ryan
gives nothing away. More remarkable than their deaths on the field
of battle is how deeply the audience cares about them. Dialogue
(from Robert Rodat's brilliant, fact-based screenplay) is minimal
and terse; the most profound moments are echoing caverns of
subtext. When Ribisi's medic wonders why, as a boy, he pretended to
sleep when his mother wanted to chat, his eyes say what the rest of
him doesn't: That he might die. That he might not ever talk to his
mother again.
</P>
<P>
   There's room for a lot of rich acting between the lines. Ribisi
is a marvel of conscience and quivering pain, while Sizemore, as
the group's weathered second-in-command, is one of the film's
sturdiest emotional ballasts. Everyone gets a nod for
understatement, even Burns, whose slick-urban-jerk routine (see
``The Brothers McMullen'') is effectively muted by shellfire.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Hanks who holds the film together; it's Hanks whose
tired eyes betray the moral and physical fatigue of war. Capt.
Miller is simply the truest, deepest, most dexterous
characterization of his career, previous Oscars included. He might
win another one.
</P>
<P>
   Janusz Kaminski's extraordinary cinematography is just as
evocative here as it was in ``Schindler's List.'' It's in muted
color this time, but it has the same bluntness of shading and view,
like a ``March of Time'' newsreel unspooled for modern audiences.
There is no more powerful way to portray atrocities than to shoot
them, foursquare, with the impartial eye of a camera. It makes them
all the more startling. In fact, whole stretches of the Omaha Beach
scene and later battle sequences were shot by hand-held cameras
equipped with old-style shutters, giving the film's goriest
episodes the jangly feel of an old documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The result is beyond realism: It's hyper-realism, realism buzzed
on panic. Red spatters the soldiers' uniforms. It spatters their
helmets, their eyes, their hands. And it spatters the camera,
dirtying our view and forcing us to face, up front, the angry blood
of war.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ To see how much, and how quickly, the world
can change, one need look no further than a lecture hall close by
the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   The students here comfortably chat among themselves, listen
intently to their teachers, take notes, and invariably laugh
easily. It seems like any classroom at just about any university,
except that the participants share a history of hate, distrust, and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite remarkable, isn't it?'' said one of the 35
attendees, all of whom are senior officials of the major political
parties in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Great
Britain. Their weeklong series of seminars at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, which ends today, was their first
opportunity to interact as a group since May's historic referendums
supporting the Irish peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, telling aspect of their convergence clearly
was the lack of tension, and even the onset of camaraderie, among
the players who have long occupied opposite _ and hostile _ sides
of the Northern Ireland political ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, when the Kennedy School held its last
executive program for Irish and British leaders, the Democratic
Unionist Party flat-out didn't attend while members of the Ulster
Unionist Party wouldn't engage in conversation with their
counterparts from Sinn Fein, and a photo of all the attendees
proved impossible to arrange; the hardline DUP is represented this
year, and a group picture was taken Monday as a matter of course,
rather than as a result of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of collegiality and engagement and informality, from
my perspective...is significantly greater than it was two years
ago,'' said Marty Linsky, a Kennedy School lecturer who led the
Irish politicians Thursday in a morning-long discussion of
leadership. ``My sense...is that people are more willing to engage,
regardless of political affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the anxieties and strains
surrounding one of the world's longest-running conflicts simply
evaporated in Cambridge this week. But, strikingly, those
sensitivities emanated far more clearly from Kennedy School
administrators than from any of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   For example, program officials established ground rules from the
start, to which the participants agreed, prohibiting them from
talking to the press.
</P>
<P>
   At The Globe's request, a reporter was permitted to sit in for
brief periods in a couple of classes this week. Though the rules
were that none of the participants could be quoted, their interplay
and discussion _ and even their positioning, with representatives
of historic adversaries sitting comfortably next to each other _
illustrated how far attitudes have progressed, notwithstanding the
continuing difficulties between Catholics and Protestants in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The stated reason for the high level of caution in Cambridge
itself revealed a concern about the fragility of the new, more
optimistic Irish reality: The intent was to keep the assembled
politicians from saying anything provocative that might start a
public tiff, thereby undercutting the positive atmosphere that the
Kennedy School was trying to foster.
</P>
<P>
   However, the participants and organizers are holding a press
conference at noon today, in the program's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants in this year's session, entitled ``The
New Political Architecture: A Workshop for Leaders from Northern
Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Great Britain,'' were 13
members of the new New Northern Ireland Assembly and three members
of the Republic of Ireland's Parliament. The project was sponsored
jointly by the New York-based Foundation for a Civil Society and by
the Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Representing 16 political parties were such diverse and key
players as David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party; Gary
McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party; Monica McWilliams of the
Northern Ireland Women's Coalition; Edwin Poots of the Democratic
Unionist Party; Dennis Rogan of the Ulster Unionist Party; Dara
O'Hagan of Sinn Fein; and Nigel Warner of the Labor Party, a top
adviser to Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo
Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're all talking to each other, but they're
all behaving in a very civilized manner,'' said Paul Arthur, a
professor at Ulster University and an adviser to this week's
events. Added Pete Zimmerman, director of the executive program at
the Kennedy School and a project organizer, ``There is a new sense
of seriousness of purpose among the participants this year.
Whatever they think of the particulars, these are people who know
the train is now moving.''

FOR GAY RIGHTS, A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than a year since the House took a
vote on legislation aimed at homosexuals. Now, suddenly, a cluster
of proposals is moving to a vote, and the city most associated with
gay rights _ San Francisco _ may take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   First up is a measure that enjoys broad conservative support and
would cut federal housing funds to San Francisco as long as firms
doing business with the city are required to provide domestic
partnership benefits to employees.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the San Francisco measure could come as early as
today. Over the next two weeks the House will vote on other
measures designed to roll back certain rights and protections
extended to gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   One of the votes will be on legislation to overturn an executive
order signed by President Clinton in May that outlaws
discrimination in federal hiring on the basis of sexual
orientation. The House is also set to consider whether to forbid
the District of Columbia from providing domestic partnership
benefits to its employees,and to weigh a prohibition on adoptions
by same-sex couples next week.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals have drawn fire from gay rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These efforts point to one thing,'' said David M. Smith,
senior strategist for the Human Rights Campaign. ``There's a
desperate attempt to make discrimination against gay people safe
and legal.''
</P>
<P>
   But opinion is divided on why there is a flurry of expected
votes. Some speculate it is part of an orchestrated attempt to
energize religious activists in the Republican Party, while others
say the string of votes is simply coincidence. Either way, many
lawmakers are leery of the votes _ and of appearing intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry how this will affect the way Americans vote in
Novemeber,'' said Carl Schmidt, vice president of government
affairs for the Capitol-area Log Cabin, a gay Republican group.
``Obviously there is a core group that will like this, but they'll
get hurt with moderate and swing voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers say Republican lawmakers are skittish
about the votes, while others see the forced rollcalls as part of a
larger legislative scramble to appeal to the GOP's base of social
conservatives before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the Republican leadership's effort to solidify
their support with the religious right, which has made known its
displeasure with the Republican Congress's failure to deliver,''
said William Schneider, public policy analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. ``While
there is controversy, the fact is Americans don't get as upset
about gay rights as abortion rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The succession of votes comes one week after a coalition of
influential Christian groups launched a high-profile ad campign
attacking homosexuality. Earlier, Senate majority leader Trent Lott
likened gays to kleptomaniacs and alcoholics, and House majority
leader Richard Armey called homosexuals ``sinners.''
</P>
<P>
   These remarks were met by an outcry from moderate Republicans,
and some in the GOP have expressed concern over a possible backlash
if the party is perceived as antigay. The Republican leadership is
not actively promoting the measures, and even lawmakers openly
aligned with the religious right are balking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will support the effort, but on the merits of the issue,''
said Representative Joseph R. Pitts, a Pennsylvania Republican who
spearheads the Values Action Team set up in the wake of a series of
meetings this spring between the Republican leadership and a
coalition of religious groups demanding action on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Pitts said conservatives support an amendment
sponsored by Representative Joel Hefley, a Colorado Republican, to
overturn Clinton's executive order because ``homosexuals shouldn't
have special rights because of the lifestyle they've chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans insisted the multiple votes are simply
coincidence, rather than an orchestrated campaign. With Congress
rushing to act on spending bills before the August recess,
lawmakers are trying to attach amendments to the must-pass
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for things to do,'' said Representative Barney
Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``Their calculation is that gays
and lesbians are a small enough minority so there are fewer
negative political consequences in going after us ... but they
underestimated resistance to this kind of gay-bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank suggested that the spate of legislation may be an effort
to place conservative activists like James Dobson, who threatened
to bolt the Republican Party if it continued to stray from its
conservative roots.

DEATH PENALTY OPPONENTS TAKE PERSONAL STAND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Mario Cuomo is ever murdered, he wants his killer
to be pursued and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But not to die.
</P>
<P>
   And, to make his feelings perfectly clear, the former three-term
governor _ who was discussed for many years as a likely Democratic
presidential candidate or a Supreme Court justice _ has attached a
notarized statement to his will.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``I hereby declare that should I die as a result of a
violent crime, I request that the person or persons found guilty
for my killing not be subject to or put in jeopardy of the death
penalty under any circumstances, no matter how heinous their crime
or how much I have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 people across the country have signed a
statement just like this, according to a nun in Brooklyn, Sister
Camille D'Arienzo, who came up with the idea for it.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arienzo and a group of other local nuns, priests, and lay
Catholics started meeting during the 1994 governor's race, when it
seemed the death penalty _ which had not been administered in New
York State for nearly 30 years _ was headed for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues are planning to redouble their efforts
now, as New York's death-penalty law _ which was signed in 1995 by
Cuomo's successor, George E. Pataki, just months after he took over
as governor _ is starting to be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The revival began last month, when a jury in Brooklyn convicted
a man of killing three people and then sentenced him to die by
lethal injection. Thursday, a jury in Poughkeepsie declined to
execute a man it had found guilty of multiple murders. A half-dozen
more capital cases await trial sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her office at the Convent of Mercy, a 136-year-old
structure in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, D'Arienzo
recalled the discussions four years ago, when her group was getting
involved in the issue. ``We were looking for something that was not
didactic but that expressed the depths of our concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group came up with the idea of the document, which it
called, ``Declaration of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of it is that it somewhat minimizes the sense of
powerlessness we have,'' said D'Arienzo, who runs the convent and
also serves as president-elect of the Leadership Conference of
Women Religionists, which represents over 90 percent of American
nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not changed the structure or the government,'' she
said. ``Some of us cannot claim to have changed a relative or close
friend. But this is what we believe. This is where we stand firm.
It's a very private statement, but it's also very public.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was asked by D'Arienzo to sign the declaration in the
spring of 1994, shortly before his bid for reelection to a fourth
term _ which he ended up losing, in part, many pollsters say,
because of his outspoken opposition to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed it immediately,'' he recalled. ``I had no hesitancy
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, now a practicing lawyer, acknowledged that the document
is not legally binding. However, he added, ``I am a believer in
victims' rights. It's appropriate to consult the victims or their
relatives in deciding a defendant's punishment. In capital cases, a
relative or a prosecutor sometimes says the death penalty would do
justice to the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in my case,'' he went on, a bit more emphatically,
``they're not going to be able to make that argument because I
don't consider it justice. If I get murdered and if victims' rights
have anything to do with the sentence, my posthumous poetry shall
be useful to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Cuomo said, the district attorney prosecuting his
murder case, knowing such a document existed, would not seek the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, director of the Capital Defender Office in New
York, which offers legal counsel to defendants in death-penalty
cases, said, ``In New York, DAs would be likely to take that into
consideration, but it would be unlikely that they would publicly
state that as part of their rationale for not seeking death.'' At
the same time, in parts of other states, Doyle added, ``it might
not have any impact at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and D'Arienzo said they know of no murder trial where the
declaration has been offered into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cuomo signed the declaration over four years ago, he
has taken no steps to publicize his action. He did suggest that
D'Arienzo ask Carolyn McCarthy _ whose husband was murdered in the
1993 Long Island Railroad massacre _ to sign it, which she did.
McCarthy, who became a gun-control advocate, has since been elected
to the US House of Representatives. Her life story was recently
made into a television movie.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have signed it include actors Martin Sheen and Mike
Farrell and Sister Helen Prejean, who wrote the book, ``Dead Man
Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arienzo said she has no idea how many people around the
country have signed it, though she has records of about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the US Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital
punishment was constitutional, 470 executions have taken place, 155
of them _ nearly one-third _ in Texas. An additional 3,300 sit on
death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The New York law gives district attorneys the discretion to seek
the death penalty in cases involving any of 12 types of
first-degree murder. If they do not ask for the death penalty, the
defendant, if found guilty, must go to prison for life with no
possibility of parole.

BIOLOGISTS SAY LOBSTER LEVEL IN A PINCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lobster, New England's most valuable seafood, has been a godsend
to depressed fishing communities, providing record catches at a
time when overfishing has decimated other fish populations. While
some fishermen have sold their boats and trained for new careers,
lobstermen from Stonington, Maine, to Marshfield, Mass. have been
putting out more traps.
</P>
<P>
   Now, biologists warn that the lobster trap ``arms race'' has
pushed the lobster population to the brink of a collapse that could
be worse than the one that closed much of Georges Bank in 1994.
Most female lobsters are caught before they can reproduce, the
researchers warn, meaning that lobster fanciers truly may be eating
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very disturbing trends ... which are similar to
trends we have seen in other fisheries before their catastrophic
decline,'' said Steven Murawski, biologist at the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Woods Hole, Mass. ``There's no way in God's
green earth that these catches could be sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal biologists calculate that lobstermen are catching at
least twice as many lobsters as is sustainable. As a result, most
of the big lobsters are gone and almost 90 percent of today's catch
is barely above the minimum legal size.
</P>
<P>
   But many lobstermen reject the gloomy predictions, arguing that
their abundant catches are a more reliable indicator than the soft
``Jello statistics'' of scientists. Last year, northeastern
lobstermen brought in a record 84 million pounds of lobster, though
the Massachusetts catch declined, and lobstermen say there is no
shortage of breeding females.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catches keep going up ... and some go down a little, but
they don't go crashing down. It's pretty stable. So fishermen say,
`OK, what's the problem?''' said William Adler of the Massachusetts
Lobstermen's Association, who questions the biologists' study
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Adler and other lobstermen agree that there are too many lobster
traps in the water, but they are sharply divided over what steps to
take. Only last week, four southern Maine lobstermen won an
injunction to block an 800-trap limit per fisherman put forward by
a state-backed panel of lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of meaningful limits, lobstermen feel pressed to
add traps to match the competition. ``If you want to play the game,
you've got to keep up,'' said Rich Fuller, the 26-year-old owner of
the Kerri Lee in Scituate, Mass. ``I'm not going to fish 400
(traps) when everyone else is fishing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists fear that lobstermen and their regulators have
begun a painful replay of the paralyzing debate that preceded the
population crash of the cod, once so important to Massachusetts'
economy that a Sacred Cod hangs on the wall above the state House
of Representatives. Now, cod is worth less than a third of the $65
million Massachusetts lobsters bring in.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, officials at the National Marine Fisheries
Service say a lobster crash would be worse than the cod collapse
because lobsters reproduce so slowly. They said the better
comparison is the Alaska red king crab, whose population has not
recovered more than 15 years after the population drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fish can grow up very fast, but a lobster takes five to
seven years. It would be catastrophic if there was a (lobster)
crash,'' said National Marine Fisheries spokeswoman Teri Frady.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other seafood, American lobster is the symbol of
maritime New England, the creature behind those postcard villages
of shingled lobster shacks, colorful buoys and traps piled on the
pier. The rocky, cold waters of Maine account for more than half
the nation's lobster catch, and 87 percent of the lobsters are
caught in New England, providing 20,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But lobstering, once an ideal small business, has gone
increasingly large-scale as the catch doubled from 37.2 million
pounds in 1980 to 84 million pounds last year. Until Maine adopted
a limit of 1,200 traps, some fishermen were tending up to 2,000
traps, and overall trap totals soared to 2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, the second-leading lobster state, sets a more
restrictive limit of 800 traps, but lobstermen say there is so
little enforcement that lobstermen violate it with impunity, or
fish in federal waters where the state limit doesn't hold.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly trap-covered waters have heightened conflicts
between fishermen in the territorial world of lobstering.
Lobstermen from two villages in Maine needed a state mediator to
resolve a fight over fishing rights off Monhegan Island last year,
while a Northport, N.Y., man suspected his boat was bombed for
invading another lobsterman's territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the local nature of the business makes it difficult to end
the trap escalation. Though the National Marine Fisheries Service
has legal power over fishing more than 3 miles offshore, 80 percent
of lobsters are caught in state waters. The New England Fishery
Management Council, in turn, could not win state support for its
plan, so the task fell to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, dominated by state officials from Maine to
Florida, has proposed a phased-in trap limit of 800, still more
than the 400 to 600 traps most lobstermen set and more than what
the National Marine Fisheries Service believes is needed. The
service suggests a limit of 480 traps, unless regulators take other
measures such as increasing the minimum legal size.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the minimum size would give young female lobsters more
time to produce eggs, but some lobstermen say the bigger minimum
creates more work than simply eliminating traps, making them toss
back more lobsters they've already caught.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the proposed limits have drawn some objection,
including a lawsuit by large-scale southern Maine lobstermen who
argue that a local plan to go to the 800 trap limit immediately
would damage their livelihood. But the National Marine Fisheries
Service's 480 trap limit has been the real lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make a living on 480 traps and I think there's a lot
of guys here who feel that way,'' said lobsterman David Merryman at
a hearing in Portland, Maine, in April. ``You're not just
regulating a fishery. You're regulating a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where the lobster catch has not grown like
Maine's, lobstermen are more receptive to low limits on traps or
other fishing limits, but they, too, differ on how far to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think fishing was ever meant to be a fulltime job,''
said lobsterman Joe Previte as he tied up his boat, The Puffin, in
Cohasset, Mass. Previte, who also works in construction, said he
would support a limit as low as 300 traps.
</P>
<P>
   But Scituate lobsterman Pat Patterson, who just bought his boat
last year, complained that part-timers undercut people who make a
living from lobsters. He said it would be more fair to have a lower
limit for part-timers and something higher than 480 for fulltimers
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   And Massachusetts state biologist Bruce Estrella warns that trap
limits are no cure-all, since lobstermen below the limit can keep
adding traps. He said measures such as an increase in the minimum
size of lobster may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate goes on, Boston Harbor lobstermen already feel
the pain that biologists fear could become widespread. Due to a
combination of overfishing and perhaps a change in water chemistry
caused by the harbor cleanup, Boston has fallen from first to fifth
in the state for lobster catch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the once-full lobster pier in Hingham on Boston Harbor
has eight empty slips, and some lobstermen have had to find outside
work. ``The catch has been down ever since the cleanup started,''
said Shawn Cavanaugh of Weymouth, who has taken a night job at a
bank due to the lobster downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boston Harbor is unique, Murawski warns that a crash
could come in two to three years if action isn't taken. The record
harvest of 1997, he said, was fueled by unusually favorable
conditions for lobster young that could disappear as swiftly as
they emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he said, lobstermen have banked their prosperity on
far too few lobster eggs. The National Marine Fisheries Service
estimates that egg production is less than 3 percent what it would
be in the absence of lobstering, and far below the bare minimum
legally required in federal waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fishery is right on the edge. It has no room for error,''
said Murawski.

FOR AGENTS, CLINTONS, DUTIES AND PRIVATE LIVES MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first signs of trouble came early: Hillary
Rodham Clinton, in her first months in the White House, reportedly
complained to friends that disloyal Secret Service agents had
falsely leaked word of a lamp-throwing fight between her and her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the style of Clinton's presidency took shape, there was
the risk of friction on many fronts between the president and the
elite corps of bodyguards assigned to protect him. Clinton insisted
on jogging through public streets in the busiest times of the
morning. He dined out often _ and spontaneously _ at night. Even
now, he rarely sees a crowd of people he doesn't want to meet.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last several years, agents and White House
officials said the Clintons have grown increasingly comfortable
with the sometimes suffocating presence of Secret Service agents in
almost every facet of their lives. Likewise, agents said the
bodyguards have grown more comfortable with the Clintons _ a fact
which underscores the irony of their present predicament, compelled
to testify before the Grand Jury investigating Clinton's private
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see firsthand how relationships and friendships form
between both sides,'' said Doug Sosnik, a Clinton adviser. ``I
would expect that in a transition to a new president. It takes a
while to get comfortable with each other. There's an adjustment
that everyone has to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Secret Service officials concede it is a tough adjustment
indeed _ not just for the Clintons, but for any new president
arriving in the White House. Agents stand watch in the residence
while the president sleeps. They shadow him wherever he goes,
inside the complex and out. And they occasionally search through
the sock drawers to make sure a listening device or chemical weapon
has not been planted inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a family dispute, they see and hear it all,'' said
Ron Noble, a former undersecretary for enforcement at the Treasury
Department, which oversees the Secret Service. ``They see your
underwear. There is really nothing that they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is exactly why Independent Counsel Kenneth W.
Starr has coveted their cooperation. The same agents who are
required to throw themselves in the path of a bullet for the
president will now be required to share what, if anything, they
know of the secrets tucked away in the deepest recesses of
Clinton's life, particularly his relationship with former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Larry Cockell, the lead Secret Service agent on the
presidential protection detail, became the first plainclothes agent
in the history of the department to testify before a grand jury
about the president he is charged to protect, answering questions
for just over an hour at the US District Court here.
</P>
<P>
   Starr won a prolonged court battle with the Clinton
administration last week over the testimony, and uniformed Secret
Service officers have already testified in the last few days.
Cockell and the officers, through their attorneys, have said they
will answer all questions put to them.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officials and even former president George Bush
have warned that such forced testimony could have a catastrophic
impact on Clinton and his successors, spurring presidents to put
more distance between themselves and the Secret Service agents.
That distance, officials have warned, could cost bodyguards their
most effective weapon against a potential assassin: proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is already a day-to-day dilemma about how close the Secret
Service can get,'' said Philip Melanson, a political science
professor at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and the
author of the book, ``The Politics of Protection: The US Secret
Service in the Terrorist Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they get in the photo or outside the office or how
distant will they be? Any president now has to think, `What is the
Secret Service overhearing, and what in the realm of my personal
and policy-making life might be important?'''
</P>
<P>
   Agents still rue President Kennedy's refusal to drive through
Dallas in 1963 with a bulletproof glass top on his limousine, as
well as his order that agents could not ride on the rear bumper of
his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begged him to put his bubble on top of the car, and he
refused because it was a political function, and we begged him to
put agents on the back bumpers,'' said Hamilton Brown, a retired
agent who worked on Kennedy's protective detail. ``He said people
were there to see him, not the agents.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain the desired degree of proximity, agents in the
presidential detail have donned an umpire's uniform at a baseball
game where the president is throwing the first pitch, dressed as a
graduating college student in cap and gown for a presidential
commencement address, even as a priest in clerical collar when the
pope last toured the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House, agents tend to be slightly more at ease
about covering the president, given the intense security they have
at the perimeter of the building and the searches of people coming
and going. It is when Clinton travels outside the gates that they
are especially attuned to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is meeting with just a small group, agents will stand
outside the door. If the gathering is larger, maybe a dozen people
or more, agents will stand inconspicuously inside, always silent.
</P>
<P>
   The plainclothes Secret Service agents assigned to the
presidential protection detail are the elite members of a law
enforcement group that prides itself on its work. They are required
to pass constant physical examinations, spend dizzying hours
performing brutally boring work, and, in the extremity, to
sacrifice their own lives to save the president's.
</P>
<P>
   The male agents always dress in impeccable dark suits, their
hair neatly trimmed, sunglasses ever shading their eyes. They speak
only when spoken to. Their allegiance, they say, is not to the
particular president, but to the job. As an example, Noble, the
former Treasury official notes, ``On Inauguration Day, the same
agents leave the White House with one president and come back with
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cockell, who was temporarily replaced last week as the
lead agent, and Clinton are often seen chatting amiably and joking.
When Clinton works a rope line, shaking hands and leaning into a
crowd, Cockell stands behind him and literally holds onto his belt,
prepared to pull him back should the president fall or be grabbed,
or to shove him to the ground to avoid an assassin.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton is chauffeured around town in his motorcade,
Cockell sits in the front of the presidential limousine, beside the
driver. And when Clinton jets around the country and the world on
Air Force One, Cockell and a second agent sit in a business class
seat just outside the presidential study.
</P>
<P>
   Agents typically work for a half dozen years or more in a field
office before being moved to the White House. Once there, they are
usually rotated out every four to five years. A president has no
say whatsoever in his protective detail. Even the detail directors
are always chosen from within the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have arrived at the pinnacle of their careers by
joining the presidential detail, agents will sometimes be required
to stand for hours at a time watching nothing more than a hallway
in a hotel. Other times, they must frantically search a crowd for
potential trouble, the sounds of six agents' voices filling their
earpieces with word of something irregular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go to work with the idea it's going to be a mundane
day,'' said Arnett Heintz, a Secret Service agent and spokesman.
``You have to be prepared. You are responsible for protecting the
president of the United States. If you screw that up, you have
quite a mess on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who argue that such protection is unncessary, agents
quickly warn that four presidents _ about 10 percent of the men who
have ascended to the position _ have been assassinated. And more
recently, President Gerald Ford was shot at twice and President
Reagan once. In the Reagan assassination attempt in 1981, an agent
was struck by a bullet trying to protect the president.

CELLUCCI CAMPAIGN CONSIDERING SHIFT TO ATTACK MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Cellucci's political advisers are debating an
abrupt change in campaign strategy as polls show the acting
governor is vulnerable to two of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and his advisers are considering dumping his
above-the-fray, Rose Garden campaign plan in favor of direct
attacks against Scott Harshbarger, according to close friends and
advisers to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Cellucci and Harshbarger face gubernatorial
primary opponents in September, Cellucci strategists say they
believe Harshbarger will win the Democratic nomination and that
Cellucci will easily defeat his primary opponent, Treasurer Joseph
D. Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers also said that Harshbarger's constant criticism of
Cellucci has been taking a toll _ as reflected in recent polling
data _ and has gone unanswered for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting clearer by the day that this is a two-person race
and it's Governor Cellucci against Attorney General Harshbarger,''
said state Senator Brian P. Lees, the East Longmeadow Republican
who talks frequently to Cellucci. ``You have to begin to move into
full campaign mode after the Legislature is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And state Senator Richard R. Tisei, a Wakefield Republican who
is also close to Cellucci, agreed: ``He really has to start
concentrating on November and on Scott Harshbarger.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci may begin calling attention to Harshbarger's record
once the Legislature adjourns for the year on July 31, but no
formal decision by the campaign has been made. Nevertheless,
Cellucci recently struck out at Harshbarger over the issue of
testing teachers for competency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes or No, Scott?'' one press release from the Cellucci
campaign reads. ``Harshbarger has trouble answering whether or not
he will support Paul Cellucci's plan to test teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another press release from the Cellucci campaign declares,
``Cellucci campaign blasts Harshbarger's opposition to testing
teachers.'' The release included a transcript of Harshbarger
answering reporters' questions in which he said he supports testing
new teachers and an ``assessment program'' to evaluate current
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the governor's race got underway, Cellucci has
concentrated on showing he could govern. He ignored the barbs and
jibes from the Democrats _ Harshbarger, Patricia McGovern, and
Brian Donnelly _ and he brushed off his Republican opponent,
Malone. On the issues, Cellucci has stuck to a steady diet of
noncontroversial rhetoric, calling for tax cuts and demanding
better child care and more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a month of heavy political advertising by Cellucci
in June, a recent University of Massachusetts poll indicated that
both Harshbarger and McGovern have pulled almost even with the
acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   In separate head-to-head match-ups, Cellucci received 39 percent
of the 401 registered voters surveyed, compared to 34 percent for
Harshbarger and 34 percent for McGovern. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci may begin responding to charges and launching
some of his own criticism at Harshbarger, no plans have been made
yet to attack Harshbarger on television. Although Cellucci became
lieutenant governor 6 1/2 years ago and acting governor one year
ago, he is still not known well enough around the state to do much
more than introduce himself and his agenda to voters through his
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person being held up to scrutiny at this point is
Paul Cellucci because no one else is considered credible,'' said
Jim Rappaport, the former chairman of the state Republican party
and a major contributor to Cellucci's campaign. ``It makes sense
now to go after Harshbarger. It's the right thing to do and allows
you to differentiate yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for Harshbarger is that Cellucci will begin blasting
him on television and he won't be able to respond in kind.
Harshbarger, unlike Cellucci, agreed to a spending cap in order to
receive state matching funds. The cap limits Harshbarger to
spending no more than $1.5 million up until the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, on the other hand, has $3.3 million in the bank. He
can spend as much as he'd like this summer, continue raising money,
and spend as much as he's able in the days leading up to the Nov. 3
general election.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins to speak out, the two issues Cellucci is likely to
raise against Harshbarger are taxes and education. Though
Harshbarger called for tax cuts for working families in December
1997, Cellucci can say that he has provided taxpayers with cuts 26
times as lieutenant governor and as acting governor. And he
recently signed the largest tax cut in Massachusetts history,
despite the fact that it looked nothing like his own proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Cellucci will fight Harshbarger with talk about
high standards, for both teachers and students, and about school
choice for parents. ``Mr. Harshbarger, to date, has been in the
pocket of teachers' unions,'' Rappaport alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tisei cautioned that Cellucci cannot write off Malone
completely. ``But it really seems that Harshbarger has solidified
his position within the Democratic Party and you really have to
start looking at post-September,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent (Cellucci) can connect the dots and frame the
debate, that's going to be the key to victory in November,'' said
Tisei.

GOING FOR THE GOLD _ AND THE FUN

   LEDYARD, Conn. _ Cigarette smoke hangs over the slot machines at
the Foxwoods Casino in a blue, surreal haze, adding a macabre veil
to the scene: Hundreds of senior citizens, some in wheelchairs,
others carrying oxygen tanks, many steadying themselves with
walkers or canes.
</P>
<P>
   All are pumping quarters into machines that gulp their money and
belch deafening whistles, bells, whirs, and, for the lucky, a
clanging change windfall that keeps them playing, robotic in their
movements, hoping to hit the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   The tops of the slot machines are littered with empty and
twisted quarter rolls, lipstick-stained coffee cups, overflowing
ashtrays, and plastic pillboxes compartmentalized by days of the
week and meals: BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER.
</P>
<P>
   In the bathrooms, secured to the walls near the towel
dispensers, are locked plastic boxes beckoning biohazardous waste.
They are used-needle repositories provided by the casino as a
``convenient customer service'' for diabetic bettors who, between
the craps tables and the bingo hall, can duck in and give
themselves an insulin shot.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon at Foxwoods, where the overwhelming majority of
gamblers seem to be grandmas and grandpas, has the ambience of a
revved-up VFW hall Las Vegas night. But gambling has always been a
favorite pastime for the elderly, and in the 26 states where it is
legal, the dominant casino color scheme is gray. A 1997 national
survey done by Harrah's found that 27 percent of Americans over the
age of 55 went to a casino at least once that year.
</P>
<P>
   Squint through the smoke and look more closely. There is delight
on the faces of the players, who anticipate their trips as a Big
Day Out. The women wear freshly sprayed hairdos, new Easy Spirits,
and colorful jogging suits. The men are in Sans-a-Belt slacks, knit
tops, and a light splash of Old Spice.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, they are happy to be here. After all, they are out
of the house, socializing with other seniors, enjoying a huge
buffet for about $5, maybe staying the night to catch the Paul Anka
show, and getting a little thrill when they leave a few dollars
richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, at our age, what's left to do?'' said Joseph DiNicola,
66, of Norwood, Mass., who took a chartered bus to Foxwoods with
his wife, Amelia, 65, and about 50 other seniors from the suburbs
south of Boston recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not high rollers here, or spending our pensions. We're
smarter than that,'' noted DiNicola, who saves his big money for an
annual trip to Vegas and budgets for his trips to Foxwoods. ``It's
just the ladies with the bluish hair and the men with the gray.
There are the bingo junkies and slot-lovers and everyone is just
looking to kill the day with a little entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either that or sit home and watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are 175 deluxe motor coaches that pick up and deliver
patrons from all over New England to Foxwoods every 15 minutes or
so, every day. The Entertainment Tours bus company out of
Braintree, Mass. is one of 45 bus lines from Massachusetts that, in
the six years since Foxwoods has opened, have been bringing bettors
to the Connecticut woods. There are four buses a day that service
Boston's Chinatown alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although casino officials say the average age of a Foxwoods
bettor is 40, hundreds of gamblers waiting curbside for motor
coaches to take them home one afternoon recently were resoundingly
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, the average age of the bus crowd is about 60,
according to Donald Little, an Entertainment Tours driver, who,
after dropping off his passengers and servicing the bus, goes off
duty and engages in a few games of seven-card stud (limiting his
spending, he swears, to the $30 his wife allows).
</P>
<P>
   Little, 36, called his charges ``very well behaved,'' but
anxious, always, to get there and get winning. Indeed, when the
last passengers were picked up in Foxborough, Mass. during a recent
seven-town run that began in Quincy, Mass., a woman in the back
yelled, ``Go like hell now!'' when the doors closed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not expecting to win a lot of money. They're
just going for a good time,'' Little said. ``But they do go a lot.
I know almost everyone on this bus by name. Sometimes one of them
will get back on the bus at the end of the day with a new Buick or
$5,000 in their pockets. That's nice to see. They're good people
just out to have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   But good times, especially when gambling is involved, can lead
to trouble. The national organization Gamblers Anonymous says that
it does not categorize addiction populations, but given the small
amount of money it takes someone on a fixed income to fall into
debt, many elderly are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Although specialists say that 4 to 5 percent of all people who
bet are compulsive gamblers, problem gambling among the elderly is
on the rise. A number of states report increased calls to their
gambling hot lines from and about the elderly. In New Jersey, where
Atlantic City casinos in that state have long lured older gamblers,
the local chapter of the National Council on Problem Gamblers views
elderly gambling addiction enough of a problem to offer outreach
programs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roland Curry, 70, is in his element: Up $50 in a game of
seven-card stud, a free drink at his side, a fresh pack of Camels
in his pocket. He's sharing a few laughs around the Foxwoods Casino
gaming table with other gray-haired grandpas _ one chewing on a
toothpick, one missing the tip of his index finger, another, his
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, a retired grocery store security guard from Roslindale,
Mass., headed for the Poker Room after arriving on the Quincy bus.
He left the table only once in six hours, to attend a $1,000
drawing on the other side of the casino. Players must be present to
win. He was there, but lost. That's the way it goes. Poker's his
game anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Since his wife died, Curry goes to Foxwoods five or six times a
month, as much for the company as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this grandfather of 12, great-grandfather of 2, is a
gambler. Always has been. Sometimes he plays the slots or
blackjack, but only when the poker table takes more than it gives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't limit myself to any amount of money, I just make sure
I have enough to hold me out,'' said Curry. ``Five hundred has been
my biggest win. But I don't really come for the money. If I weren't
here, I'd have to get a part-time job or something, just to have
something to do, to be around people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tufo of Walpole, Mass. fairly flew off the bus in search of
the exact ``Double Black Jack'' slot machine she won $960 on during
last week's trip. She walked by it that day, got a good-luck
feeling in her gut, and it paid off. This week, though, no matter
how much she fed it, ``Double Black Jack'' kept its money close to
the vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think you could do a repeat, but it's just not happening
for me today,'' said Tufo, 67, who works part time as a bookkeeper
in her sons' company for extra cash to come to Foxwoods, while she
continued to slip quarters into the machine, hoping one would hit
the spot. Or, better, the bells or the cherries or the sevens.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't come to be social, usually. There's too much
concentrating to be done. On this day, though, she has baked some
cookies for a woman she's befriended on this bus route, but her
seat is empty today and Tufo is worried that she might be ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a sweet woman,'' said Tufo, a redhead with a big, easy
smile. ``We're both gamblers and we have that in common. Myself, I
have a bum leg. But gambling is good for people who are sick. You
can do it sitting down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tufo has won big at Foxwoods. A $10,000 jackpot on the slots
last year has her favoring Ledyard over Vegas, her former haunt.
There were a couple of big winners this time, resulting in a very
buoyant mood on the bus ride home.
</P>
<P>
   One woman scored $1,000 at a Wheel of Fortune game, and a man
won $900 at blackjack. Curry, the retired security guard, missed
the bus entirely. Everyone hoped it was because he had a hot hand,
and was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tufo admits to overspending her limits, getting into a little
financial trouble every now and then. But she says she punishes
herself by staying off the bus for a couple of weeks, building the
reserves back up, and promising she won't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   But she always comes back.
</P>
<P>
   How much has she won today? ``Not enough.'' How much has she
lost? ``Honey, I don't even tell God that.''

STAKES ARE SKY-HIGH IN `PI' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
PI 
Written and directed by: Darren Aronofsky 
Starring: Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman, Pamela Hart,
Stephen Pearlman, Sonia Shoaib, Ajay Naidu 
Running time: 85 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some disturbing images) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darren Aronofsky's ``Pi'' is the kind of feverish mind-bender I
wish the ``X-Files'' movie had been. Filmed in high-contrast
black-and-white, it's a hyperkinetic film about a hyperkinetic
protagonist, a numbers freak named Max Cohen who's convinced that
if he sits in his slummy walkup tickling his patched-together
homemade computers long enough and intensely enough, he'll discover
the numerical basis of the pattern of the universe. He's interested
in finding God, but it hasn't escaped the notice of others that he
may also have tapped into the key to, among other things, the stock
market and the Kabbalah.
</P>
<P>
   This brings him into contact with a pack of Wall Street traders
and a Hassidic sect. Although both camps are made up of renegades,
they have little in common except for being haunted by the feeling
that they can't take the chance that weird Max isn't on to
something. So they take turns pursuing him. Max, for respite, seeks
timeouts with his old prof, and rides the subways, favoring the
stops lit by fluorescent lights, the glare of which Aronofsky's
camera revels in. Aronofsky's film rides the grittiness of its very
downtown sensibility, including a techno soundtrack which lends
itself to Max's not quite deranged single-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   There's a nice tongue-in-cheek implied contrast between the
frenetic dartings of Max and his ever more tightly-wound pursuers
and the key-to-it-all secret pattern he feels he's on the verge of
uncovering. Beyond that, Sean Gullette's Max draws us into the
dance he does on the thin line between advanced enlightenment and
madness in his claustrophobic digs. Mind racing, too revved up to
sleep, Gullette's Max quickly persuades us he's not just any
crackpot. Certainly, Aronofsky's ``Pi'' is not just any sci-fi
movie. Unlike most would-be specimens of the genre, this one,
firmly ensconced on the ``Eraserhead''-``Rhythm Thief'' axis,
convinces us it's wired from the inside out and that the juice is
sizzling through its circuits.

IT'S A STRUGGLE TO REMAIN A CARD-CARRYING MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ If it's going to rain for three hours, you've
got to do something other than what Richard Coughlan did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did nothing,'' he explained. ``I just sat and ate.''
</P>
<P>
   He played like it. After completing his 16th hole (No. 7 on the
Pleasant Valley CC course), a par 3, he finished bogey-bogey to
wind up the opening round of the CVS Charity Classic with a 3-over
74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out flat,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   There are guys who can afford to come out flat once in a while,
but 24-year-old Richard Coughlan is most assuredly not one of them.
The year is nearly half over and he is $168,010 short of the figure
he needs to maintain his precious PGA Tour card.
</P>
<P>
   And keeping the Tour card is merely the most important thing in
the young Irishman's life. If you do not keep your card, you are
thrown back into the shark-infested waters known as the PGA Tour
Qualifying School, the Q-School for short. We in the outside world
hear awful, horrible, stand-the-hairs-up-on-the-back-of-your-neck
things about the Q-School.
</P>
<P>
   So tell us, Richard Coughlan, is the Q-School as bad as we've
heard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse,'' he reported. ``If every round of golf felt like the
finishing holes of the Q-School, you wouldn't play. But I got
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. He finished 12th. He also picked up his European
Q-School card, although he hasn't had occasion to use it. As far as
he knows, he is the first person ever to come directly from college
(Clemson) and pick up both cards right out of the chute.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds nice and it looks good on the resume. But right now he
needs to put up some low scores and cash some checks. And an
opening-round 74 is not likely to make a cha-ching sound here.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlan arrived here direct from Madison, Miss., and a tie for
21st in the Deposit Guaranty Classic. He started that tournament
with a 74 also. But then he strung together rounds of 69, 67, and
68 for a 10-under 278, good for a career-high $12,000. He had fired
an 8-under 272 the week before that in the Quad City Classic. He
came here feeling good because those last two tournaments
represented his best golf in a long time, or since he shot a 286
(minus 2) in the Tucson Chrysler Classic back during the Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But he also arrived here tired. ``I should have taken a week
off, I guess,'' he said. ``But when you're playing well, you've got
to keep it rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   He is representative of life on the lower tier of the PGA Tour,
except that instead of arriving at Clemson from Florida or Georgia
or Virginia, he arrived there from Birr, a town of 5,000 in
little-known and nearly hidden County Offalay, smack in the center
of Ireland. ``It's next to Tipperary,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   He had begun playing at age 12. No one pushed him into it.
Neither parent played golf, and he has no siblings. It was just
something he liked to do, and when the time came, he decided to
hone his game on an American campus. His choices sounded like those
of someone from the 5-Star Camp: North Carolina, Duke, Florida
State, Georgia Tech, and the school he wound up graduating from
with a psychology degree, Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   While at Clemson, he became a big Tiger football and basketball
fan, particularly football. The psychology degree? ``Just something
so I could get that piece of paper,'' he admitted. Hey, who among
us can't relate to that?
</P>
<P>
   He caddied for a 1991 US Walker Cup team that included Phil
Mickelson and David Duval, and at one point, he caddied for current
Tour fringe player Franklin Langham _ until Langham fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was doing anything wrong,'' Coughlan shrugged.
``But I guess he didn't like my style, whatever it was. It was
nothing, really. He just wasn't playing well, and one day he just
fired me. Little did he know that five or six years later, he would
see me on the Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that would come to pass, however, Coughlan would become a
Walker Cup player himself. ``I played eight matches last year,'' he
said. ``I halved four and I lost four tough ones. Overall, I played
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlan's blunt self-appraisal: ``I have a power game, really.
I need a better short game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be a lonely existence. He has no real address, save
that of his college coach, Larry Penley. He is away from his
homeland and he is under the gun, because if he doesn't earn enough
money, the Q-School beckons yet again.
</P>
<P>
   He's got that European possibility, but it's obvious he wants
the Big Enchilada. He may not consider himself an American, but the
fact is he's just about lost his accent. When you spend four years
in a high-powered American college golf experience, your thoughts
do not turn easily back across the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Right now his life is all about numbers. He needs to make
$225,000 this year. He has made $56,990. He is ranked 176th. And
he'd sure like a 65 today.

MAFIA PARODY HAS MORE MISSES THAN HITS 
</HEADLINE>

MAFIA! 
Directed by: Jim Abrahams 
Screenplay by: Abrahams, Greg Norberg, Michael McManus 
Starring: Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges, Olympia Dukakis, Christina
Applegate, Billy Burke, Pamela Gidley, Tony Lo Bianco, Joe
Viterelli 
Running time: 86 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (crude and sex-related humor, language, violence and
drug content) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to furlough the Mafia. If Jim Abrahams can't get
a screenful of ``Airplane'' and ``Naked Gun''-style sight gags out
of them, probably they need a rest. ``Mafia!,'' the new would-be
Abrahams gagfest, makes you an offer you can refuse. It begins
promisingly, parodying ``Casino,'' then quickly moves to an ``Il
Postino'' sendup as it switches to Sicily for the beginning of an
occasionally funny but mostly ponderous dynastic ``Godfather''
travesty that weighs it down until it sleeps with the fishes _ as,
indeed, you may if you go the distance with it.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to give away more than one or two of the sight
gags, since they alone relieve the tedious plot plodding and
unfunny crudeness, but it's a hoot to watch the godfather-to-be
flee to America on a ship called Il Pacino, or notice in a hospital
scene with Lloyd Bridges's klutzy Don Corleone figure that his
intravaneous unit is attached to a jar of spaghetti sauce. This was
the late Bridges's last film, and you can't help wishing he'd had a
better swan song. For the detail-minded, this movie originally was
called ``Jane Austen's Mafia,'' but Austen's name was dropped,
continuing her run of posthumous good luck in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   One problem encountered by Abrahams is that it's a little late
in the day for ``Godfather'' parodies, period. And most of the
film's Italian-American stereotyping is even more dated and
unfunny. Perhaps sensing the flatness and low level of
inventiveness of their material was what pushed Abrahams and his
collaborators into a desperate increase in gross-out jokes based on
bodily extrusions. Certainly Jay Mohr gives it a game try as the
Pacino surrogate, but it's a cement overcoat of a role, except when
a sight gag offers momentary relief, such as a check he writes for
$37,000 to The Bullet Store.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Applegate, as his WASP wife, is the best thing in the
film and its only consistently enjoyable presence. Applegate's
riffs on the Diane Keaton character in the Francis Ford Coppola
original are smartly timed and brightly executed. Sexy-looking
women can bring a special goofiness to comedy, and Applegate dishes
it out nonstop, from her whiny complaint that she's going to be
known as that Protestant chick who never killed anybody, all the
way to a zany touchdown dance. ``Mafia!'' doesn't score often, but
she does.

`DISTURBING BEHAVIOR' COULD STAND MORE OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DISTURBING BEHAVIOR 
Directed by: David Nutter 
Written by: Scott Rosenberg 
Starring: James Marsden, Katie Holmes, Nick Stahl, Steve Railsback,
Bruce Greenwood, William Sadler 
Running time: 83 minutes 
Rated: R (some violence, brief semi-nudity, a Wayne Newton song) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps Paul Lynde said it best in ``Bye Bye Birdie'' when he
posed the musical question, ``What's the matter with kids today?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question as old as time. Think Adam and Eve didn't spend
evenings fretting about Cain's unruly behavior and his inability to
make nice with his brother Abel? It's no different for today's
parents who wring their hands over children who smoke pot, listen
to rude songs, pierce themselves in all sorts of ungodly places,
and generally refuse to live up to their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Given such harsh realities, what parent wouldn't welcome the
chance to turn their terrible teen into an upstanding, well-groomed
straight-A student. So what if their personality is sapped, they
storm around like the Hitler Youth, and have a tendency to kill
when they become sexually aroused? At least they'll get into
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disturbing Behavior'' is a mildly amusing teen trifle, but one
which dares to have a bit of a brain. It is less a slice-and-dice
horror flick than a lightweight contemplation on the price of
conformity over individuality, as well as the desperation of
parents who want a productive child at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Clark (James Marsden) is the new kid in Cradle Bay, one of
those small towns with an endless supply of beautiful teen-agers
with cheekbones and dental work to die for. Steve's a little down
these days, still recovering from his older brother's suicide;
that's why his family left Chicago for this seaside town. At his
new high school, he encounters all the cliques and kooks --
techno-geeks, metalheads, skate punks, potheads like Gavin (Nick
Stahl) and his impossibly pale pal, U.V. (Chad E. Donella), and
multi-pierced leather chick, Rachel (Katie Holmes).
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Blue Ribbons, the ``freaks so chic,'' as
Gavin calls them. Clad in their blue and gold letter sweaters, they
are the cream of the school's crop. They don't drink, don't smoke,
don't take drugs, get good grades, and respect their elders. They
spend their days hanging out at the local yogurt shop, listening to
Wayne Newton's treacly ``Danke Schoen.'' (This may be the film's
scariest moment.)
</P>
<P>
   Gavin is convinced something wicked is happening in Cradle Bay,
but of course, no one else believes him. Even after Steve witnesses
a nighttime meeting with parents and his school's counselor, Mr.
Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood) voting to bring Gavin into the Blue
Ribbon fold, he just doesn't believe it. Then Gavin shows up at
school the next day having ditched his burnout friends for a letter
sweater, and his cynicism for a personality-altering implant in his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds familiar, it's because the film's premise mimics
``The Stepford Wives,'' the 1975 film based on Ira Levin's novel
about devious husbands, brainwashed women, and the nightmare of
waxy build-up on kitchen floors. That was a flawed, but clever film
which packed more punch than Scott Rosenberg's screenplay can ever
manage.
</P>
<P>
   That's the main problem. High school and adolescence are so
fertile for such a meditation on conformity, but it never happens
here. Rosenberg's screenplay never goes over the top _ which it
needs to do _ but then again, few of the actors here seem capable
of anything more than looking pretty for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disturbing Behavior,'' is a better movie than one would
expect, but given its juicy potential, it's never anywhere near as
good as it could have been.

SPIELBERG ENTERS NEW PHASE WITH BRILLIANT WARTIME FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a guy who has more than proven himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has all the money anyone will ever need, has created some of
the biggest box-office hits ever made, has in recent years raked in
critical accolades _ the best director Oscar that long eluded him
(for 1993's ``Schindler's List'') and the American Film Institute's
Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995 _ and has a fulfilling family
life (he carpools and fixes breakfast for the kids he raises with
his second wife, actress Kate Capshaw).
</P>
<P>
   Yet no fewer than three times during a recent interview at the
Ritz-Carlton, the creator of ``Jaws,'' ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind'' and his new World War II drama, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg says he still worries about being
``pigeonholed.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit: ``I want to be able to do all different kinds of movies
that will not ultimately pigeonhole me as one kind of filmmaker or
another,'' said Spielberg, comfortably sinking into a plush chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as I had children and as I grew up I wanted to leave
something behind that I could really be proud of that wasn't just
dinosaurs stepping on stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' indeed is a long way from ``Jurassic
Park.'' The story of a unit, headed by Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks),
who survives the Normandy D-Day invasion only to be assigned the
task of locating a young private (Matt Damon) who is the only
surviving brother of four, the film begins with a stirring, brutal
take on the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, 51, expanded that sequence from five pages in the
original script to 35, and it will surely go down as one of the
greatest, grimmest extended action sequences in movie history. But
it's not for the squeamish; the film narrowly avoided an NC-17
rating for its graphic, realistic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the audience to be participants in the physical
experience of battlefield combat as opposed to spectators as most
of us are when we're filmgoers,'' Spielberg said. ``I did a lot of
things in `Schindler's List' that were very graphically realistic
and true to the reportage of the survivors that talked to us before
we made that story. I felt I had that kind of duty to those
veterans of World War II, to finally acquit them of their
experience in a non-Hollywood way.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Saving Private Ryan'' is, then, is an independent film
with a $65 million budget. Independent in the sense that its
artistic vision is unmitigated _ Spielberg's studio, DreamWorks,
made the movie and Spielberg and Hanks both waived their salaries
in exchange for back-end percentages, which shaved around $30
million off the budget.
</P>
<P>
   What they've come up with is the most realistic, unglamorized
war movie ever. Just ask noted historian Stephen E. Ambrose, who's
listed as a consultant in the film's credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the finest World War II movie ever made,'' said
Ambrose, whose ``Citizen Soldiers'' is a bestseller. ``He does
something in this film I never thought could be done. He shows
onscreen what I've been hearing the last 30 years from veterans who
were there: What it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, in fact, had the projectionist stop the film after the
D-Day battle sequence, he was so overcome with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how did the maker of ``E.T.'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark''
come to this?
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing about Spielberg is that despite all the
accolades and success, he seems to crave something more, some kind
of validation he doesn't feel he has.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people aren't stroking his ego. Damon said he
spent one of his off-days on the shoot following the director
around, so he could find out what it was like to ``be'' Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks, who acted for his close friend for the first time: ``His
attack in any movie-making process is such an energetic one and
hard to keep up with,'' Hanks said. ``He sees possibilities of
camera angles that you'd never ever begin to imagine. He does
things with shots _ close-ups, wide shots, anything, he puts the
camera places that you'd think, well, that's why the guy's a
genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Spielberg said that because of the subject matter
``Saving Private Ryan'' was one of his least enjoyable shoots in
his career, he threw himself into the project with customary zeal,
shooting the film as if he were a combat photographer: No
storyboards (``working off the page,'' Spielberg calls it) and
filming the entire movie in continuity. He and cinematographer
Janusz Kaminski diluted 60 percent of the color in the lab, giving
the movie that desaturated documentary feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave the movie a style,'' said Spielberg, who begins
shooting another un-Spielbergian project, an adaptation of Arthur
Golden's best-selling ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' which may represent
the filmmaker's final frontier: strong, complex female characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just grew up,'' Spielberg said. ``I had some very
creative and commercial, er, arrested development in my life which
I'm very happy for because I love stories of the imagination. ...
But I don't want to wind up making the same movie 80 times.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the real reason Spielberg has tackled this film, and
in the process made an American classic, is his dad. Arnold
Spielberg fought in World War II as a radio operator aboard a B-25
bomber in Burma. This week, Spielberg was to have shown ``Saving
Private Ryan'' to Arnold, now 81, in a secluded theater, just the
two of them.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of all those feel-good blockbusters is getting
personal.

SPIELBERG'S `RYAN' GRITTY, BRUTAL _ VITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 
Directed by: Steven Spielberg 
Screenplay by: Robert Rodat 
Starring: Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Jeremy
Davies, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Giovani Ribisi,
Dennis Farina, Ted Danson 
Running time: 168 minutes 
Rated: R (intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war
violence, and for language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the war movie to
end all war movies. It's the ultimate combat film, far
outdistancing what until now had been the genre's previous World
War II classics. Slamming us down on the beach with a bunch of
grunts under fire on D-Day, it never lets us forget that images can
be as powerful as bullets as the GIs stumble through the chaos and
terror, too intent on the moment-to-moment business of staying
alive to spare time for the thought that what they're doing defines
courage and heroism. After a prologue showing an aged veteran
returning to a military cemetery, the film's first section amounts
to the most astonishingly realistic depiction of war ever put on a
screen as US troops pour onto Omaha Beach in Normandy on June 6,
1944, to find that everything has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Shells from the naval guns overshot the German pillboxes lining
the beach, landing too far inland, as did the air support _ bombs
and paratroopers. GIs swarming down the ramps of the landing boats
were sitting ducks for the German machine-gunners. Most in the
first two waves of attackers died on the beach. A Ranger detachment
led by Tom Hanks' Captain Miller tries to work its way up the
beach, sloshing through water red with the blood of fallen
comrades, some of whom we see trying to stuff their insides back
inside their torn bodies, many simply lying still, blood seeping
from bullet holes. Somehow Hanks and the other survivors scuttle up
the beach and take out the pillbox, tossing a grenade through the
slits in its concrete walls. And they haven't even heard of Private
Ryan yet.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner do they get the chance to relax with a cigarette after
the beach has been taken at heavy cost than they get an order
directly from General Marshall. They are to work their way inland,
find a Private James Ryan, and bring him out to be sent home. His
three brothers have been killed in combat and the War Department is
determined to return Mrs. Ryan's last son alive to her in Iowa. We
don't see Matt Damon's Ryan until the film is two-thirds over. When
we do, he fits into the ensemble with instant rightness, so much so
that we realize how gradually and how thoroughly Spielberg and his
terrific cast have unobtrusively transcended the usual
orchestration of GI stereotypes and got to us.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sizemore's sergeant brings compelling heart and conviction
to what could have been the cliches of a salt-of-the-earth type.
Edward Burns faces even greater odds as the cynic from Brooklyn,
but turns it into what will be his mainstream breakthrough role,
bringing an edge of sentience to his character's native wariness.
Barry Pepper, too, is more than just the Kentucky sharpshooter any
sane grunt would want alongside him in a foxhole; Pepper fills him
with individuality. Nor will you forget GregoryRibisi's
hollowed-out medic or Jeremy Davies's haunting terrified corporal,
imploding with cowardice, filled with clammy self-contempt as he
finds himself frozen in combat, unable to fire a shot.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the film is Tom Hanks' Captain Miller, a natural
leader who keeps a lid on his fear and conceals his occasionally
trembling hand as he pulls together strategy after strategy for
survival. Consolidating his standing as the new Jimmy Stewart,
Hanks', whose Miller turns out to be a high school English teacher
from Pennsylvania, is decency itself, doggedly doing what's right,
subject to combat fatigue, most complex in his responses to the
trauma that rains down upon them all. Without ever pushing it, they
draw us into the intimacy of their shared brotherhood, a thing that
makes it easy for us to understand Private Ryan's refusal to leave
his buddies when the rescue unit catches up with him. Damon's Ryan
convinces us he, too, has a stubborn conscience he must answer to,
and so they all stay on for one final battle as a stray German tank
patrol doubles back toward a bridge they must defend.
</P>
<P>
   Hellfire images erupt convulsively as the men never get the
chance to fully debate the morality of putting eight men at risk to
save one. One is interrupted in mid-sentence as a bullet tears into
him. One moment another is lining up a shot, the next he's staring
at a bloody stump where his leg used to be. Although smaller in
scale, the final battle is just as hellishly mesmerizing as the
D-Day landing, perhaps more so because by the time it comes we've
had time to develop feelings for the men we're seeing. But beyond
the capturing of detail, Spielberg's genius lies not just in
realistically recreating the carnage in all its visceral,
existential, horrific finality, but in slicing through two
generations of cliches attached to war movies.
</P>
<P>
   World War II movies were invariably saddled with a need to sell
the war, to be overtly patriotic. The Vietnam War movies were angry
reactions to an unwanted war. If World War II has been portrayed as
a just war, it also has fallen victim to its own pieties.
Mercifully, there's never a single overview or big-picture shot
here, never a scene with Ike or Montgomery standing at a map with a
pointer, spelling it all out for us. Nobody was spelling much out
for the grunts, and ``Saving Private Ryan'' maintains the integrity
of its grunt's-eye-view. It's not antiwar, as Vietnam War movies
were; it's as determined to pay tribute to the heroism of the
fighting troops as any movie ever made. But it does so more
honestly, more unflinchingly, and with more graphically unsparing
detail than ever before. And more subtle, telling detail _ an
exchange of glances between Damon and Burns, a snatch of Edith Piaf
over a radio in a seemingly deserted town _ reinfircing the film's
intimate epic quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons it works so magnificently is that it
recognizes that soldiers don't have much time or energy to spare
for reams of dialogue. Films are images, and Spielberg leaves no
doubt that he is film's premier image-maker of the last
quarter-century as he brings home the sickening shock and brutality
of war not as an antiwar placard, but as felt knowledge. It would
have been obscene to estheticize this subject, equally obscene to
gloss over the blood and terror and punishing nightmarishness of
what the GIs invading Europe went through. Spielberg mutes the
color _ except for the color of blood _ and brings up the sounds of
war. We hear every thwack and ping and thud as bullets enter bodies
and bodies fall.
</P>
<P>
   As death waits to explode from every pile of rubble, from every
rear-guard sniper, from every column of enemy tanks and trucks
swarming over the landscape with the desperation born of the gut
feeling that the war was turning against them, Spielberg sometimes
pulls back to eerie silence, making the slaughter seem surreal. But
never for long. His deliberately rough-looking newsreel style, with
its jagged pacing echoing the moment-to-moment uncertainty of each
step, insures only the briefest of respites from the tension. None
of this would count for much if there weren't depth and passion
beneath the shooting strategies of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
Thankfully, there are. Indelible as ``Schindler's List'' was,
``Amistad'' and now ``Saving Private Ryan'' exceed it. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is a great film. It takes us as close as you can get
_ or would want to get _ to the consuming inferno that is war. It
is, finally, a movie designed to remind us that war is not a movie.

ON NANTUCKET, FISH STORIES COME FREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ The weathered sign out front says ``Fishing
Tackle,'' and the place is full of rods and reels, hooks and line,
wool socks, fillet knives, and salt-water jig heads. But the most
coveted commodity here isn't for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Straight advice and steady service are the legal tender of Barry
Thurston's commerce. His Harbor Square shop, an island institution
for more than two decades, is a common-sense touchstone in a place
where worth is sometimes measured by the length of a yacht, or the
price of a palace on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is homespun. It's not commercialized,'' said longtime
customer Andy Emory, as Thurston fusses at the counter with a rod
and reel Emory bought here 22 years ago when his son was a little
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Nantucket is really all about. You come in here
and you get the fishing news. You get the local gossip. You find
out what's going on on the island. That's the fun of walking
through the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's open doors, at the corner of Salem and Candle
streets, have been a lighthouse-steady fixture here since 1976,
when Thurston _ among 15 graduates of Nantucket High School's Class
of '59 _ traded in his suit-and-tie job with Aetna Insurance for a
chance to come home and turn his hobby into his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're raised on the island here you're always an
islander,'' Thurston said over a lunchtime hamburger. ``Even if
it's just to retire, everyone eventually comes back. This type of
life grows on people. If you're born to it, it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurston's recipe for business success on an island where the
turnover of commercial properties is constant is deceptively simple
_ something he probably didn't learn while getting his business
administration degree from Boston University in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Master your subject. Give away your knowledge. And the business
will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born and raised here and he knows the island so well,''
said Mike Monte, Thurston's longtime assistant. ``The information
that we give people is fresh information. This is the first stop a
lot of people make when they get off the boat. They don't even go
to their homes. Think about that. And everybody gets everything.
There are no secrets and there are no secret places.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh, reliable information is precious data for fishermen, who
over the years have worn smooth the square-head nails in the
wide-pine floors of Thurston's Fishing Tackle. The over-the-counter
questions have changed little: Where are the fish? How big are
they? What lure should I use? What's been hot for the past couple
of days? Where should I go?
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows his fishing, and I don't know why because he never
has a chance to get out there,'' said John Moore, 65, of Fairhaven,
who was checking out fishing poles here recently. ``Fishing is a
great sport. It's a sport a family can do together. And Barry is
willing to answer anything. You talk to him like you'd talk to a
good tailor and say, `How do I look?' He's never too busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jones, 55, of Greenwich, Conn., has been vacationing here for
28 years and has been a customer of Thurston's nearly that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's part of the long-term fishing lore of
Nantucket,'' Jones said. ``He really knows the island. He knows the
fishing and he's always very helpful. You come in and he can give
you advice not only on equipment, but where the fishing's good and
how to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurston, whose father was a waterfront businessman here before
the boutiques and eateries supplanted the ice houses, coal yards,
and lumber mills of what used to be a genuine working harbor, has
the quiet bearing of a university scholar. His low-key intensity
helps make him the island's undisputed expert about fish _ and the
people who pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these people come in and say, `What's happening?' They
don't just want to know if the fish are running. They want to know
where they're running, and what time they're running, and what
they're hitting on,'' Thurston said.
</P>
<P>
   On a walking tour of the nearby harbor, Thurston shakes his head
in wonder at the wood-trimmed boats and impossibly priced luxury
yachts that are a symbol of a roaring economy that has put even a
two-week rented vacation home here out of reach of most
middle-class wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think half of Wall Street must be on the island,'' Thurston
said. ``These guys are here to relax. They are demanding in the
sense they are willing to pay for what they get, and they want what
they want. They love doing something that they're never going to do
somewhere else. Simple things. Take the kids fishing. Take them
crabbing. These high-pressure guys from New York, they're never
going to do that anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurston sells $395 poles for expert and serious fishermen. But
he keeps a well-stocked supply of $18.50 rod and reels for the
newcomers to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a really good job at not catering to just the serious,
serious angler, but also certainly the casual angler and kids,
too,'' said Dave Mills, 42, of Washington state, who was buying an
``indestructible'' rod for his 10-year-old son on a recent visit.
``I've seen kids walk in here, 12 years old, and he didn't blow
them off. Now, the fact that the kid's dad might be worth $10
million and just spent $1,000 the day before, hey seriously, he
doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurston sees the irony in being kept away from his passion by
his 13-hour daily shifts in his land-locked fishing shop. He said
he made peace with that a long time ago. And, besides, he noted,
there will be time enough to fish in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Buffett, Frank Sinatra, and much of the Kennedy clan have
been customers over the years, but Thurston seems more interested
in predicting the arrival of the Average Joe fishermen whose rods
are perennially kept in the rafters of his store when island
anglers return to their day jobs back on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you exactly whose they are,'' he said. ``Those are
the August people. Those are the July people. These are the June
people. And year after year they come back for their rods. Some
guys come back I haven't seen for 10 or 12 years. But eventually
they all come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really concentrate on having a family-type business,''
Thurston said. ``That's the most important thing to me. I really
don't concentrate on getting the real hard-core professional
fishermen. I like to have them. Don't get me wrong. I hope they all
come to me. But do business with whole families, whole generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we deal with an awful lot of people who don't know much
about fishing. They want to learn; they certainly want to do it
while they're here because they may never do it again. My feeling
is that it's got to be a family-oriented, easy-come, easy-go type
place, because there's got to be a little piece of sanity in this
place.''

`LUCKY' CARRIES THE STAMP OF MCCARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LUCKY BASTARD 
By Charles McCarry 
Random House, 385 pp., $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lucky Bastard'' is superior summer entertainment from Charles
McCarry, America's greatest master of the political novel and the
spy story.
</P>
<P>
   This tale about a foreign attempt to help a secret agent along
the path to the American presidency is a great yarn that hurtles
headlong through deeds of honor and horror, fidelity and
double-dealing, cunning and instinct. Unusually for McCarry,
there's a lot of steamy sex. There's no way to predict what is
going to happen next, and even the most fantastic inventions will
have the ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, McCarry has found himself an advance man
for history. His presidential candidate, John Fitzgerald (Jack)
Adams, believes he is the bastard son of John F. Kennedy. Like
Kennedy, and some subsequent presidents, Jack has a zipper problem.
Because such problems are very much in the news, McCarry has had to
append an author's note saying his book is a work of prophecy, not
of imitation; he had plotted the book for years and wrote it months
before real events began to mirror and mimic his fictional ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky Bastard'' isn't as dense, reverberant, and rewarding as
such McCarry masterpieces as ``The Last Supper,'' ``Second Sight,''
and ``Shelley's Heart.'' Those books are full of dodges; this one
unfalteringly moves in one straight line _ there are no subplots or
diversions. That's why ``Lucky Bastard'' would make a terrific
movie, if producers only had the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious Peter, who runs operations so secret that even
the KGB doesn't know about them, is the originator of the plot to
develop the youthful and priapic Jack Adams into malleable
presidential material. ``His rivals, the spies, wanted to steal
American history and lock it up in file cabinets. Peter, the
artist, wanted to steal history, too. But his idea was to feed this
stupid little bird sweets, tie a string to its leg, and then push
it out of the nest.'' The Marxist ideal had failed because it
entered the wrong nation's history at the wrong time; Peter wants
to give it another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Jack doesn't know anything about Peter, but he doesn't have to.
His handler is his own wife, Morgan, who in turn is handled by the
book's fascinating narrator, Dmitri, Peter's chief associate. Peter
is a pretty amoral moralist; these are shrewd commentators who
enjoy playing with the role of moralist. ``Issues don't make
presidents,'' Morgan observes. ``Publicity does.'' Dmitri thinks
like this too _ he calls the media ``the priesthood in charge of
ritual executions in the United States.'' Unlike the others,
however, Dmitri is ironically self-aware. ``Like many a handler
before me, including Judas Iscariot, I was beginning to love the
agent more than I loved the operation, a bad sign that I did not
recognize at the time, or until long afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The other key figures in the story are Jack's lifelong friend
Danny Miller and Danny's lifelong girlfriend and wife-to-be, the
perfect cheerleader Cindy Rogers. The story covers decades, from
just before the Vietnam War to the end of the Evil Empire, and over
those years the personal relationships among the Adamses and the
Millers play through nearly every possible permutation of business
and sexual alliance and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   More than that it would be unfair to say, but McCarry does know
whereof he speaks. The novelist, a product of the Berkshires,
served in the CIA for years and later ghost-wrote memoirs for Gen.
Alexander Haig and former Treasury secretary and chief of staff
Donald Regan, so he can toss off observations like, ``It was said
in the KGB canteen that Peter could make Andropov laugh and
Brezhnev think. This was enough to make anyone fear him.'' The
novelist's range of reference is wide, from Joseph Conrad to ``The
Godfather.'' A television spot makes an incompetent politician
``look like an especially stupid horse that had just awakened to
find itself in bed with the severed head of a Hollywood producer.''
There is a provocative analysis of the Alger Hiss case, and many
insider anecdotes that don't have to be true to sound convincing _
the story tells us that the Soviet way of dealing with the
wandering appetites of Hugarian prime minister Janos Kadar was to
castrate him.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel full of puppets and puppeteers, it is McCarry who
controls all the strings _ and he does it with practiced hands that
are also daring. McCarry is a more profound moralist than any of
his characters, and the most politically astute of all, if not
always the most politically correct. Humorless extremists of
several sorts and sects will find cold comfort here. McCarry says
he quarantined himself from the media during the months when he
wrote this book, which means he missed a lot of Monica Lewinsky
jokes, but in sticking to himself, he was keeping better company.

CORGAN MAKES CASE TO `ADORE PUMPKINS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Smashing Pumpkins are accustomed to abuse from critics, but
not from fans. Yet the Pumpkins' new album, ``Adore,'' has drawn
some fire from the band's core audience. The band admits to being
``puzzled'' by the reaction, says singer Billy Corgan, who asks
that fans give it a closer listen before writing it off.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, ``Adore'' is a low-key, down-tempo record compared
to the general head-snapping roar of past Pumpkins disks. But, says
Corgan, ``We just think it's an extension of an underplayed part of
our character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The album comes out and all of a sudden you have fans
completely overreacting,'' Corgan says from a tour stop in
Cincinnati. ``At the same time, you have a huge dichotomy in the
reviews, where it's either completely a masterpiece _ the `best
work of our career' and a `bold step forward' _ or it's a piece of
garbage. It's really kind of puzzled the band and made the band
realize that everything is so built on the thought of something and
not necessarily the substance of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole thing was to take the opportunity of our success to
really redefine what we're doing and why we're doing it,'' says
Corgan. ``So there was a real purity in that _ to go back to a
simpler way of writing and working and, in essence, just try to
start over. Which, of course, is a highly uncommercial thing to do.
Everybody likes all the dots to connect very easily, thank you very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan is a convincing chap, but even he must realize that
``Adore'' is not an easily accessible work. The last Pumpkins
release, the double-CD ``Mellon Collie &AMP; the Infinite Sadness,''
sold 8 million copies, boosted by the hit song ``Bullet with
Butterfly Wings'' and its often quoted verse: ``Despite all my
rage/I'm still just a rat in a cage.'' The new album, though, is
more quietly philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   Some listeners think the new disk is Corgan's personal reaction
to the death of his mother and breakup of his four-year marriage.
``A lot has been made of that,'' he says, ``but I really think that
misses the gist of the whole album. It's more about someone just
surveying the landscape of the world that we're in right now. It's
almost more commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a world-view album _ and that doesn't necessarily
hit people until later,'' he adds. ``It looks way personal, but
there's a foundation under there of a bigger view. I honestly feel
this album is less personal than past work.''
</P>
<P>
   The music is meant to provide hope, says Corgan, in an age of
cynicism. ``I just think we're in a really negative era to the
point of ridiculousness, to the point of killing growth, certainly
artistically. Look at my generation. We have no heroes. None.
They've all been mangled and spit back out. Nobody walks out of
this unscathed. At least the '60s people got to be heroes for a
while, then later you found out they were (screwed) up. We're
(screwed) up now and are still trying to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album is ``really the backdrop for me to try to find the
soul amidst all the crap, for myself and for people who are
listening, to try to say what's really important _ that is, love
and the concept of family ... and to get at the core issues of
what's facing us in the light of this overwhelming negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   To rebuff the negativity, the Smashing Pumpkins, who include
guitarist James Iha and bassist D'Arcy Wretzky, are now doing a
tour in which all shows are benefits. They've been giving away
$100,000-$150,000 per show to charities. The Orpheum date will
benefit local children's AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the extension of the philosophy of the album to put
the thought into action,'' says Corgan. ``We're putting our money
where our mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a John F. Kennedy to lead you, or at least
give you a kind of shining star, you have to create those,'' says
Corgan. ``I think what's poignant about a band like the Pumpkins is
that we're not squeaky clean. We're not Pat Boone or something.
There's a weight to the message because we've been there. I mean, I
can't identify with a baby that has AIDS, but I can identify with
problems in the home and we can identify with abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Corgan is still stung by critiques of the new disk,
he's encouraged by how its songs have been received in concert.
``The reactions to the shows have been so overwhelming that it's
given us the confidence to keep going,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for the positive reaction, he says, is the addition
of new touring drummer Kenny Aronoff, who previously worked with
John Mellencamp, Melissa Etheridge, and Bob Seger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fantastic,'' Corgan says of the Stockbridge-bred
Aronoff. ``His maturity and his experience have really helped bring
this album fo fruition live. He brings a kind of consistency every
night that we've never been used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan remains a prolific songwriter and a highly in-demand
producer/guitarist for other musicians. Last year, he worked on the
solo album of Cars singer Ric Ocasek, ``Troublizing'' (``I got him
to be a little more edgy than he might have been,'' he says); and
this year on the forthcoming Hole album with Courtney Love. That
one has sparked a tabloid debate about who did what on it, but
Corgan says only, ``My influence is apparent and what shines
through from Hole's past work is apparent. ... People will hear
what I did and didn't do, and then all the dust will settle about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for future Pumpkins plans, Corgan says they'll start
recording a new album in September. What kind of music can we
expect this time? ``I'm keeping my mouth shut on that one,'' he
says with a good-natured laugh.

TURTLE IS CREEPING UP ON HARE IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call him Governor Bullseye. Because everyone's out to get him.
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci was the lopsided front-runner late
last year when one of Boston's biggest bankers scoffed at the
notion that any Democrat could beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course Cellucci will win,'' tut-tutted Mr. Bank. But as
they say when you go in to redo your mortgage, that was then, this
is now. And Cellucci's stumbling performance since the departure of
Senor Weld has brought him back to the pack. From the right comes
the sniper fire of Treasurer Joe Malone, whose Republican primary
campaign keeps Cellucci dipping into his treasure chest. From the
left comes the distant rumble of Democratic cannon, louder each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci held two hole cards this summer: incumbency and cash.
His fund-raisers methodically amassed millions with the
implication: If you don't give, you don't get any consideration
from the present and probably future governor.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Cellucci sits astride a shrinking ice floe in a
lopsidedly Democratic state, and the temperature's a-risin'. Labor
is turning up the heat. It's eight years since unions had a
friendly governor. And in Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, labor
has found its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With calculations more professional than personal, after a
cold-hearted assessment of which Democrat has the best chance to
end eight years of hostile governing, union leaders swung their
heft and people power behind the AG.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Patricia McGovern has nipped steadily at his
heels. She has raised $700,000 this year, on top of a half-million
last year. But Harshbarger, who began running well before Joe
Kennedy dropped out, did a million last year, a million so far this
year, and will outgun her down the stretch. Brian Donnelly has been
lapped by the other two and looks to be out of it.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Cellucci strategy to counter labor's anticipated
onslaught and the seven-week postprimary Democratic surge, it is
not evident. Say Cellucci and Harshbarger win their primaries, the
Democrat tears into Cellucci from the get-go on primary night.
Wednesday, the armies engage, TV spots flashing. Thursday, the big
guns of the national Democratic establishment file into the Boston
Park Plaza. There'll be podium-thumping orations by President
Clinton, Vice President Gore, US Senate minority leader Tom
Daschle, House minority leader Dick Gephardt, Ted and Joe Kennedy,
John Kerry, and every Democrat running anywhere near the top of the
November ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The menu will feature Fricasseed Gingrich, Roasted Lott, Fried
Helms, and Overcooked Cellucci. This event is run by three local
Democrats who play on the national stage: national chairman Steve
Grossman, Alan Solomont, who is McGovern's fund-raiser, and Elaine
Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   And Harshbarger's campaign will that day have pocketed a check
from the Commonwealth, about $900,000, representing the whole pot
of state matching campaign funds that was set aside for
gubernatorial tickets that abided by the state's weirdly configured
campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spurned the limits and therefore public funds, figuring
his muscle could euchre more dough the old-fashioned way, by
twisting arms till the shoulder buckled. So even though Harshbarger
had to expend a portion of his stash to repel McGovern, the
likeliest Democratic victor waltzes into his unity dinner with a
crisp check for $900,000 in his kick.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad way to start off the cocktail hour. Cellucci will have
more money. But he'll have been through a war with Malone. All
those lurking problems about Cellucci's personal finances will have
been raised, and not completely dispelled, during Malone's robust
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger cannot spend more than $1.5 million between the
primary and general elections. But his friends in labor, and
Democrats running other races, will have their own input. And there
are two political axioms in play: The crowd that has been out of
office for a long time is hungrier, and the gang that's been in for
a long time tends to get sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   And as the odds change on the tote board, the political
calculations mutate as well. Power brokers like Mayor Tom Menino,
whose hostility to Harshbarger's ambition is no secret, must
reassess. Does Menino give the wink to his minions and nudge them
to help Cellucci? Or does he go with labor, Clinton-Gore, and
voters who want to shake off eight years of Republican mastery?
</P>
<P>
   Should Harshbarger win without any sort of help from Menino, the
city administration can kiss goodbye to special treatment from the
corner office. Menino, who smarted for years at the perceived
slights of more powerful pols, knows better than most how sweet it
is to win after being written off. And not since the slow, steady,
under-the-radar campaigning of the young Dukakis or the young
Tsongas have we seen as methodical and sternly focused a statewide
campaign as Harshbarger's. His mascot is not the donkey but the
turtle.
</P>
<P>
   I know one banker and one big-city mayor who would gulp and
swallow hard if handed a turtle pin.

FOR BANKER, JAMMIN SCIENCE FEST IS A SOUND INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There's a technical question for executives: What do
astronomy and space exploration have to do with banking and
business?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, says Seafirst Bank Chairman John Rindlaub. Rindlaub is
one of the driving forces behind the ``Jammin Science Fest'' held
this week in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A science enthusiast from way back, he has an ulterior motive
for getting kids excited about science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching kids about science helps them in ways that also benefit
employers, he said. ``It encourages kids to develop
critical-thinking skills and the ability to use new information in
problem-solving _ which are important skills they can bring to the
workplace as future employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're not working in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at jobs today, more and more jobs _ and the
better-paying ones _ will touch on science literacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even customer service jobs in non-technical industries assume a
certain level of technical proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real challenge we all have is in hiring, training and
retaining good people,'' he said. ``In an area with one of the
lowest unemployment rates in the country, that's increasingly a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   That awareness led to the development of the science festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old science program for kids is designed to give
students a hands-on chance to learn about science in an
entertaining fashion. Since 1995, it has reached more than 14,000
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Each year has a different theme. This year, kids delved into
space exploration through exhibits on constellations, the solar
system, star colors and a real meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching kids science by having them participate is what builds
their excitement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to instill some curiosity at an early age, and do
it not through show-and-tell but in an interactive way.''
</P>
<P>
   His hope is that it will lead to more and better science
learning as they go through school.
</P>
<P>
   American students have been lagging in science scores in recent
years. Earlier this year, for example, U.S. high school seniors had
among the lowest scores of 21 nations in the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study.
</P>
<P>
   And a 1996 study reported by the National Assessment Governing
Board showed that four out of 10 seniors were deficient in science
knowledge and skills. Lower-grade students fared somewhat better,
but only 3 percent of kids in all the grades were capable of
advanced work.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter, unless you're planning to be a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   The value of a grounding in the sciences goes deeper than
technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skill set needed in business gets back to scientific
literacy,'' Rindlaub said. Doing good science depends on the
``three C's _ curiosity, creativity and critical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to a fourth C critical to business _ the ability
to compete. All businesses rely on employees who can solve problems
and think beyond the obvious, which is what science is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is even more critical with advances in information
sciences and the explosion of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a data-rich and information-poor society,'' he said.
``There's lots of data out there. It's how we translate that into
information that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, real competitive advances in business will come
from an interdisciplinary approach similar to the one taking place
in various scientific fields. The combination of computer sciences
and genetics, for example, is leading to a revolution in
understanding how genes work in the body, and has generated a new
model for treating disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rindlaub envisions similar innovations will come from
``horizontal'' thinking across divisions from customer service to
product development.
</P>
<P>
   Rindlaub has loved science since he was a kid getting up in the
middle of the night to look at the planets through his telescope.
He admits his office today ``looks like a recording studio and
print shop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seafirst's program has already expanded to Oregon and Idaho.
Other business leaders have expressed an interest in mounting
similar programs, or launching other initiatives to try to build
scientific literacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to turn as many kids as possible into students who
will carry a desire to learn new things into their careers, he
said. ``As fast as the world is changing, lifelong training is here
to stay.''

BOTH PAST, PRESENT TENSE FOR GUNNER'S MATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joseph Harris is a gunner's mate, 3rd class, aboard the
guided missle cruiser USS Leyte Gulf, which has come to Boston to
participate in today's bicentennial salute to the USS Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Simpson is a gunner's mate, 3rd class, aboard the USS
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The two mates live by the same pay scale. But their jobs are
separated by two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Harris monitors a multimillion-dollar missile launch system and
sails the seven seas. Aboard Old Ironsides, Simpson fires a signal
cannon that is good only for ceremonies, sells sodas during special
events, and seldom leaves the dock. He also specializes in
capturing the visitor's imagination with descriptions of cannon
warfare during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity about the job of gunner's mate, then and now, brought
the two men together for the first time Wednesday. And on one
point, they adamantly agreed: The gunner's mate aboard the
Constitution during the War of 1812 had far and away the lousier
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris summarized it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank &UR;  &LR; you, but no thank &UR;  &LR; you,'' the missile launch expert
said as Simpson was midway through a description of the sand,
water, blood, and splintered wood that typically littered the
Constitution's gun deck during a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 27, manages the forward 64 missile bays aboard the Leyte
Gulf, the 567-foot AEGIS-class cruiser that docked Wednesday
morning at the Commonwealth Pier in South Boston. Harris works
behind a door deep in the ship inscribed with several warnings
referring to the explosive nature of his work.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Tennessee taking things apart, including the tail
lights on the family station wagon, a hair dryer, and several home
appliances, none of which could ever be put together again. It was
a long leap to missile launch systems, but fortunately, the Navy
has also taught him during the past several years how to put the
systems back together, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is one of a half-dozen sailors aboard the Leyte Gulf who,
in times of crisis, are issued keys that appear designed to unlock
bicycles, but when used in concert, actually unlock missiles. To
date, Harris says, he has had to fire missiles only during
peacetime exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is odd, I must admit, to think that my targets can be 700
miles away and that I will never see them,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   A gunner's mate aboard the Constitution, on the other hand,
would put a 32-pound cannon ball through the 20-inch thick wooden
hull of a ship 1,200 yards away, then see and smell the damage. But
unlike Harris, who single-handedly can oversee his next shot with
the push of a button, the crew to reload a cannon was 14-men
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the fury of what was going on, it's remarkable
they could get the next shot off in 40 seconds,'' said Simpson, 21,
a native of Kentucky who chose to become a gunner's mate in the
wake of his father, who served on the USS Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution was undefeated in more than 30
encounters, the ship became legendary for three close-quarter
victories against the British during the War of 1812 when, as the
ship historian and author Tyrone Martin has said, battles were
fought ``fiercely, in slow motion aboard a ship that sailed about
four knots during engagements.''
</P>
<P>
   As a battle neared, a crew of 500 would take up battle stations
with the captain's command: ``Beat to quarters,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen sailors pumped water from the bilge onto the gun
deck to minimize the risk of an inadvertent explosion. Then they
sprinkled sand on the deck so barefooted gunners would not slip
should the deck become bloody.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that a cannon, recoiling from a shot,
accelerated to 80 miles an hour backward until ropes stopped it.
Then the 3 1/2-ton gun bucked several feet in the air, its ascent
checked by ceiling structures. Insignia on the cannon barrels have
been found pressed into the wood above.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the ears of a gunner's mate were bleeding from the
racket 45 minutes into a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why sailors to this day wear handkerchiefs. They would
wax the ends, then stick them in their ears for protection,''
Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Harris never sees the weapons that launch from the
tubes he maintains. He turns a key, says, ``Manned and Ready,'' and
prays that the missiles clear the launchpad.

HAPA'S HYBRID BLENDS ISLAND FOLKLORE WITH MAINLAND POP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hapa means ``half-half'' or ``ethnically mixed'' in Hawaiian
slang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affectionate local term,'' guitarist Barry Flanagan of
the music duo Hapa said by phone from Waikiki. ``There's a great
mixture of ethnicity here. It means `half-half,' and that can mean
half Hawaiian and half Caucasian or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who co-founded the duo with Keli'i Kaneali'i in 1984,
grew up in a mostly Italian neighborhood in New Jersey. Kaneali'i
grew up in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   They met at a Christmas party on Maui in 1983. An impromptu
performance convinced them to form a duo combining their diverse
but complementary styles, creating a blend of Hawaiian music with
American and European pop and folk.
</P>
<P>
   The two musicians share lead vocals and play a variety of
stringed instruments, mostly guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who heard us at the party thought we were this
rehearsed group,'' Flanagan said. ``But it was actually the first
time we had played together. It was very serendipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan had been playing in a country-rock band in Colorado
when he decided to travel to Hawaii in 1980 to study the Hawaiian
slack-key guitar style, which involves retuning the guitar by
slackening the strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up moving back here with my girlfriend about three
years later,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hapa is one of Hawaii's most popular groups. The duo's
debut album, ``Hapa,'' was released about five years ago and has
sold almost 500,000 copies. The current album, ``In the Name of
Love,'' so far has sold about 75,000. The group also has released
an album of electric surf-guitar music called ``Surf Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hawaiian music scene is really an anomaly,'' Flanagan
said. ``It's a pretty huge scene, one of the largest regional
markets in the world. Local artists can sell 100,000 albums here
(in Hawaii) in a year, and records just continue to sell. They
don't have a six-month lifespan.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Flanagan has composed many of the duo's more
Hawaiian-styled songs, among them ``E Hele Ana E,'' ``Nani Wale o
Ka'inlani'' and ``Lelehuna.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Flanagan's more striking compositions is ``The Waikiki
Beachboy Song,'' a wistful, almost eerie ballad about Waikiki's
vanishing beach boys.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan was inspired to write the song after reading ``The
Waikiki Beach Boy,'' a book by Grady Timmons about the history of
Hawaiian beach boys, who serenaded tourists and taught them how to
surf.
</P>
<P>
   Performing guest vocals on the song is Hawaii's most famous
singer, Don Ho, a man Kaneali'i calls ``the Frank Sinatra of
Hawaiian music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a verse for Don and he loved it,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Ho agreed to record the song with Hapa, Flanagan and
Kaneali'i began sitting in on Sunday nights at Ho's regular
performances at the Waikiki Beachcomber. ``I really wanted to know
why this man was the No. 1 name in Hawaiian music since the late
'50s or early '60s,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan and Kaneali'i were floored by Ho's professionalism.
``He still does five nights a week. He's the consummate
entertainer. It's no mistake or fluke that he's been the No. 1 name
in entertainment here for almost four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan recalled one of the first shows Hapa did with Ho.
``When the show was over, he was running by me to be the first
person out in front to greet everyone. And as he's running by me,
he goes, `Hey, Barry, get out there and be with the people. Don't
be like Elvis. Look what happened to him,''' Flanagan said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The current album also includes versions of the guitar classic
``Sleepwalk,'' played on a Hawaiian steel guitar; and U2's ``Pride
(In the Name of Love).''
</P>
<P>
   Hapa first played the U2 song on Martin Luther King Jr. Day five
years ago in front of a crowd of 30,000 at Hawaii's Hula Bowl. The
day also marked the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the
Hawaiian monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest crowd we had ever played, and it was a very
emotional day for many Hawaiians,'' Flanagan said. ``We liked the
song so much we started closing all our shows with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapa spends most of the year performing in the Hawaiian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything from baby luaus to large-scale theater
shows,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three months of the year, Hapa travels to the mainland to
perform a series of concerts. The duo currently is on a West Coast
tour.

INVESTORS BANK &AMP; TRUST THRIVES AMID GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says size matters?
</P>
<P>
   Giant institutions like State Street Corp., caring for trillions
of dollars of their clients' financial assets, dominate the
lucrative business of securities custody. Conventional wisdom calls
their vast scale a must to compete in a line of work driven by
sophisticated technology and known for its intensely competitive
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Investors Bank &AMP; Trust, a little-known Boston
competitor that is thriving despite its relatively tiny piece of
turf in the custody world.
</P>
<P>
   IBT and its parent firm, Investors Financial Services Corp.,
processed $164 billion of assets for customers as of the end of
June. It struck an important deal this week with BankBoston that
will add another $70 billion of assets to the total.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with State Street's $4.5 trillion in assets under
custody. Another big name in the business, Bank of New York, is
custodian to $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business about scale at one end, but at the other end
it's about niches and finding profitable customers,'' said Charles
Ruffel, editor of Global Custodian, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Bank &AMP; Trust had been growing steadily by 30 percent a
year before the BankBoston deal. One key: flying under the radar of
gigantic competitors and clients to find smaller investment
managers and assure them their business won't be neglected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the strategy we prey upon,'' said Investors
Financial chief executive Kevin Sheehan. ``You don't have to have
$70 billion to get us to stand up and take attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt to have some high-profile names on the client
roster, like John Hancock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and
Deutsche Bank. But that list includes many more smaller to midsize
money managers, like Standish, Ayer &AMP; Wood, Northeast Investors,
and David L. Babson &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Custodians and processors perform much of the investment grunt
work that is never seen by mutual fund shareholders or other
customers. They are hired by money managers to keep track of
individual stocks and bonds, collect dividends, settle trades made
by their customers, and other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing very sexy about the business,'' Sheehan
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Investors was formed in 1969 by Boston money manager Eaton Vance
Corp., then called Eaton &AMP; Howard, to provide in-house trustee
services for the company's own funds. The custodial business, once
a division of Bank of New England, was bought from the struggling
bank in 1990. In November 1995, Eaton Vance spun the entire
operation off into a public company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors Financial Services launched its initial public
offering at 16 1/2 per share. The stock reached a record 60 1/2
earlier this week and closed Thursday at 59.
</P>
<P>
   A few other companies have grown smaller custody businesses at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Brothers Harriman, a custodian for about $550 billion, is
perhaps the most prominent of the group. It makes a pitch that the
giant competitors are becoming less suitable for many customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether some of these (big competitors) have
become so large that they've become less efficient, not more,''
said Susan Livingston, a Brown Brothers partner in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nearly all of Investors Financial's client list was grown
from scratch, mostly smaller customers pitched and eventually won
over. But the BankBoston deal, by far the largest single addition
of business, was a rare and dramatic departure.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will buy BankBoston's business, providing custody to
600 customers with $45 billion, for $44 million in cash up front
and a kicker of up to $6 million more based on future performance.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston also agreed to outsource some backshop functions to
Investors Financial for its own $25 billion asset management
business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors agreed to extend its subcontracting arrangement with
the bank for custodial work in Latin America, a small but growing
piece of business. It also agreed to offer Boston jobs to
BankBoston's 106 custody employees working in Canton.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston officials said they entertained at least three bids
for the custodial business, but chose Investors because it could
accommodate them on more details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew being a significant customer, we would mean more to
them than anyone else,'' said Peter Manning, BankBoston's mergers
and acquisitions chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a deal starts out by showing us the best price, it
quickly moves into shaping the best deal,'' he said.

TRUSTEE NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE MOTHER'S NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I need some direction in helping my mother with her future
investment plans. I am now trustee of her trust because she is
totally disabled and cannot take care of herself or her finances. I
recently selected and placed my mothers in a skilled nursing
facility and am in the process of selling her home. When this is
completed, it should bring her about $300,000. How should I
conservatively invest this so as to provide for her continuing care
for the rest of her life (share is 83) and still disperse some
gifts she has designated, in her will, for her grandchildren? She
now has about $200,000 in tax-free municipal bonds, and has
pensions bringing in about $1,500 per month. Her expenses, after
the sale, will be around $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   J.R., El Cajon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The first thing I'd do is prioritize your duties as trustee
-- focusing first on your mother's needs and comfort and forgetting
about her wishes for bequests to grandchildren for the foreseeable
future. Why do I say this? Because while it's likely your mother
will have sufficient funds to see her through, it's far from
certain. Let's suppose you were able to invest her $500,000
remaining assets (after the real estate sale) so as to achieve a
6,.5 percent portfolio average return. With monthly withdrawals of
$4,500, the result would be that her funds would last early 14
years, and then be exhausted. It's true that not many people live
to reach age 97, but as a trustee you must consider the possibility
and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing to do is determine whether the tax-free
municipal bonds are still appropriate for her. I am far from an
expert on this matter, but I understand that a portion of the
charges at a nursing facility are considered health care expenses,
while another percentage is designated living costs. Since the
former quality for a tax deduction, her move to the nursing
facility may change her overall tax situation sufficiently that
all, or some, of the tax-free bonds might be profitably swapped for
higher-yielding taxable issues.
</P>
<P>
   I would begin with the administrators at the nursing facility,
who can explain what percentage of the monthly bills represent
deductible health care charges, and then take the problem to her
(or your) tax advisor.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, once you've done that, weeding out whatever
percentage of the municipals that seem to be indicated, I'd build a
portfolio dominated by a good GNMA fund, such as Fidelity GNMA or
Vanguard GNMA, which you can expect to yield about 6.5 percent. You
might put 55 percent of the portfolio here; I would divide the
balance among the municipals, a two-year CD, and a good high-yield
corporate bond fund such as Fidelity Capital and Income or Vanguard
Corporate High-Yield Bond. Yes, it's true that those last two
qualify for the tag ``junk bond funds,'' but since the positions
would represent only about 15 percent of the portfolio -- or less,
if it remains advisable to hold significant tax- exempt position --
you should be willing to accept the fairly moderate risk in favor
iof a higher yield.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 24 and work for McDonald's, where I recently qualified
to enroll in the 401(k) program. I have decided to contribute 13
percent of my salary, which will be matched 50 percent by the
company. There are five different options for investment. I am
young and retirement is a long way off, and from what I've heard I
should be making my investments grow. How would you divide
contributions among these five options, in 10 percent increments: a
money market fund, a stable value fund, a blended stock and bond
fund, and a diversified stock fund?
</P>
<P>
   K.E., Portland, Maine
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You didn't mention it, but I'm guessing the fifth option on
the 401(k) menu is McDonald's Corp. common stock.
</P>
<P>
   You're correct that what you want is long-term growth, since you
can probably expect the account to be building for 35 to 40 years.
For that reason, I suggest you summarily reject the first two
options -- the money market fund and the stable value fund, which
is probably only slightly more aggressive than the money market
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Only if your consider yourself a very cautious person, or one
who might lose sleep over the prospect of short-term reversals in
the market, would I consider the balanced offering very seriously.
A typical balanced fund holds about 60 percent of its assets in a
portfolio of stocks and the remainder in bonds. I consider it's
reasonable over a long period for a stock fund to average 10
percent annual growth, while 7 percent might be a satisfactory
target for a bond portfolio. That would give you a portfolio
average return of 8.8 percent. Let's suppose that your
contributions plus those of your employer will work out to $3,000 a
year. If you kept that pace up for 30 years, the calculator shows
the pool would grow to $406,824.
</P>
<P>
   But if you went entirely with stocks and achieved that target 10
percent average return over the same period of time, the total
would be $516,048, which strikes me as quite a difference.
</P>
<P>
   So if it were my money, I'd put 90 percent of the contributions
into the diversified stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   As for that final 10 percent, if I'm correct in assuming that
shares of McDonald's represent the final option, I'd put the last
of the money there. I think the booming growth days of McDonald are
probably behind it, bit it's obviously a very valuable franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I like the idea of employees owning a bit of the
action -- it changes your point of view, even when it comes to
things both large and small. I remember that my first journalism
job was at a closely held newspaper, and one older employee
perpetually seemed to be rescuing 3'' pencils from the wastebasket
and using them.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked a colleague to explain this, he said simply, ``He's
a stockholder.'' Finally, if you think the plan I suggest is a bit
too bold, but you also want to be a bit less conservative than
going entirely with the balanced fund, you might consider a
compromise -- 60 percent diversified stocks, 30 percent balanced,
and 10 percent company stock.

   Sometime in the afternoon, the flashy yellow BMW convertible had
been spirited away and replaced by a Mercedes-Benz sedan finished
in some exotically labeled hue that looks like gray to me. It
turned out to be Calypso Green in the Benz paint scheme, although
several people told me it was turquoise. I really wouldn't know.
</P>
<P>
   This weekly _ sometimes more often _ motor metamorphosis keeps
neighbors occupied in speculation. For some, curiosity got to be
too consuming; one came knocking at the door asking what I did that
caused the procession of new vehicles. One, being a Globe reader,
actually put two and two together and came up with auto writer.
But, while adults mostly speculate in silence, children are more
direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a dealer?'' The question came loudly, from a group of
youngsters in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered, and proceeded to tell them what I did. ``How
would one dealer have so many different makes?'' I asked my
interrogator. But he hadn't been asking was I a car dealer; he was
figuring drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The green Mercedes proved a very pleasant car, as do most Benz
cars. For the kind of money Benz requests to part with one of its
chariots, one has a right to expect a pleasant experience. This
four-door, five-passenger E-Class is elegantly appointed, quiet,
offers good performance _ although the tested model seemed to have
a bit of hesitation on initial acceleration _ something to pursue
as I roll up miles on it.
</P>
<P>
   I had rolled up a couple of hundred miles plus, approaching the
refuel moment, but the gauge indicated a half tank. Either fuel
economy is extraordinary or the tank is enormous. Or maybe the
gauge is malfunctioning? At 300 miles, the gauge was still
indicating plenty of fuel; it was time to sort this out. The
answer, had I looked, was clearly written on the back of the car,
but I found it in the paperwork in the glove box: This E-Class is
the E300 Turbodiesel. It has a modest-sized fuel tank, under 22
gallons, and an EPA economy rating of 26 miles per gallon city, 34
highway. The mystery of the extended range also answered the
question of why the hesitation; diesels are slow to wind up.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to recognize the car as a diesel immediately by
the usual diesel clues testify to the quantum leap in diesel
technology since the short-lived diesel craze of 20 years ago. The
diesel is instantly recognizable by the noise _ it usually sounds
like crushed stone in a clothes dryer _ and the aroma; diesels
stink. The E300 is quiet, odorless. And diesel fuel in these parts
is still cheaper than gasoline, a lot cheaper than mid and premium
grades of gas.
</P>
<P>
   I began listening for the telltale sound of a diesel;
occasionally you could hear what might be taken for engine knock in
a gas car _ but only occasionally and only when you slam the pedal
to the metal. The odor, however, was another matter. Nose close to
the tailpipe, I thought I smelled a trace of that familiar stink.
And maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The E300 Turbodiesel is an expensive car, $41,800 plus $595
delivery. That Calypso Green finish is an extra, the leather
upholstery added almost $1,700 to the bill, and the sunroof tacks
on $1,110. Total as-tested price: $45,895. That's an enormous
amount of money for a working stiff to contemplate shelling out for
basic transportation, but there's nothing basic about this car.
When you look at the technology aboard invested in safety, the
price doesn't seem quite so steep _ not to mention the technology
devoted to the sybaritic devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the front air bags, there are side air bags in
the doors. The passenger-side front bag is equipped with the Benz
``Baby Smart'' technology that senses when a child seat is there
and deactivates the bag while the seat is there. The front seat
belts are rigged with pre-tensioners and force limiters; the
tensioners make certain there's no slack on impact, and the force
limiters allow the belt to give some, to avoid injury from the belt
in high-speed impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes are four-wheel antilocks with a new twist _ what Benz
calls the Emergency Brake Assist System. This has nothing to do
with the emergency brake but everything to do with braking
emergencies. For the short person who cannot extend to depress the
brake pedal fully, or for the frail who cannot exert a lot of brake
pressure, the car's microprocessor deduces emergency from the speed
of the braking stroke and the forces on the car, and automatically
signals for mamximum force. And there is the automatic slip control
that senses yaw, steering angles, driver steering input, and
instantly computes impending skid and corrects same _ usually
before the driver is aware he/she was actually in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And the E300 has a tilt/telescoping steering wheel for maximum
comfort, a Benz engineeering concession to Americans. It is not too
long ago that inquiries about the possibility of tilt wheels in
Benz cars brought a reprimand: ``The engineers have determined the
optimum position for the steering wheel and there is no need to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The E300 is equipped to the max, but not everything works the
way one might expect all the time. The dual climate control, for
instance, didn't do what I really wanted done _ cool on one side,
warm on the other. It took a lot of finagling to keep the cool off
the arm side, and the result was that the cool area wasn't all that
cool after all. This is an effort to accommodate what seems to be a
basic difference between men and women; men usually are more
comfortable in a cold car, while women seem to need warmth.
</P>
<P>
   The radio controls are obviously the result of a plan by a
thinking individual _ the buttons are large enough for most fingers
_ but the whole thing needs more thought. It's time to think
``knobs'' here for the basic functions. The driver's window switch
has an ``express up and down'' feature that worked flawlessly on
the up but was a bit random on the down _ I almost never got it to
do an ``express down.''
</P>
<P>
   The 174-horepower (243 ft/lb torque) was mated with a
five-speed, automatic transmission that offers alternative
clutchless manual operation, a decided benefit in mountainous
regions, even after you concede the downhill holding power of a
high-compression (22:1) diesel engine.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is superior _ crisp and precise. The ride is quiet
and forgiving _ but not soft. The car felt good on the dirt byways
and the concrete highways. Fuel mileage was extraordinary for a
five-passenger luxury car with such performance; for 1,300 miles
measured, the Benz delivered about 30.5 miles per gallon _ three
tanks isn't enough to get a precise handle on the mileage of foamy
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, this is an exuberant thumbs up for an automobile
of grace, manners, and muscle.

<P>
   Western opinion is surprisingly untroubled by Algeria's anguish,
which has lasted more than six years and claimed almost 100,000
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The two main reasons for Western indifference are hostility
toward the Islamist rebels, who are widely seen as intolerant, and
the opacity of the Algerian political system.
</P>
<P>
   To penetrate the fog and understand the crisis, one should focus
less on the Muslim fundamentalists and more on the key player in
Algeria's politics: the army.
</P>
<P>
   Islamist guerrilla warfare broke out in January 1992, after the
army canceled elections won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).
Blocked from running the state, the Islamic Front was banned in
March 1992. A subsequent crackdown drove its moderate wing to
rejoin the radicals, who resorted to violence. The Islamists
targeted military vehicles, barracks, the police and government
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Another Islamist organization, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
then appeared and went even further, killing intellectuals,
journalists, women and foreigners and massacring villagers in
western Algeria. But the lack of information about these murders
bred widespread skepticism about the group's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers suspected _ then and now _ that the Armed Islamic
Group is actually a product of the state's intelligence service,
designed to discredit the Islamists. These suspicions have been
heightened by the Algerian government's sharp refusal to allow any
international inquiry into the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   By now, violence is erupting in Algeria in an almost total
information blackout. This is hardly by chance; the regime has
always preferred the clandestine to the transparent. Only the tip
of the iceberg, the most insignificant area of decision-making, is
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through Algerian newspapers, a reader might feel that he
was living in a country where social and economic life was more or
less normal, apart from occasional massacres by desperate bandits
who are about to be apprehended. That is because even the
``independent'' newspapers are censored, and everything in them
must be filtered through official channels.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists must depict the Islamists as criminals, and no one
can report on the army's illegal and arbitrary methods. Editors and
reporters have been imprisoned for publishing information
``prejudicial to security and to the forces of law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Countless questions about the killings of journalists and
artists and the massacres of villagers remain unanswered. Given the
reluctance of the authorities to throw any real light on these
tragedies, rumors are rife about the identity of the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   It is said _ and only a committee of inquiry could confirm or
refute this _ that the regime is pursuing a strategy aimed at
discrediting the Islamists, presenting them as criminals who rape
and kill young women, strangle children, burn down schools and
murder intellectuals. These charges imply government involvement in
the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   What is the truth? Official information on the atrocities
remains scarce. The perpetrators are never taken alive or brought
before the courts. Since there is no freedom of the press, the
media confirm the version put forward by the authorities. The army
has no intention of letting an international inquest try to uncover
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding Algeria's crisis and its possible resolution
requires looking beyond the Islamist movement, the focus of most
Western attention, to the country's political structure and to the
real power in a terrorized land: the army. The Islamists are not
the only ones resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The army, which sees itself as Algeria's supreme authority, with
the official Council of Ministers merely running the
administration, does not form a homogeneous whole. It is made up of
the national police, the military security force and various other
structures that all retain some autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officers in charge are even more independent of
the authorities. So the government, of which the army and police
are supposed to be the secular branches, is short-circuited by a
system outside the official power structure.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the army's repressive measures against the Islamists
are uncoordinated and totally outside the law. Special military
units in hoods arrest people, who then disappear without their
families ever knowing which section of the army is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   This illegal state of affairs has arisen because soldiers are
trained to believe that they alone, as individuals, are responsible
for keeping civil peace. They need not account for their actions
before the courts or the people.
</P>
<P>
   The government, including the president, lacks the authority to
punish the men conducting the antiterrorist war. Overzealous
officers are accountable to no one, and no judge can autonomously
investigate attacks or murders.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has slipped out of hand. Reports by international
human-rights organizations make it clear that the army's war
against Islamist terrorism is being waged with no regard whatsoever
for the law.
</P>
<P>
   Military die-hards are constantly trying to ensure that there
will be no turning back to fundamentalism for Algeria. But their
response to the rise of the Islamic Salvation Front was murder,
torture and collective reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after the recent massacres were blamed on Armed
Islamic Group fundamentalists, the army's secret services took the
opportunity to embark on a strategy of terror aimed at bringing the
Islamic Salvation Front to its knees, after which the generals
could impose their own conditions on the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's agony has lasted for more than six years because the
army is the backbone of the regime. In times of crisis, the top
military brass meet in conclave. It was they who decided to cancel
the 1992 elections after the first round gave the lead to the
Islamic Salvation Front and to nominate instead Liamine Zeroual for
the presidency in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The generals' informal meetings are not reported in the press _
understandably, since the constitution does not provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria for taking part in these conclaves are unknown. The
participants are thought to include officers from the general staff
and the heads of the central services of the defense ministry, the
military districts, the national police and the domestic security
force _ in other words, men who have a certain autonomy in the way
they use the forces of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of the decisions it makes, this informal
assembly is, in fact, installing itself as a sovereign body.
Increasingly, Algeria is run by a military caste.
</P>
<P>
   Recent revelations by deserters that the security services were
implicated in some of the recent massacres and killings could impel
another turf battle between army factions. It is as if the army is
above civil law. In fact, in terms of prerogatives and authority,
the judiciary ranks below both the army and the civil service.
</P>
<P>
   The government's composition reflects the political line of the
army, whose various factions nominate their proteges as ministers.
Those appointed have two briefs: to stand up for the general
interests of the regime and to show their loyalty to the faction
that appointed them.
</P>
<P>
   The government is not directly responsible for security policy,
which comes under the army's purview, but it lends a semblance of
legality to all acts of repression.
</P>
<P>
   The rigging of Algeria's elections since 1991 has masked the
degree of actual public support for a number of non-Islamist
political parties. These secularists are divided over their
positions toward the Islamists, but the lack of free speech
prevents an accurate assessment of the depths of these rifts. They
are regarded as democrats, even if some of their representatives
try to justify the most extreme authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Algerian people as a whole, distrust of the secular
parties is heightened by their recruitment from an elite that is
not merely secularized but also French-speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the street does not understand how the democrats can
still call themselves democratic while supporting an army that
cancels the elections won by an opposition party, especially since
some democrats discredited themselves by remaining silent about
human-rights violations suffered by the Islamists. This attitude
raises both a political and a moral problem.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's ``democrats'' ought not confine themselves to
denouncing the Islamists; they must articulate an ideology based on
principles such as respect for human rights, a multiparty system,
freedom of the press, and free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria's current agony, a supposedly democratic party that
does not condemn human-rights violations against the Islamists has
abandoned one of the principal values of its supposed political
identity and thereby discredited itself.
</P>
<P>
   All the political movements _ secular and Islamists _ should
negotiate a minimum consensus to consolidate electoral legitimacy,
ensure freedom of expression and establish an independent
judiciary. For such a compromise to be credible, the army would
also have to guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   If the party that won the elections breached the new contract,
that would justify military intervention, provided the army had
meanwhile regained the trust of the people. The army would first
have to abandon its opposition to a multiparty system and its
belief that it alone is the true source of power.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, however, Algeria's crisis can be resolved
only by ending the dichotomy that lies at its roots: between an
informal real power and an impotent formal power. It is time to
identify the real powers that be. The army must stop interfering in
affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But that means that all the political parties, including the
Islamic Salvation Front, must first agree on a national contract
that sets out the rules of the game and enshrines a multiparty
system, civil liberties and electoral choice. What is at stake is
not just the honor of the officers but, above all, the political
future of Algeria.

which comes under the army's purview, but it lends a semblance of
legality to all acts of repression.
</P>
<P>
   The rigging of Algeria's elections since 1991 has masked the
degree of actual public support for a number of non-Islamist
political parties. These secularists are divided over their
positions toward the Islamists, but the lack of free speech
prevents an accurate assessment of the depths of these rifts. They
are regarded as democrats, even if some of their representatives
try to justify the most extreme authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Algerian people as a whole, distrust of the secular
parties is heightened by their recruitment from an elite that is
not merely secularized but also French-speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the street does not understand how the democrats can
still call themselves democratic while supporting an army that
cancels the elections won by an opposition party, especially since
some democrats discredited themselves by remaining silent about
human-rights violations suffered by the Islamists. This attitude
raises both a political and a moral problem.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's ``democrats'' ought not confine themselves to
denouncing the Islamists; they must articulate an ideology based on
principles such as respect for human rights, a multiparty system,
freedom of the press, and free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria's current agony, a supposedly democratic party that
does not condemn human-rights violations against the Islamists has
abandoned one of the principal values of its supposed political
identity and thereby discredited itself.
</P>
<P>
   All the political movements _ secular and Islamists _ should
negotiate a minimum consensus to consolidate electoral legitimacy,
ensure freedom of expression and establish an independent
judiciary. For such a compromise to be credible, the army would
also have to guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   If the party that won the elections breached the new contract,
that would justify military intervention, provided the army had
meanwhile regained the trust of the people. The army would first
have to abandon its opposition to a multiparty system and its
belief that it alone is the true source of power.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, however, Algeria's crisis can be resolved
only by ending the dichotomy that lies at its roots: between an
informal real power and an impotent formal power. It is time to
identify the real powers that be. The army must stop interfering in
affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But that means that all the political parties, including the
Islamic Salvation Front, must first agree on a national contract
that sets out the rules of the game and enshrines a multiparty
system, civil liberties and electoral choice. What is at stake is
not just the honor of the officers but, above all, the political
future of Algeria.

   Today a new economy is emerging, just as dramatically as
smokestacks sprang from the wheat fields of the agrarian age.
</P>
<P>
   Industrialism is about things, and the efficient production of
them. The revolution today is rooted in networked information _ how
to create it, move it and manage it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 of the companies that are building the new economy _
not just the usual high-tech suspects, but a variety of enterprises
that are using technology, networks and information to reshape the
world.

<P>
   AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.
</P>
<P>
   New York
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $27.9 billion
</P>
<P>
   The insurance business is classically information-driven _ just
think about an actuarial table. But it is also intensely local: To
accurately assess risks _ much less sell policies _ you need to be
there. All of which explains why globe-girdling AIG is a high flier
in a notoriously low-altitude sector.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Shanghai in 1919, AIG focuses on the simple idea that
in much of the world, insurance _ for people and businesses alike _
is primitive or nonexistent. With offices in 130 countries, more
than half its pretax income comes from non-U.S. sources, including
China, Russia, eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Last
year it even reached an agreement with the Chinese government to
reoccupy its old Shanghai headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE, INC.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $1.7 billion
</P>
<P>
   With 11 million subscribers _ plus another 2.5 million on
recently acquired CompuServe _ AOL is the Net's 800-pound gorilla,
and the world's largest (by far) ISP, or information services
provider.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's paying customers cough up $21.95 every month and, earlier
this year, took a 10 percent price-hike in stride. Marketing
companies are lining up to write checks as large as $100 million
for the privilege of offering the AOL masses everything from
videogames to discount phone service.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES SCHWAB CORP.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $2.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sparked a democratic
revolution on Wall Street when it eliminated fixed commissions for
brokers two decades ago. Now the Internet promises to finish the
job. Schwab _ and millions of happily liberated investors _ have
been cheering all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab leaped enthusiastically into discount trading while most
brokers tried to protect their inflated profit margins. It
diversified into mutual funds and introduced 24-hour telephone
touch-tone trading.
</P>
<P>
   And it invested heavily in automated trading _ paving the way to
the Internet, where Schwab now owns 47 percent of the electronic
brokerage business. It has also moved into lucrative overseas
markets _ notably stock-mad Asia _ where discount brokering is
still a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   DELL COMPUTER
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock, Texas
</P>
<P>
   '98 revenue: $12.3 billion
</P>
<P>
   If any executive understands the Zen of the information
revolution, it is Michael Dell. His company, the world's No. 3 PC
maker, does few things that are not a direct response to customer
demands. That gives it a big advantage in tracking the marriage
between fast-moving technology and fast-evolving customer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Dell builds no computer until someone has ordered it. The
company stocks only a two-week inventory. Customers are encouraged
to order directly through Dell's Web site, which chalks up $4
million per day in sales. Suppliers deliver on hourly schedules.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DATA CORP.
</P>
<P>
   Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Electronic money isn't the future _ it's here. Credit and debit
cards alone have already taken over an estimated 13 percent of the
U.S. economy. That, in turn, has created a booming, mostly
invisible market for handling noncash transactions _ an opportunity
First Data has quickly climbed into.
</P>
<P>
   First Data controls more than a third of the U.S. credit-card
processing business, including application processing and billing
for MasterCard and Visa. It does Wal-Mart's credit- and debit-card
processing, and works with retail banks on everything from check
verification to in-store ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a stealth power on the Internet, handling transactions
for some of the biggest online retailers, including Amazon.com and
Dell Computer. It's also expanding overseas, into Germany, Hong
Kong and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $9 billion
</P>
<P>
   E-mail, fax and videoconferencing keep people in touch, but
there are some messages you can deliver only by being there. Enter
Marriott International, a dematerialized company geared to the
rising demand for physical presence in an ever-more-networked
world.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott International operates hotels that span the cost
spectrum, from cheap and cheerful (Fairfield Inns and Suites) to
posh (Ritz-Carlton). But the key to its success is classic new
economics: It doesn't actually own most of the hotels it operates.
Investors with a taste for bricks and mortar do that; Marriott
concentrates on the lower-capital, higher-markup business of making
people comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And in some markets it goes further, franchising everything but
a hotel's essence: operating procedures, quality control and a
familiar name.
</P>
<P>
   The result is steady income flows, insulation from real estate's
booms and busts and a string of powerful brands _ not to mention
the irony that a company that depends on people needing to be
somewhere can disembody itself.
</P>
<P>
   MONSANTO CO.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $7.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Monsanto became a new-economy Cinderella: It spun out
its venerable chemicals business and plunged all-out into
biotechnology. ``Life sciences'' is the company buzzphrase. But the
customer is still farmers around the world _ especially big-time
agribusiness _ clamoring for everything from sharp-shooting
pesticides to designer seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto has already racked up one of smart farming's first hits
with Roundup Ready cotton and soybeans _ crops genetically altered
to resist the effects of Monsanto's widely used biodegradable
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The big leap now includes a bid _ which could top $2 billion _
for Illinois-based DeKalb Genetics, a high-flying seed company that
develops transgenic crops custom-designed to resist insects and
improve yields. Some of the biggest potential markets are in the
pest-ridden, fertilizer-poor developing world. As such, Monsanto
has major plans for both China and India.
</P>
<P>
   NOKIA CORP.
</P>
<P>
   Espoo, Finland
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $9.7 billion
</P>
<P>
   Wireless communications is both a boom and a boon. Digital
technology takes it a step further. Nokia sells more digital
mobile-communications devices than anybody in the world. More
intriguing, it also leads the way with mobile
phone/fax/e-mail/browsers, new hybrids that put information at your
fingertips, no matter where you are or what you're doing _ a new
economy niche if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is one of those rare organizations that has never been
afraid to reinvent itself. The companies that merged to create it
in 1922 made galoshes, tissues and cables. Today, one in four
employees works in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing opportunities, Nokia has consistently been
driven by its customers. Scandinavia has the highest mobile-phone
usage in the world _ something about long distances and longer
nights. Meanwhile, Finland vies with the United States for the
title of most-connected nation.
</P>
<P>
   SCHLUMBERGER
</P>
<P>
   New York
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $10.6 billion
</P>
<P>
   The essential problem of the oil business isn't drilling holes _
it's knowing where to drill. When big oil companies need to decide
where to set up their rigs, they pay Schlumberger to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in France 80 years ago, Schlumberger gets its talent by
scouring universities for serious geeks with a taste for adventure
travel. Airlifted into remote sites with a few high-powered
workstations and a satellite link to the supercomputers back at
headquarters, Schlumberger's frontline teams pull information from
deep underground, then run the data through software models to
predict where the oil is and how it will flow into the well.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's smarts are a crucial reason why proven oil
reserves are now 60 percent bigger than they were than in 1980,
when the world was convinced it was running out of oil.
</P>
<P>
   SMITHKLINE BEECHAM
</P>
<P>
   Brentford, England
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $12.8 billion
</P>
<P>
   Like all the big drug companies, SmithKline Beecham makes most
of its money from prescription drugs _ the popular antidepressant
Paxil, for one _ plus a menagerie of branded over-the-counter
remedies such as Tums, Contac and Aquafresh. Unlike the rest of the
industry in the early 1990s, it was quick to see _ and pounce on _
the implications of a heady new field of bioresearch: genomics.
That single move put SmithKline miles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its genomics-driven research-and-development program is
the envy of the industry. Since 1989, it has signed more than 150
biotech alliances, the most important a five-year-old partnership
with Rockville, Md.-based Human Genome Sciences, a pioneer in
genome research. Marketable products are still years away, but
SmithKline's $125 million investment in HGS has already produced
hundreds of patents on disease-related genes.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline is also clever about brand extension. Its labs do
more than 100 million diagnostic tests per year, including a
lamentable growth area: workplace drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   WAL-MART INC.
</P>
<P>
   Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   '98 revenue: $118 billion
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the downmarket image fool you: Wal-Mart has reinvented
retail logistics. Wal-Mart rose to prominence through a combination
of Sam Walton's dedication to quality, his eye for location and a
system of hub-and-spoke logistics _ stores linked to a central
warehouse _ that meshes local service with economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wal-Mart is taking the logic several steps further. For an
increasing number of products, its stores hold little or no
backroom inventory _ suppliers keep them stocked with just-in-time
deliveries. Wal-Mart's keen computers provide the information about
who's buying what, and why.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's Retail Link network not only records what goods are
purchased and when, but it also lets companies predict sales based
on past buying patterns, special offers and a host of other
factors. Result: Wal-Mart cut inventory by more than $1 billion
last year, even as it expanded sales 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, Wal-Mart is looking overseas: It opened 289
stores outside the United States in 1997, only some of which carry
fishing lures and gallon jars of mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALT DISNEY CO.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $22.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Once the definition of tired Americana, Disney, under chair and
CEO Michael Eisner, has been reborn as a global powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Its twin pillars are reassuringly safe, ``family'' values _ the
sort that play well from Prague to Peoria _ and up-to-the-minute
technological innovation. Part media giant, part marketing monster,
the Mouse continues to write the book on intellectual property _
how to create it, how to manage it and how to leverage it to the
hilt.
</P>
<P>
   Though its acquisition of a TV network, ABC, has yet to be fully
digested, Disney is one of the few companies working successfully
across different media. ``The Lion King'', for instance, has earned
more than $4.5 billion in worldwide movie, merchandise, video and
music sales.
</P>
<P>
   Disney keeps up technologically, partnering with bleeding-edge
animator Pixar (``Toy Story''), automating its global string of
theme parks and, through its DisneyQuest division, pioneering
virtual reality and so-called location-based entertainment (read:
high-end video arcades for grown-ups).
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has commissioned work by virtually every notable U.S.
architect and has some of biggest thinkers in technology tethered
to Imagineering, the corporate skunkworks. Now if only it could get
Disneyland Paris _ as EuroDisney has been redubbed _ into the
black.

   Wireless communications is both a boom and a boon. Digital
technology takes it a step further. Nokia sells more digital
mobile-communications devices than anybody in the world. More
intriguing, it also leads the way with mobile
phone/fax/e-mail/browsers, new hybrids that put information at your
fingertips, no matter where you are or what you're doing _ a new
economy niche if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is one of those rare organizations that has never been
afraid to reinvent itself. The companies that merged to create it
in 1922 made galoshes, tissues and cables. Today, one in four
employees works in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing opportunities, Nokia has consistently been
driven by its customers. Scandinavia has the highest mobile-phone
usage in the world _ something about long distances and longer
nights. Meanwhile, Finland vies with the United States for the
title of most-connected nation.

   The essential problem of the oil business isn't drilling holes _
it's knowing where to drill. When big oil companies need to decide
where to set up their rigs, they pay Schlumberger to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in France 80 years ago, Schlumberger gets its talent by
scouring universities for serious geeks with a taste for adventure
travel. Airlifted into remote sites with a few high-powered
workstations and a satellite link to the supercomputers back at
headquarters, Schlumberger's frontline teams pull information from
deep underground, then run the data through software models to
predict where the oil is and how it will flow into the well.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's smarts are a crucial reason why proven oil
reserves are now 60 percent bigger than they were than in 1980,
when the world was convinced it was running out of oil.

<P>
   '97 revenue: $12.8 billion
</P>
<P>
   Like all the big drug companies, SmithKline Beecham makes most
of its money from prescription drugs _ the popular antidepressant
Paxil, for one _ plus a menagerie of branded over-the-counter
remedies such as Tums, Contac and Aquafresh. Unlike the rest of the
industry in the early 1990s, it was quick to see _ and pounce on _
the implications of a heady new field of bioresearch: genomics.
That single move put SmithKline miles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its genomics-driven research-and-development program is
the envy of the industry. Since 1989, it has signed more than 150
biotech alliances, the most important a five-year-old partnership
with Rockville, Md.-based Human Genome Sciences, a pioneer in
genome research. Marketable products are still years away, but
SmithKline's $125 million investment in HGS has already produced
hundreds of patents on disease-related genes.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline is also clever about brand extension. Its labs do
more than 100 million diagnostic tests per year, including a
lamentable growth area: workplace drug testing.

   WAL-MART INC.

<P>
   '98 revenue: $118 billion
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the downmarket image fool you: Wal-Mart has reinvented
retail logistics. Wal-Mart rose to prominence through a combination
of Sam Walton's dedication to quality, his eye for location and a
system of hub-and-spoke logistics _ stores linked to a central
warehouse _ that meshes local service with economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wal-Mart is taking the logic several steps further. For an
increasing number of products, its stores hold little or no
backroom inventory _ suppliers keep them stocked with just-in-time
deliveries. Wal-Mart's keen computers provide the information about
who's buying what, and why.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's Retail Link network not only records what goods are
purchased and when, but it also lets companies predict sales based
on past buying patterns, special offers and a host of other
factors. Result: Wal-Mart cut inventory by more than $1 billion
last year, even as it expanded sales 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, Wal-Mart is looking overseas: It opened 289
stores outside the United States in 1997, only some of which carry
fishing lures and gallon jars of mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   THE WALT DISNEY CO.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   '97 revenue: $22.5 billion
</P>
<P>
   Once the definition of tired Americana, Disney, under chair and
CEO Michael Eisner, has been reborn as a global powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Its twin pillars are reassuringly safe, ``family'' values _ the
sort that play well from Prague to Peoria _ and up-to-the-minute
technological innovation. Part media giant, part marketing monster,
the Mouse continues to write the book on intellectual property _
how to create it, how to manage it and how to leverage it to the
hilt.
</P>
<P>
   Though its acquisition of a TV network, ABC, has yet to be fully
digested, Disney is one of the few companies working successfully
across different media. ``The Lion King'', for instance, has earned
more than $4.5 billion in worldwide movie, merchandise, video and
music sales.
</P>
<P>
   Disney keeps up technologically, partnering with bleeding-edge
animator Pixar (``Toy Story''), automating its global string of
theme parks and, through its DisneyQuest division, pioneering
virtual reality and so-called location-based entertainment (read:
high-end video arcades for grown-ups).
</P>
<P>
   Eisner has commissioned work by virtually every notable U.S.
architect and has some of biggest thinkers in technology tethered
to Imagineering, the corporate skunkworks. Now if only it could get
Disneyland Paris _ as EuroDisney has been redubbed _ into the
black.

SEAL A BRICK HOUSE? NOT NECESSARILY SO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A man suggested spraying my 65-year-old brick house with a
sealant, to make the bricks waterproof. The house was built by my
father, who was an Italian bricklayer. Is spraying it with a
sealant a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   MARION RAGANTINO, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not necessarily so. If the house is not leaking nor the
mortar deteriorating, there is no need to seal the bricks. They may
be absorbing a little water, but it will evaporate in dry weather.
If the mortar is crumbling or deteriorating in any way, it can be
chipped out and new mortar inserted. It is called repointing, and
will make the walls as good as new for another 50 years or so.
Besides, if any sealing is not done right, the sealer can trap
moisture in the bricks, making things worse. The right way to seal
is to use Chimney Saver water repellent, which seals the bricks
against outside water and weather but allows water vapor to escape
through it; in other words, if water does get in the bricks, it
will evaporate through the chimney saver. The water repellent is
not sold retail; it must be applied by a chimney sweep or other
professional.
</P>
<P>
   It is the handyman's feeling that since your house was built by
an Italian bricklayer, it will be good for many more years. The
handyman's father-in-law was a Sicilian brickie, and his house in
Connecticut is in excellent shape 42 years after he built it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for a source for old-fashioned milk paint. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   LOIS, from Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can try. I looked up milk paint in my trusty electronic
file that proved untrusty _ I found nothing. But I did find this in
another file; in fact, there is a whole folder full of information
from a previous story so old that I forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Two places that sell milk paint are the Old-Fashioned Milk Paint
Co. of Groton, Mass., telephone 448-6336, and the Trend-Lines
Catalog in Chelsea, Mass., phone 617-884-8882.
</P>
<P>
   And, in this treasure-trove of information that I found are
several recipes for making your own milk paint. This one is the
easiest, from John A. Johnson of Johnson Paint Co. in Boston: Mix
equal parts of powdered milk (sold in supermarkets) and dry
pigment, such as red oxide, sienna, umber, and other agents (sold
in paint stores); add twice as much water by volume. Add more water
if necessary. Other formulas are more complicated and involve more
ingredients, some of them hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A contractor told me not to install vinyl siding in July and
August but did not give a reason. Another contractor said it was
OK. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   FRANCIS CURLEY, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's the first time the handyman has heard any taboos on
installing vinyl in the heat of the summer, and as far as I know,
the fellow who says it is OK is right; it really does not matter.
After all, July and August are the heart of the vinyl installation
season, and it's a sure bet that those people would not shut down
in that prime time. Besides, vinyl siding is hung on the wall, not
nailed tightly, to allow for movement during expansion and
contraction, so it should not matter when it is installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am relocating my washer and dryer from the basement to the
first floor. The dryer is going in a closet (exhausting to the
outdoors), but the washer has to go into a bathroom with little
room to spare. Could I take out a vanity to make room for the
washer?
</P>
<P>
   SARAH MONTGOMERY, Wayland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You could, because I don't think there is a law that requires
a bathroom to have a sink. But it would be better, in my opinion,
to install a mini-sink in addition to the washer. It's a matter of
convenience. A plumber can find you a super-small sink.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution, depending on plumbing connections, your
budget, and the age of your present appliances, is to invest in a
piggy-back combo, with dryer over, washer under.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am doing everything to redo my rooms, but I am wondering
what to do first, second, third, and last. Is there a rule about
painting ceiling, woodwork, and walls, and sanding and refinishing
floors?
</P>
<P>
   SELMA SHERMAN, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You answered your own question as to the order of projects in
redoing a room. Paint the ceiling first, then the woodwork, then
the walls. Sand and finish floors last. This doesn't sound logical,
because sanding is such a dirty job. But thinking about it, doing
the floors last makes sense, because the sanding dust is clean, and
is easily vacuumed and wiped off floors and wall and ceilings, all
of which are equally clean. Besides, if you did the floors first,
you would be tramping around and spilling paint on a new floor,
unless you use tarps.
</P>
<P>
   There is always some question as to the order of painting walls
and woodwork, but the reason the handyman suggests woodwork first
is that it is easier to paint the narrow edges of the woodwork
before doing the walls. Try it; you'll see what I mean.
</P>

<P>
   The center of Berlin today is the largest construction site in
Europe, a high-tech endeavor pharaonic in scale. The new
foundations have been laid beneath groundwater level by scuba
divers, while giant machines assembled in front of the parliament
building are drilling an astonishing network of subterranean
transport tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Mile after mile of scaffolding lines the streets of the decayed
neighborhoods in the East, and courtyards echo with the shouts of
immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Developers, engineers and contract laborers have come here from
around the world to help build a new capital for Germany, and
perhaps for all Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The last great urban redevelopment plan for Berlin, scheduled
for completion in 1950, was sketched by Adolf Hitler. Hitler's
``Germania'' would have reoriented Berlin on a north-south axis,
defined by a grand boulevard running between a 700-foot dome and an
enormous memorial arch more than twice as high as the Arc de
Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   By 1938, a hundred people were at work in Albert Speer's
planning office, and tens of thousands of apartments had already
been vacated, a task made tragically more expedient by the fact
that many of the residents were Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Allied bombing raids had reduced much of
Berlin to rubble. For the rest of the century, the once-great
Prussian manufacturing center was suspended in a state of blank
stasis, held motionless by the tension of the conflict between East
and West.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Berlin was a city with a wall and grassy rubble in place
of its old core. It had edges, but no center. Though the western
sector boasted a few thriving commercial districts, the economy was
artificially pumped up by subsidies, and serious investment went
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, meanwhile, communist rebuilding projects were mired
in the lassitude of the planned economy, and grand boulevards
started crumbling almost as soon as they were completed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wall fell. Awakening nine years ago from its
half-century trance, Berlin has struggled to decide which direction
to look in.
</P>
<P>
   Would it model itself on the new cities of the world, with their
disregard for history and their willingness to remake themselves
according to exigencies of the global economy and the whims of
savvy developers? Or could Berlin pick up some thread of a local
identity, salvaged from its prewar past?
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an innocent question, since every gap in the
cityscape of Berlin today is an expression of both the city's
losses and its crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady days that followed reunification, Edzard Reuter,
then the CEO of Daimler-Benz (and the son of Berlin's most famous
mayor), announced that the city's location at the eastern edge of
the European Union would make it the Hong Kong of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz decided to locate the headquarters of its
service-oriented subsidiary, debis, in Potsdamer Platz, on a plot
directly atop the old route of the Wall. Sony also decided to move
its European headquarters to Berlin, purchasing a large site
nearby. Scores of other companies were expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As the building boom accelerated, Berlin's leaders imagined
their city as the center of the world's attention and the site of
the Olympiad 2000. The idea was already in the air. In 1987 _ the
same visit when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Wall _
Ronald Reagan speculated that Berlin would then be an ideal host
for the millennial games, the first held here since 1936, when
Hitler had personally presided.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Berlin was rising from the ashes of its punishment, the
German government envisioned the Olympics returning to a city whose
new prosperity embodied the promise of an undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, economists predicted a massive population
increase. The city economist Eberhard von Einem estimated that
60,000 people would arrive in Berlin every year. The German
government voted to move most of the federal administration from
Bonn to Berlin, which meant the direct transfer of tens of
thousands of government employees, plus attendant law firms,
associations, and political party offices.
</P>
<P>
   To get the attention of investors, the federal government
offered irresistible tax credits, sparking an orgy of speculative
upgrade. No comparable city-building scheme has been seen in Europe
in this century. By the mid-'90s, construction investments in
Berlin reached DM30 billion per year (U.S.$16 billion-plus).
</P>
<P>
   In Potsdamer Platz alone, Daimler-Benz, Sony and the other
developers agreed to put up 29 buildings with 111,000 square meters
of apartment space, 310,000 square meters of office space, and
57,000 square meters of retail shops and restaurants; plus two Imax
theaters, 27 cinemas, a concert stage, an underground train
station, and a grand shopping arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Potsdamer Platz was the most famous ruined site of the old city,
but it represented only a fraction of the new construction. There
would be tens of thousands of fancy apartments built in the central
city _ a planned neighborhood for sophisticated city dwellers. A
new government quarter in the Spreebogen area, with an enormous,
multilevel railway station. Three crosstown tunnels to carry cars,
subway trains, and long-distance trains. A high-rent office and
shopping district running the entire length of Friedrichstrasse,
with its famous border-crossing at Checkpoint Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The new Berlin is meant to be a ``Gateway to the East,'' a
beacon of German affluence at the edge of the First World.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Berlin seems to be liberating itself from
history. The Nazi monuments were erased by bombs five decades ago,
and the Wall has been gone for nine years _ leaving long, inviting
stretches of unfilled lots. Whole swaths of the city are being
razed for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is invisible, it is also unavoidable.
Redevelopment schemes in Berlin seek either to rewrite the city's
history or to escape it entirely, and their bizarre theatrical
quality stems from this battle with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's dream is to be the affluent, service-oriented capital
of Europe's richest country and a beacon of hope to its neighbors
in the East, where prosperity remains elusive. Yet the early
results, where visible, hint at spectacular failure. Empty stores
line the streets; a wave of investors has already washed out.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that the reconstruction of a 19th-century city
at the border of the 21st century is an exercise in fantasy and
national mythmaking. But Berlin's savviest entrepreneurs and
corporate executives well understand the commercial power of
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the government buildings, they are building a
multibillion-deutschmark theatrical event whose theme is ``great
city.'' Their goal isn't the literal re-creation of an industrial
city, but the creation of a new, convincing urban environment that
will attract a new audience of tourists and knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant philosophy of Berlin redevelopment is ``critical
reconstruction.'' Its adherents want to recapture the ``mythos'' of
the city at an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   These planners discourage the aggregation of multiple lots into
extended developments and require architects to follow strict rules
governing the height and shape of the buildings, favoring stone and
ceramic exteriors over steel and glass. Where possible, they want
to restore prewar street patterns and building lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking,'' says Volker Hassemer, a former senator who
now runs an influential city marketing group, ``what was the role
of the central city area in the 19th century? Then we must invent
the contemporary equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Wall had gone, there was a great opportunity not
just to unify but to reestablish the old historical center of the
city,'' recalls Berlin architect Hans Kollhoff, who has worked on
many of the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year interruption in center-city development preserved,
paradoxically, something of prewar Berlin. The rare possibility
thus exists to realize a vision of urban life distinctly at odds
with the chaotic and exploding forms of the American and Asian
cities of the second half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was severe damage'' to Berlin, Kollhoff says, ``but
people retained a certain image of their city, a very precise
image, and they want to regain something of that old world. Good
cities are made of quiet buildings that people like,'' he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrichstrasse, the showplace project of the new Berlin,
passes a few hundred meters east of the Brandenburg Gate. Like a
cat colonizing a new house by staking out a strip of defensible
territory close to an obvious exit, West German investors quickly
got involved in this nearby sector of the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up went dozens of new buildings, an invented promenade designed
to satisfy all the dreams of the liberated consumers in the eastern
sector. For block after block, the obedient ranks of offices and
storefronts press close to the street.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical reconstruction of Friedrichstrasse has created
the form of a 19th-century city _ without the people. The shopping
showplace sits like an island between the wealthy western part of
the city and the poor East. Meanwhile, West Berliners continue to
shop in their familiar spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the buildings are owned by the banks now,'' says
Michael Sontheimer, the Berlin bureau chief of Der Spiegel, whose
office on Friedrichstrasse overlooks the street. ``Very few of the
original investors are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., on a Monday, out Sontheimer's window are the dark
glass bands of Galeries Lafayette, across which hang ribbons of
bright electric text. Inside, the Planet Hollywood store is empty,
as is the jewelry shop. There are no customers at DKNY. At the
photo boutique a man is asking a clerk to make a photocopy for him,
but it is not clear whether this is a commercial transaction or
simply a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, not a single person can be seen in the elegant
modernist lobby of the Atrium Friedrichstrasse, a truly imposing
eight-story space lined with interior windows and overlooked by an
open, metalwork staircase at each corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the front, a double-columned business directory has plenty of
room for additions. The absence of tenants is strangely compelling.
The mostly blank rectangles in the directory look like dominos set
face down, waiting for a game to restart.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most obvious reasons that Friedrichstrasse remains
empty is that Berlin remains poor. Despite the early commitments
from Sony and Daimler-Benz, it hasn't proven strictly necessary to
establish an office in Berlin in order to do business in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly developing economies of the former communist
countries are forming their own direct ties to the power centers of
the West. The main airport hubs for heading east are Frankfurt and
Vienna, not Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is still scheduled to move by the turn of
the century, the German Institute for Economic Research has revised
its population prediction and now expects the Berlin population to
shrink slightly between now and 2015. Many of the government
employees are expected to settle in the suburbs. Unemployment in
the city hovers between 17 percent and 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the takeover of formerly East German industries by
private firms from the West has rendered much of the East Berlin
population unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the physical environment, finding beauty in central
Berlin today is not difficult, but it requires a postmodern taste.
In the jumble of dilapidated postwar apartments alternating with
gentrified neighbors, harsh East German government buildings, and
isolated 19th-century monuments, there is a provocative lack of
imposed logic, and a sense that only very local patterns of order
can be grasped.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of environment that young people and the very
ambitious enjoy, because it presents, in every direction, the
prospect of problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America,'' says Hanns Nerger, director of the Berlin
Tourism office, ``you would have a memorial Wall and a simulated
escape.'' But Berlin is too haunted to commercialize its history.
It will never host a simulated Wall or a Naziworld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Berlin's leaders would like the city to connect with a
more distant past _ Weimar in the '20s is frequently mentioned.
Others are confident that the Sony Center, however uncharacteristic
today, offers a more accurate picture of Berlin's future than
anything built by the planners and architects native to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are hundreds of thousands of Berliners who are the
people of the old city, of an old Berlin, a Berlin of work and
politics, who have been superseded by the new dispensation. The
millions who inhabit this old Berlin are not recognized in any new
vision of the city _ whether it be the European ideal of critical
reconstruction, or the global entertainment culture.
</P>
<P>
   Today Berlin's challenge, and its tangible intrigue, is that no
political language, no common resource of symbols and forms, has

   The center of Berlin today is the largest construction site in
Europe, a high-tech endeavor pharaonic in scale. The new
foundations have been laid beneath groundwater level by scuba
divers, while giant machines assembled in front of the parliament
building are drilling an astonishing network of subterranean
transport tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Mile after mile of scaffolding lines the streets of the decayed
neighborhoods in the East, and courtyards echo with the shouts of
immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Developers, engineers and contract laborers have come here from
around the world to help build a new capital for Germany, and
perhaps for all Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The last great urban redevelopment plan for Berlin, scheduled
for completion in 1950, was sketched by Adolf Hitler. Hitler's
``Germania'' would have reoriented Berlin on a north-south axis,
defined by a grand boulevard running between a 700-foot dome and an
enormous memorial arch more than twice as high as the Arc de
Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   By 1938, a hundred people were at work in Albert Speer's
planning office, and tens of thousands of apartments had already
been vacated, a task made tragically more expedient by the fact
that many of the residents were Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Allied bombing raids had reduced much of
Berlin to rubble. For the rest of the century, the once-great
Prussian manufacturing center was suspended in a state of blank
stasis, held motionless by the tension of the conflict between East
and West.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Berlin was a city with a wall and grassy rubble in place
of its old core. It had edges, but no center. Though the western
sector boasted a few thriving commercial districts, the economy was
artificially pumped up by subsidies, and serious investment went
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, meanwhile, communist rebuilding projects were mired
in the lassitude of the planned economy, and grand boulevards
started crumbling almost as soon as they were completed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wall fell. Awakening nine years ago from its
half-century trance, Berlin has struggled to decide which direction
to look in.
</P>
<P>
   Would it model itself on the new cities of the world, with their
disregard for history and their willingness to remake themselves
according to exigencies of the global economy and the whims of
savvy developers? Or could Berlin pick up some thread of a local
identity, salvaged from its prewar past?
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an innocent question, since every gap in the
cityscape of Berlin today is an expression of both the city's
losses and its crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the heady days that followed reunification, Edzard Reuter,
then the CEO of Daimler-Benz (and the son of Berlin's most famous
mayor), announced that the city's location at the eastern edge of
the European Union would make it the Hong Kong of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz decided to locate the headquarters of its
service-oriented subsidiary, debis, in Potsdamer Platz, on a plot
directly atop the old route of the Wall. Sony also decided to move
its European headquarters to Berlin, purchasing a large site
nearby. Scores of other companies were expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   As the building boom accelerated, Berlin's leaders imagined
their city as the center of the world's attention and the site of
the Olympiad 2000. The idea was already in the air. In 1987 _ the
same visit when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Wall _
Ronald Reagan speculated that Berlin would then be an ideal host
for the millennial games, the first held here since 1936, when
Hitler had personally presided.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Berlin was rising from the ashes of its punishment, the
German government envisioned the Olympics returning to a city whose
new prosperity embodied the promise of an undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, economists predicted a massive population
increase. The city economist Eberhard von Einem estimated that
60,000 people would arrive in Berlin every year. The German
government voted to move most of the federal administration from
Bonn to Berlin, which meant the direct transfer of tens of
thousands of government employees, plus attendant law firms,
associations, and political party offices.
</P>
<P>
   To get the attention of investors, the federal government
offered irresistible tax credits, sparking an orgy of speculative
upgrade. No comparable city-building scheme has been seen in Europe
in this century. By the mid-'90s, construction investments in
Berlin reached DM30 billion per year (U.S.$16 billion-plus).
</P>
<P>
   In Potsdamer Platz alone, Daimler-Benz, Sony and the other
developers agreed to put up 29 buildings with 111,000 square meters
of apartment space, 310,000 square meters of office space, and
57,000 square meters of retail shops and restaurants; plus two Imax
theaters, 27 cinemas, a concert stage, an underground train
station, and a grand shopping arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Potsdamer Platz was the most famous ruined site of the old city,
but it represented only a fraction of the new construction. There
would be tens of thousands of fancy apartments built in the central
city _ a planned neighborhood for sophisticated city dwellers. A
new government quarter in the Spreebogen area, with an enormous,
multilevel railway station. Three crosstown tunnels to carry cars,
subway trains, and long-distance trains. A high-rent office and
shopping district running the entire length of Friedrichstrasse,
with its famous border-crossing at Checkpoint Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The new Berlin is meant to be a ``Gateway to the East,'' a
beacon of German affluence at the edge of the First World.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Berlin seems to be liberating itself from
history. The Nazi monuments were erased by bombs five decades ago,
and the Wall has been gone for nine years _ leaving long, inviting
stretches of unfilled lots. Whole swaths of the city are being
razed for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is invisible, it is also unavoidable.
Redevelopment schemes in Berlin seek either to rewrite the city's
history or to escape it entirely, and their bizarre theatrical
quality stems from this battle with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's dream is to be the affluent, service-oriented capital
of Europe's richest country and a beacon of hope to its neighbors
in the East, where prosperity remains elusive. Yet the early
results, where visible, hint at spectacular failure. Empty stores
line the streets; a wave of investors has already washed out.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that the reconstruction of a 19th-century city
at the border of the 21st century is an exercise in fantasy and
national mythmaking. But Berlin's savviest entrepreneurs and
corporate executives well understand the commercial power of
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the government buildings, they are building a
multibillion-deutschmark theatrical event whose theme is ``great
city.'' Their goal isn't the literal re-creation of an industrial
city, but the creation of a new, convincing urban environment that
will attract a new audience of tourists and knowledge workers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant philosophy of Berlin redevelopment is ``critical
reconstruction.'' Its adherents want to recapture the ``mythos'' of
the city at an earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   These planners discourage the aggregation of multiple lots into
extended developments and require architects to follow strict rules
governing the height and shape of the buildings, favoring stone and
ceramic exteriors over steel and glass. Where possible, they want
to restore prewar street patterns and building lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking,'' says Volker Hassemer, a former senator who
now runs an influential city marketing group, ``what was the role
of the central city area in the 19th century? Then we must invent
the contemporary equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Wall had gone, there was a great opportunity not
just to unify but to reestablish the old historical center of the
city,'' recalls Berlin architect Hans Kollhoff, who has worked on
many of the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year interruption in center-city development preserved,
paradoxically, something of prewar Berlin. The rare possibility
thus exists to realize a vision of urban life distinctly at odds
with the chaotic and exploding forms of the American and Asian
cities of the second half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was severe damage'' to Berlin, Kollhoff says, ``but
people retained a certain image of their city, a very precise
image, and they want to regain something of that old world. Good
cities are made of quiet buildings that people like,'' he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrichstrasse, the showplace project of the new Berlin,
passes a few hundred meters east of the Brandenburg Gate. Like a
cat colonizing a new house by staking out a strip of defensible
territory close to an obvious exit, West German investors quickly
got involved in this nearby sector of the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Up went dozens of new buildings, an invented promenade designed
to satisfy all the dreams of the liberated consumers in the eastern
sector. For block after block, the obedient ranks of offices and
storefronts press close to the street.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical reconstruction of Friedrichstrasse has created
the form of a 19th-century city _ without the people. The shopping
showplace sits like an island between the wealthy western part of
the city and the poor East. Meanwhile, West Berliners continue to
shop in their familiar spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the buildings are owned by the banks now,'' says
Michael Sontheimer, the Berlin bureau chief of Der Spiegel, whose
office on Friedrichstrasse overlooks the street. ``Very few of the
original investors are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., on a Monday, out Sontheimer's window are the dark
glass bands of Galeries Lafayette, across which hang ribbons of
bright electric text. Inside, the Planet Hollywood store is empty,
as is the jewelry shop. There are no customers at DKNY. At the
photo boutique a man is asking a clerk to make a photocopy for him,
but it is not clear whether this is a commercial transaction or
simply a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, not a single person can be seen in the elegant
modernist lobby of the Atrium Friedrichstrasse, a truly imposing
eight-story space lined with interior windows and overlooked by an
open, metalwork staircase at each corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the front, a double-columned business directory has plenty of
room for additions. The absence of tenants is strangely compelling.
The mostly blank rectangles in the directory look like dominos set
face down, waiting for a game to restart.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most obvious reasons that Friedrichstrasse remains
empty is that Berlin remains poor. Despite the early commitments
from Sony and Daimler-Benz, it hasn't proven strictly necessary to
establish an office in Berlin in order to do business in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The slowly developing economies of the former communist
countries are forming their own direct ties to the power centers of
the West. The main airport hubs for heading east are Frankfurt and
Vienna, not Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   While the government is still scheduled to move by the turn of
the century, the German Institute for Economic Research has revised
its population prediction and now expects the Berlin population to
shrink slightly between now and 2015. Many of the government
employees are expected to settle in the suburbs. Unemployment in
the city hovers between 17 percent and 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the takeover of formerly East German industries by
private firms from the West has rendered much of the East Berlin
population unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the physical environment, finding beauty in central
Berlin today is not difficult, but it requires a postmodern taste.
In the jumble of dilapidated postwar apartments alternating with
gentrified neighbors, harsh East German government buildings, and
isolated 19th-century monuments, there is a provocative lack of
imposed logic, and a sense that only very local patterns of order
can be grasped.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of environment that young people and the very
ambitious enjoy, because it presents, in every direction, the
prospect of problems to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America,'' says Hanns Nerger, director of the Berlin
Tourism office, ``you would have a memorial Wall and a simulated
escape.'' But Berlin is too haunted to commercialize its history.
It will never host a simulated Wall or a Naziworld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Berlin's leaders would like the city to connect with a
more distant past _ Weimar in the '20s is frequently mentioned.
Others are confident that the Sony Center, however uncharacteristic
today, offers a more accurate picture of Berlin's future than
anything built by the planners and architects native to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are hundreds of thousands of Berliners who are the
people of the old city, of an old Berlin, a Berlin of work and
politics, who have been superseded by the new dispensation. The
millions who inhabit this old Berlin are not recognized in any new
vision of the city _ whether it be the European ideal of critical
reconstruction, or the global entertainment culture.
</P>
<P>
   Today Berlin's challenge, and its tangible intrigue, is that no
political language, no common resource of symbols and forms, has
yet emerged in the theatrical new space where city life is being
remade.

   A wild-child woman born in the land of northern lights and
volcanoes, Bjork Gudmundsdottir has made a career of playing pop
paradox _ no surprise for someone whose family has gone from mud
house to MTV in two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork released her first record _ an album of Icelandic folk
songs _ at the age of 11. Since then, her impish looks and outsize
voice have belied the growing maturity of her music. A classically
trained flautist and pianist, she put the primal scream in The
Sugarcubes' pop-punk a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone solo in 1992, she has collaborated with such sound
sculptors as Graham Massey, Tricky, Goldie, Mark Bell and Howie B
to imbue techno with a mysticism suited to her fire-and-ice
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997's austere Homogenic, Bjork creates a personal history
of her twisted Icelandic roots: ``Thought I could organize
freedom,'' she sings, ``how Scandinavian of me!''
</P>
<P>
   Here the queen of eclectronica talks about her love of
information, her fear of technology and her sound of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   COLIN BERRY: How wired are Icelanders?
</P>
<P>
   BJORK: Very. Iceland has always been mad for information. We
wrote the sagas _ what, a thousand years ago? _ documenting
Scandinavian history. We were quick to take to the idea of home
computers because they were all about making access to information
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best Internet companies in the world are in Iceland,
even though we have only 260,000 people. The capital, Reykjavlk,
where I'm living now, is very modern, but at the same time
surrounded by mountains and oceans. We're still connected to nature
_ my family still hunts for half our food, but using a mobile phone
and a laptop to coordinate with other hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are Scandinavians so quick to embrace new technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It speaks to something inside us. I've got a theory that
people who live in northern climates _ Canadians, Siberians,
Scandinavians, even the North Japanese _ have something in common.
We can talk forever. We love documentation. We can analyze and
analyze and analyze. We've developed sort of a delicious
schizophrenia _ chilly on the outside, but deeply passionate in our
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could be describing your own work. Anyone else making
your kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bands coming from Finland and Canada right now represent a
new generation of electronic musicians. They've grown up with
computers being part of their life, not the scary aliens some
grownups make them out to be. They are very precise, and possess a
strong sense of beauty. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, people on the
Rephlex label _ their passion is carefully hidden under layers and
layers of information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One reviewer claimed you ``treat machines like a woman's best
friend''; you've said guitars have no soul. Are you a technophile?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take technology personally. Machines are just tools, and in
that way a synthesizer or a sequencer is no colder than a guitar or
a flute. People tend to treat newly invented things as enemies, as
a threat to their security. But it's a question of how you use
them: A song will be warm if you put warmth in it. I have to say,
though, that they have become good friends of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The machines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invented so many noises you can't even count them.
We can make rhythms from the sound of an ant running down a twig.
I'm not obsessed with technology, not at all. I love working with
freedom, but I also love to work with limitations. Something like a
violin has only so many notes; it's only made of wood. The person
who can create soul with that has won out on restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make the same claim on your song ``Alarm Call'': ``The
less room you give me, the more space I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, a new noise can be as rich and unpredictable as 10
instruments in a symphony orchestra. So in the last 50 years,
electronic music has moved forward as new textures are introduced.
Contemporary classical composers writing for stringed instruments
are becoming more and more minimal, trying to find new feelings
rather than new scales or notes. We're dealing with the same
musical structures, but we have so many different textures now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this collision of electronic and acoustic instruments
confuse the music, or create a new kind of fusion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me put it this way: A harp will be a harp and a
synthesizer will be a synthesizer. Nothing will ever replace them.
But there will still always be something gorgeous about the
chemistry of a violin or a voice. We're going to reach some sort of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indeed, Homogenic seems on the one hand chilly and
restrained, yet at the same time simmering, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always been into extremes. I live by the ocean, with
massive mountains and swirling blizzards. But I also love my
telephone and fax machine. A part of me is very conservative _ I'm
walking the same streets and hanging out with the same friends I
had since childhood. But I'm also very curious. I jump off cliffs.
In school I hung out with boys with thick glasses who owned insect
collections. I've always been a bit of a trainspotter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see today's young musicians using technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just like punk rock was a few years ago, except
15-year-olds who want to start a band today buy a synthesizer and a
sequencer instead of a guitar and drums. Orchestras used to need 50
people in order to fill a whole room with sound. Then the rock band
could do it. Now, you just need one person. It's cheaper. It's
easier. You've got more control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Post's ``The Modern Things,'' you sing: ``All the modern
things have always existed, they've just been waiting to come out
and multiply and take over.'' Is this the end, or the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who make new music and express themselves get the most
personal freedom for their imagination. I'm obsessed with that _
even romantic about it. Music is like electricity: It's always been
there, now we're learning more and more how to understand it.

your kind of music?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bands coming from Finland and Canada right now represent a
new generation of electronic musicians. They've grown up with
computers being part of their life, not the scary aliens some
grownups make them out to be. They are very precise, and possess a
strong sense of beauty. Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, people on the
Rephlex label _ their passion is carefully hidden under layers and
layers of information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One reviewer claimed you ``treat machines like a woman's best
friend''; you've said guitars have no soul. Are you a technophile?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take technology personally. Machines are just tools, and in
that way a synthesizer or a sequencer is no colder than a guitar or
a flute. People tend to treat newly invented things as enemies, as
a threat to their security. But it's a question of how you use
them: A song will be warm if you put warmth in it. I have to say,
though, that they have become good friends of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The machines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invented so many noises you can't even count them.
We can make rhythms from the sound of an ant running down a twig.
I'm not obsessed with technology, not at all. I love working with
freedom, but I also love to work with limitations. Something like a
violin has only so many notes; it's only made of wood. The person
who can create soul with that has won out on restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make the same claim on your song ``Alarm Call'': ``The
less room you give me, the more space I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, a new noise can be as rich and unpredictable as 10
instruments in a symphony orchestra. So in the last 50 years,
electronic music has moved forward as new textures are introduced.
Contemporary classical composers writing for stringed instruments
are becoming more and more minimal, trying to find new feelings
rather than new scales or notes. We're dealing with the same
musical structures, but we have so many different textures now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this collision of electronic and acoustic instruments
confuse the music, or create a new kind of fusion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me put it this way: A harp will be a harp and a
synthesizer will be a synthesizer. Nothing will ever replace them.
But there will still always be something gorgeous about the
chemistry of a violin or a voice. We're going to reach some sort of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Indeed, Homogenic seems on the one hand chilly and
restrained, yet at the same time simmering, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   A: I have always been into extremes. I live by the ocean, with
massive mountains and swirling blizzards. But I also love my
telephone and fax machine. A part of me is very conservative _ I'm
walking the same streets and hanging out with the same friends I
had since childhood. But I'm also very curious. I jump off cliffs.
In school I hung out with boys with thick glasses who owned insect
collections. I've always been a bit of a trainspotter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see today's young musicians using technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's just like punk rock was a few years ago, except
15-year-olds who want to start a band today buy a synthesizer and a
sequencer instead of a guitar and drums. Orchestras used to need 50
people in order to fill a whole room with sound. Then the rock band
could do it. Now, you just need one person. It's cheaper. It's
easier. You've got more control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Post's ``The Modern Things,'' you sing: ``All the modern
things have always existed, they've just been waiting to come out
and multiply and take over.'' Is this the end, or the beginning?
</P>
<P>
   A: People who make new music and express themselves get the most
personal freedom for their imagination. I'm obsessed with that _
even romantic about it. Music is like electricity: It's always been
there, now we're learning more and more how to understand it.

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels. Both the communities left behind and the
towns and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

PRODUCERS RACING TO BUILD GENERATING FACILITIES IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Denis &UR;  &LR; Fraine worries that Bellingham, Mass. and some towns
near it could become the ``kilowatt capital'' of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham already has a large power plant and five more are
proposed for the immediate area. Fraine, a town administrator, is
eager for all the tax money new electric plants would bring to
Bellingham, but he's also leery about the environmental and
aesthetic headaches that come with big power facilities.
</P>
<P>
   For good or bad, prospectors are rushing into New England with
proposals to construct a new generation of electric facilities, all
natural gas-fired. The lure: newly opened power markets.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maine have
recently enacted electric deregulation laws that eliminate
utilities' monopoly over power generation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, independent power producers _ mostly from outside
New England _ have proposed building nearly 50 electric generating
plants producing upwards of 30,000 megawatts of power in the four
states. That's more than all the power currently available in all
of New England.
</P>
<P>
   The new natural gas facilities would be more efficient than
existing oil or gas plants and thus produce cheaper power. Also,
they would significantly reduce air pollution and require less
water to cool their turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, where deregulation is furthest along, has been
the biggest magnet. Eighteen plants have been proposed here,
including a 1,500-megawatt plant in Everett that would replace most
of the existing Mystic River plant, a major air polluter formerly
owned and operated by Boston Edison Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, which required utilities to divest
themselves of their generating facilities, Boston Edison sold
Mystic River to Sithe Energies Inc. of New York, which proposed the
new Everett facility.
</P>
<P>
   In Agawam, Charlton, and Dighton, three plants that would
produce over 800 megawatts are under construction. Two more
facilities are proposed for Bellingham and Blackstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before deregulation, when we first proposed building an
electric generating plant whose power we sell to anyone at
prevailing rates, people in Boston thought we were crazy,'' said
Kenneth Roberts, chief operating officer of Power Development
Corp., a Boston company that began construction in January on a
272-megawatt plant in Agawam. ``Now those same people call us
visionaries. It's a very fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   The power plant rush also is being fueled by two natural gas
pipelines that will come into Massachusetts from Canada next year.
Compared with other regions, New England has long been more
dependent on oil and less on natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a big opportunity in the region,'' said Thomas
O'Connor, of North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., which is
involved in building one of the pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But it's far from certain all the plant proposals will get off
the drawing boards. Tempering the optimism are a series of
environmental and state requirements for site permits plus
community reviews of the impact on local water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Money also will be a big question mark. Only a small number of
the new power developers will be able to raise the $100 million to
$700 million needed to build an electric plant. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Financiers who put up the money for the new plants will
remember the lessons of the 1980s here, particularly in the
overbuilding of real estate and other assets,'' said James Gordon,
president of Energy Management Inc. of Dartmouth, which is building
a 175-megawatt electric plant in Dighton.
</P>
<P>
   For communities that open their arms to the new power players,
rewards can be huge.
</P>
<P>
   In Bellingham and Blackstone, American National Power Co. of
Houston hopes to break ground by year-end on a pair of 550-megawatt
facilities. Both towns will gain $45.5 million in real estate tax
revenue over the next 20 years from American National Power. For
Bellingham, the company also agreed to spend $2.4 million to
improve the sewer system, $500,000 for a new Council of Aging
building, and $650,000 for a water conservation fund. It also
pledged to turn over 92 acres for town conservation use.
</P>
<P>
   In Blackstone, American National Power agreed to sell
electricity at a discount for five years, and to provide $600,000
for water conservation and $3.5 million for the sewers.

   But the new electric plant proposals also have drawn flak.
Bellingham's selectmen recently rejected a proposal for a
1,035-megawatt plant as too big. But the plant's developer has
offered to pick up the town's $8 million cost for a new high school
and pay approximately $4.5 million in taxes a year. ``If they
downsize their project ... we would reconsider it, said Fraine.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As early as 1985, President Reagan and I, at our first summit,
said that nuclear war can never be won, and must never be fought.
Even then we knew something very important about the
inadmissibility of nuclear war.
 &HT;    Today, it is just as true that if nuclear war, on any scale,
were ever to be unleashed, or were ever to become a reality, it
would threaten the very existence of life on earth.
 &HT;    It is particularly important to keep this in mind, in the wake
of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. All must condemn those
tests and the dangerous era which they rekindle.
 &HT;    What is not being discussed by the established nuclear powers
today is that the process of nuclear disarmament has been stalled
for several years now; it is just marking time. I believe we have
not been properly using the opportunities that were open since the
end of the Cold War, the possibility to move toward a really new
world order based on stability, democratic cooperation and
equality, rather than on the hegemony of one country.
 &HT;    Instead, the geopolitical games are continuing; we are seeing
those old geopolitical games in places such as Bosnia, and we know
the dangerous potential of such conflicts. During the years of the
Cold War, many of those wars in small places festered for decades
and became worse because the two superpowers and the two military
alliances were self-interestedly fueling the hostilities.
 &HT;    During the years of the arms race, the United States and the
Soviet Union spent $10 trillion each on weapons production. It is
true that the danger of nuclear war has significantly diminished,
but it has not disappeared for good. The so-called conventional
wars and regional wars are still claiming thousands of human lives
and tremendous resources, as well as ravaging nature, the unique
source of life on our planet.
 &HT;    After the Cold War, instead of defense conversion, we are still
seeing the continuation of defense production, of the arms trade
and weapons-export policies. After the breakup of the Soviet Union,
while Russia was immersed in its domestic problems, the United
States captured 70 percent of the world weapons-trade market, while
not doing much for defense conversion.
 &HT;    The result is that Russia now too has decided to step up the
production and transfer of the most sophisticated weapons, and is
pushing in the same direction and trying to capture that market.
 &HT;    Behind this is the underlying assumption of defense and security
planning in most countries: that all the time we should consider
the possibility of war. Thus we see the arms race, weapons
production and also the increasing sophistication of arms,
including very exotic weapons.
 &HT;    And at the same time we see poverty, backwardness and disease in
territories that account for almost two-thirds of the population of
the world. So as we face the 21st century, let us think about what
is happening. It is a trap to perpetuate those systems that existed
during the Cold War _ relaunching the arms race and planning on the
supposition of a resumption of war.
 &HT;    We must say very firmly to the United States and Russia that in
dragging their feet on further nuclear disarmament, they are
setting a bad example for others.
 &HT;    We should also once again raise the issue of missiles,
intermediate- and shorter-range missiles, because those are weapons
of a particularly regional nature. We should do more not just to
limit the nuclear-arms race but even further to move toward the
elimination and abolition of nuclear arms.
 &HT;    Certainly we should bear in mind, in cooperating with
less-developed countries in the area of commercial nuclear power,
that we should always be vigilant that this is not taken further,
and does not stimulate the production of nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    Finally, we should put an end to the myth that nuclear weapons
guarantee peace. Everyone, for example, should understand that
security on the Indian subcontinent has not improved because of
recent developments; it has deteriorated very sharply.
 &HT;    We should do all we can to help Pakistan and India understand
that they're not gaining anything. They're actually losing a lot by
embarking on the nuclear path. In the context of the conflict that
has been festering in that region, this is really an ominous
development. We should work very hard to ensure that India and
Pakistan sign without delay the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
 &HT;    The 20th century has seen more bloodshed and cruelty than the
whole rest of human history and left us a complex and challenging
heritage. The tradition of resolving national and international
problems by force, violence and arms is a political disease of our
epoch. We must do away with it _ which is the great and noble
imperative of our time.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The basic marketing summer school course at Boston
College was only a few sessions old last month when the e-mails
starting flowing to professor Nick Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   The student in the front row, the one with the beard sprinkled
with gray specks, looked familiar to many in the class of 46.
Nugent got a chuckle as he read one e-mail that cut right to the
point: ``Is it Bags or not?''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   As a basketball player at Boston College and in the NBA, John
Bagley was impossible to ignore for a variety of reasons, ranging
from height (small) to weight (large) to ability (plenty). He's no
less noticeable now, back at BC in search of his undergraduate
degree after a 16-year hiatus. Nugent, a longtime Celtics fan, and
many of the 3,484 students enrolled in BC's summer school
recognized him instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley left Boston College in 1982 after his junior year, 12
courses shy of a sociology degree. He'll complete three courses
this summer and hopes to have his degree by this time next year. He
is living in Hyde Park with his sister Patricia, a third-grade
teacher in the Boston school system, and his nephew Samir. He has
left his two children, their mother, and his life running a
printing business in Elgin, Ill., to come back and finish what he
began as a recruit out of Bridgeport, Conn., in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if I was going to go back to school, this is where I
wanted to go,'' he said. ``It's all right here. It's to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley is following in the footsteps of BC teammate Jay Murphy
and Bruin Steve Heinze, both of whom picked up their degrees in
May. ``I'm really jealous of Jay,'' Bagley said. ``He's at the end.
That's where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley, 38, deliberately reentered academia at a slow pace,
recognizing it would take him a while to get reacquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been out of the system for a while, and you could sense
that early on,'' Nugent said. ``He was a little shaky on the
midterm, but he ended up getting an A-minus. It was a pleasure to
have him in my class. He has a real good sense for the way business
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley said the adjustment has been eased by the lack of
distractions, be they business, family, or basketball. He is a
student with a capital S. While he does hang out at the gym to talk
to the coaches and players, he understands why he is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opportunity to come back and I can really put in the
time I'd like to put into it,'' Bagley said. ``Being back opens up
many worlds. I think of biology, chemistry, and math, areas I
excelled in coming into college. I've always had an interest in
that. When you come back, you realize the more information you get,
the better you can be of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was harder for him this time around, he said, ``Some
things are. But not everything. Having the enthusiasm is not hard.
When I find myself in the library researching stuff, there's a
newfound excitement, kind of a rejuvenation. I'm truly excited. The
only thing I find (hard) is that you only have so many classes, so
many hours, so it's pretty intense. You try to make everything fit,
and it gets a little challenging at times.''
</P>
<P>
   While at BC the first time around, Bagley said he was a
committed student who nonetheless realized after his sophomore year
that he was destined for the NBA. ``I knew things were going to
happen (in basketball) and I really began to push myself in that
area,'' he said. He was named the Big East Player of the Year in
1981 and led the Eagles in scoring in each of his three seasons. He
came out early and was taken 12th overall by Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 years, Bagley played 665 games for the
Cavaliers, Nets, Celtics, and Hawks. But he never made it back to
BC in the offseason to take a course or two. ``My book was filled
every summer with things to do for youth,'' he said, mentioning a
foundation in Bridgeport and the Bagley Bunch in New Jersey, which
helped kids in the inner city. He hasn't been in the league since a
cameo (13 minutes over three games) for Atlanta in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA encourages all its players to go back to school to get
their degrees. The league has a program, run by Northeastern's
Center for the Study of Sport in Society, which helps roster
players continue their schoolwork during the season. Last season,
according to center director Richard Lapchick, there were 101
roster players in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley's objective is still to coach, although he understands
that won't happen until, or possibly unless, he does get a degree.
Two years ago, Quinnipiac College in Connecticut announced it was
going Division 1. Bagley talked to the school's athletic director,
former BC track coach Jack McDonald, about taking over the
basketball program. Bagley said the message he got from McDonald
was that a degree was a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that,'' Bagley said. ``You're dealing with young
men, and institutions want to make sure you set an example, be a
role model.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald recalled advising Bagley to get his degree but added
that not having one wouldn't eliminate him as a candidate.
Quinnipiac eventually hired Joe DeSantis, who had been a Big East
assistant at St. John's and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, you're as much an educator as a coach, so
it's helpful to have a degree,'' McDonald said. ``But John also
didn't have any experience in Division 1, and I think that was more
the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   While preferring to coach at the collegiate level, Bagley
nevertheless made calls to former teammates Kevin McHale
(Minnesota) and Larry Bird (Indiana) to inquire about coaching
possibilities with the Timberwolves and Pacers. He called Golden
State general manager Garry St. Jean, who was with Bagley in New
Jersey. Nothing materialized.
</P>
<P>
   He also called Rick Pitino to inquire about the recently filled
assistant's opening with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could think of no other team that I would want to be
involved with. It would have been super,'' Bagley said of the
Celtics, with whom he spent four up-and-down seasons. ``I was
discouraged a little at first. I really felt like I was the type of
person a coach would love to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catapano, Bagley's longtime agent, said his client was one
of the smartest individuals he has ever represented and would be a
strong coaching candidate. ``As a player, he combined the physical
and the intellectual,'' Catapano said. ``Most guys have one or the
other.''

   Bagley's game plan is to help the BC basketball program this
season, absorbing what he can from the coaches while imparting what
he knows to the players. It sounds like the ideal trade-off, and
it's one he will gladly make before and after he hits the books.
</P>
<P>
   That still comes first.

PALESTINIAN TOURISM LANGUISHING IN SHADOW OF MIDEAST STALEMATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, July 26) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ The picture on the wall shows Tareh
Saliba, a gray-haired Palestinian businessman, cutting a cake in
celebration of the opening of his new hotel, The Nativity. At his
side, flanked by burly security men, is Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, in town to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in April 1996, the snapshot hangs near a large wooden
cross in an empty hotel conference room used by Christian pilgrims
as a prayer hall, a reminder of the high hopes Palestinians pinned
on increased tourism in the wake of peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the picture seems out of place with the air of solitude
outside the conference hall. It's not one of the peak tourist
seasons _ those are in March, for Easter, and November, for the
Feast of Tabernacles. Still, occupancy rates are far below
expectations &UR; .  &LR; Only 20 of Saliba's 90 rooms are filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Israel and the Palestinians signed the peace treaty, we
thought things would be OK in the future,'' said Saliba. He
converted his original plan to build a business center to the hotel
project in anticipation of an influx of tourism after the 1993 deal
was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that things would be good because peace was
coming,'' he said. ``But it hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional birthplace of Jesus and a 20-minute drive from
religious sites in Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, Bethlehem
should be overflowing with Christian pilgrims and curious tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not, indicating that perception of the region as
dangerous will be more difficult to overcome than entrepreneurs
like Saliba had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian militants
killed 59 Israelis. The tourism industry, riding the crest of a
two-year wave precipitated by peace, never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But with better facilities and a steady influx of Jewish
visitors, particularly from the United States and Europe, Israeli
tourism can limp along where nascent Palestinian tourism cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinian infrastructure for tourism is in a bad state,''
said Mohammed Shtayyeh, who heads the Palestinian Economic Council
for Development and Reconstruction, an extragovernmental body set
up in the wake of the peace agreement to oversee foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bethlehem is the Mecca of the Christian world, and yet there
are no five-star hotels there,'' said Shtayyeh, an economist.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians blame the state of their towns on Israeli neglect
during 30 years of military rule. Main streets in Bethlehem are
under construction or repair.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians also suffer from television images of rioting
and the vague perception among tourists that areas under their rule
are not safe.
</P>
<P>
   That perception is reinforced by Israeli car-rental companies
that refuse to insure cars driven in Palestinian areas. Until
recently, Israel posted signs at the entrances to Palestinian-ruled
towns warning tourists not to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are frightening the people away,'' said Saliba. ``They
tell tourists at the airport that there isn't security here. That's
not good, and it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 17 months of political stalemate have not improved those
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was moving
forward, 2.5 million tourists visited Israel, the highest number in
years. Many of them came to the traditionally Christian towns of
Bethlehem and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they say, `not this year, we can come to see Bethlehem and
Jerusalem when the situation improves,''' said Nabil Bandak, an
operator with Near East Tours, one of the Palestinians' largest
tourist companies, based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening politically is not comfortable to the ears of
the American or the European tourists,'' Bandak said. ``They hear
the Israelis threaten and the Palestinians threaten. It's not
comfortable for the pilgrims. And it's not good for tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of affairs mirrors an economic downturn, both in
Israel and in the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinian Authority was set up in 1994, 8,500 new
Palestinian companies have been set up, a phenomenal number in an
economy with less than 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But many of them are ``only on paper,`` said Shtayyeh. ``The
potential for investment is great,'' said Shtayyeh. ``But the real
investment is not yet there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason, he said, was due to Israel's prolonged
policy _ in place since 1993 _ requiring Palestinians to get
permits to travel in between the West Bank and Gaza. Similarly, the
total value of goods and services produced within the region
declined 24 percent between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, likewise, has suffered an economic downturn since 1996
that some economists partially attribute to the downturn in the
peace process. Unemployment in Israel hovers around 11 percent and
the economy is in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Saliba, like most Palestinians in tourism, says he hopes
celebrations planned for the year 2000 will pull the industry out
of the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Israel expects 4 million tourists to come that year, more than
double the usual annual number. Italy, Turkey and Jordan are also
heavily promoting their religious sites to attract tourists in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   High expectations for 2000, said Saliba, are enticing investors
to sink money into an industry that has limped along with a 20
percent occupancy rate for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people thinking to start building hotels,'' he
said. ``Some have already started. They are living on hope.``

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the afternoon, the flashy yellow BMW convertible had
been spirited away and replaced by a Mercedes-Benz sedan finished
in some exotically labeled hue that looks like gray to me. It
turned out to be Calypso Green in the Benz paint scheme, although
several people told me it was turquoise. I really wouldn't know.
</P>
<P>
   This weekly _ sometimes more often _ motor metamorphosis keeps
neighbors occupied in speculation. For some, curiosity got to be
too consuming; one came knocking at the door asking what I did that
caused the procession of new vehicles. One, being a Globe reader,
actually put two and two together and came up with auto writer.
But, while adults mostly speculate in silence, children are more
direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a dealer?'' The question came loudly, from a group of
youngsters in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered, and proceeded to tell them what I did. ``How
would one dealer have so many different makes?'' I asked my
interrogator. But he hadn't been asking was I a car dealer; he was
figuring drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The green Mercedes proved a very pleasant car, as do most Benz
cars. For the kind of money Benz requests to part with one of its
chariots, one has a right to expect a pleasant experience. This
four-door, five-passenger E-Class is elegantly appointed, quiet,
offers good performance _ although the tested model seemed to have
a bit of hesitation on initial acceleration _ something to pursue
as I roll up miles on it.
</P>
<P>
   I had rolled up a couple of hundred miles plus, approaching the
refuel moment, but the gauge indicated a half tank. Either fuel
economy is extraordinary or the tank is enormous. Or maybe the
gauge is malfunctioning? At 300 miles, the gauge was still
indicating plenty of fuel; it was time to sort this out. The
answer, had I looked, was clearly written on the back of the car,
but I found it in the paperwork in the glove box: This E-Class is
the E300 Turbodiesel. It has a modest-sized fuel tank, under 22
gallons, and an EPA economy rating of 26 miles per gallon city, 34
highway. The mystery of the extended range also answered the
question of why the hesitation; diesels are slow to wind up.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to recognize the car as a diesel immediately by
the usual diesel clues testify to the quantum leap in diesel
technology since the short-lived diesel craze of 20 years ago. The
diesel is instantly recognizable by the noise _ it usually sounds
like crushed stone in a clothes dryer _ and the aroma; diesels
stink. The E300 is quiet, odorless. And diesel fuel in these parts
is still cheaper than gasoline, a lot cheaper than mid and premium
grades of gas.
</P>
<P>
   I began listening for the telltale sound of a diesel;
occasionally you could hear what might be taken for engine knock in
a gas car _ but only occasionally and only when you slam the pedal
to the metal. The odor, however, was another matter. Nose close to
the tailpipe, I thought I smelled a trace of that familiar stink.
And maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The E300 Turbodiesel is an expensive car, $41,800 plus $595
delivery. That Calypso Green finish is an extra, the leather
upholstery added almost $1,700 to the bill, and the sunroof tacks
on $1,110. Total as-tested price: $45,895. That's an enormous
amount of money for a working stiff to contemplate shelling out for
basic transportation, but there's nothing basic about this car.
When you look at the technology aboard invested in safety, the
price doesn't seem quite so steep _ not to mention the technology
devoted to the sybaritic devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the front air bags, there are side air bags in
the doors. The passenger-side front bag is equipped with the Benz
``Baby Smart'' technology that senses when a child seat is there
and deactivates the bag while the seat is there. The front seat
belts are rigged with pre-tensioners and force limiters; the
tensioners make certain there's no slack on impact, and the force
limiters allow the belt to give some, to avoid injury from the belt
in high-speed impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The brakes are four-wheel antilocks with a new twist _ what Benz
calls the Emergency Brake Assist System. This has nothing to do
with the emergency brake but everything to do with braking
emergencies. For the short person who cannot extend to depress the
brake pedal fully, or for the frail who cannot exert a lot of brake
pressure, the car's microprocessor deduces emergency from the speed
of the braking stroke and the forces on the car, and automatically
signals for mamximum force. And there is the automatic slip control
that senses yaw, steering angles, driver steering input, and
instantly computes impending skid and corrects same _ usually
before the driver is aware he/she was actually in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And the E300 has a tilt/telescoping steering wheel for maximum
comfort, a Benz engineeering concession to Americans. It is not too
long ago that inquiries about the possibility of tilt wheels in
Benz cars brought a reprimand: ``The engineers have determined the
optimum position for the steering wheel and there is no need to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The E300 is equipped to the max, but not everything works the
way one might expect all the time. The dual climate control, for
instance, didn't do what I really wanted done _ cool on one side,
warm on the other. It took a lot of finagling to keep the cool off
the arm side, and the result was that the cool area wasn't all that
cool after all. This is an effort to accommodate what seems to be a
basic difference between men and women; men usually are more
comfortable in a cold car, while women seem to need warmth.
</P>
<P>
   The radio controls are obviously the result of a plan by a
thinking individual _ the buttons are large enough for most fingers
_ but the whole thing needs more thought. It's time to think
``knobs'' here for the basic functions. The driver's window switch
has an ``express up and down'' feature that worked flawlessly on
the up but was a bit random on the down _ I almost never got it to
do an ``express down.''
</P>
<P>
   The 174-horepower (243 ft/lb torque) was mated with a
five-speed, automatic transmission that offers alternative
clutchless manual operation, a decided benefit in mountainous
regions, even after you concede the downhill holding power of a
high-compression (22:1) diesel engine.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is superior _ crisp and precise. The ride is quiet
and forgiving _ but not soft. The car felt good on the dirt byways
and the concrete highways. Fuel mileage was extraordinary for a
five-passenger luxury car with such performance; for 1,300 miles
measured, the Benz delivered about 30.5 miles per gallon _ three
tanks isn't enough to get a precise handle on the mileage of foamy
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, this is an exuberant thumbs up for an automobile
of grace, manners, and muscle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ To see how much, and how quickly, the world
can change, one need look no further than a lecture hall close by
the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   The students here comfortably chat among themselves, listen
intently to their teachers, take notes, and invariably laugh
easily. It seems like any classroom at just about any university,
except that the participants share a history of hate, distrust, and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite remarkable, isn't it?'' said one of the 35
attendees, all of whom are senior officials of the major political
parties in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Great
Britain. Their weeklong series of seminars at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, which ends today, was their first
opportunity to interact as a group since May's historic referendums
supporting the Irish peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, telling aspect of their convergence clearly
was the lack of tension, and even the onset of camaraderie, among
the players who have long occupied opposite _ and hostile _ sides
of the Northern Ireland political ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, when the Kennedy School held its last
executive program for Irish and British leaders, the Democratic
Unionist Party flat-out didn't attend while members of the Ulster
Unionist Party wouldn't engage in conversation with their
counterparts from Sinn Fein, and a photo of all the attendees
proved impossible to arrange; the hardline DUP is represented this
year, and a group picture was taken Monday as a matter of course,
rather than as a result of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of collegiality and engagement and informality, from
my perspective...is significantly greater than it was two years
ago,'' said Marty Linsky, a Kennedy School lecturer who led the
Irish politicians Thursday in a morning-long discussion of
leadership. ``My sense...is that people are more willing to engage,
regardless of political affiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the anxieties and strains
surrounding one of the world's longest-running conflicts simply
evaporated in Cambridge this week. But, strikingly, those
sensitivities emanated far more clearly from Kennedy School
administrators than from any of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   For example, program officials established ground rules from the
start, to which the participants agreed, prohibiting them from
talking to the press.
</P>
<P>
   At The Globe's request, a reporter was permitted to sit in for
brief periods in a couple of classes this week. Though the rules
were that none of the participants could be quoted, their interplay
and discussion _ and even their positioning, with representatives
of historic adversaries sitting comfortably next to each other _
illustrated how far attitudes have progressed, notwithstanding the
continuing difficulties between Catholics and Protestants in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The stated reason for the high level of caution in Cambridge
itself revealed a concern about the fragility of the new, more
optimistic Irish reality: The intent was to keep the assembled
politicians from saying anything provocative that might start a
public tiff, thereby undercutting the positive atmosphere that the
Kennedy School was trying to foster.
</P>
<P>
   However, the participants and organizers are holding a press
conference at noon today, in the program's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants in this year's session, entitled ``The
New Political Architecture: A Workshop for Leaders from Northern
Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and Great Britain,'' were 13
members of the new New Northern Ireland Assembly and three members
of the Republic of Ireland's Parliament. The project was sponsored
jointly by the New York-based Foundation for a Civil Society and by
the Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Representing 16 political parties were such diverse and key
players as David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party; Gary
McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party; Monica McWilliams of the
Northern Ireland Women's Coalition; Edwin Poots of the Democratic
Unionist Party; Dennis Rogan of the Ulster Unionist Party; Dara
O'Hagan of Sinn Fein; and Nigel Warner of the Labor Party, a top
adviser to Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo
Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying they're all talking to each other, but they're
all behaving in a very civilized manner,'' said Paul Arthur, a
professor at Ulster University and an adviser to this week's
events. Added Pete Zimmerman, director of the executive program at
the Kennedy School and a project organizer, ``There is a new sense
of seriousness of purpose among the participants this year.
Whatever they think of the particulars, these are people who know
the train is now moving.''

FINALLY, SOMETHING GOOD FROM STEVEN SPIELBERG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I must begin this review by reiterating my stand on the work of
director Steven Spielberg. I think its cheap thrills and thudding
sentimentality have contributed to the general infantilization of
American movies. That stated, it is my pleasure to announce that
not only is ``Saving Private Ryan'' the best movie he ever made,
but it is a terrific movie by any standards. Spielberg is growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   The director says he has recently been traveling the country
giving interviews about the movie, not to promote it, but to warn
people of the graphic nature of its violence. I doubt the
ingenuousness of this notion, but he would have nothing to be
ashamed of if he admitted to simply wanting as many people as
possible to come see his wonderful new movie.
</P>
<P>
   The story is foolproof. Proving himself to be the great everyman
actor of his era yet again, Tom Hanks plays Capt. Miller, an
ordinary man thrown into the extraordinary circumstances of World
War II European battle. After surviving the carnage of the Omaha
Beach D-Day landing, he and a small group of soldiers are ordered
to embark on what seems a wild goose chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has discovered that a Mrs. Ryan of Iowa, mother of four
boys, has lost three of them to the war. On the assumption that one
is still alive, Miller and his troops are sent on foot through
battle-torn areas to find Pvt. James Ryan and send him home to his
grieving mother before he gets killed.
</P>
<P>
   As the soldiers in the unit note, the mission is both
humanitarian and galling at the same time. Poor Mrs. Ryan, they all
concede; yet why is saving Ryan worth risking the lives of a bunch
of other perfectly nice guys who also have mothers?
</P>
<P>
   World War II was one of the last times in recent history when
Americans felt proud of being one of the most militarily powerful
nations on Earth. It was a time when we could believe that our
firepower would actually be used to do good in the world. The
soldiers who fought knew they were eradicating evil. They could
persuade themselves that the brutality of war might actually be
justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   And the people back home were rooting for them to accomplish the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg does a wonderful job of capturing this idea of
nobility. Even though his soldiers are scared of being killed, you
understand that they have a profound sense that they are all
working toward something greater than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons this movie is so much better than
``Schindler's List'' is that Spielberg is no longer in pedagogic
mode here. He is not teaching tolerance, at least not overtly, nor
proving that a horrendous episode of history took place in the face
of doubters. All he is doing is telling _ with skill and heart _ a
story about several human beings interacting under the duress of
life-threatening times.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason ``Private Ryan'' succeeds is that unlike the
Schindler story, the ``Private Ryan'' conflicts are amazingly
simple. We know that Spielberg _ who did well making ``Duel,''
about a man being chased by an evil truck, and ``Jaws,'' about
several men being chased by an evil shark _ is good at Simple.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's talent has always been to tell a story well, but he
often did so by resorting to the overkill of technical
contrivances. He came up with amazingly real-looking dinosaurs, but
the movie's premise was so far-fetched, who could care?
</P>
<P>
   This time, the fantasy is abandoned, and Spielberg applies the
technical wizardry to a painfully harsh reality. The first 24
minutes of ``Saving Private Ryan'' are a brutal evocation of the
landing of American troops on Omaha Beach during the Normandy
invasion of 1944. ``Private Ryan'' makes ``The Longest Day'' look
like ``Beach Blanket Bingo.''
</P>
<P>
   For just one example of the cruelty of war (and of the great
cinematography by Janusz Kaminski), there is much drama and sorrow
in watching soldiers weighed down by their equipment sinking in the
surf as they fall out of the invading vessels. We see them struggle
to shed their weights and swim to the surface for air, but in many
cases German bullets streak through the water and kill them before
they can rise.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg clearly had in mind to emulate some of the best war
movies ever made _ ``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' ``Stalag
17,'' ``The Great Escape,'' ``Grand Illusion'' _ as he skillfully
assembled ``Private Ryan.'' Nothing beats a ragtag band of soldiers
thrown together. And to re-create those great collections of
humanity, he assembled an emotionally satisfying cast of young
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks brings a quiet brilliance to his sensitive portrayal of
Miller. Edward Burns (director of ``The Brothers McMullen'') is
fine as Reiben, a Brooklyn-bred soldier fed up with the war and
with authority, a character John Garfield might have played. And
Tom Sizemore is the William Bendix stand-in as Sarge, Miller's
right-hand man. There's Jackson, the religious sharpshooter played
by Barry Pepper, and Adam Goldberg as Mellish, the Jew only too
happy to see German prisoners-of-war marching to prison.
</P>
<P>
   To help us newcomers in the audience acclimate to the rigors of
war, Spielberg gives us a naive guide, Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies),
a translator who has never been under fire. He asks all the dopey
questions we un-uniformed people in the audience want to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon, best-screenplay-Oscar-winner for ``Good Will
Hunting,'' plays the title character. He doesn't have much to do,
but he does it well. Throughout the quest for Ryan, Miller and
company continually voice the weary and angry hope that Ryan will
turn out to be a fellow worth saving. It is Damon's tough job to
make us believe that this is so.
</P>
<P>
   Damon is saddled with giving one of the movie's more sentimental
speeches, but he is good enough to pull it off. He does writer
Robert Rodat proud. Less good, but forgivable, is Spielberg's
insistence on tacking onto this movie a completely unnecessary coda
reminiscent of the ``Schindler's List'' ending. Many viewers may
disagree with this view at least partly because Spielberg's ending
provides the crowd with one big, cleansing cry. Sometimes an
audience enjoys the catharsis of the great boohoo. I enjoyed my
cry, too, but that doesn't make it good.
</P>
<P>
   The movie would undoubtedly have been a better work of art had
it ended before Spielberg glued on all the curlicues.
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the many pleasures of this movie is Spielberg's giving up
on storyboard (drawings that look like cartoon panels and to some
degree dictate a cartoonishness to his films) to get down in the
trenches (literally) and shoot battle scenes with hand-held cameras
as if the cameramen were in battle with the soldiers. The effect is
riveting and frightening. You feel you are under siege with the
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   We bring the close-up horror of those opening minutes with us
though the rest of the film. The D-Day landing on Omaha Beach was a
slaughter, and from the first moments you have a profound
understanding of how capricious the fates were. That the character
Hanks plays survives the landing is a minor miracle. Every day
forward from that moment in the movie seems a bonus. And you may
feel that way about your own life, too.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Two fresh graves 50 miles apart tell
much of the story.
</P>
<P>
   They speak of hope springing from a well of sadness. But they
also remind that hope is fragile in this long troubled land.
</P>
<P>
   One grave holds the bodies of three young brothers who were
burned to death in their beds in a fire-bombing attack two weeks
ago. The other, filled only Tuesday, contains the remains of a
33-year-old father of four who was shot and left to bleed to death
Sunday by masked men who snatched him from his apartment as he
cradled his 2-week-old daugther in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect that both incidents were sectarian attacks, clear
signals that the violence that has claimed 3,200 lives in Northern
Ireland continues.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the attacks have stricken so many people here so
deeply that it is widely believed that they have stiffened resolve
for the peace process they were intended to undermine.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a place where such images have at times been too
familiar, people are having a hard time shrugging off the pictures
from these two funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said a gray-haired retiree who was mowing
his small patch of lawn in Twinbrook, a Catholic enclave near
Belfast. Fearing the consequences, he asked that his name not be
used. ``I can't get the picture of those little boys out of my
mind,'' he said. ``And the boy who was killed, too. It's put faces
on the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a moment, rubbing the back of his neck, closing
his eyes to replay a memory. ``On the TV, they really were three
good looking children, weren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, people here have been laboring to put the past to
rest after voters in both Northern Ireland, a province of the
United Kingdom, and the Irish Republic to the south voted
overwhelmingly to support a peace process. Despite general support
for the process, there remain pockets of dissenters, some obviously
capable of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped and prayed so fervently that such scenes had
passed us by forever,'' said the Rev. Patrick Walsh, the Bishop of
the diocese of Down and Connor, in a letter read at the funeral of
the man killed by masked men Sunday. ``But now, once again another
family circle is heartbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kearny was dragged from his eighth-floor apartment near
Belfast Sunday morning by a paramilitary gang suspected of having
ties to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), police said. As the
intruders held his girlfriend in the apartment, Kearny was shot in
both knees, with one bullet severing an artery. The attackers then
ripped the telephone from the wall and blocked the elevator,
apparently to delay emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Just one week earlier, Richard Quinn, 11, and his brothers Mark,
10, and Jason, 9, were burned to death after a firebomb was tossed
in the ground floor window of their two-story row house in
Ballymoney, northwest of Belfast. A 23-year-old salesman from the
same town is suspected by police. The man, who is in custody, has
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police and neighbors speculate that the boys were targeted
because their mother was a Catholic living with a Protestant in a
predominately Protestant housing project.
</P>
<P>
   So powerful were the images from the brothers' funeral that they
led to the resolution of a tense stand-off between the British
government and a prominent Protestant order that was developing
into a full-scale crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, thousands of members of the Orange Order, a
Protestant group, had camped in a field near Drumcree Church -- in
the Portadown district -- in preparations for a march down Gavaghy
Road through a Catholic neigborhood, a path the group has walked
since 1807. About 3,000 such parades are held each July to
celebrate the 300-year-old victory of the Protestants over the
Catholics in Northern Ireland, thus establishing British rule. The
leader of the Protestants was William of Orange, who defeated his
father-in-law King James II.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics, who are a minority here, regard the marches as the
equivalent of a Ku Klux Klan march through a black neighborhood in
America. Fearing a conflict, the British government deployed
hundreds of combat troops to prevent the march. This outraged the
Orangemen, who consider themselves loyal British subjects seeking
only to exercise their rights to parade on a public road.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the arrival of the security forces reassured
Catholics who have long claimed that police and soldiers often have
been harsh and sometimes brutal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deaths of the Quinn brothers, the Portadown conflict
had become a troubling stalemate with rising prospects of spinning
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   When they awoke Sunday morning to the news, Orange Order
chaplains expressed shame and called for an end to the stand-off at
Drumcree as a sign of respect for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths brought tears to the Rev. William Bingham, an Orange
Order chaplain, who had staunchly supported the marches. Taking his
pulpit just hours after the fire-bombing, Rev. Bingham urged fellow
Orangemen to withdraw with honor from Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last night's atrocious act, a 15-minute walk down the
Gavaghy Road by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory
because it would be in the shadow of three coffins, of little boys
who wouldn't even know what the Orange Order was about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, angered hardliners grabbed Bingham by his clerical
collar, accused him of being a traitor and threw him in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   While Orange Order leaders have refused to see any connection
between their actions and the boys' deaths, the boisterous crowd at
Drumcree began to disperse despite earlier vows to remain for as
long as it took to convince British authorities to allow the march.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the grassy field was populated only by green
plastic trashbags and a scattering of men gathering the litter left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Three men leaned against a fence below the church that perches
on a hill overlooking the field. They gazed out over the green
expanse and chatted quietly. When a visitor asked where the
Orangemen had gone, one of the men replied with a hint of irony,
``They're here, there. They're everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Catholic neighborhood, police and soldiers remain to
deter any further violence. Heavily armed paratroopers patrol the
streets, croutching among curious children and undistracted mothers
pushing strollers. Armored vehicles guard the main roads in and
out.
</P>
<P>
   One armored car was parked by a community center with the words
``Ireland Unfree Shall Never be at Peace'' spray-painted in
unsteady block letters across the brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional add. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   The violence seems to have eased tensions, perhaps because both
sides are joined in their horror. Additionally, the general climate
of hope and reconciliation seemed to magnify the brutality of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sobered everyone up a wee bit,'' said Christopher McCrocken
of Holywood, a Belfast suburb. ``The Orangemen see themselves as
respectable and law-abiding people who want none of this. I think
the killings of the three boys killed the Portadown stand-off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is quiet optimisim as the parade season begins to fade and
attention shifts to a planned September visit by President Bill
Clinton, who with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, is regarded as
an essential and energetic supporter of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In Ballymoney, a prim and bustling town, the healing has begun
slowly. The house where the Quinn boys lived and died will be torn
down and replaced by a playground dedicated to the boys, said Ann
Smyth, the chairwoman of the neighborhood association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be no more fitting memorial to the children than a
park,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an ancient hillside churchyard in the tiny town of Rasharkin
a few miles to the south, the three boys rest under a thick
colorful blanket of fading flowers. Their nicknames are written in
baby blue flowers: Tavish, Ace and Markey. On Friday, two women and
a toddler girl attended the grave silently in the sunshine, bending
occasionally to read the dozens of messages left for the Quinn
boys.
</P>
<P>
   They smiled gently when approached by a stranger but would say
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for words is over,'' Bishop Walsh told the crowd at
the boys' funeral last week. ``It is now time for silence -- not
just the silence of the absence of strident words of hatred -- but
the silence, the deeper inner silence in which the soul can hear
and listen to the word of God.''

   NIRELAND _ BELFAST, Ireland _ It took the tragic deaths of three
boys to ease the worst tensions in this war-torn nation in years.
Tensions that were expected to wither following a decisive vote for
one Ireland this spring. President Clinton has added a stop-over
here on his return trip from Russia in September to add his voice
to those pleading for unity and calm. But some significant
questions need to be answered, not the least of which is: Has the
peace process, having weathered this latest crisis, regained

   JERICHO-CASINO _ JERICHO, West Bank _ This is the oldest and
lowest city in the world. But, is it lucky? In the dusty expanse of
desert across the street from one of the oldest Palestinian refugee
camps, hundreds of workers are building a casino hotel aimed
largely at tempting Israelis to come gamble _ something they cannot
do next door in Israel. It's a business venture that is sure to
cause political waves among both Palestinians and Israelis even as
it could turn a big profit. The casino project is headed by an
Austrian firm with the consent of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority. But, it is widely disliked by the Palestinians who live
in the refugee camp and famous biblical town nearby. The problem is
not that Palestinians will not be allowed to gamble there. Rather,
they see gambling and the western culture it represents as a threat
to their Islamic values. Some even object to the high profile the
10-story hotel will cut amid the peaceful town of 15,000. Many of
their arguments would be recognizable to Americans who have heard
the religious opposition to casino gambling in their own country.

SEISMIC WAVE IN PACIFIC PROMPTS CONCERN ON U.S. WEST COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The catastrophic seismic waves that hit Papua
New Guinea last week could be repeated anywhere along the West
Coast of the United States, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1964, a seismic wave hit the coast of California,
killing 11 people in Crescent City.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for such a disaster, state and federal officials and
scientists in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington are
establishing a deep-ocean array of seismographs that can provide
warnings of seismic waves to the West Coast, perhaps up to hours in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they are trying to identify West Coast harbors,
coastal towns and bays most vulnerable to seismic waves, and are
trying to increase awareness of the risk to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Three seismic waves, or tsunamis, hit Papua New Guinea on July
17, killing at least 1,300 and perhaps as many as 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Spawned by undersea earthquakes, the wave ``might be a wake-up
call for people living near the ocean in earthquake-prone areas,''
said oceanographer and seismic wave expert Eddie Bernard of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying this as an alarmist, I'm saying it as a point
of fact: This is a hazard you need to be concerned about, just as
you need to be concerned about other hazards in your everyday
life,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, scientists from the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration expect to finish installing six
tsunami-detecting buoys in deep Pacific waters, said Bernard, who
chairs the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program run by NOAA.
</P>
<P>
   Two buoys are being tested just off quake-prone Alaska. They are
attached to seismometers on the ocean floor that sense major
quakes.
</P>
<P>
   A wire transmits the quake signal to the buoy on the surface of
the water. From an antenna on the buoy, the signal goes by
satellite to the nation's tsunami-warning centers near Palmer,
Ala., and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the wave-awareness program stems from 1992, when a
7.1-magnitude quake in the Cape Mendocino-Petrolia area caused a
relatively harmless seismic wave, perhaps up to 3 feet high, on the
north coast of California.
</P>
<P>
   But to the shock of scientists, the wave persisted up to eight
hours as it bounced up and down the coast, ``like coffee sloshing
in a coffee cup,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous hint that researchers might have
underestimated a future super-wave's duration and potential punch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, professor Kenji Satake of the University of Michigan
ran a computer simulation indicating that a magnitude-9 quake off
the California-Oregon coast could send a 6-foot wave crashing into
Fort Point by the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Firpo, emergency services coordinator at the
California Office of Emergency Services in Oakland, said the
state's wave-preparation effort is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the proximity of California populations to coastal
areas, it's not unreasonable to prepare to respond to a coastal
disaster such as this,'' Firpo said.
</P>
<P>
   Costas E. Synolakis, a University of Southern California
professor has suggested that offshore thrust faults, which move
vertically rather than horizontally, could trigger a particularly
severe wave. In a worst-case scenario, he and a colleague said, a
bizarre type of tsunami called a dipole wave _ generated just off
the Southern California coast _ might cause even worse damage than
long-distance waves.
</P>
<P>
   The San Andreas Fault runs out to sea just south of San
Francisco. It is a kind of fault, known as strike-slip, that is
less likely to cause a seismic wave, because it moves horizontally
rather than vertically. However, major vertical faults exist off
Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.

A NEWSPAPER FOR THE CARTOON FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dean Wallace had his dream, it had cartoons running through
it.
</P>
<P>
   It still does. Last week the Somerville, Mass. entrepreneur
pumped out the 200th issue of ``Editorial Humor,'' a scrappy,
mostly-cartoons-with-a-few-columns biweekly tabloid which, if it
doesn't give you a laugh on every page, will give Wallace gas
pains.
</P>
<P>
   To call him a cartoon nut is to understate the situation. His
fascination with drawings-in-a-box began 1951, Wallace says with
the specificity of a truly maniacal cartoon fan. At age eight, he
came across a Herblock cartoon in the newspaper, showing Gen.
Douglas MacArthur riding through cheering crowds.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur had just been sacked by President Truman for
insubordination over the conduct of the Korean war. Herblock
labelled one MacArthur ``World War II Hero,'' the other
``Politician,'' and the caption ran: ``Hurrah for the one on this
side,'' signifying the cartoonist's cheer for the hero, not the
politician.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was hooked, but he could never draw even a stick figure.
Through Trinity College in Hartford, and a masters at Northwestern
in history, to a University of Connecticut PhD, Wallace's cartoon
fetish remained in check.
</P>
<P>
   A stint as a chanteyman and performer at Mystic Seaport in
Connecticut moulted into a 12-year career as president of a
wholesale dealer in non-mainstream music. He hit the ``burnout''
wall in 1985, sold the business, and ``tried to write the Great
American Novel.'' So, Dean, how was that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Harder than it looks,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, he and a newspaper editor friend schemed to
start up their own little newspaper, which can be as daunting a
task as starting up your own little automobile factory. Soup to
nuts, it's a lot of work to make it go.
</P>
<P>
   At the 11th hour, his first partner got a promotion and dropped
out, and Wallace turned to an artist friend, Phil Uzanas. ``Without
Phil's help I never could have gotten the paper off the ground,''
he says. They opened under the business title ``HOP Publications.''
``Hop'' is either his mother (Hopkins) nickname, or stands for
``handshake over pizza;'' Wallace tells both versions.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to start a paper that saw the world through the
skewed or screwy or seer-like eyes of the most talented cartoonists
the pair could muster. He quickly scrapped plans to call his paper
``Strip Tease'' because of the invidious implications; there's
nothing blue or salacious in his selections. Teachers at a number
of high schools use the paper to get across sophisticated notions
of satire and political manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   The initial name was ``Out.rage.us,'' but that gave way to
calling it the Boston Comic News, till an associate, Stavros
Cosmopulos, persuaded him to rename it ``Editorial Humor,'' so
``advertisers would not think we are aimed at the 10-year olds who
read comic books.''
</P>
<P>
   Since one person's cartoon meat is another's cartoon poison,
Wallace has fielded hundreds of opinionated letters through the
years, such as one in '94:
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're a paper for `intelligent adults' or you're not.
You take away Feiffer and add Dilbert? Give me a break!'' Every
editor who's ever had to yank one cartoon strip to add another
opens that kind of mail with a sinking heart. Taste in cartoons is
like taste in food or fashion, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace gets to propound his own whimsical or wacky take on
current events in his own regular column. He invites readers to
submit their cartoons (no original copies, please), runs a cartoon
contest judged by local luminaries Szep, Wasserman, Danziger and
Holbert, as well as further-away 'toonists cqsuch as Tom Toles of
Buffalo, Jim Borgman of Cincinnati and Kevin Kalligan (KAL) of
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Sports Daily folded, Wallace bought 200 of
their newspaper vending machines, and his boxes are ubiquitous
around Greater Boston. He's heavy on Harvard and Davis Squares,
along the Cambridge-Somerville hipness axis.
</P>
<P>
   His advertisers range from local restaurants, pubs, clubs to
boutiques, the Allston Amvets Thrift Store, youth and young-adult
marketers, and a recent issue's back page pictured a full color
pint of creamy Guinness stout.
</P>
<P>
   Cover price is 50 cents, but some are distributed free. The fare
is mostly national and international. If the young are supposed to
be getting their news largely from television, then a good portion
of the more educated slice of the population gets their chuckles
from sophisticated cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace says reader surveys show 45 percent of his audience is
between 25 and 34, a third of them have graduate degrees, and 61
percent attended college. Out of every ten readers, he says, six
are professionals, one self-employed, another's a techie, and
(almost) two are students. ``Teachers use us in all sorts of
settings, for current events and arts to English as a second
language or helping GED students overcome their fears of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   What may seem like a zany cartoonist's fevered imagination can
turn out to be the next day's news with fearsome rapidity. Wallace
points to the many global developments since he started in 1989
where many established patterns in geopolitics ``were turned upside
down'' in ways that may have surprised cartoonists less than
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War, the Soviet breakup, Mandela going from
prison to the presidency of South Africa, the Pope in Cuba, these
developments were wilder than any cartoonist would have predicted.
But the cartoonists often cut a lot closer to the bone of reality
than, say, the columnists or editorial writers.

   ARTISTS-MIDDLE-CLASS (Undated) _ Artistic disgust with the
bourgeoisie has been a defining theme of modern Western culture.
Since Moliere lambasted the ignorant, nouveau riche bourgeois
gentleman, the bourgeoisie has been considered too clumsy to know
true art and love (Goethe), a Philistine with aggressively unsubtle
taste (Robert Schumann) and the creator of a machine-obsessed
culture doomed to be overthrown by the proletariat (Marx and
Engels). Flaubert was perhaps the most ruthless in his disgust,
calling himself a ``bourgeoisophobe.'' Generations of avant-gardes
have single-mindedly sought to shock the bourgeoisie and overturn
its retrograde tastes. In doing so, they have drawn the battle
lines for a century's esthetic battles. By Edward Rothstein.

EPA STUDY CITES RISE IN PCB LEVELS IN HUDSON RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ PCB levels in the Hudson River are rising at a
``startling'' rate, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says,
contradicting claims from the General Electric Co. that clean silt
deposits are burying the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA findings, which agency officials said could quicken a
decision to dredge the Hudson River, are based on analysis of 170
sediment samples taken from the river between Fort Edward and
Waterford in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also voiced renewed concern that residents
down river who eat Hudson River fish may be ingesting far more PCBs
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that these PCBs are so rapidly re-entering the river
system is startling,'' said Jeanne Fox, EPA's New York regional
administrator, said in a written statement. ``Given what we know
about the health risks of eating contaminated fish, this
information is even more disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the sediment samples, EPA scientists discovered that
30 percent of the PCBs that were found in Hudson sediment in 1984
have since escaped into the water instead of breaking down or being
buried, the EPA said Thursday. Moreover, most of the PCBs in the
two-foot-long sample cores were located in the top nine inches, not
in the deeper, older strata of the river bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The new information could prompt the agency to accelerate its
decision whether to dredge sediment from areas of high PCB
concentration, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ignore what we have learned at this point,'' said
Doug Tomchuk, who heads EPA's Hudson River analytical team. ``This
gets us closer to the idea that an action might be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, an industrial chemical used
for decades as insulation in electric transformers, have been found
to cause cancer in animals. The federal government considers them a
probable human carcinogen. GE legally discharged more than a
half-million pounds of the chemical from two plants in Hudson Falls
and Fort Edward.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's findings were part of a complex eight-year
reassessment by the EPA to determine whether to dredge the Hudson
to remove PCBs, which were banned by federal government in 1976.
GE, which is liable for the cost of dredging should the EPA order
it, has bitterly contested the agency's findings and its
data-gathering methods.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in a two-page statement, GE accused the agency of
``moving toward a pre-ordained, politically motivated dredging
solution.'' The company has repeatedly noted that PCB levels in
many types of fish and sediment in the Hudson have dropped over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA announced its findings at news conference, closed to GE
officials. Tomchuk emphasized that EPA officials have not reached a
decision on the question of dredging. But he said the primary
source of the Hudson's PCBs is a large patch of sediment south of
GE's now-closed plant site in Fort Edward, known as the Thompson
Island Pool.
</P>
<P>
   That pool is the best known of the 40 ``hot spots,'' or areas of
high PCB concentration, in the river between Fort Edward and the
southern tip of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that the EPA would decide sometime this fall if it will
move much more swiftly than anticipated to stem the flow of PCBs
from sediment to water.

FOR BANKER, JAMMIN SCIENCE FEST IS A SOUND INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There's a technical question for executives: What do
astronomy and space exploration have to do with banking and
business?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, says Seafirst Bank Chairman John Rindlaub. Rindlaub is
one of the driving forces behind the ``Jammin Science Fest'' held
this week in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A science enthusiast from way back, he has an ulterior motive
for getting kids excited about science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching kids about science helps them in ways that also benefit
employers, he said. ``It encourages kids to develop
critical-thinking skills and the ability to use new information in
problem-solving _ which are important skills they can bring to the
workplace as future employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're not working in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at jobs today, more and more jobs _ and the
better-paying ones _ will touch on science literacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even customer service jobs in non-technical industries assume a
certain level of technical proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real challenge we all have is in hiring, training and
retaining good people,'' he said. ``In an area with one of the
lowest unemployment rates in the country, that's increasingly a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   That awareness led to the development of the science festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old science program for kids is designed to give
students a hands-on chance to learn about science in an
entertaining fashion. Since 1995, it has reached more than 14,000
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Each year has a different theme. This year, kids delved into
space exploration through exhibits on constellations, the solar
system, star colors and a real meteorite.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching kids science by having them participate is what builds
their excitement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to instill some curiosity at an early age, and do
it not through show-and-tell but in an interactive way.''
</P>
<P>
   His hope is that it will lead to more and better science
learning as they go through school.
</P>
<P>
   American students have been lagging in science scores in recent
years. Earlier this year, for example, U.S. high school seniors had
among the lowest scores of 21 nations in the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study.
</P>
<P>
   And a 1996 study reported by the National Assessment Governing
Board showed that four out of 10 seniors were deficient in science
knowledge and skills. Lower-grade students fared somewhat better,
but only 3 percent of kids in all the grades were capable of
advanced work.
</P>
<P>
   Why does that matter, unless you're planning to be a scientist?
</P>
<P>
   The value of a grounding in the sciences goes deeper than
technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skill set needed in business gets back to scientific
literacy,'' Rindlaub said. Doing good science depends on the
``three C's _ curiosity, creativity and critical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to a fourth C critical to business _ the ability
to compete. All businesses rely on employees who can solve problems
and think beyond the obvious, which is what science is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is even more critical with advances in information

   What's more, real competitive advances in business will come
from an interdisciplinary approach similar to the one taking place
in various scientific fields. The combination of computer sciences
and genetics, for example, is leading to a revolution in
understanding how genes work in the body, and has generated a new
model for treating disease.

HAPA'S HYBRID BLENDS ISLAND FOLKLORE WITH MAINLAND POP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hapa means ``half-half'' or ``ethnically mixed'' in Hawaiian
slang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affectionate local term,'' guitarist Barry Flanagan of
the music duo Hapa said by phone from Waikiki. ``There's a great
mixture of ethnicity here. It means `half-half,' and that can mean
half Hawaiian and half Caucasian or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who co-founded the duo with Keli'i Kaneali'i in 1984,
grew up in a mostly Italian neighborhood in New Jersey. Kaneali'i
grew up in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   They met at a Christmas party on Maui in 1983. An impromptu
performance convinced them to form a duo combining their diverse
but complementary styles, creating a blend of Hawaiian music with
American and European pop and folk.
</P>
<P>
   The two musicians share lead vocals and play a variety of
stringed instruments, mostly guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who heard us at the party thought we were this
rehearsed group,'' Flanagan said. ``But it was actually the first
time we had played together. It was very serendipitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan had been playing in a country-rock band in Colorado
when he decided to travel to Hawaii in 1980 to study the Hawaiian
slack-key guitar style, which involves retuning the guitar by
slackening the strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up moving back here with my girlfriend about three
years later,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hapa is one of Hawaii's most popular groups. The duo's
debut album, ``Hapa,'' was released about five years ago and has
sold almost 500,000 copies. The current album, ``In the Name of
Love,'' so far has sold about 75,000. The group also has released
an album of electric surf-guitar music called ``Surf Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hawaiian music scene is really an anomaly,'' Flanagan
said. ``It's a pretty huge scene, one of the largest regional
markets in the world. Local artists can sell 100,000 albums here
(in Hawaii) in a year, and records just continue to sell. They
don't have a six-month lifespan.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Flanagan has composed many of the duo's more
Hawaiian-styled songs, among them ``E Hele Ana E,'' ``Nani Wale o
Ka'inlani'' and ``Lelehuna.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Flanagan's more striking compositions is ``The Waikiki
Beachboy Song,'' a wistful, almost eerie ballad about Waikiki's
vanishing beach boys.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan was inspired to write the song after reading ``The
Waikiki Beach Boy,'' a book by Grady Timmons about the history of
Hawaiian beach boys, who serenaded tourists and taught them how to
surf.
</P>
<P>
   Performing guest vocals on the song is Hawaii's most famous
singer, Don Ho, a man Kaneali'i calls ``the Frank Sinatra of
Hawaiian music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a verse for Don and he loved it,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Ho agreed to record the song with Hapa, Flanagan and
Kaneali'i began sitting in on Sunday nights at Ho's regular
performances at the Waikiki Beachcomber. ``I really wanted to know
why this man was the No. 1 name in Hawaiian music since the late
'50s or early '60s,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan and Kaneali'i were floored by Ho's professionalism.
``He still does five nights a week. He's the consummate
entertainer. It's no mistake or fluke that he's been the No. 1 name
in entertainment here for almost four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan recalled one of the first shows Hapa did with Ho.
``When the show was over, he was running by me to be the first
person out in front to greet everyone. And as he's running by me,
he goes, `Hey, Barry, get out there and be with the people. Don't
be like Elvis. Look what happened to him,''' Flanagan said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The current album also includes versions of the guitar classic
``Sleepwalk,'' played on a Hawaiian steel guitar; and U2's ``Pride
(In the Name of Love).''
</P>
<P>
   Hapa first played the U2 song on Martin Luther King Jr. Day five
years ago in front of a crowd of 30,000 at Hawaii's Hula Bowl. The
day also marked the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the
Hawaiian monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest crowd we had ever played, and it was a very
emotional day for many Hawaiians,'' Flanagan said. ``We liked the
song so much we started closing all our shows with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hapa spends most of the year performing in the Hawaiian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything from baby luaus to large-scale theater
shows,'' Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three months of the year, Hapa travels to the mainland to
perform a series of concerts. The duo currently is on a West Coast
tour.

HITLER'S ASSASSINATION MIGHT HAVE LED TO ANOTHER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The newly disclosed fact that secret British
intelligence plans to assassinate Adolf Hitler during World War II
never came off is probably good news for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If, as revealed this week, British agents had succeeded in
bumping off the 20th century's master monster, it might have
assured that the Hitlerian myth would have survived to help revive
the Nazi cause a generation later and to bring on World War III.
</P>
<P>
   His assassination would have resulted in another
``stab-in-the-back'' theory like the one that fueled Germany's
nationalism after its defeat in 1918, leading to the eventual rise
to power of the dreadful corporal with his promise of revenge. When
the Germans lost World War I, many claimed that enemies within had
overthrown the regime of Kaiser Wilhelm and that, had that
treachery not occurred, Germany would have pursued the war and
ultimately prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Hitler's ignominious 1945 suicide in his Berlin
bunker to escape capture by the Russians effectively destroyed the
myth of the great leader except for a handful of Nazi diehards.
</P>
<P>
   With the war's end, the vast majority of Germans were ready to
abandon the memory of their past conquests and military glory and
to begin looking toward a different kind of future. For almost the
first time in their history, they started building a nation based
on democratic foundations. But a martyred Hitler might well have
been a serious obstacle to that process.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the failure of a July 1944 plot by German officers
to kill him and stage a coup was also a good thing although it led
to the executions of hundreds of brave men. Anything that allowed
the Germans to claim they hadn't lost the war because they were
beaten by stronger enemies _ which was the case _ would have meant
trouble for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the newly revealed secret archives show that
British agents seriously embarked on a scheme to kill Hitler _
either at Berchtesgaden, his Bavarian retreat, or on board his
special train _ only in 1944 when it was already apparent that
Germany was losing the war. British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill, among others, favored assassination and was ready to
approve a feasible plan. Luckily, no such plan was ever developed.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent objection to the plot made by allied
officials was that Hitler was committing so many strategic errors
that his removal would prolong the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been true in the immediate sense, but a deeper
objection to killing him was that it would have assured the
continuation of the Hitler legend. Thank heaven it didn't happen.

WHISTLE-BLOWER'S LIFE MADE DIFFICULT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ark., Calif., Ore.) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christiaan Walker was working for American Honda Motor Co. when
he stumbled upon carbon copies of checks showing that top sales
executives of the automaker had received thousands of dollars in
exchange for their secret ownership of a Honda dealership near
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who was a district service manager in Arkansas, thought
he smelled a rat, so he reported the information to a regional
sales executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was doing the company a favor, that I'd be a
hero,'' said Walker, who now lives in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem: The executive was in on the scam and he
alerted executives up the ladder that they had a potential fink on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Walker watched his career languish for three years.
He felt Honda was trying to force him out of the company by setting
employment conditions so strict that if he missed a plane because
of weather problems, that was grounds for termination. When he
realized his career was over, Walker said he went to the top
executive at American Honda about the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he was accused by Honda officials of using the
information to blackmail them into giving him promotions, and of
forging one of the checks. He turned copies of the checks over to
federal prosecutors and quit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 22 former American Honda executives, dealers and
vendors were prosecuted in 1994. Most of them went to prison for
taking millions of dollars of cars, cash and homes under the table
from dealers to assure a steady supply of hot-selling cars and for
taking kickbacks to open new Honda dealerships, said Steve Lynch,
author of a fascinating new book about this scandal, ``Arrogance
and Accords'' (Pecos Press).
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, a Honda dealership was a
license to print money, and several hundred dealers were willing to
fork over the cash to ensure they were on the gravy train, said
Lynch, who became interested in the Honda scandal while he was
working as Honda's head of regional marketing. He was fired from
his job when excerpts from his book were published.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows why it's difficult to be a whistle-blower, said
John Renner, an industrial psychologist with Hagberg Consulting
Group in Foster City, Calif. Usually it's one person up against an
organization of people who want to keep their jobs and preserve the
company's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Often whistle-blowers lose their jobs and they have trouble
getting new ones. It's fairly common for a company to suggest the
whistle-blower was threatening to bring up problems in exchange for
raises and promotions, Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies try to discredit whistle-blowers, said Renner.
</P>
<P>
   American Honda responded to the accusations with a statement
that Walker had been treated professionally throughout his tenure
and that serious questions about his credibility were raised when
it found that some of the evidence Walker provided had been
falsified.
</P>
<P>
   One common element of all whistle-blowers is they are morally
repulsed by the behavior they see, said Abigail Hubbard, management
professor at the University of Houston. It strikes at their core
values.
</P>
<P>
   It goes back to their upbringing, she said. While some people
look the other way, rationalizing that what they see is not all
that bad, others are willing to risk their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   By going to his supervisor, who was in on the scam, Walker was
toast, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for whistle-blowers to feel ostracized, she said.
When an employee complains, the other employees worry the company
will be harmed and, therefore, their jobs are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers are also uncomfortable because they know that the
managers don't like the whistle-blower, so they don't want to be
seen with him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to make reporting problems easier by
hiring an outside company that has a toll-free line so employees
can report corruption anonymously, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's case also shows how hard it can be for a whistle-blower
to fight back after being pushed out of a company. He sued Honda
for back wages and emotional distress. He lost that case when an
appeals court ruled he couldn't sue under the employment laws of
Oregon, where he had been living.
</P>
<P>
   So, would Walker do it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret I'm poor now,'' said Walker, who said he doesn't make
nearly the money he used to earn, or have the same job security.
``It's really tough to be honest.''

MAIL CAN BE EASY BOOTY FOR THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With MAIL-THEFT-TIPS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Several months ago, Claudia Dean stopped at her
bank to make a deposit and instead made a disturbing discovery: Her
account was $300 short.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing her balance statement, Dean found three checks she
didn't remember writing. Someone had stolen Dean's new checks. They
had been left sitting on a shelf in the unlocked, communal foyer of
her apartment building, delivered by the mailman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about my mail, never gave it a second
thought,'' said Dean, 37. ``But I do now. I'm not having my checks
delivered anymore. I'll pick them up at the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Mail theft, and subsequent mail fraud, bleeds Americans of
millions of dollars every year _ between $20 million and $30
million in stolen credit cards alone, according to U.S. Postal
Inspection Service statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scams are relatively easy to do,'' said Ray Smith, a
Postal Service inspector in Albany. ``A person can steal thousands
of dollars in a matter of hours using just a few pieces of mail _
credit cards, blank checks, bank statements. Even a signed check
you send out to pay a bill has your account number and your
signature, that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, about 4,300 people were arrested for mail theft
nationwide and some 4,100 were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of fraud, however, are on the rise. Technological
advances have armed thieves with a new arsenal of tools including
color printers and scanners used to make counterfeit documents.
Personal information of potential victims _ like Social Security
and credit card numbers _ are accessible on the Internet at the
click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mail theft often occurs because many people unwittingly
advertise their mail to potential thieves by raising the red flag
on their mailbox, Smith said. A flag alerts thieves that there
might be signed checks inside, which is why trolling for full
mailboxes is sometimes referred to as ``flagging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better idea to mail bills in a secure box on the
corner, or at the post office,'' Smith said. ``And know when your
financial statements come in.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune to mail theft, Smith said. It occurs in tony
suburban neighborhoods and inner-city apartment complexes.

WAYS TO PROTECT MAIL FROM THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are ways to protect your mail from thieves, according to
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service:
</P>
<P>
   _ When paying bills, do not place signed checks in your home
mailbox and raise the red flag as a signal to the letter carrier
that there's something inside; thieves look for that flag too.
Instead, drop bills in a secure corner mailbox or at the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to collect your mail soon after it is delivered. Don't
provide opportunities for someone to commit mail theft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick up renewal checks at the bank, don't have them sent to
your home. The boxes are too easily recognized by thieves.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're going out of town for more than three days, make a
``stop delivery'' request at your local post office, or have a
neighbor collect your mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bank statements, pre-approved credit card applications, Social
Security checks and replacement checks or credit cards are prime
targets for a mail thief. Try to be aware of when this kind of mail
is due to be delivered to your house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not simply discard potentially sensitive documents _
anything with your Social Security, bank or credit card account
number on it _ destroy them to avert ``Dumpster divers,'' who sift
through the trash in search of these items.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you believe you are a victim of mail theft or mail fraud,
call the U.S. Postal Inspectors.

LOW-BUDGET `PI' IS A BIG-SCREEN SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``PI'' will not be for everyone, but for those who are fed up
with the mainstream idiocy that gets dumped into theaters each
summer, this movie will be like a great big palate-clearing taste
of sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Darren Aronofsky has made a dark, comic drama
about Max, a madman mathematician played by Sean Gullette, an actor
who seems to have deep reserves of personal pain to draw from if
the simulated migraines Max suffers are any indication.
</P>
<P>
   With black-and-white cinematography by Matthew Libatique, an
eerie soundtrack by Clint Mansell and a tortured-looking leading
man, the movie is quirkily modern at the same time as being a dear
love note to all those sci-fi thrillers of the '50s when the threat
of nuclear annihilation loomed around every corner.
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky had the clever idea to combine the ethereal passion of
a mathematician looking for a numerical explanation of the physical
world, with the spiritual interests of a group of Hasidic Jews
seeking the sacred number derived through Kabalistic means that
expresses the most holy name of God, and the financial lust of a
group of Wall Street types who want to use Max's genius to
manipulate stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   So in this movie there is passion (for knowledge), love (of
God), greed and plenty of conflict. I had a ball.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is minimal. Max's inner torment, not to mention his
excruciating headaches, provide most of the film's action, although
when the suits come after him looking for Dow Jones predictions
things get pretty cloak-and-dagger.
</P>
<P>
   Long sequences concentrate on Max's face as he tries to prove
that the universe is an orderly place. He believes that therefore,
even though no one has as yet discerned the pattern in the stock
market, he is certain there is one. Once decoded, it will apply to
many other long, seemingly arbitrary strings of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That anyone is out there sweating to make movies (and this one's
budget was only $60,000!) about mathematical theories, philosophy
and other exertions of the mind would be great news all by itself.
That the movie is also good is even better.

A FEW GOOD LAUGHS IN `GODFATHER' SPOOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I could report that ``Mafia!'' is half as funny as
``Airplane!,'' ``The Naked Gun'' or ``Hot Shots!,'' other items on
director-writer Jim Abrahams' resume.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Abrahams has, as always, created a number of hilarious
moments in this spoof of ``The Godfather'' (no exclamation point),
but not enough to keep a more or less one-gag movie going.
</P>
<P>
   To save you the trouble of hiring the baby sitter, parking,
buying tickets and drinking watered-down Coke, here is a partial
list of the best moments. (For those who absolutely must go, I omit
a few jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   The casino games include Chutes and Ladders, Go Fish and
Candyland. In some cases the casino prefers gamblers to just mail
them the money. It eliminates the unnecessary plane fare.
</P>
<P>
   Godfather Vincenzo Cortino (the elder version is played by Lloyd
Bridges) hails from that famed Sicilian town Salmonella. In his
boyhood he ate the taste treat spaghetti-on-a-stick. Times were so
bad that even nothing cost five cents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vincenzo is head of the powerful Cortino family, he is
no mental giant. When members of another crime family ask Don
Cortino to become their partners in distributing a new product,
they carefully unwrap a cache of white powder. The Don thinks that
non-dairy creamer sounds like a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Don is gunned down by enemies, his son Anthony (the
rather insipid Jay Mohr) assures him, ``You lost a lot of blood,
but we found most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup, those are the jokes. But this movie did have a saving grace
and that was the presence of Olympia Dukakis as the Don's aged
mother. Dukakis, who is a handsome and vibrant woman, plays Mama
Cortino as an aged, bent-over and angry matriarch. Watching her
actorly transformation was the highlight of the movie for me.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I feel I can in good conscience reveal what was the
movie's funniest line to me, as I was the only one in the theater
who laughed: A little boy says to Anthony's wife (Christina
Applegate), ``You smell good,'' and she replies, ``I had cantaloupe
for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there something wrong with me?

TAKING THE TIME TO STUDY THE FLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 26)  
(lh) 
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ People once went to Garden in the Woods
seeking nothing more than a stroll through the forest. In
springtime in the mid-1980s, the parking lot was filled by families
who descended into clouds of azaleas bedded with carpets of phlox,
walking with Virginia bluebells and poppy celandine lapping at
their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   They ventured into the garden, a 45-acre preserve here that is
the headquarters of the New England Wildflower Society, to commune
with painted turtles sunning themselves by the pond bank and to be
serenaded by a chorus of bird song. If they paid attention to the
signs, it was probably to point and say, ``Nice Anemonella
thalictroides,'' before the name slipped out of sight, out of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, a stroller is likely to encounter people at every bend
in the path with pens poised and note pads in hand, feverishly
jotting ideas for color combinations and easy-to-grow wildflowers
they want to incorporate into their own backyards. And Garden in
the Woods _ like many other public gardens _ has changed from a
place to take the children for a walk to an educational site. It
delights the eye while providing sharply focused information on
incorporating wildflowers into an ordinary yard. It has sunny
wildflower gardens and shady counterparts; it has wetland
wildflower gardens and arid versions, which demonstrate that the
moisture-demanding rose mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos) doesn't mix
happily with the moisture-averse butterfly weed (Asclepias
tuberosa).
</P>
<P>
   Those who yearn for a meadow will find a multiseason one with
purple coneflowers, blazing stars, black-eyed Susans and asters. If
you have hankered for a pond, the Garden in the Woods has one to
copy, native plantings and all. The garden has 1,700 species of
wildflowers, mostly native, displayed to best advantage. And it has
just created a garden devoted to plants on the government's
endangered species list. Although walking its paths is still a
pleasure, to be sure, the garden strives to get visitors involved.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy seems to be working. Parking spaces are at a
premium. (The garden reported 40,000 visitors in 1997, as against
8,000 in 1985.) And visitors have to drive slowly to avoid little
red wagons brimming with newly purchased native plants. People take
their strolls in the woods seriously these days.
</P>
<P>
   Although earlier visitors may not have noticed, Garden in the
Woods has always had an educational slant, going back to the time
when it was privately owned. It dates to 1932, when Will Curtis, a
landscape designer with a bent for natural plantings, saw an
undeveloped country parcel on Hemenway Road. It had everything: a
pond, a wooded bog, sunken ditches with steep slopes on either
side, a flowing brook and good soil.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the land, built a modest cottage in the forest and,
with his partner, Richard Stiles, spent the next 30 years creating
a garden that blended native and cultivated plants, ostensibly as a
selling tool for his design business. It was nature perfected; it
was the woods without poison ivy at a time when very few people
were working with native plants. In 1965, with suburban Boston
developments encroaching on all sides, Curtis gave Garden in the
Woods to the New England Wildflower Society, founded in 1900, which
needed a headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The name Garden in the Woods is a little misleading, because the
woodland is only one of the many habitats featured on the 45 acres.
Much of the 13 acres of cultivated wild gardens (that sounds like
an oxymoron, but managing wilderness is what Garden in the Woods is
all about) remains as Curtis and Stiles designed them, including
that grove of oaks and azaleas.
</P>
<P>
   But other areas have become more sharply focused for educational
and conservation purposes. There are a lily pond, a shady New
England bog, a sunny bog, pine barrens, an alpine rock garden, a
rock garden and a Western garden complete with hardy cacti and a
meadow.
</P>
<P>
   All the plants in those gardens are meticulously labeled, and
many can be purchased in the nursery. The staff members who
maintain decorum among the wildlings _ not a low-maintenance chore
_ are eager to share their secrets with visitors. For example, to
keep the entryway woodland garden abutting the original Curtis
cottage door in pristine condition, the beds are fertilized, a
percentage of the wildflower seeds are harvested before they
scatter, invasive weeds are yanked, trees are trimmed to provide
proper shade and leaves are raked in autumn. The leaves are stored
under a tarp, shredded (Garden in the Woods uses a chopper, but
home gardeners could enlist their lawn mowers) and reapplied as
mulch after a hard freeze.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if wildflowers aren't self-sustaining, if they don't promise
more hours in the hammock, why are they so popular now? After all,
the society reports that its membership has increased 34 percent in
five years, 14 percent since October 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brumback, the garden's director of conservation, said he
thinks that in addition to being charmed by wildflowers' innate
beauty, people are trying to make a difference, preserving what is
slipping away: A third of North America's flora is endangered, and
they are eager to help. Adopting a nursery-propagated lady-slipper
won't prevent the species, which is endangered, from disappearing,
but it can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the society is concerned that
well-intentioned people might simply go into the woods and dig
plants to take home. Although Brumback conceded that commercial
collecting was a far bigger threat to wildflower populations than
individual digging, he was quick to point out, ``There's no
difference between one person digging 1,000 lady-slippers and 1,000
people each digging only one lady-slipper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why Garden in the Woods recently began
propagating and selling wildflowers. It now lists 343 plants.
Judging from the phlox-laden red wagons being pulled through the
parking lot, many people are now taking their weekend woods
experience home.
</P>
<P>
   BEAT THE SEEDS: Pick beans, cucumbers and squash before they get
tough as seeds ripen. Herbs are most flavorful harvested just as
flowers begin to develop. For the sake of next year's crop, treat
asparagus as you would tulips: Don't cut ferny foliage until stems
have turned brown.

THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN TRANSLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHELE ROSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In describing his craft, the translator John Ciardi said that
practitioners could try for ``no more than the best possible
failure.'' Yet scholarly translators have split over how to achieve
even that modest goal.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are the traditionalists who believe that translators
should try to produce what's known as ``transparent'' translations.
Translators, says Clifford Landers, president of the literary
division of the American Translators Association and a translator
of Portuguese literature, should strive to ``recreate the same
emotional and psychological effect that someone in the source
language would have had in reading the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents argue that this method amounts to a kind of
cultural imperialism, eliminating essential linguistic and cultural
differences. ``The ideal in translation,'' said Lawrence Venuti, a
professor of English at Temple University who is on the judging
panel for a translation prize awarded by the Modern Language
Association, is ``where the reader comes away with the experience
of reading a foreign text, not only in the sense of themes that are
foreign, but also at the level of the sentence.'' In other words,
readers shouldn't be fooled into feeling too comfortable and at
home with what is, after all, an alien world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the trouble with such translations, traditionalists argue,
is that few people will want to read them. ``The problem with the
dense and difficult school is it ends up being something for the
elitist,'' said Lynn Hoggard, president of the American Literary
Translators Association and a professor of French at Midwestern
State University. ``A lot of people don't want to read something
that constantly reminds them of its foreignness.''
</P>
<P>
   And getting people to read a work is the point, say the
traditionalists. As it is, translation is a tough sell in the
United States. Fewer than 2,000 works of translated literature are
published here each year, or 2 percent to 4 percent of all
published books.
</P>
<P>
   Readers, they say, will have the easiest time understanding a
work if it uses terms and ideas familiar to them in standard,
modern English. This inevitably means that important literature
should be translated again and again for each new generation, so
that it reflects the changes in the language over time. (And it has
the added benefit of guaranteeing a steady stream of work for
translators.)
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Venuti argue that the translator should search
for the words and ideas that most closely resemble those in the
source text. He uses his own translation of a Gothic horror story
by the 19th-century Italian author Inigio Ugo Tarchetti as an
example. ``I decided this was a writer who wrote in the late Gothic
period,'' he said. ``It was important for me to signal the
foreignness of this text that included archaisms and to mix those
with current standard English.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So Venuti made lists of words used in works by Poe, Shelley and
Stoker because he felt these were the authors in English whose work
most closely resembled Tarchetti's. Then he used them in his
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no translation can ever perfectly reflect the
original because of grammatical, linguistic and cultural
differences. And in some cases, as with slang, idioms, puns and
wordplay, no equivalent word or phrase can capture the exact
meaning either. In his book, ``Le Ton Beau de Marot: In Praise of
the Music of Language,'' Douglas Hofstadter points out that it
would be impossible to construct a palindrome in another language
that would convey the exact meaning of ``A man, a plan, a canal,
Panama!''
</P>
<P>
   A translator's linguistic struggles extend far beyond dictionary
definitions, however. Hofstadter goes on to argue that every word
is surrounded by a halo of connotations and associations that
radiate far beyond their literal meanings.
</P>
<P>
   And since all words carry meanings and suggestions in one
culture that don't necessarily have an exact counterpart in
another, it is inevitable that translations will end up with
colors, tones and meanings that don't exist in the original.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why both the traditionalists and their critics agree
that translators ultimately determine how their readers perceive
another culture's literature. As even Venuti concedes:
``Translators are essentially interpreting a foreign text,
overlaying the text with another set of meanings. To practice
translation and think you're not doing that is a misunderstanding
of translation.''

   CONGRESS-RELIGION-NYT (Washington) _ Legislation to require the
U.S. government to punish foreign countries that permit or endorse
religious persecution was put off indefinitely Thursday by a Senate
committee because Republicans were deeply divided over the issue.
The measure, which pits social conservatives like the Christian
Coalition against business interests like the Chamber of Commerce
and the major farm organizations, is strongly opposed by the
administration. By David E. Rosenbaum. Moved 7-23.

<P>
   VATICAN-BISHOPS-NYT (Rome) _ Seeking to curb the independence of
bishops, Pope John Paul II issued an apostolic letter Thursday that
tightens the Vatican's control over 108 bishops' conferences around
the world. Under the new rules, it would be almost impossible for
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States to
issue major, binding statements on topics like nuclear weapons,
homosexuality or the status of women, that diverged from the
Vatican view. By Alessandra Stanley. Moved 7-23.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-CULTUREWAR-NYT (Jerusalem) _ A look at the dispute
between religious and secular Jews, which has steadily intensified
in fury and emotion. It is common now to hear references to
Kulturkampf, a culture war in which the secular ``Tel Aviv'' and
the religious ``Jerusalem'' are battling for the very soul of
Israel. By Serge Schmemann. Moved 7-20. WITH PHOTO.

DUCK! HERE COMES THE CHIEF

   (For release Sunday, July 26)  
(lh) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clintons are coming! The Clintons are coming! For weeks that
has been the cry raised on the South Fork of New York's Long
Island, and now that plans for the visit next weekend by the
president and the first lady have come into focus, the anticipation
has boiled over, with many residents and vacationers clamoring for
invitations _ and just as many planning to grab the kids, close the
blinds and batten down the hatches.
</P>
<P>
   It's been three decades since a U.S. president paid a visit to
the Hamptons. In 1968, president-elect Richard Nixon slipped in
along Route 27 and checked quietly into Gurney's Inn in Montauk for
a weekend. When he left, stopping at an ice cream parlor on Route
27 and ordering a pineapple sundae, Nixon and his sundae made the
front page of The East Hampton Star.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that when Bill Clinton hits town five days
from Sunday for a three-day visit, Friday to Sunday, the sundaes
will be at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the hedge clippers, the martini shakers and the
blow-dryers. ``The entire community is thoroughly engaged in
anticipating the president's visit,'' said Judith Hope, the
chairwoman of the New York state Democratic Committee and a
part-time resident of East Hampton. ``It's not just myself having
my hair done, but the waitresses at the catering companies having
their hair done, making reservations weeks in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger are
playing host to a political fund-raiser at their Amagansett estate
for 1,000 guests, who will donate up to $5,000 each. On Friday
night, there's an intimate dinner for 60 _ the price of admission
is $25,000 a couple _ at the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein's
house in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors of a golfing trip to the Atlantic Golf Club on
Saturday (gardeners are pruning, seeding and trimming). And from 4
to 6 p.m. on Saturday afternoon, Dr. Christopher Barley, an
internist, and Jonathan Sheffer, the artistic director of the Eos
Orchestra, will be the hosts of a small gathering at their home in
East Hampton to benefit the Democratic National Committee's Finance
Council. Barley expects the president to attend, and he confirmed
that the Secret Service would be shutting down neighborhood roads.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about area-wide gridlock are what have caused most of
the advance fretting. Sam Schwartz, the former deputy commissioner
of the New York City Transportation Department, who now writes the
Gridlock Sam column for The New York Daily News, predicts that the
drive out on Friday night could last as long as 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president's going out to the Hamptons, well, that's
about as peak as you get,'' Schwartz said. ``But it is also the
change-over weekend for the month _ new renters going in for the
month, old renters going out. And it's a Friday night. So you
basically have a triple whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Glen Stonemetz of East Hampton Village thinks the
10-hour figure must be wrong. ``From what I understand, in terms of
the protocols the Secret Service uses to move the president
around,'' Stonemetz said, ``I'd make that 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of impending doom for many Hamptonites has led to
plans to hunker down in houses and not leave the premises. Dini von
Mueffling, a writer who summers in a house on Town Line Road, which
straddles the towns of East Hampton and Southampton, said she would
stock up on essentials, then check the tires on her bike and settle
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing to do is go to King Cullen on Wednesday, hit
the farm stands on Thursday and then not move for the rest of the
weekend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Canfield, a Manhattan art dealer who spends most summer
weekends in East Hampton, said he planned to stay in New York City.
``On the other hand, how can you add any more to what it is
already?'' he said of the Hamptons traffic. ``It's already a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The small coterie of vacationers who commute from Washington to
the Hamptons each weekend don't quite understand the fuss. ``We're
used to getting stuck in the motorcade, so it's kind of old hat for
us,'' said Mark Ein, a venture capitalist, who lives in Washington
and shares a house with friends in Bridgehampton.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   All the elements involved in planning a presidential getaway _
from the sublime to the ridiculous _ are full steam ahead. On
Monday and Tuesday, the Secret Service will meet with the East
Hampton Village police (22 officers) and the town police (60
officers) to get acquainted with the neighborhood and plan their
bomb sweeps. The hairdressers at the Echo Salon in East Hampton are
solidly booked for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Dreesen's Excelsior Market on Newtown Lane in East Hampton,
Rudy DeSanti will be awake at 6 a.m. on Saturday to prepare the
dough for the 800 Dreesen's Famous Donuts he is donating to the
fund-raiser at the Baldwin-Basinger estate. And all across the
island, waiters and waitresses are trying to finagle a presidential
catering spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's been some fighting,'' said Ariele Fierman, a
server at the Bridgehampton Cafe, who had to submit her Social
Security number, date of birth, sex and race, along with a
statement that she has no criminal record, to the Secret Service
about two weeks ago. ``It caused a lot of tension in the kitchen,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Much to her delight, Ms. Fierman will be working the
Baldwin-Basinger party, where the levels of access among the
several hundred guests will vary widely. For $5,000, invitees get
to venture inside the house. For $1,000, partygoers get to stand
under a tent next to the house, and the president will work a rope
line, shaking hands. And for $250, the remaining attendees get to
stand a few hundred yards from the house and snarf as many
cocktails and Dreesen's doughnuts as they can manage. (The entire
weekend is expected to net the Democrats $1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred and fifty bucks to stand 500 yards from a
motorcade?'' said Glenn Horowitz, a rare book dealer, who has a
shop on Newtown Lane and is bravely giving a party for the novelist
Dani Shapiro that same evening. ``It's potentially one of the great
social shakedowns of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in charge of ensuring that all runs smoothly, there is
the tricky problem of the Hamptons temperament. Anyone who has ever
spent time waiting for a Sunday newspaper at the General Store in
Sagaponack, or watched a famous divorce lawyer rant at a helpless
clerk under a ``Sold Out'' sign at the United Artists East Hampton
Cinema, has seen it. The people who have weekend homes in the
Hamptons _ the land of the $5 million summer cottage and the $10
million ego _ are not exactly used to being bossed around. Even the
United States Secret Service has taken notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have to be able to tell someone no in a polite
way,'' said Chip Smith, the Secret Service special agent in charge
of the president's visit. ``Maybe in a way that they don't even
know you're saying no. In a polite way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possible conflicts _ gridlock traffic, doughnut
overdoses, Secret Service squabbles, oversize egos _ Ms. Hope, the
state Democratic Committee chairwoman, is naturally, delighted that
East Hampton is playing host for the President.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fierman, the waitress who will be serving at the
Baldwin-Basinger party, is also eagerly awaiting the weekend and
Saturday night's party. But for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm keeping my eyes out for a Baldwin brother,'' she said, her
voice brimming with hope. ``But I guess I'll take a Secret Service
man.''

DON'T SWEAT IT: THINGS COULD BE WORSE IN HOUSTON _ AND IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ So you think it's hot?
</P>
<P>
   Quit your whining. Believe it or not, we live in a veritable
tropical paradise compared to the hellish summer climes found in
other hot spots around the state and globe.
</P>
<P>
   You only have to go as far as Dallas _ which has endured nearly
three straight weeks of triple-digit heat _ to find folks sizzling
under higher temperatures. Yes, this is an off-the-charts heat wave
in Texas, the steamiest since 1980. But Dallas always gets hotter
than Houston on average in July. The normal high for Dallas during
this month is 96.5 _ almost four degrees above Houston's
goose-pimply 92.7.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a punishing summer. Nationwide, deaths from the heat
stand at 133, including 87 in Texas (four in Houston.) Now it's
even getting hot up North, where once-chic New Yorkers now sweat
copiously. Meanwhile, we currently bask in the brisk high 90s.
</P>
<P>
   We have geography to thank for our comparatively lower
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're near the Gulf (of Mexico), and so that keeps us a bit
cooler,'' said Jill Hasling, director of the Weather Research
Center in Houston. ``We get that nice sea breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   When we recently neared our July record of 104, weary citizens
of Abilene simmered at 107 and unfortunate souls in Arlington
toasted at 108. They were downing plenty of mineral water in
Mineral Wells (107), Long View (105), Midland (109), Fort Stockton
(108) and San Angelo (107). We were even cooler than the ultra-cool
denizens of Austin (106) and the stiff-lipped Aggies at College
Station (105.) Pueblo and Grand Junction, Colo., both recently
reported record highs of 104.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling chilly yet?
</P>
<P>
   In general, it gets hotter in north Texas than in the balmy
regions of Southeast Texas because of our close proximity to the
coast, said Paul Lewis, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in League City. This also makes us wetter, which increases
an unfortunate thing called the heat index.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high heat index makes it feel hotter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is the humid coastal breeze, while cooling things
down, makes it harder for the moisture-laden air to absorb sweat as
effectively as dryer climes. So while we may boast cooler temps, we
feel more miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consider this: In recent days, Houston has been
considerably cooler than a slate of forecasts for Phoenix, Palm
Springs, Calif., and Carlsbad, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   And on the same day we hovered just three measly degrees above
100:
</P>
<P>
   _ The thermometer hit 107 in Roswell, N.M., too hot for even the
most intrepid space aliens to land on the scorched desert Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Folks were feeling prickly in Organ Pipe Cactus, N.M., where
it zoomed to 112.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was Hades incarnate in Needles, Calif., which became the
absolutely hottest place in the nation when it hit 114.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the thermometer reached 122 degrees in Lake Havasu, a
tourist town smack-dab in the middle of the Arizona desert, making
it the hottest place in the nation so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only hell is hotter,'' said Candi Isaacs of the Lake Havasu
Chamber of Commerce. Even so, Lake Havasu hasn't broken its own
record, reached in June 1996, when the mercury hit 128 degrees. But
it's plenty warm for Isaacs, who said that the town's population of
mainly senior citizens and tourists combat the heat by staying
indoors, like people do in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from air-conditioned car to air-conditioned home to
air-conditioned business. If we're not there, we're in the lake.
Literally,'' she said, referring to the 45-mile-wide Lake Havasu,
spanned by the original London Bridge. The historic bridge was
dismantled and reassembled there in 1970 by a chain-saw-company
entrepreneur. You can catch a breeze standing on it, said Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   But Lake Havasu's temperatures are positively Arctic compared to
steam boilers like the appropriately named Death Valley, Calif.,
where the highest degree ever was reached (so far) on June 10,
1913, when the mercury reached 134. Recent forecasts have Death
Valley nearing 127.
</P>
<P>
   And you said you were hot?
</P>
<P>
   When temperatures get this high, said Hasling, you can hardly do
anything. It hurts to move. It hurts to think. You can't even fly
planes to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to watch things like gasoline tanks,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other places around the world are doing their own tango with
high temps. Try toughing it out in a barbecue pit like Fort
Flatters, Algeria, located just 28 degrees above the equator, where
the average high in July is a blistering 110 degrees. The record is
124.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, temperatures have climbed to 120 degrees in San Luis,
Mexico. And don't even consider tripping over to Adrar, Algeria,
where the average in July is a steamy 115. Ditto places like Libya,
Mali and Argentina, all of which get way hotter than Houston (and
in Argentina, it gets hot in January.) It's the same story for
Baghdad (121 is the July record) and Iran (127.)
</P>
<P>
   Desert areas, explained Hasling, tend to get extremely hot
because of the lack of cooling rains and heat-deflecting clouds.
They also get lots of high-pressure areas _ that's
meteorology-speak for clear weather. The opposite of storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just the bearing down of the heat and the sun,'' she
said. ``It just radiates.''
</P>
<P>
   We should thank our stars, too, for Houston's comparative
flatness. Sure, we don't enjoy picturesque vistas like those found
in New Mexico and other deserty places, but we avoid the dreaded
``sinking air'' syndrome, another cause of high heat, said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air cools as it goes up, but then it rises over the mountains,
loses its moisture and warms up,'' he said. ``Voila! Instant
desert. Just add water.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Houston is hot, it isn't the hottest, not by a long
shot. And don't go cooking up any scary scenarios like global
warming to explain why we're sweltering so. Sometimes it's just,
well, hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most meteorologists you meet don't tie global warming into
(the current heat),'' said Hasling. ``Right now, we're not as hot
as we were in the 1980s. Actually, global warming could produce
more clouds, which could actually make us cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Texas is in the midst of an awesome heat wave
breaking records set more than a century ago. Last month alone, 70
daily temperature records were bested in 17 Texas cities, according
to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   If things get too bad, just close your eyes and imagine slipping
into a parka in Truckee, Calif., or Mountain Home, Idaho, where
residents recently shivered their way to 33 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   And just wait until winter.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   FRED THOMPSON: The lawyer-turned-movie actor-turned-U.S. senator
says he might run for president in 2000, which raises a question:
Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is the Tennessee Republican whose Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee conducted those coma-inducing hearings last year
in search of campaign finance violations by President Clinton and
his money-raisers. The hearings failed to produce any significant
evidence of Clintonian lawbreaking and also failed to launch the
Thompson-for-President bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson hopes to generate interest in his candidacy by talking
up issues such as nuclear proliferation. Fat chance. He'd have
better luck talking up his roles in movies such as ``In the Line of
Fire'' and ``Die Hard 2.''
</P>
<P>
   JANET RENO: The U.S. attorney general hasn't made any movies
lately _ although a Reno look-alike was featured on television's
``Ally McBeal.'' What Reno has in common with Thompson is the
albatross known as campaign finance. The attorney general has
bravely resisted demands that she seek an independent counsel to
investigate Clinton's money-raising tactics _ does this country
really need one more independent counsel? _ but a newly leaked
``confidential'' report from a Justice Department underling has put
the special-prosecutor gun to Reno's head once again.
</P>
<P>
   Reno-watchers say she has no plans to back down. I say good for
her. If Thompson couldn't crack Clinton's campaign-finance
stonewalling, and if Ken Starr is having all this trouble proving
that the president dallied with an intern, why spend a fortune on
another futile investigation?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL JORDAN: His Airness is still threatening to retire from
basketball, and that would be a tragedy for fans who hang on
Michael's every move. To untold numbers of kids and grownups,
Jordan IS basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I think he ought to hang up his sneakers. Don't
misunderstand. I'm no less thrilled than any other fan by Jordan's
matchless spirit of competitiveness and mind-boggling feats of
athleticism. He's in a class by himself, a transcending presence
who long ago rendered moot any debate about the identify of
basketball's best-ever player. There is Michael Jordan, and then
there are all the others.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan has ruled the game long enough. It's time to let the
other guys take their shots at fame and fortune. Besides, Jordan is
still at the top of his game _ or near it _ but he won't be much
longer. Athletes almost never have enough sense _ pride? _ to bow
out before erosion of their skills begins to tarnish their legacy.
Jordan ought to be the one who does.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT YOUNG: That's an impressive list of movies that Young
racked up over the decades, but it was television that made him an
American icon. Most TV actors are lucky to star in one show that is
remembered by viewers as an all-time favorite; Young starred in
two. He was TV's greatest dad on ``Father Knows Best'' and TV's
greatest doctor on ``Marcus Welby, M.D.''
</P>
<P>
   Young died the other day at 91, leaving his legions of fans with
fond memories of the great guys he played on television in the
'50s, '60s and '70s: a father who never lost patience with his
children and always commanded the respect of his family, and a
doctor whose main concern was the health and well-being of his
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Were those the good old days or what?
</P>
<P>
   ALAN SHEPARD: Kids growing up in 1950s America had fictional
space heroes to admire: ``Tom Corbett, Space Cadet,'' ``Captain
Video and His Video Rangers,'' Buzz Corey of ``Space Patrol.'' But
the real deal seemed a distant dream _ until Alan Shepard burst
onto the scene.

HERE'S THE STORY ON ELEVATORS
</HEADLINE>

By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My friend Andrew has an enormous fear of elevators. Is there
an official term for that? Also, how many elevator deaths occur
yearly?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.H., Corpus Christi, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: There doesn't appear to be a phobia named specifically for
elevator fear, though claustrophobia (enclosed spaces), acrophobia
(heights) and mechanophobia (machines) all come close.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ``20/20'' report indicated that 6,500 people were
hospitalized for elevator-related injuries last year, usually from
being struck by doors or falling when exiting an unlevel elevator.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 100 fatalities since 1991, according to
``20/20.'' Most occur when someone tries to exit a stalled elevator
or walks into an open elevator shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Postal Savings System $1 certificate purchased on
July 12, 1932. How much is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.W., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Those certificates, which were sold from 1910 until 1967 for
amounts from $1 to $2,500, paid 2 percent annual interest. A $1
certificate purchased in 1932 would be worth $3.69 today.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1984 law prevented any Postal Savings claims from
being filed after July 13, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1971, $60 million in savings deposits certificates was
unclaimed, according to Valerie Welsch of the U.S. Post Office Fort
Worth district.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money was divided among the states, with a small
amount withheld for any remaining claims.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Richard Bach, the author of ``Jonathan
Livingston Seagull?''
</P>
<P>
   _ L.R., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Bach in care of William Morrow &AMP; Company, Royalties
Dept., 1350 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10019.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, who turned 62 on June 23, lives in Seattle with wife
Leslie Parrish-Bach. ``Seagull'' has sold more than 30 million
copies since being published in 1970.

PASSAT HAS FEATURES OF PRICIER COUSIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an automaker owns both a mass-market brand and an upscale
name plate _ such as Toyota and Lexus, Nissan and Infiniti,
Volkswagen and Audi _ people who buy the less-expensive brand often
get many of the advantages of the more-expensive one without paying
the extra bucks.
</P>
<P>
   What the buyer lacks, of course, is the snob appeal of the
more-expensive brand. But if value for money is what you're looking
for, it makes more sense to choose a fully loaded 1998 Volkswagen
Passat GLX, for instance, than the comparable but pricier Audi A4.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat, VW's biggest sedan, is all new for '98, and is based
on the platform of the A4 that was introduced a couple of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars aren't identical; the Passat is actually a bit
larger and roomier inside, qualifying it as a midsize, while the A4
remains a compact. But this newest version of the Passat truly
feels like a premium car. It goes way against the perceptions that
most people have of Volkswagen as a company that builds small,
economical, practical cars.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $26,250 that includes leather seats and the
same 190-horsepower, 2.8-liter V-6 engine of the A4, the Passat GLX
is a real bargain compared with some of the competition _
especially the A4, whose comparably equipped price is about $5,000
more.
</P>
<P>
   This Passat is one really fun car to drive, too. Although the
suspension is a bit cushier than the A4's, the new four-link front
suspension arrangement is a great improvement over that of the
previous Passat. The cushiness makes for a smoother ride but cuts
some of the sporty firmness out of the road-handling
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Passat feels expensive and a lot sportier than one
would expect from even the most expensive VW. The vehicle holds
tightly to the road in curves, and the acceleration is surprisingly
good. Power is comparable to that of V-6 Toyota Camry and its twin,
the Lexus ES 300, but handling is definitely more crisp on the
Volkwagen.
</P>
<P>
   The GLX comes with a four-speed automatic transmission and
front-wheel drive, but an all-wheel-drive version is available.
</P>
<P>
   To get a Passat with a five-speed manual transmission, you would
have to back up a bit and choose the less-expensive GLS model (base
price $20,750), which comes with VW's impressive 1.8-liter
turbocharged four-cylinder engine, rated at 150 horsepower. To
this, add the leather ($950) and other standard amenities of the
GLX, such as the power glass moon roof ($1,000) and get a vehicle
comparable to the GLX but with a manual gearbox.
</P>
<P>
   You can add the nifty five-speed Tiptronic automatic
transmission to the GLX for $1,075, an option that showed up on our
test car. This transmission allows you to shift manually, although
without the bother of a clutch. It's similar to the Tiptronic
offered in the Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic traction control and the excellent Bosch four-wheel
antilock braking system are standard. The brakes are discs all
around _ vented in front and solid in the rear. Steering is
power-assisted rack-and-pinion.
</P>
<P>
   The new Passat is one of the roomiest and most comfortable
midsize sedans on the market. Three adults can fit easily into the
back seat, and the two front bucket seats are living-room-lounger
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Trunk space is unusually generous at 15 cubic feet, thanks to
the squaring of the rear end. The split-folding rear seat allows
cargo to be extended into the back seat, great for skis or other
long or bulky items.
</P>
<P>
   All Passats come with alarm system, AM/FM/cassette stereo,
central door locking with remote control, center console, cruise
control, dual heated power mirrors, dual illuminated visor vanity
mirrors, fog lights, plenty of interior lights (including one in
the trunk), manual air-conditioning, power windows with one-touch
up and down for both front windows, rear defroster, tilt and
telescopic steering wheel, trip computer, variable intermittent
wipers and wheel covers.
</P>
<P>
   GLS models with the V-6 engine (a $2,440 upgrade) get cloth and
wood door-trim panels.
</P>
<P>
   Our top-of-the-line GLX got even more goodies: leather and wood
door trim, the all-weather package (heated front seats and
windshield-washer nozzles), automatic climate control, eight-way
power driver's seat with memory, leather-wrapped steering wheel,
and the power moon roof.
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our test car was $27,825, including $500
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Although EPA fuel-economy ratings were not provided, expect the
GLX's V-6 to get mileage comparable to the A4's 17 miles per gallon
in the city and 27 on the highway. The fuel tank holds 18.5
gallons, enough for a long ride between fill-ups.

THE MULTI IN CULTURAL STILL LEAVES ALSO-RANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What inevitably prompts the most discussion about an anthology
isn't what's put in but what's left out.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of ``The Dictionary of Global Culture'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, 1997), for example, noted the included and the excluded.
Schubert in, Schumann out; Homer in, Horace out; Franklin Roosevelt
in, Ronald Reagan out; Joe Louis in, Arthur Ashe out.
</P>
<P>
   It's an engaging parlor game, but there are weighty questions
embedded in list-making: How thorough is the research? What are the
intellectual or artistic criteria and are they sound? Who is even
entitled to make such decisions?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer the case that you automatically have the
authority to pronounce these things because you're two Harvard
professors,'' said Kwame Anthony Appiah, who, together with his
Harvard colleague Henry Louis Gates Jr., edited the dictionary.
``We've had the general democratization of culture in which there
is a wider range of people who rightly feel entitled to declare
their views.''
</P>
<P>
   As the editors note in their preface, the twin problems of being
exhaustive and being representative have existed since Diderot
wrote the first modern encyclopedia in the 18th century. The global
dictionary doesn't pretend to be either, Appiah and Gates say, but
instead offers ``an invitation for readers to begin the process of
understanding those cultures that most of us educated in the West
barely know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried in our introduction to be clear that our idea wasn't
to identify the basic minimum knowledge needed to be the global
citizen of something,'' Appiah explained, adding that they still
got complaints like ``Why is Jackie Robinson not in here?''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, on the cover, right under the title, the book
pronounces itself ``the global citizen's guide to culture,
emphasizing the achievement of the non-Western world _ what every
American needs to know as we enter the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without that subtitle, however, Appiah and Gates are
essentially doing what all anthologists do: deciding what does and
what does not belong in a given canon. And increasingly, such an
undertaking involves contentious debates about race, gender,
ethnicity and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true object of this dictionary is to question deep-rooted
assumptions of European pre-eminence,'' the critic Frank Kermode
said about the global dictionary in The New York Review of Books,
``and let white culture ... take its proper place, diminished but
accorded the measure of respect now thought decent, in a global
account that includes all the others.'' The editors' goal, he adds
``is to establish a new and aggressive point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Weinberger said his anthology of ``American Poetry Since
1950'' (Marsilio, 1993) became enmeshed in vituperative arguments
about who deserves to be included and why they should be.
</P>
<P>
   A critique in the American Poetry Review accused him of holding
degrading views of African-Americans, he said, because he had
selected the work of Amiri Baraka and Langston Hughes, who the
reviewer felt were not representative of African-American writing.
To Weinberger, that such a selection could be labeled racist was
like entering a world of ``Alice in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly never do another anthology,'' Weinberger
added. ``It's a thankless task.''
</P>
<P>
   David Curzon had a different experience with identity politics,
however. He said he was initially irked by pressures of political
correctness in assembling his two anthologies of poetry based on
biblical texts such as the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it a little irritating to be asked to think about
nonliterary criteria such as the proportion of people of one gender
or ethnic origin,'' he said. ``But it turned out not to be a
problem. I was pushed by some of these requirements to look further
afield than I probably would have, and I think I came up with some
interesting poems which I'm glad are in the anthology.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, identity politics aren't the only politics that can
cause problems. In assembling his ``Columbia Anthology of British
Poetry'' with Carl Woodring a few years ago, James Shapiro said,
``There were Irish distributors who had the rights who did not want
to part with those poems unless we changed the name of the
anthology _ they didn't like the idea of British.'' He said that
``every anthology is a political statement or a series of political
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because their anthology of world poetry covered so many
ethnic groups, Katharine Washburn and John S. Major did not worry
so much about multicultural considerations. ``We didn't see this as
the United Nations,'' Ms. Washburn said. ``Nevertheless, it turned
out to have an extraordinary range of diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The two editors updated Mark Van Doren's ``Anthology of World
Poetry,'' published in 1928. Their volume, ``World Poetry: An
Anthology of Verse From Antiquity to Our Time,'' published by W.W.
Norton in April, includes more than 1,600 poems spanning a period
of 4,000 years from the era of ancient Sumer to the late 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The book consists of eight chronological parts, from the Bronze
Age forward, with each section subdivided by language. (Most of the
poems were translated into English for the anthology by other
poets.)
</P>
<P>
   Helen Vendler, probably the most powerful poetry critic in the
United States, attacked this organizing approach in a review in The
New Republic, arguing that Van Doren's method of dividing poems by
language in chronological order was more intelligible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Washburn defended their attempt to create linkages across
geography and time. ``You have a poem from seventh century B.C.
from Greek, and not far away in the same section you have a Chinese
poem from the Han dynasty,'' Ms. Washburn said, ``This has
unexpected resonances, so that readers could see connective tissue
and could see parallels and echoes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The book weighs in at a hefty 1,338 pages, including the index.
Nevertheless, Ms. Vendler still noted what was left out. ``Would
you represent Tennyson without mentioning `In Memoriam'?'' she
asked in her review. ``If you could print four poems by Keats,
would you leave out all the odes?''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Lopate, the essayist, is preparing an anthology for
perhaps the toughest crowd of all: New Yorkers. He is editing a
collection of writings about New York that is scheduled for
publication by the Library of America in September. ``They're a
more educated audience,'' he said. ``And every New Yorker is an
expert on New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Having decided to start with Washington Irving, Lopate said, he
pushed himself to go up to the present, which he described as the
hardest period to address. ``They're our contemporaries _ sometimes
they're our friends, sometimes they're our enemies _ and we don't
have perspective, we don't know how to judge them,'' he said. ``It
would have been easier to stop at the '60s, but it seemed to me
that would have been cowardly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what many people may not realize is that often a particular
selection may have absolutely nothing to do with taste, scholarship
or politics but simply be a matter of space. The more pages there
are, the more entries can be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get enough pages, you can circumvent this whole
issue of the canon,'' Lopate said. ``You can have as many
multicultural authors and you can have as many dead white males as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, copyright might be the problem. In many cases,
editors say, the cost of the permissions is prohibitive, so
material is ultimately left out because it was too expensive to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the new range of questions, professors say
they try now to present anthologies as just one of many sources,
rather than offering them as an authoritative selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthologies today are taught self-consciously on the part of a
teacher who wants to call attention to the fact that the book
represents a particular version of literary history and has its
organizing principles and assumptions and is not the only version
of things that might be available,'' said Langdon Hammer, an
associate professor of English at Yale University who is also the
director of undergraduate studies in English.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, anthologists say they have to expect debate.
``I finally had to be governed by my own love and my own passion
for this or that,'' Lopate said. ``I think being an anthologist is
an invitation to guilt and defensiveness. In a way you're convicted
in advance.''

ARTISTS' MODERN TRADITION OF MOCKING THE MIDDLE CLASS _ AND
THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Artists: All charlatans. What artists do cannot be called
work.'' From Flaubert's ``Dictionary of Accepted Ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about new paintings of recent years shows
George Washington taking a stroll along the banks of a lake.
Nearby, three young people in modern dress approach the water. Two
deer frolic. The blue sky is streaked with white clouds.
</P>
<P>
   That painting is, its creators declare, ``America's Most
Wanted.'' It was carefully constructed after a detailed poll
questioned 1,001 randomly chosen Americans about their taste in
art. Sixty-seven percent wanted a ``dishwasher-size'' painting; 88
percent wanted an outdoor scene; 66 percent wanted ``soft curves.''
They got them all. And the painting, along with interviews and much
commentary, was featured in a book published this season:
``Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to
Art'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   The artists who created the poll and the painting, Vitaly Komar
and Alexander Melamid, also surveyed taste in other countries and
detected a worldwide love of kitschy blue landscapes. Former Soviet
dissidents, they stick their tongues firmly in their cheeks as they
refer to their project as a collaboration with a ``new dictator'':
the ``majority.'' That majority has another name with a long
tradition: the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   This bourgeoisie _ the middle class that is neither upper nor
lower, neither so aristocratic as to take art for granted nor so
poor it has no money to spend in its pursuit _ is now the group
that fills museums, buys books and goes to concerts. But the
bourgeoisie, which began to come into its own in the 18th century,
has also left a long trail of hostility behind it. And it doesn't
take more than a glance at the Komar and Melamid painting to see
what awful taste they think the bourgeoisie still has.
</P>
<P>
   Artistic disgust with the bourgeoisie has been a defining theme
of modern Western culture. Since Moliere lambasted the ignorant,
nouveau riche bourgeois gentleman, the bourgeoisie has been
considered too clumsy to know true art and love (Goethe), a
Philistine with aggressively unsubtle taste (Robert Schumann) and
the creator of a machine-obsessed culture doomed to be overthrown
by the proletariat (Marx and Engels).
</P>
<P>
   Flaubert was perhaps the most ruthless in his disgust, calling
himself a ``bourgeoisophobe.'' He wrote to George Sand: ``Hatred of
the bourgeois is the beginning of all virtue.'' His ``Dictionary of
Received Ideas'' was a roster of bourgeois cliches and know-nothing
attitudes. Seeing the small-town bourgeoisie, Flaubert wrote,
``made me want to vomit and to cry at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, that urge has become an artistic convention. It has
also given birth to generations of avant-gardes that have
single-mindedly sought to shock the bourgeoisie and overturn its
retrograde tastes. In doing so, they have drawn the battle lines
for a century's esthetic battles.
</P>
<P>
   The history of 20th-century concert music, for example, is a
history of avant-gardes reacting against an apparently established
mainstream. Against that bourgeois mass, Arnold Schoenberg and Kurt
Weill set their sights (with often barbed hostility); so did Pierre
Boulez and John Cage. Even the now familiar early-music movement
that began at the turn of this century and championed the revival
of Renaissance and Baroque instruments and styles was, to a certain
extent, an avant-gardist rebellion against bourgeois concert
culture. The critic Martha Bayles has argued that the same
rebellion has driven much pop music: heavy metal, punk, rap and
grunge adopted hostile attitudes toward the bourgeoisie that were
alien to pre-1960s pop and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But what lies behind this widespread hostility? The historian
John Brewer, in his recent book, ``The Pleasures of the
Imagination'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), shows how the bourgeoisie
in 18th-century London ended up displacing both church and
aristocracy as arbiters of taste. Coffee shops became counterparts
of salons; public concerts provided income to composers and
performers; art collectors and dealers became monarchs of
commercial kingdoms. An artist no longer had to genuflect toward a
particular patron. Instead, the arbiters were critics, purchasers,
ticket buyers _ the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments that accompanied these new relationships were
all the more pungent because the artist had often emerged from the
class being courted. The artist may have even been the bourgeois
par excellence, believing that with long schooling, husbanded
talents, careful imitation and energetic innovation, advance might
be possible, even advance out of the middle class with its
commonplace tastes. Bourgeoisophobia among artists may have been a
form of self-disgust.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest paradox of 19th-century bourgeoisophobia is how
little offense it inspired within the bourgeoisie itself. It even
had a certain amount of appeal. The artist's desire to transcend
origins seemed to resonate with the similar ambitions of the
mercantile middle classes. After all, wasn't there always an
element of self-disgust in the aspiring bourgeois? As Flaubert said
of his most bourgeois character, ``Madame Bovary: C'est moi.'' He
saw himself in what he hated; so did his readers.

</P>
<P>
   How justified, though, is the disdain? Not very, argues the
historian Peter Gay in a 25-year, five-book project discussing the
vagaries of bourgeois life. In his recently published ``Pleasure
Wars'' (W.W. Norton), Gay adopts Flaubert's term,
``bourgeoisophobia,'' and shows just how unjustifiably sweeping it
was. Bourgeois industrialists became great patrons; bourgeois
dealers spurred public interest; bourgeois culture even helped give
birth to bourgeoisphobic movements like modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure of Gay's examples, the concepts of a
``bourgeois'' taste or of uniform ``bourgeois'' political interests
begin to seem absurd, stale leftovers from Flaubertian hostility or
Marxist theorizing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. case is particularly revealing. The United States was
the first country largely predicated on such bourgeois ideas as the
absence of inherited status and the importance of entrepreneurial
innovation. This made U.S. bourgeoisophobia rare: who was to be
scorned and on what grounds? Mark Twain, for example, took on all
comers, bourgeois or not, mixing satire with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Even when bourgeoisophobia did develop, a very clear distinction
was made between the bourgeois businessman attacked, say, by
Sinclair Lewis, and the ``common man,'' who was widely championed.
That populist, democratic spirit flourished in the arts in the
1930s and '40s, in the music of Aaron Copland, for example, or the
novels of John Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, U.S. bourgeoisophobia became more sweeping
as various avant-garde movements made the middle class its target.
From the Beats of the 1950s to the performance artists of the '80s
and '90s, the middle class has been accused of narrowness, bigotry,
blindness; and it responded in kind. Even the uproar over grants
made by the National Endowment for the Arts in recent years _
objections to the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe or the
performance art of Karen Finley _ were over works that attacked
conventional, mainstream tastes and values.
</P>
<P>
   But this bourgeoisophobia has also differed from its European
parent. Unlike Flaubert, who disdained the bourgeoisie for its
vulgar artistic tastes, his U.S. counterparts have criticized the
middle class for its elite pretensions. In some cases, the very
idea that gradations of esthetic achievement exist, and that
``art'' exists as opposed to entertainment, are themselves attacked
as antidemocratic, self-indulgent and bourgeois. So in recent years
the bourgeoisie has been attacked from below as well as from above.
Once the bourgeoisie was blamed for enshrining kitsch; now the
bourgeoisie is also blamed for enshrining art. Once the bourgeoisie
was scorned for lacking elite taste; now the bourgeoisie is also
scorned for claiming to possess it.
</P>
<P>
   This atmosphere helped inspire the ``Most Wanted'' project.
Melamid and Vitaly embrace both types of bourgeoisophobia. On one
hand, the artists' poll about taste was a trap: the questions
almost guaranteed mockable results. When asked about the ideal size
of a painting, two main choices are ``dishwasher'' or ``full-size
refrigerator.'' When asked to agree or disagree with statements,
the participants are given examples like: ``Art should be relaxing
to look at, not all jumbled up and confusing.'' Care to disagree
(and declare a preference for confusion and jumble)? And if you
agree, haven't you already become a philistine seeking ``relaxing''
art? The poll's questions _ whether one's favorite painting would
have a blue or green background, nude or clothed people, wild or
tame animals, brush strokes or smooth textures _ already presume a
vulgar way of thinking about painting. It is no accident the
results were so farcical.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Melamid decries elitism. He talks about
modern art as a ``bourgeois business'' and describes museums as the
``castles'' of ``people in power.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sees this project as an odd tribute to majority tastes,
claiming support for ``people's art.'' He and his colleague don't
want to actually dismiss the middle class; instead, they want to
poke fun at both it and its critics, mock both the idea of artistic
standards and the idea that there aren't any. This results in a
peculiar mixture of disgust, irony and emulation.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class taste has always been a bit paradoxical, yearning
for comfort while aspiring to wider knowledge and experience. That
is also the kind of art it often inspired. Now a different kind of
taste is celebrated. Its first canonical painting is ``America's
Most Wanted.'' It is meant to reflect the taste of the bourgeois;
actually, it reflects the taste of the bourgeoisophobe.

NEIL FINN: BROODING ABOUT AN UNCERTAIN WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Misery loves melody. Or so it seemed when the
songwriters Neil Finn, from New Zealand, and Ebba Forsberg, from
Sweden, shared a double bill on Wednesday night at Irving Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Finn's big hits, notably ``Don't Dream It's Over'' by Crowded
House, have been declarations of enduring love, filled with
promises that romance can transcend the mundane. But he also has a
less reassuring side, as he broods over private anxieties and past
sins.
</P>
<P>
   In a set that stretched more than two hours, there was a
distinct gap between Finn's older songs and the dozen new ones he
played from his current album, ``Try Whistling This'' (Work
Group/Sony). The older songs were steeped in 1960s rock like the
Beatles and the Byrds, wrapping poetic imagery around his vows,
while the newer ones are more experimental and oblique.
</P>
<P>
   Finn is one of those songwriters who, following an example set
by the Beatles, like to see how much unlikely material they can
slip into what sounds like a pop tune.
</P>
<P>
   His new songs generally have at least three different sections,
and they might use a lugubrious lounge-piano undertow, sampled and
looped percussion, distorted voices or oddly shaped chromatic
melodies (including the one that makes the song ``Try Whistling
This'' a challenge) alongside folk-rock fingerpicking and pop
nonsense syllables.
</P>
<P>
   The new songs touch on love, but only as one shifting element in
an uncertain world. In ``Sinner,'' Finn contemplates a child he
left behind, as ``conscience plays upon me now''; in ``Loose
Tongue,'' set to a pushy blues guitar riff, he berates himself for
talking too much.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Truth,'' he confesses, ``They say that I am worthy of their
love and attention, but they still don't know the truth,'' while in
``Addicted,'' he wakes up after nodding out, telling someone, ``You
say I was addicted to the drug, but I know when I've had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs drift into their troubled reflections, then rise above
them with expansive melodies. At Irving Plaza, an adoring crowd
sang along whenever Finn offered them a chance, letting the tunes
cushion his misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Forsberg suggests Carole King and Sarah McLachlan midway
through therapy, singing midtempo songs centered on steady piano
chords with touches of country in her voice. She was best when she
wallowed in depression _ ``Nobody falls like I do,'' one song
morosely boasted _ and only halfway convincing when she insisted,
``I must forgive myself.''

COUNT YA LATER, ALLIGATOR
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Counting books are a fun way to get your kindergartner ready for
the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't care if your child can count to 100 and back by 10s,
she'll still get a big laugh out of Judy Sierra's ``Counting
Crocodiles,'' which starts ``On an island in the middle of the
Sillabobble Sea lived a clever little monkey in a sour lemon tree
...''
</P>
<P>
   Seems our little friend has prepared those lip-curling fruits
every which way he can and, frankly, he's tired of them. When he
spies a banana tree on an island across the sea, it's up to the
monkey and his friends, the fox and snail, to deal with a flotilla
of mathematically challenged crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   If the story sounds familiar, the author allows that the story
is based on a Pan-Asian folk tale in which a tricky animal
persuades members of a duller species to form a bridge over water
under the guise of counting them.
</P>
<P>
   The rhyming text is a joy, but the real giggles come from Will
Hillenbrand's illustrations. Anybody who hasn't seen a picture of
six crocs with pink mohawks just isn't living right.

   NEW YORK _ A discreet net curtain shields the Mercer Hotel and
Kitchen from the eyes of curious passers-by. But once the lights
come on, that curtain acts as a scrim, and behind it, a roisterous
performance was in progress last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening Kate Spade and Marie-Anne Oudejans, fashion
designers, were among those swarming the upstairs dining room and
bar. Downstairs in the hangarlike hub of the restaurant, Holly
Solomon, the art dealer, and Brian McNally, the restaurateur, were
among the crowd squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder behind pared-down
refectory tables, sampling bite-size portions of onion tart, black
sea bass with eggplant caviar and chilled berry soup. The next
night, the diners included James Truman of Conde Nast, Gabe Doppelt
of VH1 and Famke Janssen, an actress.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from the latest hot restaurant to open in SoHo? Not
quite. The Mercer Kitchen is still a work in progress. It is not
scheduled to open its reservation book to the public before
mid-August. But that has not stopped a heat-seeking crowd from
zeroing in on its door at Prince and Mercer Streets, eager to be
among the first to experience a highly anticipated new destination.
They have been invited to preview the food _ or in some cases,
simply to check out the space during a cocktail party for a book or
a movie _ weeks and even months before the official opening.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the process known as a soft opening, a gradual
tease in which taste makers _ clothing designers, Hollywood stars,
foodies, fashion magazine editors _ are invited to new restaurants
that are being promoted like nightclubs. It's a two-way street: the
restaurant owners court the attention of the chattering classes,
and the beau monde are eager to arrive early at a hip new
destination.
</P>
<P>
   A string of soft openings preceded the official inauguration of
such hot spots in lower Manhattan as the Bowery Bar, Bond Street
and Cafeteria, generating enough advance press and hyperbolic word
of mouth to ensure that when the curtain really did go up,
reservations were as hard to come by as courtside seats at a
Knicks-Bulls game.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mercer Kitchen, which is a collaboration between hotel
impresario Andre Balazs and celebrated chef Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, the preopening drumroll began in April.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief, used the
restaurant for a book party, held jointly with The New Yorker, for
Michael Roberts, a fashion illustrator and commentator. The kitchen
was barely operational, and Vongerichten, whose other restaurants
include Jean Georges and Vong, had not settled on a menu, but a
glittering crowd descended nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there was even a morsel of food, there already was a
great buzz about the place,'' said Drew Nieporent, a partner in
Montrachet and the TriBeCa Grill and a professed nonbeliever in
soft openings.
</P>
<P>
   Elle magazine used the Mercer Kitchen for a preopening party for
its new fashion and style editor, Sally Singer, who had returned to
New York after several years in London and who found the
soft-opening concept an amusing new twist to Manhattan night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could only work in the double-cell-phone, double-decaf
world of New York, where people are so driven by the excitement of
consumption that they have to be at a new place in the first five
minutes,'' Ms. Singer said. ``The only safe way to go to a place
while it still has any hip credibility is to be there before it
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   As Balazs tells it, the object of staging preopening tasting
dinners is not really to generate buzz, but to train the staff and
refine the menu before a restaurant's official debut. Last week,
the fare was still being altered daily, the staff members had
clearly improvised uniforms from anything black that came to hand,
and the air-conditioning system had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to make mistakes, it's better that they happen
in Philadelphia, so that when, finally, you do step into the
limelight, you're putting your best foot forward,'' Balazs said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. But the sort of crowds invited to his tastings, like
bees to wild clover, hardly qualify as an out-of-town audience. On
the contrary, they're the ones most likely to spread the word if a
restaurant is found lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Or if it's a going to be a hit. ``It's stupid, but people love
to get to know a place before the general public does, so they can
brag to their friends: `I've been there. The food is fantastic,'''
said Nadine Johnson, Balazs' formidably well-connected publicist,
who helped compile the invitations for the tasting dinners. She is
married to Richard Johnson, the Page Six columnist for The New York
Post, one of the places restaurateurs most love to be mentioned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Mercer Kitchen would likely draw an enthusiastic crowd even
without the advance buildup, because of the reputation of its chef,
Vongerichten. It is a hybrid among restaurants: partly the city's
next hot scene, partly a food-lovers' destination.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity chefs and restaurateurs can usually count on their own
panache to draw a stylish crowd, without courting high-profile
drop-ins before the opening. People like Daniel Boulud, who plans
to reopen his Restaurant Daniel in January in the former Mayfair
Hotel, and Keith McNally, the owner of Balthazar, ``bring with them
an aura of prior success as they branch out,'' Paul Wilmot, a New
York fashion publicist, said, adding, ``That's part of their
positive luggage, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   But for many others, whose reputations do not speak so loudly,
the soft opening, often engineered with the help of a publicist's
mailing list, is the way to go. It helped establish Bond Street, a
Japanese-inspired restaurant filled, on the first floor, with
aspiring Masters of the Universe and their dates and, on the second
floor, with fashion insiders like Patrick Robinson and Lainey
Keogh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always catered to the fashion world,'' said Jonathan
Morr, a partner. Morr, who also owns Indochine, the long-running
downtown mecca for the hip, knows a thing or two about courting a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Johnson, the publicist, helped to orchestrate a
Donatella Versace post-fashion-show party at the restaurant last
April, before it opened, the name Bond Street became a household
word, at least in the lofts of trend-setting New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party, the telephoning before the event, the post-party
buzz, all recorded in the gossip columns, are part of the drumbeat
that raises a restaurant's glamour quotient,'' Ms. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago when Tony Fortuna and Charles Palmer opened the
Lenox Room, on Third Avenue near 73rd Street, they agreed to let
Tommy Hilfiger and the Estee Lauder Companies give a party there
the night before its opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``John F. Kennedy Jr. came, and everyone picked up on that,''
said Fortuna, who had previously managed the Monkey Bar. ``My
mother saw the Lenox Room on TV that night, and that made the
business.'' Today his regular crowd, he said, includes Katie
Couric; Mary Boone, the art dealer, and Michael Fuchs of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Attaining _ and sustaining _ that kind of sizzle requires the
endorsement of not only the gossip columnists and the occasional
television report, but also other taste makers, including fashion
designers, whose influence these days extends well beyond skirt
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers tell you how to smell, what linens to sleep on and
which plates to eat off of,'' said Wilmot, who as Vogue's former
public-relations chief helped organize more than his share of
restaurant parties. ``Their presence is almost a ratification of a
restaurant's good taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miller girls always make a room,'' Wilmot added, referring
to the three Miller sisters, duty-free heiresses Alexandra Von
Furstenberg, Pia Getty and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want Oscar and Annette,'' he continued, referring to the
de la Rentas. ``You want Calvin Klein and John Bartlett. And if
you've got them in a room with David Bowie and Iman, and Blaine and
Robert Trump, you win the game, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   But that game is reinvented weekly by a handful of new players,
including a crop of young publicists specializing in night life.
Lizzie Grubman, who by her own account handles publicity for one
new restaurant a month, was the force behind the preopening parties
in June at Cafeteria on Seventh Avenue at 17th Street, a restaurant
owned in part by Victor Alfaro, the fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   Circling and swanning in Alfaro's packed-to-capacity room were
Veronica Webb and Bridget Hall, Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, Ted Fields of
Interscope Records and a cast of more anonymous, but sleekly turned
out twentysomethings. ``I call them the CIAs _ clubbies in
action,'' Ms. Grubman said. ``They are the 100 opinion makers who
talk up each new place and get the word out in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But to talk up the action may sometimes be to sow the seeds of
future disappointment. Almost by definition, what is hot this
moment will be cool six months from now. ``I don't believe in the
pressure of a high-profile opening,'' said Steven Hanson, who owns
a string of long-running popular restaurants including Park Avalon
on Park Avenue South, and the Atlantic Grill and Isabella on the
Upper West Side. Hanson has refused to hire publicists to organize
his previews, for fear they might whip up a frenzy that can be
sustained only for a few months at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get a star-studded evening or two, but where do you
go from there?'' he said. ``It's almost like you're setting
yourself up in the following weeks for a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson contends that the showy crowds attracted by soft
openings are anathema to certain restaurant critics, who begin
trickling in after the initial fanfare has subsided. ``You don't
want to buzz a place to such an extent that it draws attention from
the fare or turns off the food writer,'' said Ms. Johnson, who
remembers being cautioned by one food critic, ``You can be
ambitious as you like, but if you have too many beautiful people or
your waitresses show too much cleavage, you can forget about
earning that third star.''
</P>
<P>
   Balazs brushes off such reservations like specks of soot from
his natty cream suit. In fact, he used the soft-opening strategy _
heretofore largely the province of restaurateurs _ to generate
interest in the Mercer Hotel, too.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of on-again, off-again construction, the last
of the Mercer's 75 rooms was completed in June. But beginning as
early as last December, it discreetly welcomed such
attention-getting guests as Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes,
Heather Graham and fashion designer Alexander McQueen, their visits
duly reported in the tabloids and the fashion press.
</P>
<P>
   Balazs, who is married to Katie Ford, the chief executive of
Ford Models, also owns the stylish, hacienda-style Chateau Marmont
in Los Angeles. He simply spread the word about his hotel's soft
opening by telephoning friends in the fashion and entertainment
industries. By the time the hotel was fully operational, Vogue was
declaring it ``the place to be right now in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural for Balazs to extend the strategy to his
restaurant. A keen student of group psychology, it is his
conviction that you can never attract too many beautiful people _
they are part of what keeps a business percolating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a restaurant, people's sense of who they are is affected by
who is sitting next to them,'' Balazs said. ``And that is the full
explanation of why a restaurant is perceived as hot or not hot.''

LIFEDANCE/GLORIA MCLEAN: PROMISING, YET DISJOINTED, ELEGANCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ingredients were promising for ``Her Father,''
presented by Lifedance/Gloria McLean and Dancers on Thursday night
at the Tenri Gallery in SoHo. Ms. McLean is an intelligent,
imaginative choreographer with long experience in dance. Kazuko
Miyamoto's black-and-white photographs of her elderly nude father
were the inspiration for the dance, providing documentation with a
stark elegance. And Ms. Miyamoto's design of the space and props
and her text, spoken as part of the performance, had a spare
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But those ingredients never quite came together to form a
greater whole. The small stage space looked cluttered, filled with
seven performers, slide projections and the set elements, which
included a hanging chair and rope sculpture, a gauzy kimono with a
soft-toned black-and-white photograph printed in its back and wall
hangings of stones and twigs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLean's involvement in the subject matter was puzzling. She
seemed to be addressing her own father in her opening comments and
in her interaction with Robert Yahner, a father figure of sorts,
throughout the piece. The connections between the two fathers and
between the diffuse movement and apparent theme were never made
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Her Father,'' set to music by Ushio Torikai,
Karlheinz Stockhausen and Erik Satie, also included Joy McEwen,
Rachel Margolis, Rod Rufo, Beth Simons and Ms. Miyamoto. Rufo stood
out for his quietly intense presence. The lighting was by Haen
Naruo, with sound editing by Tim Hatfield.

MONICA MANCINI: MAKING THE MOST OF A FAMILY TIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a ticklish situation. When the child of a
celebrity strikes out on a career as an entertainer, is it best to
emphasize the family tie? Or in hopes of establishing an autonomous
identity, should the young performer pretend the connection either
doesn't exist or is irrelevant?
</P>
<P>
   Monica Mancini, the daughter of Henry Mancini, who made her New
York cabaret debut at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel on
Tuesday evening, has chosen the former path. Her show, which runs
through Aug. 1, is devoted entirely to the music of her father,
whom she refers to throughout the performance as ``Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mancini, who is accompanied by a group that includes Mike
Renzi on piano and her husband, Gregg Field, on drums, can
certainly sing. A formal pop stylist who delivers carefully
measured readings of songs, she rarely strays from the written
note.
</P>
<P>
   In her timbre, she suggests a more laid-back descendant of the
1950s pop belter Toni Arden, who specialized in declamatory
semioperatic ballads. Lie Ms. Arden, Ms. Mancini conveys guarded
tension, even when her voice spreads into a rapid vibrato that
suggests the glamorous vocal equivalent of diamonds flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's show opened with a jazzy, uptempo ``Charade,''
followed by ``Two for the Road,'' and reached a lush plateau with
``Dreamsville.'' Later, Ms. Mancini swung out confidently with ``Le
Jazz Hot.'' Her readings of ``Moon River,'' ``Dear Heart'' and
``Days of Wine and Roses,'' folksy pop ballads with a deeply
nostalgic undertone, held emotion at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   As a performer celebrating a family tie, Ms. Mancini remained
surprisingly reserved. Instead of an intimate portrait of a father
and daughter's shared musical values, the show had the atmosphere
of a carefully prepared recital.

GORE VOICES CONFIDENCE IN RUSSIAN PREMIER'S ECONOMIC POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vice President Al Gore ended two days of talks here
Friday by declaring his confidence that Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko will be able to carry out the fiscal reforms needed to
make the Russian government solvent again.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statements came after two days of get-acquainted meetings
with Kiriyenko, who has replaced former Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin as the senior official on a panel that coordinates the
two governments' work on major U.S.-Russian issues.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Kiriyenko, Gore said the prime
minister had ``full command'' of the economic issues confronting
Russia ``and a very impressive understanding of economic reform and
what must be done in order to advance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts and some Russian officials have said the
government has but three to five months to make major improvements
in its tax system and budget or face another fiscal crisis like the
one that nearly bankrupted the government early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Using political pressure and executive declarations, President
Boris Yeltsin and Kiriyenko managed earlier this month to put in
place most of the laws needed to make financial reforms that have
been demanded by Russia's creditors as the price for continued
investment there. But persuading Russia's stubborn bureaucracy to
carry out the laws is another matter, as is forcing powerful
private interests to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko, who turns 36 on Sunday, seemed crisp and confident at
Friday's meeting with reporters. He dismissed speculation that
Russia's Communist-led Parliament would block reforms, saying the
Parliament's opposition to some of the more onerous tax laws is
normal, considering that many members face re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not pay too much attention to the inevitable
political emotions,'' he said, ``we'll find common approaches and
agreed solutions together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And he handily put down a reporter from the frequently critical
Independent newspaper of Moscow, who asked Gore if the United
States had plans to step in should the Yeltsin government ``prove
unable to cope'' with economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Vice President, this is a favorite subject with the
Independent newspaper,'' Kiriyenko said. ``For the past four months
they have been tensely waiting for collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said the United States and Russia had arrived
at ``an epochal moment in human history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we make the right choices now, there could be great
trouble in the future,'' he said. ``By contrast, if we do make the
right choices now, the future can be very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit produced three agreements that had been prepared in
advance for release during the trip. The most important commits the
United States to spend $3.1 million to help Russian scientists in
so-called closed cities _ towns devoted to nuclear weapons research
and production _ start work on nonmilitary projects.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in one of those cities staged a strike this week,
protesting the government's failure to pay them. One goal of the
U.S.-backed programs is to prevent hostile nations from luring
those scientists to work on clandestine nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another agreement would open a new effort to convert plutonium
from dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors,
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Gore visited Ukraine, a former Soviet republic
in even more dire financial straits than Russia, to encourage its
leaders to adopt capitalist-style economic reforms. The
International Monetary Fund has demanded such reforms before it
will extend a loan that could help prevent the country from sliding
into bankruptcy next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited the concrete-encased Chernobyl nuclear power
reactor, which exploded 12 years ago in what remains the worst
civilian nuclear accident on record. He was promoting efforts to
raise $760 million to build a new concrete tomb for the reactor,
something scientists say is needed to prevent further radioactive
contamination of the area.

 By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, when a money manager tells an investment conference
that he has almost half his portfolio in Asian stocks, his
listeners are apt to snap to attention. Asian markets have been a
minefield since the currency crisis began last summer. The market
indexes for the region, excluding Japan, have fallen an average of
44.9 percent for the past year, and many investors are keeping
their money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Pioneer Emerging Markets manager Mark Madden commanded
notice in June when he told a Morningstar Mutual Fund Conference in
Chicago that 49 percent of his $175 million portfolio was allocated
to Asian stocks. For most of the last three years, Madden has
compiled an impressive record making big bets on these markets: At
the end of 1997, his fund was ranked in the top 20 percent of all
emerging-markets funds for each of the three previous years, with
an average annual return of 9.86 percent, according to Morningstar.
So far this year, the fund has fallen 11.4 percent. But that is
still better than the 12.15 percent average decline for
emerging-markets funds.
</P>
<P>
   A prime reason for this year's tumble is that Madden has built
up his position in Asia as the markets have continued to sell off.
The fund's position in Asia is nearly double the 26 percent stake
of the average fund in its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look to exploit political and economic crises in emerging
markets,'' said Madden, who considers himself a value investor with
a contrarian streak. ``We buy cheap, and then we wait until the
political situation turns positive or the economy recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist at the conference, Scudder Emerging Markets
Growth lead manager Joyce Cornell expressed the more conventional
view of the region, saying: ``We feel the problems are deeply
structural. Asia will survive, but the downturn is in no way
over.'' Only 3 percent of her fund's holdings are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Madden agrees that Asian economies are likely to be ``flat on
their backs'' for the next two to three years, but based on
research he conducted with colleagues at Pioneering Management in
Boston, he contends that there is money to be made in such
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Madden studied 22 selloffs in individual emerging markets
between 1981 and 1997. He found that once investors became
convinced that a market had hit bottom, its stocks, often thinly
traded, could move up rapidly as money began flowing back in and as
investors who bet against the market were forced to cover those
bets. He found that gains in this initial ``confidence rally''
averaged 93 percent. Markets then tended to consolidate and resumed
rising once it became clear that the economy was rebounding or that
a political crisis had passed. Gains averaged 251 percent in the 24
months after a bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Madden expects Asian markets to hit bottom in the next six
months, allowing him to begin selling into a confidence rally. ``If
we can continue to accumulate stock in Asia, we'll make a lot of
money over the next three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madden has played a deft hand in this game before. Early last
year, while visiting Thailand, he became concerned about the
combination of a strong currency, slowing exports, a growing
current account deficit and a squeeze on corporate profit margins.
He then pulled money out of Asia, reallocating large stakes to
Brazil and Mexico, where the economies were beginning to grow
again, and to Israel. Those markets rallied last year, while Asia's
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Two years before that, he moved boldly into Mexico, where the
market had bottomed after devaluation of the peso, and he sold out
before the market faltered again in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to constantly be repositioning the fund in countries
and stocks that have substantial upside and minimal downside,''
Madden said. ``When a market plunges 70 percent, the upside is much
greater than the downside over the next 18 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost seek out areas of high perceived risk. If we've
analyzed the situation properly, when that risk premium declines,
we profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden's approach certainly entails risk, said Bill Rocco, an
analyst at Morningstar Mutual Funds. The Asian crisis could last
longer than Madden expects, or he could dart into the wrong country
at the wrong time, but, so far, he apparently has not done so.
``It's too short a time horizon to judge his move into Asia,''
Rocco said. ``Past history suggests he'll be right over time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Madden considers moving into a battered market, he looks
first at government policy to see if steps have been taken to
return the economy to solid footing. Generally, those include
raising interest rates and devaluing the currency. Ultimately, he
said, such painful medicine brings capital back and makes exports
more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he has been buying in South Korea and Thailand
where, he said, governments are moving to recapitalize their
economies. In April, he bought preferred stock of Samsung Display
Devices of Korea, which makes color monitors and liquid-crystal
displays for computers. The majority of its sales are overseas, and
it has a solid balance sheet. It is selling at 2.2 times its 1998
earnings, a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, he bought K.R. Precision, a Thai maker of
suspensions for hard-disk drives; its customers include Seagate
Technology. In dollars, the stock is off 90 percent from its June
1997 high and is trading at three times 1998 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he picked up Siam City Cement of Thailand. It costs
$110 to $130 per ton of capacity to build a cement plant these
days, Madden said, but the company's stock is trading at $40 per
ton of capacity. ``It really is the buying opportunity of a
decade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madden expects that his picks, which are traded only on foreign
exchanges, will rise 150 percent to 300 percent over the next 18
months. ``Five years down the road, people will look back and say,
`Gee, I should have bought in '98,''' he said.

`LITERALLY: BERNSTEIN': CELEBRATING A COMPOSER'S EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leonard Bernstein, who died in 1990, would have
turned 80 next month, and various aspects of his remarkable life
and achievements have been commemorated in recent weeks, notably at
the Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, it was his education at the Boston Latin School
and Harvard that was celebrated on Thursday evening in ``Literally:
Bernstein,'' the program of the Eos Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall
that ended the festival's Bernstein series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This concert addresses the fact that Leonard Bernstein
received a thorough classical education, and that literature played
an enormous role in his musical life,'' Jonathan Sheffer, Eos'
artistic director, wrote in his program notes.
</P>
<P>
   An artist's education may seem an odd thing to single out for
celebration, since it is so much of a piece with the mature
creator. But when the liberal arts draw scorn in many quarters and
canons of all sorts are thought by some to contaminate culture,
Sheffer's notion is mildly provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Here, after all, was a composer steeped in canons, musical,
literary and otherwise; a composer who took inspiration freely from
his European forebears and from ancient texts. Yet was there ever a
musician more attuned to his own time and place?
</P>
<P>
   It may, in fact, have been the independence of a well-trained
mind that allowed Bernstein to go his own way _ make that ways _
with such assurance, flying in the face of orthodoxy if not always
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And one way was the American way. That was a given in the 1977
work ``Songfest,'' selections from which opened the concert on
Thursday. Its 12 songs draw mainly on American poets, ranging from
the venerable (Whitman and Millay) to the hip (Lawrence
Ferlinghetti), and embody sympathetic and idiomatic responses from
the composer.
</P>
<P>
   Four numbers were presented here, those recently reorchestrated
for small orchestra by Sid Ramin, George Steel and Charles Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's ``To What You Said'' made the strongest impression, in
an excellent reading by Richard Bernstein, a bass-baritone. Philip
Cutlip, a baritone, and Angelina Reaux, a mezzo-soprano, had
appropriate sport with Gertrude Stein's inscrutable ``Storyette
H.M.'' and alternated in works by Ferlinghetti and Julia de Burgos.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's ``Serenade,'' of 1954, followed in an eloquent
performance by the violin soloist, Anne Akiko Meyers, who
persuasively evoked the work's conceit of conversation. The
dialogue became literal in the finale in Ms. Meyers' well-matched
interchange with Roger Shell, the orchestra's principal cellist.
</P>
<P>
   This concertolike work, for all its greater formality and for
all the antiquity of its subject, Plato's ``Symposium,'' is hardly
less American and up-to-date in sound than ``Songfest.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bernstein way was that of his Jewish heritage, which was
represented here by the ballet score ``Dybbuk,'' a 1974 adaptation
of a Yiddish play by the pseudonymous S. Ansky.
</P>
<P>
   This was said to be the first complete performance of the work
since the year of its birth and ``its premiere as a concert
piece.'' But it is not a concert piece, or at least not an entirely
effective one, seeming fragmentary and repetitious at times despite
its many lovely and exhilarating moments.
</P>
<P>
   The male singers were back as soloists, Bernstein again sounding
especially strong. Here, as throughout the evening, the orchestra
responded capably and eagerly to Sheffer's direction, though the
overall sonority was often diffuse.
</P>
<P>
   In all, a stimulating evening.

   STYLISH DENIM
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that the cowboy hat is back, what could be more
natural than the return of the jean jacket? Spotted around town
lately: stylish women in black cocktail dresses or long, silky
skirts, who have accessorized with a denim jacket. Designer denim
is particularly hot. Karl Lagerfeld has included a denim jacket for
the first time in many seasons in his line that will be available
in November. Gucci, Helmut Lang Jeans and the DKNY jeans line are
featuring denim jackets.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Calvin Klein brought back his original jean jacket
from the 1970s for the CK jeans line. And the Gap has knocked off
the Gucci jacket so closely that it is hard to tell the difference.
But Andrea Linnett, a fashion writer at Harpers Bazaar, prefers her
simple old Wrangler jacket, which she wears with a slip dress or
trousers and heels. ``It instantly creates a fresh, sporty look,''
she said.

   PALETTE TO PALATE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The art dealers who pulled up stakes in SoHo for new
galleries in deserted west Chelsea don't miss the throngs of
tourists, but they are nostalgic for one thing: good food. Rather
than wait for an enterprising restaurateur to discover their
up-and-coming art district, a group of dealers took matters into
their own hands. They invested $10,000 each in Bottino, a low-key
but stylish trattoria in a former hardware store at 246 10th Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which serves simple Tuscan fare on an open
backyard terrace, as well as indoors, has already become a
destination for a sleek-looking crowd. It has played host to
post-art-opening parties for Ellsworth Kelly and Mike Kelley. It
was opened six weeks ago by Daniel Emerman and Sandro Prosperi, who
also own Barocco in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer-investors include Barbara Gladstone, Matthew Marks
and the owners of Metro Pictures. In return for their stakes, each
gallery gets a food tab worth $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting hungry!'' Ms. Gladsone said. ``We wanted a place
to socialize that was intelligently set up but without
pretension.''
</P>
<P>
   The new restaurant is across the street from the Getty _ a gas
station, that is, not the museum.

   4 O'CLOCK PRETZEL BREAK
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are trends in hemlines and trends in footwear
and, just as surely, there are trends in snack foods. The latest
must-have accessory for many in the fashion flock is Rold Gold's
new Honey Mustard pretzels _ 99 cents for a fat-free, four-ounce
bag. ``They are on every desk at 4 o'clock,'' Pixie Yates, a
downtown designer, said.
</P>
<P>
   At Frou by Paige Novick, another fashion design house, they
can't get enough of the pretzels. ``All the women in the office eat
the pretzels all day,'' Ms. Novick said. Philosophizing about their
appeal, she added, ``The feminine shape and delicate line represent
the ultimate snack.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular snack is Parrillo Bars, a power bar sold in
health clubs. ``If you go to events, all the girls about town have
them in their bags, right there next to the cell phone,'' Kimberly
Ryan, special projects editor at Vogue, said. ``Nobody eats meals
anymore, they just snack.'' And for those low-energy lulls between
snacks? Caffeinated water like Water Joe is the answer.

   CANNED MESSAGES
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, Miller Lite has been sold in seven different
cans that invite the guzzler to establish a meaningful relationship
with his beer. One can has a Cal-O-Meter on it, a scale to show the
calories consumed, from zero ounces (zero calories) to 12 ounces
(128 calories). Another can has a space where a drinker can write
his name, address and phone number _ in case the can gets lost.
Some cans note, ``Not every can of Miller Lite contains the same
number of bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   The arch labeling is pitched to the postcollegiate crowd,
beer-drinkers weaned on Lettermanesque humor. It is Miller Brewing
Co.'s response to a flatness in sales, said Gina Shaffer, marketing
communications manager for Miller Lite in Milwaukee. She said the
labeling is ``focused on 21- to 28-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller Lite, introduced in 1975, had its peak year in 1990, said
Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketers Insight, an
industry newsletter. A six-pack of 12-ounce cans is $4.50.

   LOS ANGELES _ Warren Littlefield, master kidder and actor
wannabe, was introduced the other day as the network president most
likely to find positives in the most dire of circumstances. Facing
a roomful of critics ready to pounce on NBC's proliferation of
newsmagazines and its breezy dismissal of cable competitors,
Littlefield cued up a video to comically drill holes into the
premise that after ``Seinfeld's'' departure, he was this close to
stepping in front of a moving train. By KEN PARISH PERKINS. Story

get many of the advantages of the more-expensive one without paying
the extra bucks. What the buyer lacks, of course, is the snob
appeal of the more-expensive brand. But if value for money is what

 CELEBRATING ISRAEL'S 50th ANNIVERSARY: A LIVELY MULTICULTURAL(js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The three modern-dance choreographers who
presented premieres as part of the annual International
Choreographers Commissioning Program at the American Dance Festival
here on Thursday all grew up in countries built by immigrants.
Brenda Angiel was born in Argentina, Inbal Pinto in Israel and
Barak Marshall in the United States. For all their differences,
history and circumstances brought them together at the festival to
present highly distinct experimental works on an evening that was
billed as a salute to Israel's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall moved from his native Los Angeles to Israel in 1994,
after graduating from Harvard. His father is American and his
mother is Margalit Oved, who was a leading dancer in the famed
Israeli Yemenite troupe, Inbal Dance Theater, and was later a
distinguished choreographer and teacher at UCLA Those who have seen
Miss Oved in her own dance pieces over the years in New York and
elsewhere would not be surprised that the dramatic presence she
brought to Marshall's premiere as a performer is as fierce as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Pinto, Marshall directs his own dance troupe in Israel.
Miss Angiel, known as Brenda Angielczyk when she studied and
presented choreography in New York in 1990-1991, directs her
company in Argentina. All three choreographers are Jewish, but this
program, called ``Celebrating Israel's 50th Anniversary,'' could be
seen chiefly as a timely tribute of convenience. If anything, it
suggested that heritage was to be treated or ignored according to
esthetic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Angiel's piece offered a super-polished image of dancers
suspended in the air. Ms. Pinto created a clever surreal fable, and
Marshall presented a collage of exciting athletic movement and
charismatic solos.
</P>
<P>
   Each work was choreographed during the festival's six-week
summer school on the Duke University campus. Since 1987 the
International Choreographers Commissioning Program has provided
rehearsal space and dancers for choreographers from abroad. The
dancers are drawn from the students and other foreign
choreographers attending the festival school.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In ``South, Wall and After,'' Ms. Angiel made striking use of
what is now a tired device: dancers harnessed to ropes and
suspended in the air. The original twist was to suggest a
bird's-eye view of performers, creating the illusion that the
viewer was seeing pedestrians on a pavement below. The backdrop by
Anna Wirth and Frank Sheets suggested gray bricks or paving stones,
depending on how Ms. Angiel experimented with perspective. At
times, the dancers looked as if they were perpendicular to a
bricked wall. The structure of the choreography became formal, with
dancers in unison or in staggered repetitive permutations that sent
them flying into the air or combining steps on the wall within a
pendulum swing. There was a stunning moment when a trio engaged in
the aerial equivalent of synchronized swimming expanded into a
group of five.
</P>
<P>
   Yet suddenly, the choreography might focus on the dancers (Oren
Bar-Noy, Michelle Knudson, Maria Emilia Cominguez, Megan Mazarick,
Domenico Giustino and Edgardo Mercado) in pairs. The viewer became
a voyeur, looking at embraces from an imaginary window above.
</P>
<P>
   A riveting duet for a man and woman, often head-down in their
twisting and tumbling entanglements, opened the work. The beauty of
the piece is its ability to operate on two levels: one sees the
reality of the movement and believes in the illusion it creates.
The eclectic musical score, created by Ms. Angiel and Christian
Cherry, was rhythmically apt, ranging from Astor Piazzolla to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Frieda and Rosa,'' Ms. Pinto used a Cuban recording by
Esteban Salas and the theme from Charlie Chaplin's film
``Limelight.'' The action on stage was a charming surprise: Five
women in Ms. Pinto's Victorian pleated skirts moved as doll-like
figures on a music box. Four moved on platforms under their skirts
and towered over the fifth. All twitched or undulated and puffed up
their cheeks in a charming image. But these may have also been the
ghosts of elderly aunts of a thoroughly modern pair of young women
sitting on a red bench, perhaps the Frieda and Rosa of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Hardy and Ariane Malia Reinhart (Elizabeth Swallow and
Summer Belnap in an alternating cast) took up the second half of
the piece. They moved at top speed in a sitting dance that
consisted of leg and arm movements so swift that one could barely
follow the sequence. As these permutations became more complex, the
relationship of the two women evolved into sisterly and playful
swipes.
</P>
<P>
   There were absurdist but not illogical touches. The last had one
of the Victorians entering to take a photo of the two women in the
dark. The excellent cast also included Ms. Belnap, Ms. Swallow,
Adrienne Longenecker, Stephanie Nugent and Liliana Tasso.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Wives' Tale,'' set to Romanian and klezmer music,
Marshall suggests that experimental and ethnic dance are not
mutually exclusive. Ms. Oved enters with lighted candles on her
head and after she passes, this image from a Yemenite wedding is
succeeded by a dance for six women with lighted candles on their
heads; it is lyrical and flowing, contrasting with units that fuse
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oved is the charismatic storyteller, resonant in her voice
and gestures. She holds the audience in her palm when she speaks of
two grandmothers whose book of wisdom cannot be found in the
library because ``I swallowed it.'' As a choreographer, Marshall
knows how to move 17 dancers around as a group. His highly
energetic natural movement is grounded in deep plies, followed by
leaps and high swings of the leg. English, Arabic, Yiddish and
Hebrew were the tongues heard on stage. ``The Wives' Tale'' is a
fine quilt, not quite a woven tapestry.

A MERGER NIGHTMARE ON FASHION STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 26)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate mergers are all the rage, what with Daimler-Benz
buying Chrysler, Bertelsmann swallowing Random House, and other
high-stakes marriages in banking, pharmaceuticals and
telecommunications. In the fashion industry, unions of famous
labels have long seemed highly unlikely, given that designers
consider themselves brilliant originals, whose artistic visions
could not possibly be merged into one entity.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent acquisition by Prada of a 9.5 percent stake of
the publicly traded stock in Gucci, its archrival in the Italian
high-fashion business, has changed old assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the start of merger mania on the catwalks? Who
would be a likely partner for whom? Most important, what would
their new perfumes be named? Below, some spurious speculations on
the new landscape of a post-merger style world.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flash flood and severe thunderstorm warnings were issued Friday
for parts of Arizona as moisture continued to stream into the
Southwest from the tropics. On Saturday, a high-pressure system
building over the southern California Coast at high altitudes will
curtail the flow of moisture into the Southwest, limiting the scope
and intensity of storms. Nonetheless, isolated storms fueled by
residual moisture will develop, particularly over the southern
Rockies, where the uneven heating of mountains and valleys promotes
currents of rising air.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will erupt over parts of eastern
Colorado, eastern Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas as moist winds
blowing from the east just behind a stationary front are forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. A disturbance at high altitudes will
also provide lift for showers and storms. Farther east,
thunderstorms may become heavy from southeast Kansas to southern
Missouri and northern Arkansas as surging humid air from the Gulf
of Mexico meets the stationary front.
</P>
<P>
   A risk of thunderstorms will extend east near the stationary
front to the Carolinas as hot, humid air converges along the front.
Storms, however, will tend to form in isolated clusters, dousing
one area but missing others.
</P>
<P>
   A dry air mass will soothe the northeast quadrant of the nation
Saturday. Isolated showers and thundershowers are possible, mainly
over the mountains of northern New England and parts of the central
Appalachians, as a weak trough of low pressure at jet stream levels
pivots east from the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden Floods
</P>
<P>
   The risk of flash floods was heightened Friday in parts of the
West as slow-moving thunderstorms, fueled by tropical moisture
streaming northward, blossomed in the heat of the afternoon. The
places at greatest risk were determined mainly by topography.
Canyons and mountain passes in the Rockies are notorious for sudden
summer floods. With steep slopes to channel runoff from heavy rain
into gorges below, small creeks and low-lying beds called dry
washes (because they are usually dry) can fill with surging water
in a very short time, sometimes catching unsuspecting travelers
off-guard.

TREASURY PRICES FALL AS STOCK MARKET STEADIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices declined Friday, as the stock market
steadied itself from a sharp falloff the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds were also held back by some cautious investors who
speculated that with the election of Japan's foreign minister to
president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, the Japanese
government might take further action to pull the economy out of a
slump. Any such effort would make Treasury securities less
attractive as a safe haven for foreign investors fleeing Asia's
crises.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32, to 106 9/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
5.68 percent from 5.66 percent on Thursday. A week ago, the yield
was 5.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market over the near-term is very likely to remain in
its recent trading range as a slowing economy, subdued inflation
and financial fragility abroad will keep the Fed from lifting
interest rates, while at the same time strong consumer spending and
torrid housing activity clearly reduce the chance of any ease in
monetary policy anytime soon,'' said Donald Fine, chief market
analyst for Chase Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will soon turn their attention to Tuesday's report on
consumer confidence and the government's first estimate of gross
domestic product in the second-quarter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB
Capital Management, a Washington-investment firm, said he expected
the GDP report to show little if any growth in the quarter,
compared with the first quarter's rate of 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that we may have a second quarter of little of no
growth should lower bond yields to the 5.5 percent area and improve
fixed-income market pyschology to a substantial degree,'' he said.

   SHOOTING AT THE CAPITOL
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SHOOTING _ WASHINGTON _ Four people were shot, and one
possibly killed, when a lone gunman somehow managed to get by
security in the U.S. Capitol building Friday and shot an
unidentified woman, according to U.S. Capitol police. The gunman
was also shot and injured, apparently in a shoot-out with police
near the House Majority Whip's office in the Capitol. The incident
caught hundreds of tourists and Capitol workers looking forward to
a normal winding down of a Friday in the nation's capital by
surprise. The metal detector at the entrance near the Majority
Whip's office sounded when the gunman went through, followed by a
hail of bullets. Developing. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With SHOOTING-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ According to eyewitnesses in
House Majority Whip Thomas DeLay of Texas' office in the Capitol
Building, the gunman chased an unidentified woman into the offices
and began shooting. What followed was complete chaos. (Harlan, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With SHOOTING-TOURISTS _ WASHINGTON _ This time of year, the
U.S. Capitol Building is teaming with thousands of tourists each
day. The last thing they expect to experience or witness is a
shooting. We talk to some of them. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With SHOOTING-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ Getting into the Capitol
with a gun is extremely difficult. The public is only allowed into
the Capitol through a few entrances and everyone _ except members
of the House and Senate _ must pass through metal detectors similar
to those found at airports. Large bags must be placed on an X-ray
machine that shows a video of their contents. Staff members and
journalists are allowed in some entrances barred to the public, but
they still must pass through a metal detector and have their bags
searched by hand. That wasn't enough Friday afternoon. (Lipman, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With SHOOTING-HISTORY _ WASHINGTON _ A primary reason that
Friday afternoon's shooting was so surprising to many people is
that the U.S. Capitol Building is viewed as one of the most secure
public building complexes in the world. But Friday's incident was
not unprecedented. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND _ BELFAST, Ireland _ It took the tragic deaths of three
boys to ease the worst tensions in this war-torn nation in years.
Tensions that were expected to wither following a decisive vote for
one Ireland this spring. President Clinton has added a stop-over
here on his return trip from Russia in September to add his voice
to those pleading for unity and calm. But some significant
questions need to be answered, not the least of which is: Has the
peace process, having weathered this latest crisis, regained
momentum? (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   JERICHO-CASINO _ JERICHO, West Bank _ This is the oldest and
lowest city in the world. But, is it lucky? In the dusty expanse of
desert across the street from one of the oldest Palestinian refugee
camps, hundreds of workers are building a casino hotel aimed
largely at tempting Israelis to come gamble _ something they cannot
do next door in Israel. It's a business venture that is sure to
cause political waves among both Palestinians and Israelis even as
it could turn a big profit. The casino project is headed by an
Austrian firm with the consent of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority. But, it is widely disliked by the Palestinians who live
in the refugee camp and famous biblical town nearby. The problem is
not that Palestinians will not be allowed to gamble there. Rather,
they see gambling and the western culture it represents as a threat
to their Islamic values. Some even object to the high profile the
10-story hotel will cut amid the peaceful town of 15,000. Many of
their arguments would be recognizable to Americans who have heard
the religious opposition to casino gambling in their own country.

   RUSSIA-COSSACKS _ ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The feared Cossacks
ride again? Russia's tradition-steeped warrior caste is undergoing
a revival of sorts, after being submerged for decades by the Soviet
Union. St. Petersburg officials plan to use the Cossacks to patrol
city parks and assist regular police in fighting crime -- sort of
the Guardian Angels, Russo-style. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   HEALTH _ WASHINGTON _ Despite a veto threat from the White
House, Republicans are rushing to the House floor with legislation
they brought forward only a week ago to respond to Americans'
complaints about health plans. (Carr, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   FARM-AID _ WASHINGTON _ Just two years after the nation's
farmers were put on the path to independence from subsidies and
price supports, the concept of the ``Freedom to Farm'' act is
coming under a severe test in the drought of 1998 as lawmakers and
the president rush to provide aid. (Malone, Cox News Service).

possibility of extraterrestrial microbes infecting Earth in samples
collected by space missions involve two moons of Jupiter, Europa

   SIXMONTHS _ On the eve of his official installation as president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Martin Luther King
III talks about the six months that have passed since he was named

   TEXAS-DAMS -- Substandard dams pose a growing threat to people
and property in Texas, and the state's inspection program to keep
track of the problem is woefully inadequate, according to a report

NEW YORK ARTIST CONDUCTS HIS STRING SOLOS IN WOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHUSHAN, N.Y. _ Most people are eager to share family photos.
Geoffrey Ovington is a host with three-dimensional treasures. He
wants you to see different planks of wood.
</P>
<P>
   He's in his studio, a splendidly renovated space on the second
floor of a rustic red barn, the rolling Taconic Mountains in
southern Vermont framing the landscape to the east. Moving about
like a youngster showing off birthday presents, Ovington goes from
one piece of wood to the next.
</P>
<P>
   For the artisan with an international reputation for handmade
string instruments, the planks of maple, pear and spruce represent
the staffs of life. He removes a pillow-case-size piece of wood
from a shelf, caressing the surface with his muscular hand, an
appreciative smile creasing his round face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pear wood, it's wonderful for cellos,'' he explains.
``Cellos are the only instruments for which I'll use pear wood.
It's much more common for me to work with maple. Some of the maple
I have here was imported at the turn of the century by Italian
violin makers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this curly maple,'' Ovington adds, removing another
plank that, to the untrained eye, looks not unlike the pear plank.
``Doesn't it have just a magnificent grain? This is a beautiful
piece of wood, just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The plank, which will be cut and scraped and cut again before it
is etched and varnished, will become even more beautiful in
Ovington's capable hands. The 53-year-old has been creating
instruments for a quarter of a century, and during that time has
become a much sought-after maker of violins, violas and cellos.
</P>
<P>
   From the Philadelphia Orchestra to the Vienna Philharmonic to
the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie, there are few world-class
symphonies or philharmonics without at least one musician playing
an Ovington. And in Victoria, British Columbia, a quartet has paid
him a high and rare honor, calling itself the Ovington String
Quartet because two of the four play his instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he toils in almost total anonymity in Shushan, a hamlet
northeast of Albany, known better in concert halls in Milan, Munich
and Vienna than in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month he completed his 200th instrument, a viola
for Cecily Friedman in Callicoon, N.Y., one of Ovington's few
amateur clients. It was a milestone that warranted a toast with
glasses filled, for he has reached a point where even he will agree
he has a substantial body of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that before you sum up a maker's work,
they better have made a couple hundred instruments,'' he says.
``It's really not fair to judge a maker by basing your judgment on
one or two instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a watchful parent he has carefully kept track of the 200
Ovingtons in circulation, noting for the record that four have
succumbed to unfortunate fates. One was stolen, one was destroyed
in a ship accident, one was stepped on in an orchestra pit, and one
was pushed under a car in its case by a toddler just as her mother
was backing out of the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   A work of art, an acclaimed hand-made instrument worth $10,000
to $15,000 and increasing in value all the time, crushed into
splinters in the blink of an eye. Notes Ovington, ``Those are the
only four I know of that have been taken out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 196 are in musicians' hands, bringing pleasure to
the makers and lover of classical sounds on at least three
continents.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ovington take a chestnut-handled knife to the deep-set
rim of a new viola, it is easy to imagine this same setting two
centuries earlier. There are no high-tech tools in his studio; the
maker uses hand-sized knives and planes just as the European
craftsmen once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one notable exception,'' Ovington interjects, pointing to
the hi-fi system in the corner of his studio. ``If this was the
18th century, I wouldn't be able to listen to NPR (National Public
Radio) every minute of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The central Massachusetts native first realized he wanted to be
an instrument maker while he was studying English at Clark
University in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when I saw a real instrument for the first time,'' he
explains. ``It belonged to my girlfriend at the time. It was a
beautiful violin, with mouthwatering varnish that made me want to
touch it and stroke it. I thought, `I want to make those.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always liked classical music, along with rock and other
kinds of music. I guess I was ripe, because my reaction to her
violin was immediate. I thought this is the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It took almost six years for Ovington to act on his revelation.
After college he taught English and remedial reading in the New
York City public school system, a job he took to avoid being
drafted for the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew it wasn't what he wanted to do. ``I kept feeling
that I was being sucked in. I had other reasons pushing me into
teaching. My heart wasn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he listened to his inner voice. He bought a how-to manual for
making a violin, and paid a visit to the Metropolitan Music Co. in
New York City to buy the wood he needed. He struggled, he
remembers, yet in 1973 he finished his first violin, an instrument
he dismisses today as ``a total amateur effort.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, though. At last he was doing what he wanted to
do, what he believes he was meant to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ovington also started taking violin lessons, for practical as
well as artistic reasons. ``I decided if I wanted to build them I
had to learn to play them. I ended up making a lot of friends in
the violin field, and it's turned out to be a real blessing for me
as an instrument maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovington is devoted to classical music, and he and partner
Bonnie Hoag, regularly host string quartets in their barn,
nurturing music appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   It both saddens and angers him to report that the percentage of
people who can read music in the United States is roughly 4
percent, compared with 76 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've abandoned teaching music. We'd rather have a $50,000
scoreboard than fund a music program,'' says Ovington, the words
rushing out as he speaks with passion. ``We don't spend a dime on
string programs in most of our schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody bothers to tell kids how to like classical music. You
can't just expose them, they have to be led to it. We're failing.
Music is a big thing and we're throwing it out the window. The
general public is ignorant of the value of music.''

DIRECT FROM PARIS: THE RUNWAY EXTENDS TO THE LIVING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 26)  
(lh) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was as if this were what John Galliano had always had in
mind: an ABC-TV prime-time special that would demand all his
creativity to keep millions of Americans enthralled from 9 to 11
p.m. A runway show that could go toe-to-toe with ``Seinfeld''
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Galliano seized his moment. ``The World Fashion
Premiere From Paris,'' which featured the haute couture shows of
last week, reached its zenith with Galliano's presentation for
Christian Dior. To the throbbing beat typical of a Galliano
orchestration, a train, carrying Pocahontas and handsome braves
atop its engine, burst through a red scrim, and came to a halt
inches from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did an admirable job of bringing the elite haute couture to
the masses. But anyone who has sat through a live 30-minute runway
show knows that two hours is already too long. The producers, Anne
Archer and her husband, Terry Jastrow, distinguished their program
by eschewing the fast cutaways, chaotic behind-the-scenes footage
and model mania that have become commonplace on cable. For the most
part, they kept the hammer right where it belonged, on the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is now a general assumption _ one that is close to
calcifying into fact _ that fashion cannot stand on its own two
feet. Each discourse must be cloaked in pop culture, here in images
of Puff Daddy or the Princess of Wales, or in a cutaway shot of a
stone-faced Peter Jennings announcing the murder of Gianni Versace
a year ago. Travelogues were another unnecessary crutch. Do
Americans watching a program on couture really need to know that
the Champs Elysees is the most important street in the world?
</P>
<P>
   More informative would have been an excursion into the workrooms
of Lesage, the legendary company that supplies much of the
breathtaking embroidery for the couture.
</P>
<P>
   The audience need not be pandered to. As this program proved,
fashion represents itself well on its own, thank you, whether it is
educating, prescribing or entertaining _ the thrust of ``Paris
Premiere.''
</P>
<P>
   There was far too much naivete in the commentary that
accompanied the generous showcasing of designers' work. It was
surprising given that the program was written by William Middleton,
the former Paris bureau chief for W magazine. Where, for example,
was that living legend of a couturier Yves Saint Laurent, as
Isabella Rossellini, who was the co-host of the program with Ms.
Archer, intoned that Gaultier was the ``most French'' of
couturiers? Saint Laurent's absence aside, was this a cagey
reference to the fact that almost half of the couturiers featured
were not French?
</P>
<P>
   The fashion professionals scattered throughout the program to
provide commentary might have shed some light had they been asked
challenging questions. Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of
Harper's Bazaar, managed to shine by answering what might be seen
as a basic question. Eyebrows across America must have shot up when
Ms. Tilberis, when first asked, deemed it unprofessional to comment
on her favorite couture shows. Unprofessional? Bad diplomacy,
maybe. Boring television, definitely. Eventually, Ms. Tilberis
allowed that she thought the best shows were Jean Paul Gaultier and
Chanel. Here a fashion expert might have noted that career fashion
editors must be career diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   A fatuous comment by Ms. Archer was also in need of deflation:
``I think they all love to do a Chanel show because they love the
clothes,'' she said, referring to the many supermodels on hand for
Chanel. Viewers could probably have seen through that one. Earlier,
Ms. Archer had started the puff ball rolling by saying that
Donatella Versace's first couture show had gone well, it seemed,
because the audience was applauding. Some perspective, please!
Fashion audiences always applaud at the end of a show.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the camera loved some collections more than others. The
work of Gaultier and Valentino was breathtaking and accessible. And
if the camera was lying, it did not matter, because fashion and its
colorful personalities benefited from being in America's living
rooms during coveted viewing hours.
</P>
<P>
   The program garnered an overnight Nielsen rating of 5.2 and a
share of 9, according to ABC, which means that it attracted 9
million viewers in 40 major markets. It did better than programs
like the canceled series ``Prey'' in the same slot.

GOOD YIELD IS GETTING MUCH HARDER TO FIND

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26)  
 (af)  
 By PEGGY EDERSHEIM KALB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many stock fund portfolios seem sorely lacking in dividends
these days. With the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index paying an
aggregate yield of just 1.24 percent, even funds that bill
themselves as growth-and-income offerings seem far more weighted
toward growth than income.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the bull market keeps roaring, many shareholders
are perfectly happy with the situation, much preferring a capital
gain to a dividend that is taxable as ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   But other shareholders, noting that shares are trading at
historically high valuations, want yield as a safety factor.
Dividends are paid regardless of movements in price and permit
investors to get some money off the table with each payout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that is hard to remember in this
kind of a stock market is that you need to distinguish between what
is knowable and what is not knowable,'' said Janet McKinley,
president of the Income Fund of America, a $22 billion stock fund
whose goal is to produce income for shareholders. ``The only thing
you can know with some degree of certainty when you look at stocks
is the stream of dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   But that stream has slowed to a trickle, and the funds that
traditionally pay the most in dividends, like utilities and real
estate investment trusts, may be sacrificing capital appreciation
in today's market. The stock prices of REITs are down about 10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The average utility fund yields just 2.33 percent; indeed,
Merrill Lynch has the only utility fund yielding more than 5
percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. A.
Michael Lipper, the firm's president and chief executive, warned
that many individual investors might think twice before giving up
the diversification of a more general fund for the
not-so-impressive yield of utility funds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are growth-and-income funds, in which
managers are supposed to be seeking a balance between yield and
capital appreciation. The group includes warhorses like the Mutual
Series funds, which yield only 3 percent, and Vanguard Windsor II,
at 1.9 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Yield is also elusive in the bond markets. Thirty-year Treasury
bonds are yielding just 5.68 percent, near their historical low,
and even high-risk junk bonds are paying relatively skimpy interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Among equity-income funds, which invest a minimum of 65 percent
of their assets in dividend-paying securities, Heartland Value
Plus, a small-cap value-oriented fund managed by William Nasgovitz
and Patrick Retzer, has consistently strong yields. The 12-month
yield, at 3.62 percent, is small by historical standards but is
more than twice that of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   And the fund has also managed to perform in the top 10 percent
in its category over the last three years, with an average
annualized total return of 20.85 percent through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nasgovitz, who called Heartland Value Plus a more conservative
version of the well-known Heartland Value fund, said the emphasis
on yield was intended to make the fund more defensive than its
sibling in a down market.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 61.4 percent of the assets were in common
stocks, 10.8 percent in REITs, 24.9 percent in corporate and
convertible bonds, 2 percent in preferred stocks and less than 1
percent in cash.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund's favorite high-yielding stocks, with a dividend
of 6.5 percent, is the Interstate Energy Co., based in Madison,
Wis., which just merged with two Iowa utilities. Retzer expects the
stock, which closed at $30.625 on Friday, to reach the mid- to high
$30s in 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get yield into a portfolio is to buy shares of
balanced funds, which tend to have a fixed allocation of stocks and
bonds. Mark Mullin, chief investment officer for Diversified
Investment Advisors, called this ``a common sense approach'' that
provided exposure to the primary asset classes, but he added that
``if you truly wanted to maximize income, balanced funds would not
be the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   His firm's Diversified Investment Balanced fund is a standout
among such funds, with a yield of 5.55 percent over 12 months and
average annual return of 17.1 percent over the last three years,
putting it in the top 25 percent of its group. The subadviser of
the fund, which has $451 million in assets, is the Institutional
Capital Corp. of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has 59 percent of its assets in equities, 40 percent in
fixed-income instruments _ typically triple-A rated government and
agency bonds _ and 1 percent in cash. A current stock favorite is
General Motors, considered a reorganization play, for which the
fund has a price target of $84. It closed on Friday at $71.06, with
a yield of 2.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on the theme is asset-allocation funds, which give
portfolio managers more latitude to switch their amounts of stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   One such fund is Income Fund of America, which had a 4.1 percent
yield for the 12 months ended Thursday, and has been in the top 25
percent of its peer group in total return over the last five years.
Since its inception at the end of 1973, the fund, which is marketed
by American Funds, has returned 14.3 percent a year, just a
fraction of a point below the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a get-rich-slow kind of person,'' said Ms. McKinley, the
fund's president, adding that the fund's strategy meant that ``you
get to sleep at night.'' As of June 30, the fund was about 60
percent in equities (including convertibles) and 14 percent in
cash, with the balance in corporate and government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKinley declined to identify stock picks under
consideration but said the fund's managers looked for companies
that generate a lot of cash flow, pay dividends and in some cases
buy back shares. ``Many of the banks and telecoms around the world
fit that bill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any hope that yields will rise? Kenneth Heebner,
manager of CGM Realty, a perennially popular REIT fund with a
12-month yield of 4.51 percent, contends that REIT dividend growth
will remain strong, though share prices are now depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner has more than half of his fund in office and industrial
REITs because that sector, with its long-term leases, is more
defensive than higher-yielding hotel REITs.

 (ART ADV: Graphic on three airlines' frequent flier miles is being
sent to NYT graphics clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.)  
 (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines recently notified the 30 million members of
its frequent-flier program that award redemption levels for certain
tickets would rise next Feb. 1. An upgrade from coach to first
class on a domestic flight will require 30,000 miles, up from
20,000, for example, and a business-class ticket to Europe or Latin
America will require 90,000, up from 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   To clarify these and other adjustments, American has printed a
handy chart _ detailing 196 separate redemption requirements in 11
different categories.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to believe for those who think frequent-flier
plans are already too complex, but these are the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, the country's six largest airlines, which
collectively carry 70 percent of all air traffic, are to combine
their frequent-flier plans into three separate alliances. Plans
that seem difficult to follow now will seem simplistic once members
of one program can redeem tickets in another.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines call the new links a boon for consumers, who will
be able to accumulate and redeem mileage on more than one carrier.
But analysts and consumer advocates, who already say frequent-flier
miles are not that great a deal, worry that they will shortly
become a worse deal.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much worse is hard to say, because the airlines have
been reluctant to describe exactly how the new arrangements will
work.
</P>
<P>
   American, the country's second-largest airline and a unit of AMR
Corp., and U S Airways, the sixth largest, are set to begin their
alliance on Saturday. United Airlines, the country's No. 1 carrier
and a unit of UAL Corp., and Delta Air Lines, No. 3, are to start
offering reciprocal rights in each other's frequent-flier programs
Sept. 1. The details for each of these alliances remain sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, the country's fourth-largest carrier, and
Continental Airlines, No. 5, were first to announce their alliance,
in January. Six months later, they have not even said when their
joint program will start.
</P>
<P>
   After a bumpy start in the early 1980s, frequent-flier programs
have become a huge success for the airlines. About 75 million
people around the world now belong to at least one program.
Consumers annually divert billions of dollars _ to credit cards
affiliated with the programs, or to goods and services tied to such
plans _ to obtain more miles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an estimated three trillion miles are waiting to be
redeemed, the equivalent of about 110 million tickets at the
average redemption level _ or more than half what the domestic
industry sells in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines earn $1.5 billion a year simply selling miles _ at
2 cents apiece _ to marketing partners like hotels and rental car
companies, according to Randy Petersen, the editor and publisher of
Inside Flyer, a magazine that monitors frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   For that, they give away seats that, according to the industry's
calculations, probably would have flown empty.
</P>
<P>
   Each new alliance appears to be slightly different. American and
U S Airways say members of their plans will be able to redeem miles
for tickets on each other. Eventually, fliers with memberships in
both plans will be able to pool their miles for tickets from either
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   United and Delta members will be able to designate which program
they want to credit with miles they earn on individual flights. The
airlines say they will soon announce when United fliers can cash in
miles for tickets on Delta and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The reciprocity will be limited, however, to the airlines'
domestic flights. And there will be no pooling of miles between the
two programs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Northwest and Continental? ``Until we make a formal
announcement of when the program begins, we will not be forthcoming
with details with how the program will operate,'' said Sara
Anthony, a spokeswoman for Continental.
</P>
<P>
   When will that announcement be? Ms. Anthony would not say.
</P>
<P>
   One of the airlines plan to address the biggest consumer
complaint about frequent-flier programs: that free seats are not
available when people want to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say the number of new destinations added by the
alliances will relieve the pressure on the seat supply. But many
critics say the alliances will aggravate the problem because more
people will be competing for the same choice destinations at the
same peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   American said its decision to raise mileage requirements for
certain tickets had nothing to do with its alliance with U S
Airways. But some rivals disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Jilek, Delta's director of relationship marketing,
said American was forced to act because by pooling its program's
miles with those of U S Airways, more people would suddenly be
eligible for free tickets on American.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, Ms. Jilek said, was not planning to raise its award
redemption levels, a view echoed by United, Continental and U S
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue: United, American and Northwest require their
miles to be used within certain lengths of time, or they will
expire. But their respective partners _ Delta, U S Airways and
Continental _ all offer miles that do not expire (though Delta
requires members to use the airline once every three years) and say
they have no plans to change.
</P>
<P>
   That will create some interesting choices. A frequent traveler
on United, for example, might be tempted to credit all his miles to
Delta, to keep them from expiring. But if he does so, he will lose
his elite mileage status when he flies on United.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be so complicated out there,'' said Petersen,
the frequent-flier expert, ``that it is going to be hard to figure
out how to get the best benefit.''

A BIG YIELD, BUT NO STOCKS

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26)

 By PEGGY EDERSHEIM KALB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In contrast to all those funds that find the quest for yield a
veritable snipe hunt, the DFA Enhanced U.S. Large Co. fund boasts a
stratospheric 12-month yield of 10.88 percent. But the fund's
manager, David Plecha, warns that his esoteric fund is not for many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Plecha described the fund as ``an equity portfolio that
typically doesn't hold stocks.'' Instead, he largely buys futures
contracts of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, generally about
three months out, giving the fund an equity component while
allowing him to keep cash in interest-bearing instruments, thus
raising the income component of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   His management team is particularly partial to high-quality
bonds in foreign currencies, which often have higher interest rates
than those in the United States, and the fund hedges the currency
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fund gives you full stock exposure with income more
reflective of a bond portfolio,'' Plecha said. Among recent
purchases were bonds issued by Denmark, maturing in October 1999
with a coupon of 6.5 percent, and by GE Capital Canada, maturing in
July 1999 with a 7 percent coupon.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception in July 1996 through Thursday, the fund's
annualized return has been 33.7 percent, far ahead of the 25.5
percent for the average growth-and-income fund. Still Plecha says
his fund, available to institutions and through investment
advisers, is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It generates a lot of taxes because of the amount of activity
in the futures markets,'' he said. Both dividends and short-term
capital gains are taxable at ordinary income-tax rates. Thus, it is
a more appropriate investment for tax-exempt or tax-deferred
accounts. Then, of course, there is the inherent volatility of the
futures market to consider.

FORD ACHIEVES CROWNING GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - My neighbor Louie's a big guy, a Phoenix motorcycle
cop and a longtime driver of Chrysler products. Sometimes he'd
settle for a Chevy, but never, ever would he buy a Ford. Not his
style.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some amusement that I recently discovered a new,
white Crown Victoria sitting in his driveway. ``What's the deal?''
I asked.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the modern run of front-drive, wedge-shaped,
V-6-powered sedans are not up to snuff, in Louie's view. What he
wanted, and without spending a small fortune to get it, was a
full-sized American sedan in the classic sense.
</P>
<P>
   There are only three of these left on the planet, all built by
Ford Motor Co. That's the Crown Victoria and its upscale corporate
twin, the Mercury Grand Marquis, and the top-drawer Lincoln Town
Car.
</P>
<P>
   Louie wanted the space, the comfort, the compliant ride and the
sense of security of a big American, so that's how he ended up with
a Crown Vic in his driveway. He grudgingly admitted that he likes
it, too, even if it is a Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Louis is not alone in finding the Crown Vic's traditional values
appealing. For one thing, Ford has a lock on the nation's fleet of
police cars, cabs and other public vehicles where size and strength
matter. It used to face stiff competition from the Chevrolet
Caprice, which Chevy axed two model years ago to turn over its
factory space to sport-utility vehicles and pickups, the nation's
hottest sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Caprice was mourned by many, especially older drivers and
those, like Louis, who favor the big rear-drive sedans. And many of
those people have turned to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Victoria is something of a throwback. Its name hints
at its old-fashioned appeal, the Victoria label first being applied
to a Ford in 1932 for the cars that replaced the Model A.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel, with the long hood jutting forward and the
soft seats underneath, a middle-ager can recall learning to drive
in Dad's Galaxy 500. Older drivers can be lulled into recalling
their own cars of the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's trying to expand the appeal of the Crown Vic beyond
the traditional-car market. Improvements in suspension, steering,
brakes and styling give the Crown Vic more of a modern edge.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 engine under that big hood is a thoroughly modern
overhead-cam design with fuel injection and coil-on-plug ignition
that eliminates spark-plug wires, delivering a solid 200
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   It's linked to an electronic four-speed automatic that's been
improved for '98 with smoother shifting. The front and rear
suspension have been redesigned for better handling and quicker
response, and the brakes are bigger and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an optional handling package available that adds
beefier suspension, better tires and 15 more horses of engine
power. I'd go for that.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Crown Vic rides comfortably and competently. On
a quick trip to Tucson, its quiet ride and high-speed highway
manners were well appreciated. So was the excellent stereo system,
cushy seats and broad roominess. This kind of distance cruising is
where a Crown Vic shines.
</P>
<P>
   Around town, the big sedan was surprisingly nimble, cornering
ably while it soaked up bumps and irregularities. The power
steering is quick and not too light or overboosted, like so many
big American cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a big car and sometimes feels as if it can't get out
of its own way. The float and vague handling of past years is
mostly gone, but it can feel heavy and ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is sedate and the appointments conservative. Driving
excitement has been pretty much dialed out of the equation,
replaced by the secure, placid ride of a luxury barge.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the LX model, fully equipped with all the goodies. One
thing you can say for the Crown Vic, you get a lot of car for the
money, both in sheet metal and ameni ties. This loaded LX had just
about everything you could want, except maybe that handling
package, and still came in just over $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not cheap, but the kind of value that has kept Crown Vic in the
game all these years and, according to Ford, for many more to come.
</P>
<P>
   With the standard engine, acceleration is quiet and smooth, the
V-8 moving the heavy cruiser quickly. Gas mileage suffers badly
with this kind of activity, though, so spirited driving will cost
you at the pump. Once up to speed, cruise-control keeps things on
track, the torquey engine pulling evenly up and down grades, while
you relax behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The optional leather seating is nice, in the manner of a
living-room easy chair. The spacious interior provides true
six-passenger space, once common but rare these days. Headroom and
legroom are great, front and rear. Styling and trim are very
traditional, befitting its mainstream appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Not so traditional is the digital dashboard, which I found
distracting and annoying, especially the speedometer. Most
automakers flirted with these things but eventu ally did away with
them, spurred by consumer complaints, in favor of regular analog
gauges. Some companies, particularly Chrysler, are fitting gauges
that look vintage.
</P>
<P>
   I also think it's time that Ford changed the trunk
configuration, which is too deep and narrow, lacking space for
anything other than bulky, square objects. A broad, flat floor
works so much better.
</P>
<P>
   While the sedan's styling has been upgraded with smoother lines
and some new shapes front and rear, there's no mistaking the Crown
Victoria. It's a survivor among automobiles, carrying a torch for
drivers who remember fondly when American cars were big, wide and
driven by their back wheels. &QL;

IT'S A BARK-MEOW WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It has been said that there are two kinds of people in
the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and
those who do not. But I've never met any of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody and his brother-in-law splits the world into two
categories: male and female; conservative and liberal; Gene Autry
fan and Roy Rogers fan; those who get it, and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying every other distinction, however, is the basic,
fundamental one: between dog and cat. Every animate being on the
planet is one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've come to this understanding, you can see it in the
faces of everyone around you.
</P>
<P>
   They are opposed personality types. They function in the world
differently and see the world differently.
</P>
<P>
   For the dog, the world is essentially simple. Truth is truth, up
is up and down is down. The dog has a direct relationship with the
things of the world: They are what they are.
</P>
<P>
   A cat, on the other hand, sees the world metaphorically. Things
are never only what they seem. They can mean one thing Monday and
something entirely different on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When dogs read poetry, they like to read, ``what oft was
thought, but ne'er so well expressed.'' Their word is their honor
and they have 30-year mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   There are many kinds of dogs in the world. Some are bureaucrats
and some, the more stylish, wear whatever is touted in ``Esquire.''
Some are noble and become doctors or missionaries; others bring my
slippers at day's end.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain, especially to dogs, that the world functions only
because of them.
</P>
<P>
   But cats have eyes that change as the moon changes. They live by
their own rules and amend them as their mood shifts. They are
filled with prevarication and treachery. Their minds shuffle like a
gambler's deck of cards, and we never know what face will show, or
what suit. ``Spades and Diamonds, Courage and Power; Clubs and
Hearts, Knowledge and Pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to poetry, cats often prefer to write their own.
</P>
<P>
   There can be little meaningful dialogue between the dog and the
cat, because they mean different things when they use the same
word.
</P>
<P>
   This frustrates the dog no end; he cannot pin the cat down,
while the cat delights in the ambiguity, and will even do what he
can to amplify it.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are trustworthy. A dog will be on time; a cat will be late,
cancel or forget.
</P>
<P>
   A dog joins the Rotarians; a cat never does, unless he can use
his membership toward the end of world domination, or something
else he thinks might be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, cats can wear too much eye makeup; dogs put too
much lacquer in their hair. The difference is total and complete.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a dog can certainly be selfish, but it takes a cat
to be egocentric. A telling difference.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs have faith in the basic goodness of the world, and although
they make a place for evil, they nevertheless believe it is
something that can be overcome. A cat may or may not believe in
evil, but whatever else, he believes in the relativity of goodness
and truth.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just people: All animals are also dogs or cats. Think
of a sea otter. Cat or dog? There can be no question. Anything that
can sleep floating on the ocean surface so curled up that its head
rests comfortably on its own belly is a cat. Sturgeon are dogs. So
are bears, horses, elephants and cows _ ungulates as a class are
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to see this play out in nature. Don't be
confused by taxonomy. It is not names that define dogness and
catness. Foxes, for instance, are classified as canines by the
doggy scientists, but they are nevertheless cats. And cheetahs _
you only have to look at those stiff, tensioned legs to recognize
their essential dogginess.
</P>
<P>
   The main physical difference is in their bendability. Pick up a
dog by his middle and what do you feel? The beast is stiff as a
two-by-four. He is uncomfortable off the ground. He whimpers. Put
him back down and his tail wags.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a cat, and it drapes over you, form-fitting and at ease.
I know a man who used to wear his big orange cat as a kind of
living Davy Crockett hat. The cat sagged over his skull and down
his neck and never wavered. The cat just purred.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell the relative caninicity or felinicity of a person
when you dance some old-fashioned thing like a waltz. If your
partner's spine is rigid, he or she is a dog. A cat-partner will
swing and sway with the rhythm like a willow in a gust.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone remember seeing archival TV film of Richard Nixon
attempting the Twist? The very definition of a dog.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a dog is all of a piece; he is one thing, head
to tail. A cat is a loose concatenation of impulses, a pile of
multiple personalities. When a dog dances, every part of him has to
move in the same direction at the same time. A cat is syncopated.
</P>
<P>
   This pervades their world views. A dog is regimented and feels
most comfortable when most conventional. A cat is individual and
often takes little notice of what is expected of him.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the American Revolution. The redcoats, marching in
rank, were dogs; the Americans, taking potshots at them from the
woods, were cats.
</P>
<P>
   Groucho Marx, taking his potshots, is the quintessential cat. If
a canine becomes too officious, a cat is always there to flick his
cigar ash and wiggle his eyebrows. Although dogs do not understand
cats, cats understand dogs all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, although almost all politicians are dogs, the
most effective religious evangelists are cats. They don't actually
believe what they say, but they get a great deal of pleasure from
persuading listeners to line up behind them, cheering (and sending
money).
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, the cat believes what he is saying as he says it. It
is just that tomorrow, he can say something else. I'm thinking of
Marjoe Gortner, for instance, or Lyndon Larouche. A foolish
consistency, they rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
   A true cat will really enjoy making one argument now, then
switching hats or podiums, proving himself wrong in the next
breath. The pleasure is in the arguing, not the results. Strife is
the natural order of things.
</P>
<P>
   This makes dogs very, very uncomfortable. For the dog, arguments
are proof that the world is out of balance. Equilibrium must be
restored: The two sides in a dispute must work it out, so the truth
will prevail and peace _ the dog's natural order of things _ will
re-emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomy is at the bottom of some of the most familiar
cultural pairings we know. Benjamin Franklin, with his ``early to
bed, early to rise,'' was a dog; Thomas Jefferson, with his house
filled with maps and stuffed elk, inventive contraptions and lack
of heat, was a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy was a dog; Dostoevski was a cat. Hemingway went woof
woof; Faulkner, meow.
</P>
<P>
   The very earliest organized philosophies broke down along these
lines. Plato was a cat. Even now, you can never know for sure when
he actually believes some of the piffle he comes up with.
Aristotle, on the other hand, was the very model of a dog. ``Let's
make lecture notes.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to marriage, a dog can be happy married to a dog.
But a cat can be happy married to either a cat or a dog. There is
fun either way. But you see, there is a built-in paradox. How many
marriages do you know where one party is happy and the other isn't?
The reason, I tell you, is always the same: One dog, one cat.
</P>
<P>
   Two cats mated can be happy briefly. But such marriages don't
tend to last. Think of a Hollywood marriage and you pretty much get
the picture. Variety is not just an ideal for a cat but a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the arts are heavy with cats, just as the field of
accounting is not. You don't last long at H&AMP;R Block if you believe
arithmetic is a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, we need both animals in the world. You need the dogs
to make life possible; you need cats to make it worth living. &QL;

THE INFORMATION AGE MEETS THE AGE OF FAITH

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Star-Telegram religion reporter Jim Jones
recently joined with writers, publishers and editors of news
organizations in a Religion and Media 2000+ conference in Rome.)
</P>
<P>
   ROME _ The new millennium, less than two years away, will usher
in one of the most religious centuries. And religious and media
leaders, who are often at odds over news coverage of religion, must
forge closer ties in interpreting the new wave of spirituality
sweeping a troubled world.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message coming from an unusual ``Religion and
Media: 2000+'' conference held recently in the shadow of the
Vatican. It brought together cardinals, archbishops and other
religious leaders to mingle with publishers, writers and TV
producers.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of a surge in religious interest, speakers quoted
Gallup polls and increased sales of books on faith and
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 120 million Americans say that God is very important to
them, that should be all editors and publishers need to hear'' to
persuade them to give higher priority to religion coverage, said
Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The Oregonian in Portland, Ore., and
immediate past president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``Covering this expansion of religion in the new
millennium will not be easy. If religion and spirituality will be
one of the defining issues in the next five years, we must be
prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Vatican, physical preparations for the coming millennium
are evident. St. Peter's Basilica and other major buildings are
covered with scaffolding as workers renovate them for a massive
influx of pilgrims in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for the 2,000th birthday of Jesus Christ _ a
pretty major event,'' said Archbishop John Patrick Foley, president
of the Vatican's Pontifical Council on Social Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium provided more questions than answers about
improving religion coverage and strengthening ties between religion
and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beginning of dialogue, the beginning of
understanding each other better,'' said Tim McGuire, editor of the
Star-Tribune in Minneapolis, which has started a religion section
in its newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who write about religion have a hard job, said
Cecile Holmes of Houston, president of the Religion Newswriters
Association, a national organization of religion reporters in the
secular media.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the millennium we find that religion is
both a powerful force of peace and justice, and also a relentless
weapon for war, rape, torture and genocide,'' said Holmes, religion
editor of the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of newspapers, ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN television
and National Public Radio, along with Christian and Jewish leaders,
heard good news and bad news about religion coverage in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Although many newspapers have increased religion coverage, and
one major network _ ABC _ has hired a religion specialist, the
American media still have much room for improvement, speakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, most of us, do a profoundly inadequate job of covering
matters of faith,'' said keynote speaker David Lawrence Jr.,
chairman and publisher of the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The religion beat, in most newsrooms, doesn't get the attention
shown to politics, education, business and the environment,
Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in my business simply cannot see, before their
very eyes, just how big this story of faith is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Neary, religion correspondent for National Public Radio,
said that four years ago, much attention was given to the fact that
she was hired to cover religion and Peggy Wehmeyer was employed by
Peter Jennings as a religion specialist by ABC television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years later, we're still it,'' Neary said. ``We still are
the only ones covering religion on a national basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Register of Atlanta, vice president for special projects
for CNN, said his network is having a lively internal debate about
whether to hire a religion correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered the pope in Cuba extensively, but it was not
covered specifically as religion,'' he said. ``Some say we need a
religious correspondent to cover the issues well.''
</P>
<P>
   Register said the global scope of CNN makes it hard to hire a
religion specialist who would be qualified to cover world religions
such as Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered an important pilgrimage in India as well as the
pope's visit,'' said Register. And the network, for the first time,
covered the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Some conferees argued that without a religion specialist, news
organizations often miss the religious dimensions of major stories.
And it even happens, in some cases, when a news organization has a
religion reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, the Miami publisher, noted that when Pope John Paul II
visited Cuba, his newspaper covered the event extensively _ as a
political story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the best religion writers in the country in
April Witt,'' he said. ``But in our planning and brainstorming
about how to cover that story, her advice simply was not sought.
The editors managing the Cuban coverage thought this was a
political story, not a religion story. We think, obviously, it was
both.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dart, Los Angeles Times religion writer and co-author with
the Rev. Jimmy Allen of a much-quoted study, ``Bridging the Gap,''
said a way must be found to gather evidence to show news media
executives that excellent religion reporting can be to their
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Such information would include the popularity of new religion
sections at several major newspapers, and the fact that Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report say their cover stories on
religious topics are among the bestselling issues, Dart said.

Aristotle, on the other hand, was the very model of a dog. ``Let's
make lecture notes.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to marriage, a dog can be happy married to a dog.
But a cat can be happy married to either a cat or a dog. There is
fun either way. But you see, there is a built-in paradox. How many
marriages do you know where one party is happy and the other isn't?
The reason, I tell you, is always the same: One dog, one cat.
</P>
<P>
   Two cats mated can be happy briefly. But such marriages don't
tend to last. Think of a Hollywood marriage and you pretty much get
the picture. Variety is not just an ideal for a cat but a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the arts are heavy with cats, just as the field of
accounting is not. You don't last long at H&AMP;R Block if you believe
arithmetic is a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, we need both animals in the world. You need the dogs
to make life possible; you need cats to make it worth living. &QL;

AKERS NOW SEEMS AT TOP OF HER GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite knee injuries and chronic fatigue syndrome in recent
years, Michelle Akers is still the leading scorer in history and a
protagonist for the U.S. women's national soccer team. The
32-year-old Akers, the only player who has been with the program
since it started 13 years ago, has been a leader in gaining
acceptance for women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   With Akers always in a key role, female soccer players in the
United States broke many barriers. Winning the first World Cup for
women and capturing the gold medal in the first women's Olympic
tournament in 1996 brought credibility to American soccer and
financial rewards to the players and to the U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people know how many sacrifices some of us are still
making to be part of this team,'' Akers said after practice the
other day while preparing for Saturday night's game against Denmark
in the Goodwill Games. ``But it's been a rewarding experience for
all of us, and it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There were those who thought that because of injuries and
chronic fatigue, Akers would retire after helping the Americans
capture the gold at the Atlanta Olympics. But Akers has been so
rejuvenated by a strict diet to combat her chronic fatigue syndrome
that she plans to play through the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not where I was a little younger,'' Akers said, ``but I'm
very close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers has scored 96 goals in 120 games with the national team.
Of her two well-known teammates who follow her on the scoring list,
Mia Hamm has 92 goals in 150 games and Kristine Lilly has 59 goals
in 156 games.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Akers twist and turn with the ball at her feet and
accelerate through the midfield and into the attack during practice
this week, one is convinced that she is at the top of her game, as
she was in 1991 when she led the Americans to the world
championship in the first Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That World Cup was staged in China, and Akers led all goal
scorers in the tournament with 10. In 1995, she sustained a
concussion and a knee injury in the game against China and missed
part of that year's World Cup, which was staged in Sweden, where
the Americans finished third after losing to Norway in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which has been the Americans' main rival, will play
China in Saturday's other Goodwill Games match, and the winners
will meet for the gold medal Monday night. All games will be played
at Mitchel Field near the Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is the only team to have defeated the United States this
year, a 4-1 victory in a tournament in Portugal. The Americans'
record this year going into Saturday night's game against Denmark
is 14-1-2. The loss was to Norway, and the ties were with China and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the American women in the World Cup and the
Olympics prompted FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to award the
1999 World Cup to the United States. U.S. organizers have already
sold 130,000 tickets for next year's tournament, more already than
the tournament attracted in Sweden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this place will be full for the opening game,'' Akers
said about Giants Stadium, which will stage the opening ceremony
and a double-header that will include the American team. ``If you
told me in 1985 we would be playing before thousands of people, it
would have been beyond my wildest dreams.''

BRIDE, GROOM WANT DONATIONS OF BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City area bride and groom are asking
their wedding guests for an unusual gift: a pint of blood.
</P>
<P>
   They've registered for the typical household items at an area
store. But when people ask about it, they say they also hope their
guests will open a vein at the Shawnee Mission American Red Cross
in honor of their Aug. 12 wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need stuff to live on, but the most important thing is
knowing we've made a difference,'' Loretta Stewart said Wednesday
afternoon before donating blood with her future father-in-law,
George Hoover, and brother-in-law Zac Hoover. ``We can always get
stuff, but that feeling, you can't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added that she and her fiance, Jason Hoover, both enjoy
giving back to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old couple got engaged in the spring. They've been
separated a lot since. Jason Hoover, who is in the Navy, has been
in Florida assisting the Red Cross with disaster relief. Stewart
kept busy with her studies in biology at Rockhurst College, where
they began dating, and with her volunteer work for the Multiple
Sclerosis Society.
</P>
<P>
   To help Jason Hoover feel a part of the blood donation outing,
his mother, Jonette Hoover, took pictures of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, this is for Jason,'' Jonette Hoover told Stewart, ``so
look happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Grayson, an American Red Cross volunteer since 1961, said
they've never had anyone donate blood in honor of a wedding _ or
any other event like it, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect a lot out of the best man, but not normally a pint
of blood,'' Grayson teased 17-year-old Zac, who will be his
brother's best man. ``That's going all out to be in a wedding.''

FORD UNVEILS PLAN FOR NEW SPOT_UTILITY VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ford Motor Co. already has started expanding
its Claycomo, Mo., plant to accommodate the launch of a new,
compact sport-utility vehicle in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With cranes hovering over the plant, several hundred Ford
workers and business and public officials gathered Wednesday to
hear the automaker officially unveil plans to enter the
fast-growing, compact sport-utility vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and union officials even held a ceremonial pouring of
concrete on the plant floor, which will be expanded by 122,000
square feet in order to produce the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Jac Nasser, president of Ford's automotive operations, divulged
only a few details about the new vehicle, saying it will seat five
passengers, come in front- and four-wheel drive, offer side air
bags and run at more than 20 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of this vehicle will be smaller than any other
sport-utility vehicle we make,'' Nasser said. ``At the same time,
it will still have the same tough, Ford-brand essence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant, which also produces the top-selling F-series
pickup, beat out three other Ford facilities worldwide for the new
vehicle, according to Nasser. Ford is receiving a variety of tax
breaks in return for picking Claycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's entry into the compact sport-utility niche will be a
first by a domestic automaker, said George Magliano, analyst with
the WEFA Group in New York. Toyota created the market with its
vehicles, including the RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing a little bit of catch-up, but it's also a good
move,'' Magliano said. ``The SUV market has room for more growth.
The competition is heavy, but Ford's got an excellent track record
when it comes to light trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has not named its new vehicle, dubbed the U204, nor issued
any price information. However, rival vehicles such as the Toyota
RAV4 had a 1998 base-price range of $15,858 to $18,128. The Honda
CR-V, another competitor, has a base-price range of $18,745 to
$20,645.
</P>
<P>
   Ford hopes the retooling and expansion of the 3.7
million-square-foot plant will be completed by early 2000. While
the new product may not lead to many new jobs, Nasser said some
work now performed at other locations might be transferred to
Claycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Minor, Claycomo's plant manager, said it was too early to
tell how many additional jobs would be created. The plant now
employs about 5,200 workers, including about 4,800 hourly
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said Ford's decision to build the new sport-utility
vehicle at the Claycomo plant would create job security. He noted
the plant's recent strong showings in quality and productivity
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of what we're really doing here is to ensure the
long-term viability and strength of this plant...well into the 21st
century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser would not comment on the size of Ford's investment to
build the new vehicle. However, area executives familiar with
Ford's plans said it was about $750 million. Earlier estimates had
pegged the investment at $100 million to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant could be shut down for a short time in early
2000 before the new product's launch, Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be longer than the two-week traditional summer
shutdown, but it will be as short as we can make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new sport-utility vehicle will hit dealer showrooms in the
2001 model year and will replace the Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique passenger cars. Those cars will continue to be built at
Ford's Cuautitlan plant near Mexico City. The passenger cars have
never lived up to the hype Ford created when it launched them four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said the Contour and Mystique sold nearly 200,000 units
last year in the United States, although sales never met Ford's
initial expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly in between two very, very popular products, the
Taurus and the Escort,'' Nasser said. ``The second thing is in the
U.S. market, there has been a marked shift to more versatile
vehicles, (like) sport-utility vehicles, trucks and pickups.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said Ford's $6 billion investment in developing the
Contour and Mystique continues to be the standard for building
other products, such as Claycomo's sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to reuse many of the parts and systems
developed for the Contour-Mystique in this new vehicle,'' he said.
``That's another reason we chose Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Top officials from the United Auto Workers union commended Ford
for working with the union in making product decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UAW wants to be a part of Ford's growth,'' said Ron
Gettelfinger, a UAW International vice president in charge of
Ford's national department.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kline, president of UAW Local 249, said Ford's decision
was a testament to the work ethic of the Claycomo plant.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan said the state cooperated with Ford
by expanding an existing enterprise zone at the plant and offering
assistance with job training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (enterprise zone) expansion will allow Ford tax relief on
its substantial new investment,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The state incentives included an income tax refund of $2 million
a year over five years if Ford proceeded with the Claycomo
expansion and renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said Missouri's tax relief packages were a factor in
putting the new vehicle in Claycomo, ``but we had similar offers
being made at many other locations.''

 To get your way, use the power play  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Your position in an organization may give you
authority, but it is your ability to influence people that gives
you power, regardless of your position.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Charles E. Dwyer, a faculty member of the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, told managers from
Kansas City area companies at a recent Institute for Management
Studies seminar.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to write off overt or covert influence peddling as
nasty office politics. Do so at your peril, Dwyer advises.
</P>
<P>
   You will get what you want in the workplace, he says, if you _
day in and day out _ are the most persistent at getting others to
do what you want. And the genius is that you will get what you want
while convincing others that it's the best behavior or outcome for
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make you squirm?
</P>
<P>
   It does me. It sounds so Machiavellian, so manipulative. And,
Dwyer admits, it is. There are costs associated with trying to get
others to behave in ways that suit your ends.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, the costs will be worthwhile, provided you ``never
expect anyone to engage in a behavior that serves your values
unless you give that person adequate reason to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean in real life?
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you've been assigned to lead a team of co-workers on a
certain project. You're not their boss. You don't write their
performance evaluations. You don't dole out their raises. They have
no reason to do what you say unless you can convince them they
should.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one way:
</P>
<P>
   You say, ``John, I know that researching why the last rollout
failed is a thankless task, but if you will do this for me _ for
the group _ I will owe you big time. If you do this, I will make
sure the big guy knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, you follow through. When John does his part,
you write him a terrific thank-you note. He'll put it in his file
and his memory bank. You also write ``the big guy,'' John's boss,
and tell him what a great job John did. And you make sure John
knows you did it. You give him a copy of your letter to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the organization's needs, John came through. In
terms of your needs _ succeeding as the project leader _ John came
through. But Dwyer suspects that what John will remember most from
the project team experience is that you came through for him.
</P>
<P>
   That's power. He owes you, and you both know it.
</P>
<P>
   Still squirming? No doubt. But Dwyer says there's also no doubt
that it works. To make sure it works, he offers suggestions for
hammering home your needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if John is obviously unenthused about his
assignment the first time you speak with him, you take the
responsibility and follow up immediately: ``I don't think I said
that very well. This is very important to me. Let me try it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   You must, of course, be perceived as sincere. The sincerity part
is what trips up some excellent manipulators. Co-workers get a clue
if they're used too often for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   But the more you're good for your word, the more you return a
favor or provide a benefit for John _ and for as many others in the
organization as you need in your sphere of influence _ the more
they trust you. The more they trust you, the more influence they
grant you.
</P>
<P>
   Voila, Dwyer says. You have power.

THE BEST LISTS? LET'S START WITH TOP 50  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26)  
 (WITH LISTS-LIST) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Every columnist in America seems to be writing about
the Modern Library list of the 100 best English-language novels of
the past 100 years. It's almost obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing they seem to agree on is that James Joyce's
``Ulysses'' is hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   But they have missed the real significance of the list. And that
is that Americans don't actually read the books, but instead read
the list.
</P>
<P>
   We are a country crazy for lists. There is the list of the 100
greatest American films put out recently by the American Film
Institute. ``The Arizona Republic'' even produced its own list of
100 greatest foreign films in response.
</P>
<P>
   And now with the 100 novels, we are off on a tear. We may not
have the time and patience to get through Booth Tarkington's
``Magnificent Ambersons'' (the caboose on that long, gray,
respectable list), but we can zip through the list and be done with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lists have been around a long time. They predate
writing. Some of the first evidence we have of human existence are
the odd scratchings on bone or stone that anthropologists believe
are calendar listings. Prehistoric people notched their medicine
sticks to remind them of significant events _ they were memory
aids.
</P>
<P>
   And the ancient Incas communicated with a knotted string, a
``quipu,'' each knot standing for an item the messenger was
required to remember.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not cut to the chase? It is lists that matter in the
'90s, so let's forget the long difficult novels, or the subtitled
films, and decide what are the 50 Best Lists of All Time.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the 10 Commandments come in at No. 1. It
is a consensus choice. There were a few rumblings among the more
erudite judges that perhaps Hammurabi's Law should displace the
decalogue, but finally, the conciseness of the Torah beats out the
comprehensiveness of the Babylonian ruler.
</P>
<P>
   The list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, compiled by
the Byzantine mathematician Philon, is one of the oldest and most
venerable in the world. In his ``De Septem Orbis Spectaculis,'' he
listed the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens, the Olympian Zeus, the
Ephesian temple of Diana, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the
Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse of Pharos. His list was so
influential that when they made ``King Kong'' in 1933, they called
the big ape the ``Eighth Wonder of the World.'' And everyone in the
audience knew what the reference was.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights comes in at No. 3, although it is a list of
amendments to the Constitution that many Americans are vague about,
except for their favorite one, whether it be the first and Larry
Flynt, the second and Charlton Heston or the fifth and Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth is the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, or the ``Index of
Prohibited Books'' first published by the Vatican in 1557. At one
time, it listed 5,000 books that were bad for you _ and undoubtedly
more lively than many of the moldy classics on the Modern Library
list.
</P>
<P>
   And rounding out the top five is the Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial
in Washington, D.C., perhaps the most moving of the lists and the
only one that people actually make a pilgrimage to.
</P>
<P>
   This last proves that lists need not be trivial. &QL;

 &HT;    DISASTERS TEST PROGRAM TO END FARM SUBSIDIES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parched fields in Texas, drought-withered crops in
Florida, and tumbling grain prices have combined to severely test
one of the major accomplishments of the Republican congressional
revolution, the program to wean farmers off federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   For two relatively fat years since passage of the Freedom to
Farm Act in 1996, the new program plowed smoothly through the
agricultural belt, as wheat and other grain prices soared, and many
of the nation's farmers pulled down some of their best profits
ever. And to top that, they shared in more than $5 billion in
annual ``transition'' payments, the first in a seven-year phase-out
of farm price supports.
</P>
<P>
   Now in lean times that happen to come in a congressional
election year, officials in Washington are rushing to propose
emergency assistance and raising doubts about the new program. ``It
gave farmers more freedom to make their own planning decisions ...
But it did not have an adequate safety net,'' President Clinton
said on Thursday as he called on Congress to approve $500 million
in disaster aid already passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has pledged quick action to
speed up the $5.5 billion for the next annual Freedom to Farm
payments so that they would be in the farmers' hands by early fall,
a plan also pushed by Senate Republicans, including Texas
Republican senators Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Democratic critics have failed to repeal the Freedom to
Farm Act and return to the old system, which paid farmers when
prices dropped and controlled how much acreage they planted.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom to Farm program is still ``overwhelmingly popular''
with American farmers, said Andy Fisher, spokesman for Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``These are
regionally isolated problems,'' said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the latest disasters have rekindled old doubts
about the new program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be under attack as soon as prices dropped,''
said Bob Amstrup, farm director for the radio station KNOX in Grand
Forks, N. D., who farmed until a flood three years ago put him out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, many farmers received higher payments under
Freedom to Farm than under the old program, Amstrup said. ``Now
this year the old system would pay more,'' he said, because it
would have compensated farmers for the low prices after the Asian
economic crisis drastically reduced exports.
</P>
<P>
   The hard times raise questions about whether the politicians
will stick by their plans to cut off the subsidies altogether in
the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the whole Freedom to Farm Act is being
tested, and members of Congress are falling all over themselves to
increase farm supports,'' said Steve Moore, vice president of the
Cato Institute, a Libertarian research group that has cheered the
effort to remove government from the farm economy. Now Moore has
concluded that ``it's unlikely we'll ever see these farm programs
entirely eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Avery, director of global food issues for the
conservative Hudson Institute, said that the disaster aid may be
only a temporary setback for taking government out of farming.
``But we've not yet taken the second step, eliminating trade
barriers'' to open up foreign markets, said Avery, who predicted a
huge market for American goods in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, he conceded, ``The American farmer isn't really
convinced about the free market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Webster, a senior agriculture official in the Carter
administration and now editor of a farm newsletter, predicted that
the pressure on the new farm program has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have a lot more debate over this very
question,'' he said. ``The Freedom to Farm Act will come under
severe challenge'' as the presidential campaign begins in earnest,
with the first major test coming in the farm state of Iowa.

   DALLAS _ What would Jesus do?
</P>
<P>
   It has become a million-dollar question. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Abbreviated as WWJD, it has helped sell more than 17 million
bracelets and countless coffee mugs, key chains and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   And more products are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th annual International Convention of the CBA, formerly
known as the Christian Booksellers Association, unveiled 6 acres of
merchandise this month at the Dallas Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in among classic items such as paintings of Jesus and
praying hands were new products seeking to capitalize on the WWJD
phenomenon and secular successes such as the New York Times
bestsellers ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' and ``Life's Little
Instruction Book.''

   ``Soup'' is now being served in a variety of flavors: ``Chicken
Soup for the Teen-age Soul,'' ``Woman's Soul,'' ``Mother's Soul,''
``Pet Lover's Soul'' and ``Country Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``God's Little Instruction Book'' series includes volumes of

   The WWJD concept, which is not trademarked, is popping up on
CDs, Bibles, books, T-shirts, hats, latte mugs and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   All those products are helping to drive Christian consumerism to
new heights.
</P>
<P>
   The CBA reports that sales in the group's 2,500 retail stores in
the United States have increased an average of 12 percent since
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Christian retailing is posting annual sales of $3 billion, up
from about $1 billion in 1980, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is both a ministry challenge as well as a business
challenge,'' said Bill Anderson, president of CBA. ``It is not a
matter of balancing business and ministry. It is an integration of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Anderson launched an initiative to double sales in
the 2,500 member stores by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Impact X 2,'' the program is not designed solely to
make money for Christian businesses, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about people,'' he said. ``It's about impacting the lives
of more people for Christ. But since we are in retail, our impact
will be measured by sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said those sales are being helped by mainstream stores
such as Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think retailers have realized that this is not just some
church basement subculture,'' he said. ``For 88 million Americans,
being an evangelical Christian is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all retailers are cheered by talk of increased sales,
because much of the growth is taking place in areas that have
little to do with Christian discipleship.
</P>
<P>
   Product areas with the largest percentage of growth in 1997
included jewelry (50 percent) and clothing (28 percent), according
to CBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is more and more product, but it's getting more
and more into gift-type things,'' said Alister Stott of Australia,
who was making his 11th visit to a CBA convention. He owns two
bookstores in the state of Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gift books are lovely, but how much are they going to
influence people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stott said he stocks the front of his stores with greeting cards
because he knows they draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trade profitably if you want to stay in
business,'' he said. ``It's really market-driven. It's what people
are asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he bends to the demands of the market, Stott said, he
hopes his customers will venture deeper into his store for books
that will nurture their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably what keeps me hanging in there,'' he said. ``I
do as much as I can.''

 KC politician indicted  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM JACKMAN, GROMER JEFFERS JR. and MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal grand jury Wednesday indicted
former Jackson County, Mo., Legislature Chairman James D. Tindall
on charges of bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The action wasn't unexpected. Last fall a federal jury convicted
public relations consultant Elbert L. Anderson of paying $10,000 in
bribes to Tindall. On Wednesday Anderson testified before a grand
jury about his dealings with Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall has sworn under oath that he neither asked for nor took
bribes. During Anderson's trial, he testified that ``I've never
done anything like that. Would never think or dream of doing
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the charges Wednesday involved allegations that Tindall, a
bishop in the Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ, stole more
than $14,700 from a church-affiliated social services agency he
helped create in 1977. The indictment alleges Tindall took checks
intended as rent payments and deposited them into accounts he
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tindall is accused of filing false tax returns that
underreport his income for the years 1992 to 1995. The indictment
states Tindall's true income each year was ``substantially in
excess of the amount stated'' on each tax return, although the
amount wasn't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall, 56, is expected to make his first court appearance
Monday. If convicted, he faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said,
``When you have this type of public corruption, it damages the
integrity of government in general and weakens the confidence
people have in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Tindall was one of the most formidable political
presences in Kansas City. He had been a member of the Jackson
County Legislature for 14 years and its chairman from 1991 to 1996,
when he suddenly retired from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall also was president of Freedom Inc., an influential
inner-city political club.
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1996, as FBI subpoenas began circulating
through the Jackson County courthouse, Tindall unexpectedly
resigned from the Legislature. A pastor of his own church in Kansas
City, Tindall said his archbishop was ordering him to step down to
spend more time on his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal corruption probe snared then-Kansas City
Councilwoman D. Jeanne Robinson, a friend of Tindall's, and
evidence arose that Robinson had sent money to a Tindall company,
Tindall maintained his innocence. Robinson pleaded guilty to
defrauding her employer, Marion Merrell Dow, in September 1996, and
agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson revealed to prosecutors and FBI agents that she had
taken bribes from Anderson and that she'd helped Anderson pay
bribes to Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, a grand jury indicted Anderson on charges of
bribing both Robinson and Tindall. Tindall wasn't charged, though
he was repeatedly named throughout the indictment as ``the chairman
of the Jackson County Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson took his case to trial, but three key government
witnesses _ Robinson, Robinson's assistant Jane Lacy, and
Anderson's top assistant Michelle Lathan _ all told of Anderson's
cash payments to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In Tindall's case, Jackson County had agreed in 1995 to provide
$40,000 to Black Expo USA, a trade show staged by Anderson. The
county paid $30,000 before the show and agreed to pay $10,000 more
after Black Expo filed an accounting report.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson testified, and the indictment alleges, that in late
November or early December 1995, Tindall knew that the $10,000
payment still hadn't been made. The indictment contends Tindall
called Robinson twice, ``urging her to contact Elbert Anderson
immediately,'' because ``Tindall wanted this money for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Robinson testified, Tindall offered to increase
Black Expo's funding in 1996 to $50,000. The indictment offers new
information that Robinson and Anderson both met and spoke on the
phone about Anderson's willingness to pay Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Madden, the Jackson County auditor, testified that
in December 1995, Tindall asked him specifically to speed up the
payment of Black Expo's remaining $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson testified, the indictment alleges, that Anderson then
gave her $5,000 cash on two occasions to be passed to Tindall.
Robinson said she and Tindall used the first $5,000 for a gambling
spree in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand last fall, Anderson said he never paid a
bribe to Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard he wanted a bribe,'' Anderson said. ``Nobody has
ever asked me for anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tindall followed, saying he never requested any money to support
Black Expo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done it,'' Tindall said.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall also denied making a special request to the county
auditor for Black Expo's check. ``I wouldn't, as a legislator, know
how they would get checks,'' Tindall testified. ``I wouldn't have
any idea whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors later said they found Tindall's testimony hard to
believe, based on his lengthy political experience.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1977, according to its articles of incorporation, Tindall
was one of the founders of Metropolitan Sociological Resources
Corp. Located next to Tindall's church, the nonprofit company
distributed money for utility and food assistance projects and held
computer education programs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 registration report filed with Missouri lists Tindall's
brother, Wallace Tindall, as the president and another brother,
Monta Tindall, as a director. Tindall is not listed as an officer
or director. The corporation's purpose is stated as: ``To serve
those that need.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 through 1996, the company received roughly $200,000
from Kansas City. Although nearly $21,000 came from the city's
general fund, most of the money was from federal Community
Development Block Grants administered by the city.
</P>
<P>
   The company operated in a building owned by Tindall's
congregation, and prosecutor Hill said Metropolitan Sociological
paid rent to Tindall's church next door.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that in 1994, Tindall deposited 13 checks
from Metropolitan Sociological that had been written as rent
payments to the church. The checks totaled $8,675.
</P>
<P>
   Tindall is accused of embezzling 10 checks totaling $6,107 that
were intended for rent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said ``there was a relationship'' between the agency and
Tindall's church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Tindall used that working relationship to access
those accounts,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Sociological later presented copies of the checks
to the city to be reimbursed for its rent payments, which are
typically recoverable under federal grant guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the checks appeared to be legitimate rent
payments and did not raise red flags.
</P>
<P>
   The state dissolved Metropolitan Sociological in December 1997
when it failed to file its annual corporate report.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities subpoenaed city records on the corporation
in September 1996, after Robinson's guilty plea. Tindall resigned
from politics the next month.

MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ENTER DEBATE OVER MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Republican-led House passed a bill last
week to regulate managed care plans, it performed reconstructive
surgery on a little understood but highly controversial program
called medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially approved by Congress in 1996 as a pilot project,
medical savings accounts (MSAs) offer tax deductions as incentives
to help individuals save for out-of-pocket expenses incurred when
they purchase high-deductible medical insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Between January 1997, when the accounts first became available,
and June of that year, 22,051 MSAs were opened, according to
Internal Revenue Service figures, the latest available. By
unofficial estimates, as many as 100,000 such accounts are now
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers purchase them as companions to health insurance
policies with deductibles that are no lower than $1,500 for
individuals and $3,000 for families. For the most part, these
insurance policies are designed to guard against catastrophic
illness or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to MSAs are fully tax deductible. Withdrawals are
used to meet medical expenses under the deductible. Once expenses
rise above the deductible, the insurance policy picks up most or
all health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure would expand MSAs by dropping limitations
built into the 1996 pilot program. The Senate could take up its
version of the managed care measure, which includes MSAs, as early
as this week.
</P>
<P>
   MSA advocates say the accounts would ease increasing concern
that managed care prevents patients from obtaining the care they
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical savings accounts are an antidote for people tired of
medical gatekeepers and hospitals that throw people out early,''
said Jack Strayer, head of the Washington office of the National
Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative Dallas-based think tank
that formulated the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a medical savings account, you can stay in the
hospital as long as you need to, and decisions are made by your
doctor and you, not someone at a switchboard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have rejected the MSA concept. They and their
supporters _ particularly organized labor _ consider it a sop to
the healthy and wealthy at the expense of the poor and the
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see them as savings accounts that would afford the rich an
opportunity to squirrel money away tax free,'' said Gerald McEntee,
president of the 1.3-million American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). ``There's not too many run
of-the-mill middle-class people who can afford that kind of a
deductible. It's a boondoggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the House measure passed Friday, the White House
condemned the MSA expansion in it as one of several ``poison
pills'' that would derail any chance of legislative compromise. An
exodus of healthier and wealthier people into medical savings
accounts would drive up the cost of conventional, low-deductible
insurance and managed care for those poorer and sicker, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress created the MSA pilot project two years ago, it
said money in the accounts could be invested and dollars not spent
on medical care could be carried over to the following year.
</P>
<P>
   But it said withdrawals for non-medical purposes would subject
account holders to a 15 percent penalty. Eligibility during the
pilot period was limited to the self-employed and those in
companies with 50 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employees could buy them on their own or employers could fund
them. But no matched employee-employer contribution was permitted.
Also, yearly contributions were limited to 65 percent of the
deductible for individuals and 75 percent for families.
</P>
<P>
   Both House and Senate GOP bills would end all these
restrictions. Nonmedical withdrawals would be subject to normal
taxation, but not the 15 percent penalty. And the deductible floors
would be lowered to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for families.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and their supporters say MSAs are an ingenious way
to get around limits on doctor choice and specialist care, which
are targets of numerous complaints about managed care. And,
supporters say, MSAs do it without federal mandates and lawsuits
against health plans, which the Democrats favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical savings account is a vehicle that permits the
aggregate cost of medical care to be controlled just as effectively
as managed care, but without the undesirable matter of bureaucrats
saying no,'' said J. Patrick Rooney, chairman emeritus of Golden
Rule Insurance Co. in Indianapolis, a leading advocate of the
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney himself has become a lightening rod in the debate because
of Golden Rule's financial support of Republicans. Rooney and
Golden Rule executives gave $757,875 to the Republican Party
between 1991 and 1997, according to a review of Federal Election
Commission documents by Common Cause, the campaign finance
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rooney acknowledged contributing $49,000 to a failed
ballot initiative in California that would have required unions to
get written consent from members before spending dues money on
political candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 congressional compromise, Golden Rule has sold
31,522 medical savings accounts, according to company spokeswoman
Amanda Newlin.
</P>
<P>
   Medical savings accounts are ``geared to make Pat Rooney more
rich than he is today,'' said AFSCME's McEntee.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney denied a monetary motivation. ``If I were driven by
money, our best interest would have been to go the managed care
route'' instead of emphasizing medical savings accounts, he said.

BRITISH AUTOMAKER'S WOES SPARK DEBATE ON CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What price the pound?
</P>
<P>
   As the British currency has risen 30 percent in value against
the German mark over the last two years, so, too, have British
exporters bemoaned the pain they say this has caused. And nowhere
has that been so apparent as at Rover Group PLC, the money-losing
British automaker that BMW acquired four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hasselkus, the BMW-appointed chairman of Rover, on
Thursday announced 1,500 job cuts among Rover's 39,500 workers,
blaming the strength of the pound for hurting the export sales that
account for 57 percent of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government, please note and understand: The pound is
overvalued,'' Hasselkus told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Rover's move has touched off a far wider debate over monetary
policy and other issues, raising questions about the government's
decision last year to shift control of interest rates to the Bank
of England, which in turn has raised rates to the highest level in
more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain's
equivalent of Treasury secretary, attributed Rover's problems to
deficient productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, one
committee member, DeAnne Julius, openly challenged the decision
last month to again raise interest rates by a quarter-point, to 7.5
percent. She said the rate increases, intended to restrain
inflation, might be contributing to an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   The higher rates, which make deposits denominated in sterling
more attractive, are an important force driving the pound higher,
particularly against the mark. It now costs nearly three marks to
buy a pound, compared with about 2.1 marks to the pound in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply too high for industry to bear,'' said Nick Argent,
a Rover spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Argent acknowledged that, as Brown said in a published interview
Friday, ``productivity is an issue'' for the Rover Group, which,
along with Rover cars, produces the Mini, the MG and various models
under the Land Rover line. But, Argent said, it was not the only
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators suggested that Rover, like other British
exporters facing recession, was using arguments about the
currency's strength to cloak its own failures to increase
productivity. Others pointed out that Rover cars, over the years,
have had a reputation for being expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Argent said that Rover's work force had improved its
productivity by 18 percent in the last few years. But that
improvement has been undermined, he said, by the pound's strength.
This has not only made imported cars more affordable in Britain, he
said, but Rover's cars more expensive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come when we must take action,'' said Hasselkus,
the Rover chairman, who is also a member of the BMW board in
Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rover announced that apart from eliminating 1,500
jobs, it would move to a four-day workweek at some plants and
increase purchases from less expensive foreign suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs are to be shed initially through early retirement and
attrition. But these 1,500 positions will not be the only
casualties. The increase in foreign-made parts will cost British
suppliers more than $1 billion in sales and thousands of jobs,
contributing to a manufacturing malaise affecting roughly one-fifth
of the British economy.
</P>
<P>
   The main British labor union representing workers at Rover, the
Transport and General Workers Union, said it would challenge the
job cuts on the ground that it was unjust to penalize the work
force for the strength of the pound.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a time when Volkswagen AG is planning to enter the British
car market through the purchase of Rolls-Royce, Rover's troubles
highlighted the perils of sterling's strength for foreign investors
as well as domestic exporters.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's shares fell 6.3 percent on Thursday in Frankfurt, Germany,
despite the parent company's announcement of an 18 percent increase
in its first-half profit. Some analysts ascribed the drop to the
problems at Rover, but Christopher Will, European auto analyst with
Lehman Brothers here, said the slide reflected broader weakness in
European auto shares. On Friday, BMW regained a little of that
loss, rising 14 marks to close at 1,719 marks _ or $966.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has said it does not expect to turn a profit at Rover until
2000. The investment plan's first results are expected later this
year with the introduction of the first two models developed fully
under BMW's tutelage _ a new Land Rover Discovery all-terrain
vehicle and a luxury car. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Despite visits by three senior Israeli officials to
Yasser Arafat and an unusual flurry of political activity in the
last week, the Sabbath siren sounded this evening with no tangible
movement on the Israeli-Palestinian front and growing fears that it
could stay that way till fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, the Palestinian leader, received Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani in Ramallah on Friday with smiles and
promises of more such meetings. But Palestinians and Kahalani
himself emphasized that the Israeli was not a negotiator and had
not gone there bearing a message from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The only official meetings, between Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and the senior Palestinian negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas,
began on Sunday and ended on Wednesday with no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai then appealed to the Americans to return and help
break the logjam. But after eight months of fruitless efforts to
extract a decision from Netanyahu, Washington showed no eagerness
to rush back to assist the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   By general consent, that leaves only one week to find a way to
resume negotiations before the Israeli Parliament's summer recess,
followed by a series of Jewish holidays and municipal elections,
imposes new restraints on talks for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this exercise for the past eight months, this
game in which Netanyahu takes us for a ride,'' said Saeb Erekat,
one of the Palestinian negotiators. ``First the Knesset recess,
then municipal elections, then the Americans are busy with
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key point now is that this government of Netanyahu
either cannot take the decision or does not want to take the
decision. Either way they want a pretext for a lack of decision by
this process of meetings, envoys, talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week Netanyahu gave the impression of a man
seriously intent on achieving an agreement. He refrained from
blaming the Palestinian Authority for a botched terror attack in
Jerusalem on Sunday, he avoided his usual litanies of accusations
against the Palestinians and he told reporters that he was ready to
meet Arafat round the clock to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kahalani's visit to Arafat was apparently linked to the threat
by his small, centrist party, the Third Way, to quit Netanyahu's
coalition unless it agreed to make the withdrawal in the West Bank
that the United States has sought as a condition for resuming
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After 90 minutes of talks, Kahalani and Arafat emerged smiling
and promising to meet again. That appeared to be enough for
Kahalani to call off his threat of pulling out of the government.
``This week it sounds to me we are going to close the gap, and I
don't think there is a reason to make this kind of decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian officials said nothing substantive had changed
through this meeting, nor in one on Thursday between Arafat and
Netanyahu's coalition chairman, Meir Sheetrit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arafat treated Sheetrit to lunch and a promise that he would
seriously consider the Israeli's suggestion that the Palestinian
leader meet directly with Netanyahu. Sheetrit attributed what he
perceived as his success to ``Sheetrit charm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes one's image makes all the difference,'' he told
reporters. ``That's one of the prime minister's problems _ his
image in the Palestinians' eyes, which I think is wrong _ regarding
his desire for peace. The ball is now in Arafat's court.''
</P>
<P>
   However charmed he might have been by Sheetrit or Kahalani,
Arafat did not cancel his plan to travel early next week to
Austria, which is assuming the rotating leadership of the European
Union. The trip only served to further cool expectations of a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In public at least, Arafat's consistent position before and
after all the meetings has been that he is awaiting Netanyahu's
reply to the U.S. proposal, which calls on Israel to withdraw from
a further 13 percent of the West Bank. It also calls on the
Palestinians to undertake a concrete set of measures against
terrorism and to complete the revision of the Palestinian charter,
which originally called for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he accepts the U.S. proposals. He has also
declared that he will proclaim a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999,
the date by which the Oslo agreements were to have produced a final
settlement, unless an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, intensive efforts by the United States,
including threats by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, have
failed to secure a concrete decision from Netanyahu. The issue of a
further withdrawal has generated constant threats from within his
coalition, with the right wing fiercely opposing a full 13 percent
and centrists like the Third Way and Mordechai insisting that
Netanyahu agree.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's meeting on Sunday with Abbas, who is better known as
Abu Mazen, came about after the United States reportedly declared
it had exhausted its efforts, and believed that the two sides had
to overcome the final hurdles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai reportedly came to the Palestinians with a ``10 plus
3'' proposal under which Israel would cede control over another 10
percent of the West Bank, while another 3 percent, in areas near
Jewish settlements, would be turned into a ``nature preserve,''
where the Palestinians could not build and Israel would have
security control. Mordechai also reportedly softened Israeli
demands that the Palestinians should convene the full 500-member
Palestinian National Council, the parliament of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, to adopt a new charter.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians listened to the ideas, but reiterated that they
were awaiting Israel's reply to the full U.S. proposal. They said
the ``nature preserve'' proposal effectively kept the land in full
Israeli control, as it is now, under what is termed ``Area C'' in
the Oslo agreements. Area A is fully under Palestinian control, and
Area B is under joint control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to me without specific percentages, without maps,
saying that they intended to maintain overall security, including
public order, and a veto on planning and zoning,'' Erekat said. ``I
said I will answer like in the American television show,
`Jeopardy': `What is Area C?' What they really offered is Area C.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's aides told reporters that Arafat was playing his
usual 11th-hour stalling game to extract more concessions, and that
a breakthrough really was imminent and possible.
</P>
<P>
   But after so many months of delays, it was not only Erekat who
was not convinced. ``We've been through this too many times
before,'' Joseph Alpher, director of the Israel office of the
American Jewish Committee, was quoted as saying. ``It's too early
to conclude that this is a truly serious attempt.'' &QL;

FLEET, BANKBOSTON ATM FEE PLAN COULD FACE ANTITRUST SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A plan by New England's two largest banks to introduce a maximum
$1 ATM surcharge on customers from other banks and not raise the
fee for two years may violate antitrust laws, the state attorney
general's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In antitrust laws, agreements among competitors to set maximum
fees have been held illegal,'' said Barbara Anthony, chief of the
Public Protection Bureau at Massachusetts Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger's office. ``This office is concerned about certain
antitrust issues raised by this agreement between the two banks and
is reviewing and examining the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, whose bureau handles antitrust issues, said officials
would meet with banks next week to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group, Inc. and BankBoston Corp., which own
two-thirds of all automated teller machines in Massachusetts, said
on Thursday they would adhere to a proposal by the 210-member
Massachusetts Bankers Association to charge non-customers a maximum
$1 surcharge per ATM transaction over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the two Boston-based banks, which hold 40 percent of
all deposits in the state, was a compromise designed to appease
consumer advocates and lawmakers who have been urging legislators
to ban ATM surcharges outright.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Bankers Association executive vice president Kevin
F. Kiley said the ATM surcharge plan was not a formal agreement but
rather a set of voluntary guidelines _ a distinction he said meant
the surcharge does not violate antitrust laws. A banking lawyer who
declined to be identified echoed that thought. Fleet and BankBoston
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of ATM surcharges contend the fees will hurt small banks
and drive their customers into the arms of larger banks, which have
more ATMs. A $1 surcharge covering 3,200 ATMs in Massachusetts
processing an average 7,000 transactions a month _ 25 percent of
them for customers from banks other than those which own the ATMS _
would cost consumers $60 million a year, according to the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The banks say non-clients should have to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston already charges its own customers a $2 dollar fee
each time they use another bank's ATM, but it has not decided if or
when it will levy surcharges on customers at its New Hampshire,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island branches. Fleet charges non-customers
using its ATM machines a $1 fee in four states outside
Massachusetts. The two banks have said they may forge agreements
allowing other banks to pay the fee directly rather than levy it on
non-customers who use BankBoston or Fleet ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The State Senate passed a bill last year preventing banks from
charging non-customers any fees for using their ATMS, but the House
has yet to vote on the matter. House Speaker Thomas Finneran
opposes the bill.

 &HT;    SECURITY IN CAPITOL TIGHT, WELL-MANNED
 &HT;    With CAPITOL-SHOOTING.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Getting into the Capitol with a gun is extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The public is only allowed into the Capitol through a few
entrances and everyone _ except members of the House and Senate _
must pass through metal detectors similar to those found at
airports. Large bags must be placed on an X-ray machine that shows
a video of their contents.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members and journalists are allowed in some entrances
barred to the public, but they still must pass through a metal
detector and have their bags searched by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Most tourists enter the Capitol through the double-doors on the
east side in the center of the building which lead into the massive
rotunda. There are two banks of metal detectors and X-ray machines
which must be navigated. This is apparently where the suspect
entered the Capitol, setting off the detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill is a large sprawling complex which consists not
only of the dome-capped Capitol but also three enormous office
buildings on the House side and another three on the Senate side.
The office buildings are connected to the Capitol through
underground tunnels. There are metal detectors and X-ray machines
at the entrances to the tunnels which are manned by uniform police.
</P>
<P>
   Public entrances to the House and Senate office buildings also
are limited and have metal detectors. Usually there are one or two
uniformed Capitol police officers at each entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza on the east front of the Capitol has been sealed to
traffic since a bomb went off on the Senate side in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol, security is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed police officers are to be found almost everywhere,
particularly on the second and third floors where the House and
Senate chambers are located. Plain-clothed officers roam the
corridors and are stationed near the offices of congressional
leaders, including Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are free to roam through the Rotunda on the second
floor and the crypt _ the circular room below the rotunda _ on the
first floor, where there are numerous displays of Capitol history.
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor, where the shooting occurred, tourists can
walk down a central corridor lined with statues toward the south,
or House side, of the building. DeLay's office is on that corridor.
They also can walk down a similar corridor toward the north, or
Senate side, and eat in a restaurant.

NBC PLAYS IT SAFE WHILE THE WILY fOX TAKES ALL THE RISKS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Warren Littlefield, master kidder and actor
wannabe, was introduced the other day as the network president most
likely to find positives in the most dire of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a roomful of critics ready to pounce on NBC's
proliferation of newsmagazines and its breezy dismissal of cable
competitors, Littlefield cued up a video to comically drill holes
into the premise that after ``Seinfeld's'' departure, he was this
close to stepping in front of a moving train.
</P>
<P>
   On the video, a collapsed Littlefield is wheeled into, yep,
``ER,'' where the drama's core players revive him by playing the
show's theme music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go anywhere!'' he tells each cast member, getting
promises from everyone except the departing George Clooney, who
nervously quips, ``Uh, hmm, gotta make a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   The video ends with Littlefield strutting through the ER to the
tune of the Bee Gees' ``Staying Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK _ you had to be there. But Littlefield wants to make the
point that America's most-watched entertainment network, the one
that still commands enormous respect on Thursday nights, is doing
fine.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer holes to fill than its competitors and ``Frasier''
taking over ``Seinfeld's'' real estate, Littlefield again gets to
watch the network ships sink from the safe, snug confines of a
lifeboat.
</P>
<P>
   And safe is the operative word here. What's distressing about
the new series NBC showcased for critics at this semiannual
gathering is how bland and shielded they are _ in premise or
execution or both. It's as if this is a championship team playing
``not'' to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the return of ``Married ... With
Children's'' Christina Appelgate, but there's nothing distinctive
about her sitcom, ``Jesse,'' in which she plays a harried waitress
who wants to be a nurse taking care of a bunch of clueless guys _ a
father, brother and son. Older and looking more sophisticated,
Appelgate acknowledged that she has no idea whether the audience
will accept her ``with clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   On that note, Bo Derek resurfaced, too, arriving on the NBC
press stage along with a crew of incredibly good-looking young men
to discuss ``Wind on Water,'' a poorly acted drama about ``a large
youthful cast seeking love and adventure in the world of extreme
sports competition.'' The pilot episode was just as vague.
</P>
<P>
   The series is produced by Zalman King, he of ``Wild Orchid'' and
``Red Shoe Diaries,'' projects in which cinematic style and nudity
work as one. Since the series, called a family drama, is scheduled
to air at 7 p.m. on Saturdays, the best King could do was some
terrific slow-mo water scenes (the young bods are always surfing)
and Derek in a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still got it,'' King observes, at least for her age,
which was exposed when one of her young co-stars, Brian Gross, said
he had no idea who Derek was, ``but my dad and my grandpa sure
did.'' With that compliment, Derek popped the poor guy upside the
back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC's most controversial series is controversial for what
it ``won't do.'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is an energetic, well-crafted
sitcom about a woman who'd have the perfect man if only she could
sleep with him. He's gay, a fact revealed in the pilot's first
scene when the two are seen simultaneously salivating over George
Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   Friends since college, the two _ played by Debra Messing and
Eric McCormack _ are so close it's almost annoying. Funny, smart
and devoid of the usual gay stereotypes (wisely, Will is the
understated gay guy and his friend is the overstated,
Broadway-show-tunes-loving gay guy), ``Will &AMP; Grace'' will
inevitably face the issue of dating and, dare we say, kissing. And
you thought a lesbian's libido was difficult terrain in ``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   James Burrows, the show's executive producer, best known for
``Cheers,'' dug himself a hole early by insisting that they weren't
interested in ``politicizing'' the show by giving Will a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Questioners, led mostly by angry, offended gay and lesbian
critics, ripped into his statements mercilessly, asking, ``What's
inherently political about two gay men having a sex life?''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows stumbled nervously through the answer, finally saying,
``I think to go to that area takes away from the essence of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   McCormack, a product of Canadian theater, isn't gay, so brace
for the inevitable charges that this is proof of television's
discomfort in casting gays in gay roles. Muddling the proceedings
was the presence of Max Mutchnick. One of the few openly gay
writer/producers in Hollywood, Mutchnick sounded much like the
straight producers.

TWO FIRMS TO DEVELOP LINUX-BASED PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The upstart Linux operating system took another step toward the
mainstream this week, as two leading makers of corporate database
software said they would begin developing products for use on Linux
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But not every Linux backer is happy. Indeed, a Massachusetts
computer scientist who played a major role in the development of
Linux has denounced the latest development as a violation of the
principles on which Linux is based.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Corp., the world's largest maker of database software,
will develop a Linux version of its Oracle8 database. The company
will also produce Linux versions of other Oracle business
applications, for tasks like product ordering and inventory
management.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jarvis , Oracle's senior vice president of marketing, said
there's a growing demand for heavy-duty business software that can
run on Linux, because companies don't want to be locked into using
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. Linux is a
high-quality alternative that is available free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheaper than NT and it's actually more reliable than
NT,'' said Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another database software company, Informix Corp.,
announced that it has begun selling a Linux-compatible version of
its Informix-SE software for small- and medium-sized businesses.
Steve Lambright , senior manager for server products for Informix,
said that customers have been clamoring for a Linux version of the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is an operating system that works like the advanced Unix
system developed by AT&AMP;T Corp. But it runs on regular desktop
computers and is available at no charge. A large part of Linux was
created by the GNU Project, a team of programmers associated with
the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But the head of the foundation, Richard Stallman , isn't
thrilled about the growing acceptance of his work. Stallman
believes that all software should be ``free.'' That doesn't mean
the software cannot be sold. Instead, Stallman says software makers
should allow customers to make copies of their products, and even
alter the underlying computer code in any way they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle and Informix, like most software companies, copyright
their work and don't allow users to give copies to friends.
Stallman considers this immoral. ``It's the sort of thing that, if
there was a Satan, Satan would find very effective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is distributed according to Stallman's principles. Anyone
can make an infinite number of copies and modify the code. Stallman
said he was appalled that Linux users might embrace ``non-free''
software that violates the Linux philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman admitted that the moves by Oracle and Informix would
likely lead to broader use of Linux, but he says it's not worth the
sacrifice of his principles.

LOS ANGELES: straight producers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The honest truth,'' he said, ``we're not hiding from anything.
I feel like you guys want us to talk about something that hasn't
come up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, NBC is also taking hits over Kyle Secor's character on
``Homicide: Life on the Streets,'' whose story arc last season
suggested bisexuality. While picking up ``Homicide's'' Television
Critics Award for best drama series, Tom Fontana spoke glowingly
about Littlefield, saying he was the reason the ratings-challenged
drama has stayed on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, while introducing new ``Homicide'' cast
members Michael Michele and Giancarlo Esposito, Fontana criticized
NBC for its skittishness on that story line.
</P>
<P>
   When Littlefield showed up for his semiannual State of NBC
address just a couple hours later, he told reporters, ``I wasn't
aware that I was uncomfortable with Kyle Secor's sexual ambiguity.
The question that we did ask was, how long are you going to keep
this ambiguous? Is there going to be a declaration one way or the
other?''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Littlefield listed the TV remote as NBC's most feared
enemy, and suggested that the network needs to stay ahead by not
taking silly risks. This steamed Fox's Entertainment Group
President Peter Roth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think holding the line _ it's about as anathema to the Fox
philosophy as you can possibly imagine,'' Roth said. ``I have no
intention, ever, of being satisfied with holding the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Fox have such a luxury. Roth backed up his tough words
with the introduction of some, well, intriguing fare. In
``Brimstone,'' Peter Horton is Ezekiel Stone, a dead former cop
dispatched by the devil to find 113 of his disciples who escaped.
``Costello'' features standup comic Sue Costelloas a bartender
constantly at odds with her traditional Irish Catholic family and
friends. Her favorite word in the pilot can't be printed here,
which illustrates its approach.

   Diane English's ``Living in Captivity,'' a comedy about life in
the suburbs, features an Archie Bunker-type bigot (Lenny Venito),
although English would prefer the description, ``ignorant. He has
never even known a African-American, let alone an Asian or
Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't appear till midseason, but the best of the Fox lot
might again be an animated series. ``The PJ's'' is clay animation
and takes a satirical look at life in a big-city housing project.
The pedigree is impressive: Eddie Murphy created the series; Ron
Howard and Brian Grazer are producers. Judging from a four-minute
clip, it has the potential to be downright hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' dropped by to
discuss his developing half-hour series, ``Futurama,'' which is set
1,000 years from now and will bring his unique and satirical humor
to ``this unconventional family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't do this anywhere but on Fox,'' Groening said.
``The other networks could never look outside their box and do this
sort of thing. And you'd think that would have changed with ``The
Simpsons.'' They're innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly are. The other night, Fox rented the hotel's
large, indoor garage and turned it into a '70s disco hall, filled
with lava lamps, smile buttons, 8-tracks and beanbag chairs. Roth
showed up at the party dressed in bell-bottom bluejeans and
platform shoes, as did the cast of ``That '70s Show,'' a fall
sitcom set in the 1970s and featuring young, promising unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing to '70s hits until late in the evening, a good time was
had by all, except perhaps The Monkees' Mickey Dolenz, who was
brought in to give nostalgic resonance to the proceedings. In a
graying ponytail and black suit, he strolled around kind of
aimlessly, mostly alone, with people pointing to him and saying,
``That's what's-his-name ...''
</P>
<P>
   Roth had better hope his series isn't treated like Dolenz, a
'70s relic no one remembers _ or cares about.

OUTLOOK BRIGHTENS FOR INCREASE IN FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Prospects for a plan to boost the number of
skilled foreign workers admitted to the United States improved
sharply Friday, after lawmakers reached an agreement on measures
aimed at protecting American workers from layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by Congress, the annual quota of foreigners admitted
on so-called H-1B visas would rise to 115,000 by the year 2001, up
from 65,000 today. The agreement would also add 20,000 to this
year's quota, which had been filled in May, leaving employers with
no available visas until the next federal fiscal year begins in
October.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms say a higher quota of foreign workers is needed
because the booming economy has left thousands of US computer jobs
vacant. H-1B visas are good for six years and are used to fill a
variety of skilled jobs, from computer programmer to nurse to
fashion model.
</P>
<P>
   But employee groups and labor unions quickly criticized the
congressional compromise, saying it would allow employers to use
low-cost foreign labor instead of raising wages to attract American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a sell-out of American college graduates,''
said Jack Golodner, president of the AFL-CIO Department of
Professional Employees, which represents 4 million professional,
technical and administrative workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary question is still whether there really is a
shortage of skilled workers, and many measures say there is not,''
said Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, a higher quota for visas was supported by EMC
Corp., Cognex Inc. and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal reached Friday, certain employers who want to use
H-1B labor would have to certify that they have not laid off an
American worker before hiring a foreigner, and that they tried to
recruit Americans before hiring foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   A House committee had voted that all employers should have to
sign those certifications, but the compromise says the rule applies
only to ``heavy users'' of the visas. Heavy users are likely to be
defined as employers who hire H-1B labor as 15 percent or more of
their work forces, but that could change as final language is
drafted, said an aide to Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent rule appears aimed at so-called ``job-shoppers,''
or businesses that bring in foreign labor only to hire the workers
out to other employers. ``That's where the problems have been,''
said Allen Kay, the Smith aide. ``The Intels and Microsofts -- you
rarely see any signficant complaint against them, and there is no
evidence of serious problems with their use of H-1B visas. So the
safeguard is focused where the problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This both protects American workers while raising the cap for
visas,'' said Sandy Boyd of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But Golodner of the AFL-CIO complained that big companies, with
thousands of employees, would never fall under the certification
requirement because they could hire hundreds of H-1B workers
without reaching the 15 percent mark. ``Big employers are off the
hook,'' he said. The protections for US workers ``are cosmetic, but
nothing more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also says that complaints about a company laying
off Americans to hire H-1B workers would be investigated by a
three-member arbitration panel selected by the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   Labor groups criticized this provision as ineffective, while
employer groups applauded it. Traditionally, enforcement of the
H-1B program has been handled by the Department of Labor, but
employer groups feared more federal intervention in their hiring
practices.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the arbitration panels would have money or
authority to actively investigate complaints. Kay, of Smith's
office, said details of the arbitration rules had not yet been
drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise would have to be approved by the House and
Senate. The Senate has already voted to boost the number of visas,
but its bill included no certification requirements for employers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had threatened to veto any increase in H-1B
visas unless it included protections for American workers and a
worker-training component. Kay said a worker-training plan would be
part of the final bill.

   ``The Bully Pulpit''

   _
</P>
<P>
   Religion and politics shouldn't mix, some would say, but a
sizable chunk of humanity has never bought into that. And as long
as that remains true, scholars will have something to write about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious fundamentalisms couple a premodern sensibility with
an instrumental exploitation of modernity (for example, the
employment of modern arms and technologies),'' writes professor
Bassam Tibi of the University of Gottingen, ``and it is for this
reason that I consider the politicization of religion as the
greatest challenge to cultural modernity and the gravest threat to
world stability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Challenge of Fundamentalism'' is an academic critique of
politicized Islam. Tibi asserts that those who seek an ``Islamic
order'' to replace secular, Western-style nation-states have
presented no concrete outline of their ideal government; that the
Islamic world is too culturally fragmented to sustain it anyway;
and that such radicals can nevertheless cause the world
considerable trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi is a self-described ``liberal Muslim,'' but he does not
focus on theology. He does, however, distinguish between Islam as a
faith and the religio-political ideology he criticizes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dismiss any suspicions of disparaging wordplay in the
title of ``The Bully Pulpit.'' This study by James Guth, John
Green, Corwin Smidt, Lyman Kellstedt and Margaret Poloma is a
scrupulously neutral assessment of the politics of Protestant
clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The five collegiate scholars present a detailed analysis of the
views and actions of leaders in four evangelical denominations (the
Assemblies of God, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Evangelical
Covenant Church and the Christian Reformed Church) and four
mainline groups (the Reformed Church in America, the United
Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the
Disciples of Christ). The book considers what issues clergy see as
important, how they vote, how they view political activism, how
they are likely to be active, and how various theological and
political factors intertwine.
</P>
<P>
   The authors find a distinct split between ``orthodox'' clergy,
who tend toward political conservatism and the Republican Party,
and ``modernist'' religious leaders, who tend toward liberalism and
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bully Pulpit'' outlines its statistical findings in some
detail, but it still remains accessible to the lay reader.

 &HT;    GUN VIOLENCE IN CAPITOL NOT UNPRECEDENTED
 &HT;    With CAPITOL-SHOOTING-0725.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The shots fired on Friday were the fourth such
incident in the U.S. Capitol, a structure that has been the scene
of several acts of violence, including three bombings, in its
nearly 200-year history. Among the other incidents:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 7, 1993 -- A bomb that exploded in a window seat in
the corridor of the empty Senate chamber in November of 1983
stunned the capital and led to a security crack down. Soon
afterwards, Capitol police set up metal detectors at entrances and
began requiring identification tags for staff and journalists.
Three people later pleaded guilty in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1, 1971 -- A bomb demolished a restroom in the old
Senate wing, doing extensive damage to a hearing room and the
Senate barber shop, but not injuring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 2, 1915 -- A homemade bomb damaged a Senate reception
room. It had been placed there by Erich Muenter, a former
instructor of German at Harvard University who was upset by private
sales of U.S. weapons to the Allies in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1, 1954 -- Five members of the House were wounded on the
floor of the House of Representatives by three gun-wielding Puerto
Rican extremist nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 12, 1947 -- Sen. John W. Bricker, R-Ohio, was shot at
twice in the subway tunnel under the Capitol. His attacker was a
disgruntled former Capitol policeman. The senator was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  February 28, 1890 -- Charles E. Kincaid, a correspondent for
the Louisville Times, shot former Rep. William P. Taulbee, D-Ky.,
in a stairway in an argument over a scandal report in the
newspaper. Taulbee later died from his wounds.

`GH' STAR FINDS PARADISE IN THE VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Brad Maule's a happy guy.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing well-broken-in jeans and a t-shirt, perched on the
stucco ledge around the rear balcony of his Sherman Oaks home
overlooking a rain-forest-like back yard, he's strumming his guitar
and singing one of the tunes he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, I would stay here all night long
</P>
<P>
   Just to see the moonlight on your face.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me it's time to walk away
</P>
<P>
   And common sense tells me there's a price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   But my heart only knows what it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my secret place,'' explains the star of ABC's
``General Hospital.'' ``I come here to work on my music. I can be
quiet and sit. And'' _ he grinned _ ``if I lock the door, nobody
can find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Maule's a hermit. In his neighborhood, he's just the
guy next door. And to his wife and kids, he's Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   But to the nearly 4.5 million ``GH'' viewers, he's crazed,
baby-kidnapping neurosurgeon Dr. Tony Jones, a character light
years away from the good ol' Texas fella who finds happiness in a
song, a splash in the pool and a cuddle with the kids and the
family's small herd of cats and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Maule, wife Laverne and their kids live in a renovated 1920s
home filled with the actor's own paintings, eclectic Mexican and
religious pieces, and a back yard with a pool and a fish pond.
</P>
<P>
   His real life is far different from life on the ``GH'' set,
where Tony Jones has morphed over the past year from the loyal
husband and dedicated doctor he's been since 1983 to a dangerous
man just this side of insanity, the result of his daughter's death
and his wife's infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a turnaround the laid-back Maule relishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a ball on the show,'' he said with a grin. ``I had
to play that good guy so long, it's great to play something else.
I'm not the old, dull Tony anymore. That Tony's gone _ probably
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   His character may live life on the edge, but Maule's rock-solid,
retreating each day after work to a home that looks like any other
on a tree-lined street off Ventura Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside, and it's like being inside an adobe art gallery,
with heavy Mission-style furniture, pierced-tin picture frames,
clay religious figures and primitive art. Weather-beaten leather
chaps Maule's father once wore when herding cattle hang on the
wall, a piece of 3-D western art.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee table _ a piece of heavy glass balanced on two giant
concrete fish sculptures _ is covered with family photos. An
old-fashioned ladies' ``fainting couch'' has been reupholstered in
a western-themed print. The dining-room table was once a heavy
wooden door, with legs added. What looks like a church pew along
one wall is a stripped-down reject from the ABC lot, where it had
been covered with ugly '60s naugahyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never pay retail,'' Maule advised with a grin, running a hand
over the grain in the pew's wood. ``Go to a garage sale. You get
the best stuff, and you don't have to spend an arm and a leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maule house is filled with children's laughter, the ringing
of phones, skittering cats and dirty-footed dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children were babies when we moved in here, so they've got
a whole street full of `grandparents','' Maule said. ``We love it
here. We've got great restaurants two blocks away, a great hiking
trail two blocks away. It's a great neighborhood. If you're leaving
town, you tell your neighbors, and they'll put your garbage out and
pick up your mail.''
</P>
<P>
   His kids _ daughter Lily, 10; son Hunter, 11; and Laverne's son
Michael, 19, who just finished his freshman year at the University
of North Carolina _ are unimpressed with what Dad does for a
living. They only know they like to hit him up for cash regularly
and splash with him in the backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think acting is a silly job,'' he said. ``They want to be
jocks. They were born with me doing what I'm doing, so for them,
it's not that weird.''
</P>
<P>
   When the musical muse calls, Maule migrates to the tiny backyard
balcony, where he works on his second career: singing and
songwriting. He's produced a video and two albums of
country-western songs and is working on a third CD; he's also a
featured performer on a ``GH'' album released earlier this year,
singing ``My Heart Only Knows What It Feels'' and an upbeat
country-western tune, ``There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With Me That You
Can't Fix.'' He's sung both songs on ``GH.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the comma-shaped pool, the Maule back yard holds a tiny
guesthouse that doubles as a playhouse for the kids, and the garden
is filled with trees that yield bananas, olives and plums _ plus a
rare coral tree _ that are legacies of silent-film actor Gino
Carrato, who built the home. The trees, plus a stand of bamboo that
keeps spreading in spite of efforts to curb it, provide a curtain
of privacy from neighboring homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a good time here, so much fun,'' Maule said. ``We
just like to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   Family has always been important to Maule, whose parents _
married for 56 years _ still live on the family farm near a wide
spot in the road called Hobbs, Texas (pop. 36).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great sense of belonging. My roots are like an old
mesquite tree; they go down and down and down,'' he said. ``Every
song I write goes back to there.''
</P>
<P>
   He _ and a four-years-older brother who died at 17 of a heart
defect _ were raised doing chores and playing in the fields. The
budding actor left home to live with his grandmother when he was a
teen-ager so he could enroll in theater classes at a junior high in
Snyder, 20 miles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   After earning degrees in English and theater from Stephen F.
Austin University, Maule began to pick up acting jobs wherever he
could, including performing in a regional spectacle celebrating
Texas history ``for about 20 cents an hour. What I was really doing
was riding a horse on stage and shooting a gun and yelling,
`Yahoo'!''
</P>
<P>
   With hopes high, he headed for Hollywood and the big time. Five
weeks later, his bankroll had dwindled to $11, and he was living on
half a meatloaf sandwich a day. To keep from going home a failure,
he joined a singing group on a yearlong tour that ended in Hawaii,
where he donned a flowered shirt and became a backup singer for
tourist heartthrob Don Ho.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back to Los Angeles after a couple of years, he worked as
a backup singer for Bobby Gentry and acted in one play after
another, winning a Drama Logue Award in 1983 for his performance in
Stephen Sondheim's musical, ``Marry Me a Little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in genuine show business. And the rest is just an
incredible success story of one tragic, silly job after another,''
Maule said, laughing. ``But I still wanted to be in television. I
wanted to act.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been accepted into the chorus of the first national
company of ``Evita'' when he landed a guest spot on ``Charlie's
Angels,'' the hottest show on TV in the late '70s. But the
``Evita'' director refused to give him time off to do the show, so
he quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opted out of culture and theater for `Charlie's Angels.' I
never looked back, and I never regretted it.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break came a few weeks later. When singing star Andy
Gibb failed to show up to sing ``Arthur's Theme'' for the American
Movie Awards, Maule was stuffed into an usher's tuxedo and sang the
song for a nationwide television audience. Somehow, a tape of the
show found its way onto the desk of the ``GH'' casting director,
who saw the fresh-faced singer from Texas as Dr. Tony Jones, the
new neurosurgeon in the fictional town of Port Charles, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't life bizarre?'' said Maule with a grin. ``All of a
sudden, I was on TV. And I'm still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maule continues to perform in musical theater and concerts
around the country as his schedule permits. And he makes time every
year to emcee a telethon for the West Texas Rehabilitation Center,
where his brother was treated free of charge before he died because
the Maule family had no money.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the Maules have an easygoing marriage that'll be 14
years old in December. He's the family's public figure, and she's
the support staff; she recently gave up a longtime stressful career
as a certified public accountant to work at being a free-lance
fiction writer.
</P>
<P>
   Laverne Maule says her husband is a protector, a lover, a
companion, a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to take care of people, and he does it well,'' she
said. ``He can cook _ whip up whatever: pasta, salads _ and he's a
better cleaner than I am. And when things get crazy, he'll take
just me out to dinner, or we'll take a drive, have private `date
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is out of the question when the two appear in public. As
a longtime ``GH'' cast member, Maule is often mobbed by autograph
seekers _ especially since his character's attitude turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this story started, people stop me all the time and say,
`We hate you, we really hate you _ but we understand','' Maule
said. ``Then there's a small percentage of people who think you are
the character. They think you can't act that crazy on TV and not be
warped in real life. That's when it gets real spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently on a plane to Las Vegas, a male passenger struck up a
seemingly innocent conversation. Then he suddenly became convinced
that Maule was crazy Tony Jones and began yelling and screaming at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers around me were defending me. They were like, `Leave
him alone; he's just an actor.' He was still screaming at me as we
landed, accusing me of ruining the morals of the whole United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   But on another occasion, a woman thanked Maule for playing out
the emotional story line of the death of Tony's daughter, B.J., and
the donation of her heart to another child (he won an Emmy
nomination for that story line), saying it helped her get over her
own daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of thing I really appreciate,'' he said. ``It
makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Maule's CDs are available only by mail order. For information,

EVERTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's a cruel world out there and suddenly you're
alone. Mom and Dad aren't always there to give you a hug and tell
you tomorrow will be a better day ... or dispense advice about how
to keep afloat in love and office politics.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, you've got Aristotle, Plato and Socrates to cuddle up
to. No, Miz Hot Tips isn't talking about the philosophers, but a
trio of electronic talking plush animal guides inspired by the PBS
animated series ``Adventures From the Book of Virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   She was recently introduced to Socrates, a cute orange bobcat
with eyebrows that look like furry caterpillars, and as she
squeezed his paw heard reassuring comments like ``It's OK to be
afraid,'' and ``Now, you're cookin'. The little guy now talks in
slow-mo because everybody in Miz Hot Tips' office came over for a
hug, but new AA batteries should have it up to speed in no time.
</P>
<P>
   The furry talking pets who dispense words of compassion, faith,
loyalty, honesty, perserverance, courage and responsibility (just
like Mom or Aunt Dottie) are made by the Family Co., priced at
$27.99 at Toys R Us and other toy stores. Best of all, you can turn
them off when you've had enough advice and not hurt anybody's
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of waking up to an annoying buzzzzz, or Mom shaking
you, Nickelodeon has invented the Rugrats Talking Alarm Clock. Not
to worry, as it's G-rated, with music and cutesy comments from the
TV show characters. Among them are ``I kind of like you the way you
are,'' and ``I think we'd better go now.'' The colorful clock is
$24.99 at toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   WAL-MART MANIA: Everybody's been talking about how great
Wal-Mart stores are, so Miz Hot Tips finally got over to the
Panorama Mall in Panorama City to see the Valley's first Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   She was impressed. It's not just another oversize drug store, as
she was led to believe. Housed in the old Broadway store,
merchandise is displayed more like a real department store than
other stores in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't been there yet, you can find children's
school uniforms, a huge lingerie department, fancy wrought-iron
patio furniture and even fabric by the yard. The store has a
restaurant and kids' toy zone with coin-operated rides, too.
</P>
<P>
   FANCY FURNISHINGS: Z Gallerie has finally opened at the
Promenade in Woodland Hills, and Miz Hot Tips found it worth the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   The place is huge, filled with cool film noir furnishings, from
black dressers, oversize chairs with ottomans, and dark velvet
sofas and draperies. There are even some stunning reproductions of
old movie posters in retro frames to complete the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Cheery floral plates with a '50s mood are there, too, as well as
a witty collection of bathroom accessories. Miz Hot Tips' fave is
the yellow rubber ducky attached to a drain stopper for about $5.
</P>
<P>
   If you're on the prowl for new furniture, also check out
Resources House and Garden, which recently opened at 8440 Santa
Monica Blvd., West Hollywood. You'll find new and old furnishings,
plus a cafe and flower stand.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're in the market for window coverings, there's the
new 3 Day Blinds &AMP; More showroom that opened earlier this month at
6537 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park. It's got draperies, swags
and valances, too.
</P>
<P>
   ON MALL PATROL: The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks now has an
electric vehicle charging station and a bunch of new businesses,
including Regis Hairstylists, Island Nut House, King of Knives,
Thomas Kinkade Gallery and People's Pottery. A fall opening is
planned for Banana Republic, Pottery Barn, Nickelodeon, Toys
International, K B Toys, Skechers (the sneaker store) and LaSalsa.

REMEMBER ``YELLOW RAIN?'' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Defense Department report last week put a final spike through
the CNN/Time report that US forces had used nerve gas on a secret
raid in Laos in 1970s. American stocks of sarin &UR;  &LR; gas were no nearer
than Okinawa, the Pentagon said. Only a few cranks will continue to
subscribe to the idea that American commandos spewed deadly nerve
gas in their choppers' wakes during Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Why such passion over the details of a battle fought more than a
quarter century ago? It is worth thinking about the matter a
little, for it offers some revealing clues to the climate of
opinion in the present day, both political and economic.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that questions about nerve gas kindled so quickly
into sensational reporting is that troops may have gone into battle
that day with the atropine syrettes that are supposed to serve as
the antidote to nerve gas _ three apiece, according to a medical
corpsman who accompanied the Tailwind force. To &UR;  &LR; possess even one
of these syrettes was unusual in those days, but it happened that
they were handed out sometimes in remote locations. Nerve gas was
something that the American army feared that its enemies might
employ in mortar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   These fears were fanned into flames starting in late 1970s, when
reports began to filter out that Hmong tribesmen in Laos, loyal to
the Americans, were being subjected to attacks by Laotian
communists using a strange new weapon that took the form of clouds
of droplets, usually yellow. These ``yellow rain'' attacks were
said by tribesmen to be associated with jets and propeller-driven
planes, artillery and mortar shells, hand grenades, and landmines.
They were said to cause vomitting, hemorrhagic bleeding, and
sometimes death.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time of extraordinary brutality in Asia. The Vietnam
War had just ended. The episodes of the Killing Fields, the Boat
People, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan had begun. ``Laos was a
black hole during the war,'' as Peter Arnett said recently,
explaining much. ``A lot went on there that we didn't know about.''
To knowledgable observers, the yellow rain reports were plausible
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In due course the issue was taken over by the editorial page of
The Wall Street Journal, which promptly connected the attacks
against the Hmong to the Soviet Union. In those days the Journal's
ed page was just beginning to accumulate an audience that for a
time would become one of the largest and most sophisticated
readerships in the world. Its editors recognized just how potent a
symbol of evil might be biological warfare waged against a
primitive tribe _ all the more so since it would be a ruthless
violation of a 1972 treaty banning chemical and biological weapons
that had been held up as one of the fruits of detente.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in yellow rain quickly became a central tenet of the
foreign policy of the Reagan Revolution, part of the rationale for
its ``Star Wars''-led military build-up. The Soviets denied the
charge, but Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. announced in a
celebrated speech in West Berlin in September 1981 that the United
States finally had obtained ``physical evidence'' of biological
warfare in Laos: telltale yellow spots a few millimeters in
diameter deposited on samples of leaves and twigs.
</P>
<P>
   First Haig, then his State Department successor George Shultz,
asserted in full-dress reports to Congress that yellow rain as a
biological weapon was a proven fact. It was a vital part of the
case against the ``Evil Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Then just as quickly as it had arisen, the government's case
collapsed _ at least the most prominent part of it, the physical
evidence, the dozens of samples of yellow rain turned in by Hmong
refugees. US tests had concentrated on isolating the active
poisonous ingredient, a substance known chemically as
trichothecenes, but when a British scientist looked at a sample of
yellow rain under an ordinary light microscope, it turned out to
consist entirely of pollen. Caught by surprise, the government
countered that the Soviets apparently were deliberately mixing in
pollen with their chemical agents, in order to enhance their
poisonous effect.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1983, a Yale University expert on bees suggested that
yellow rain was nothing more complicated than the feces of honey
bees deposited during cleansing flights after winter hibernation _
and that the tricothecenes that had been identified (in tests never
replicated outside of a couple of government labs) were either
naturally occurring or inadvertant contaminants. When laboratories
around the world studied the American samples, it turned out that
every last specimen of yellow rain consisted of the empty husks of
pollen grains, such as those digested by bees.
</P>
<P>
   A period of intense scrutiny among scientists and policy-makers
followed; fairly quickly the matter was resolved. Scientific
American, Nature, and Chemical and Engineering News weighed in
against the government's case, C&AMP;E News in the course of a 27-page
special section calling it ``tenuous at best.'' Three broad
failures to persuade were noted: no corpses were produced, nor
blood or urine samples containing tricothecenes; no credible
eyewitnesses were found; no pieces of a delivery system were
produced.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in Foreign Policy in 1987, Harvard University
biochemistry professor Matthew Meselson drove home the point: in
order to assure maximum impact for its 1981 charge, the government
had bypassed the president's science adviser, the Defense Science
Board, and the National Academy of Sciences. With virtually no
support in established channels from scientific experts in chemical
and biological warefare, the governent's case had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal didn't retract its claims, however;
instead it escalated them. After C&AMP;E News found against it, the
Journal editorialized ``Among men of affairs the `yellow rain'
debate is closed.'' When the editors of Science, Scientific
American, and Nature piled on, the Journal asked, ``For whom do
these science magazines speak? What is science, anyway? Can it
really be so dense?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There was no response in a neutral scientific venue; a florid
series, ``Beyond Yellow Rain,'' appeared in the Journal in 1984.
From then on, the Journal's editorial writers mainly lapsed into
silence, puctuated by occasional re-assertions, until a pair of
dispatches from Claudia Rosett appeared in 1990, hypothesizing that
the Laotian government was at it again, ``drawing on old dumps
bequeathed by Soviet advisers in the days before Glasnost.'' The
Hmong were ``sick and tired of bringing samples,'' she reported. By
the early 1990s, Journal editorialists were snidely using
``science'' and ``scientific community'' in quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Like television producer April Oliver, who held a news
conference last week to defend her CNN report &UR;  &LR; on Operation
Tailwind, the Journal editors still contend that they successfully
made their case. A few more newsies come to grief? Their
embarrassment would be of no greater significance than hers except
for two things.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the Soviet Union really was violating the 1972
treaty all those years, pursuing an extensive R&AMP;D program in the
forbidden weapons with a view to outdistancing the United States,
which it suspected of doing the same. A suspicious anthrax outbreak
in Sverdlovsk in 1979 (to which the Journal repeatedly called
attention) was only the visible tip of this program. Defectors
since have described a vast Soviet buildup in convincing terms
(though nothing has been said about yellow rain). In this, as in
much else, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal was
esposusing a large part of an important truth. Russian know-how
apparently is for sale now in various black arms markets, and in
recent years, Saddam Hussein has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a
doubt that the world has much to fear from biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a treaty is in the works to criminalize the possession
and use of these agents under international law _ just as
hijacking, slavery, and genocide are. Its passage would enable
governments to pursue scientists who do the work, the bureaucrats
who supervise them, the industrialists who supply the manufacturing
apparatus _ not just the leader who authorizes its release. Among
its architects? Matthew Meselson. Of this the Journal wants no
part. Outlawing chemical and biological weapons is ``a quick fix
that will do more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason to remember yellow rain is that the episode
was the beginning of the Journal's long slow descent into a radical
skepticism and rhetorical nihilism that today is polluting the
atmosphere of American politics. The paper's editorial page is
commonly thought to be conservative; in fact, it is the fount of
one radical idea after another. Supply-side economics, the gold
standard, the long rearguard action against a balanced budget,
Steve Forbes's insurgency against Bob Dole, the current campaign to
scuttle the International Monetary Fund, and above all, the drive
to impeach Bill Clinton: all of these views are distinctly on the
fringe of American politics today. And the hallmarks of the
Journal's opinions in these debates are those that emerged with
yellow rain: a contempt for expert opinion, an inability to narrow
differences, or to identify common ground. The result is to
routinely discredit a wide variety of positions on which many
readers are anxious to agree.
</P>
<P>
   If anything like the energy that was spent on CNN were spent on
the Journal, the persons who pursued the yellow rain matter would
have been discredited. Instead, the episode was permitted to fade
away. Dow Jones &AMP; Co. made no independent investigation of the
Journal's finding, as did CNN; even the highly respected newsside
of the paper shied away. The government has shown no interest in
retracing its steps. Editor Robert Bartley, who led the campaign,
is still running the page; William P. Kucewicz, who wrote most of
it, is editor of Markets magazine, a Dow Jones publication.
Recently it was Kucewicz who was chosen to recommend Milton and
Rose D. Friedman's memoirs to Wall Street Journal readers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Do not misunderstand: the sorry history of the yellow rain
debate does not demonstrate that chemical or biological weapons
were never used in Laos, only that the case was never proved, nor
even broached in a very convincing way _ and that the main attempt
to make it backfired in a highly embarrassing fashion. It would
take an investigative saint to deliver a convincing opinion now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (For an extraordinary example of what a serious investigation
would look like, see ``The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,''
by Anne Fadiman, editor of a quarterly journal, The American
Scholar. It is an account of the collision between Hmong refugees
and &UR;  &LR; various members of a California health care community over the
etiology and treatment in a three-year-old Hmong girl of the
ailment commonly known in the West as epilepsy. Ms. Fadiman is
strikingly agnostic on yellow rain.)
</P>
<P>
   By not presenting honestly the evidence that was brought to bear
against its positions, by not backing away from its more
insupportable allegations, The Wall Street Journal in fact behaved
much worse than did CNN in the nerve gas escapade. There was no
attempt at closure; only reiteration and exaggeration: its
editorial writers thereby demostrated a willingness to pollute the
conversation. The same intransigence that has characterized yellow
rain now can be found in almost any issue in which they take an
interest, from Arkansas's Mena airport to the goings-on in Janet
Reno's Justice Department. They are like people who, on a hunch,
cry fire in a crowded room in order to demonize their foes. Not
once but over and over again.

 (Subs to fix time element in first graf to Friday evening. No other

 By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Despite visits by three senior Israeli officials to
Yasser Arafat and an unusual flurry of political activity in the
last week, the Sabbath siren sounded Friday evening with no
tangible movement on the Israeli-Palestinian front and growing
fears that it could stay that way till fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, the Palestinian leader, received Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani in Ramallah on Friday with smiles and
promises of more such meetings. But Palestinians and Kahalani
himself emphasized that the Israeli was not a negotiator and had
not gone there bearing a message from Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The only official meetings, between Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and the senior Palestinian negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas,
began on Sunday and ended on Wednesday with no breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai then appealed to the Americans to return and help
break the logjam. But after eight months of fruitless efforts to
extract a decision from Netanyahu, Washington showed no eagerness
to rush back to assist the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   By general consent, that leaves only one week to find a way to
resume negotiations before the Israeli Parliament's summer recess,
followed by a series of Jewish holidays and municipal elections,
imposes new restraints on talks for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this exercise for the past eight months, this
game in which Netanyahu takes us for a ride,'' said Saeb Erekat,
one of the Palestinian negotiators. ``First the Knesset recess,
then municipal elections, then the Americans are busy with
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key point now is that this government of Netanyahu
either cannot take the decision or does not want to take the
decision. Either way they want a pretext for a lack of decision by
this process of meetings, envoys, talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week Netanyahu gave the impression of a man
seriously intent on achieving an agreement. He refrained from
blaming the Palestinian Authority for a botched terror attack in
Jerusalem on Sunday, he avoided his usual litanies of accusations
against the Palestinians and he told reporters that he was ready to
meet Arafat round the clock to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kahalani's visit to Arafat was apparently linked to the threat
by his small, centrist party, the Third Way, to quit Netanyahu's
coalition unless it agreed to make the withdrawal in the West Bank
that the United States has sought as a condition for resuming
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After 90 minutes of talks, Kahalani and Arafat emerged smiling
and promising to meet again. That appeared to be enough for
Kahalani to call off his threat of pulling out of the government.
``This week it sounds to me we are going to close the gap, and I
don't think there is a reason to make this kind of decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian officials said nothing substantive had changed
through this meeting, nor in one on Thursday between Arafat and
Netanyahu's coalition chairman, Meir Sheetrit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arafat treated Sheetrit to lunch and a promise that he would
seriously consider the Israeli's suggestion that the Palestinian
leader meet directly with Netanyahu. Sheetrit attributed what he
perceived as his success to ``Sheetrit charm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes one's image makes all the difference,'' he told
reporters. ``That's one of the prime minister's problems _ his
image in the Palestinians' eyes, which I think is wrong _ regarding
his desire for peace. The ball is now in Arafat's court.''
</P>
<P>
   However charmed he might have been by Sheetrit or Kahalani,
Arafat did not cancel his plan to travel early next week to
Austria, which is assuming the rotating leadership of the European
Union. The trip only served to further cool expectations of a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   In public at least, Arafat's consistent position before and
after all the meetings has been that he is awaiting Netanyahu's
reply to the U.S. proposal, which calls on Israel to withdraw from
a further 13 percent of the West Bank. It also calls on the
Palestinians to undertake a concrete set of measures against
terrorism and to complete the revision of the Palestinian charter,
which originally called for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he accepts the U.S. proposals. He has also
declared that he will proclaim a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999,
the date by which the Oslo agreements were to have produced a final
settlement, unless an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, intensive efforts by the United States,
including threats by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, have
failed to secure a concrete decision from Netanyahu. The issue of a
further withdrawal has generated constant threats from within his
coalition, with the right wing fiercely opposing a full 13 percent
and centrists like the Third Way and Mordechai insisting that
Netanyahu agree.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai's meeting on Sunday with Abbas, who is better known as
Abu Mazen, came about after the United States reportedly declared
it had exhausted its efforts, and believed that the two sides had
to overcome the final hurdles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai reportedly came to the Palestinians with a ``10 plus
3'' proposal under which Israel would cede control over another 10
percent of the West Bank, while another 3 percent, in areas near
Jewish settlements, would be turned into a ``nature preserve,''
where the Palestinians could not build and Israel would have
security control. Mordechai also reportedly softened Israeli
demands that the Palestinians should convene the full 500-member
Palestinian National Council, the parliament of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, to adopt a new charter.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians listened to the ideas, but reiterated that they
were awaiting Israel's reply to the full U.S. proposal. They said
the ``nature preserve'' proposal effectively kept the land in full
Israeli control, as it is now, under what is termed ``Area C'' in
the Oslo agreements. Area A is fully under Palestinian control, and
Area B is under joint control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to me without specific percentages, without maps,
saying that they intended to maintain overall security, including
public order, and a veto on planning and zoning,'' Erekat said. ``I
said I will answer like in the American television show,
`Jeopardy': `What is Area C?' What they really offered is Area C.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's aides told reporters that Arafat was playing his
usual 11th-hour stalling game to extract more concessions, and that
a breakthrough really was imminent and possible.
</P>
<P>
   But after so many months of delays, it was not only Erekat who
was not convinced. ``We've been through this too many times
before,'' Joseph Alpher, director of the Israel office of the
American Jewish Committee, was quoted as saying. ``It's too early
to conclude that this is a truly serious attempt.'' &QL;

MORALES EXPECTS FINAL APPROVAL OF $17.3 BILLION TOBACCO DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales said Friday that he
expected a federal judge to give final approval to a revised, $17.3
billion settlement of Texas' lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Morales also reported that he agreed to reduce state
government's potential share of the record deal from $15.3 billion
to $15 billion to help convince cigarette makers to add almost $2.3
billion to the settlement for counties and hospital districts.
</P>
<P>
   The way was cleared for U.S. District Judge David Folsom of
Texarkana to make the settlement final after the local governments
were guaranteed the tobacco funds and Morales negotiated a separate
truce with Gov. George W. Bush and seven legislators over lawyers'
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Morales signed the final documents Friday and had them flown to
Folsom late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The money to the counties and hospital districts is designed to
reimburse them for their smoking-related health care costs. Morales
also is urging the Legislature to spend the state's settlement
proceeds on health care and anti-smoking programs, especially for
children.
</P>
<P>
   State government is to receive more than $1.2 billion from
cigarette companies this year, with the remainder to be paid out
over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the at the end of what has been a very long and
grueling but very gratifying and fulfilling process,'' Morales
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement represents a tremendous victory for the state
and an unprecedented opportunity to promote the public health in
our state, particularly the health of our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of counties and hospital districts challenged the
original $15.3 billion settlement announced in January because of a
provision that prohibited them from filing their own health care
claims against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Morales succeeded in winning an additional $2.3 billion in
tobacco money for the local governments under a settlement clause
that enabled Texas to match, proportionately, a better monetary
deal that Minnesota had negotiated with cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said the tobacco industry, in turn,
insisted that Texas give up $330 million from the state's share of
the settlement. That represented extra funds that Texas had
negotiated for being one of the first states to sue tobacco
companies. Morales said Texas would have received the money only if
Congress had approved national tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Minnesota settlement, which Texas was attempting to
match, did not include a similar provision.
</P>
<P>
   Texas counties and hospital districts will share $450 million in
tobacco money over the next three years. An additional $1.8 billion
will be placed in a trust fund. Income from that fund also will be
distributed among the counties and hospital districts beginning in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over how much to pay a group of private lawyers who
helped Morales sue the tobacco industry will be separated from the
body of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who initially opposed treating the fees as a separate
issue, agreed to a compromise with the governor and seven
legislators to allow the settlement to become final. Bush and the
lawmakers contended that $2.3 billion awarded to the lawyers by
Folsom under a 15 percent contingency agreement with Morales was
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Although the months-long political fight was nasty, Morales said
Friday that it was all ``strictly business, nothing personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ceasefire is supposed to hold until a three-member
arbitration panel sets the lawyers' fees in November. The tobacco
industry has agreed to pay the amount set by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislators reserved the right to resume their
fight if the lawyers aren't satisfied with the amount the arbiters
set and ask Folsom to honor their full contract.
</P>
<P>
   Morales predicted the panel's award will be ``so high there will
be no need for these outside lawyers to try to enforce their
contract.''

 &HT;    VENGEFUL MJ WILL DUNK ON JERRYS
 &HT;    By GREG STODA
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He won't quit.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a dead-lock cinch that Michael Jordan will play in the
NBA next season. Believe it regardless of who says what in upcoming
lockout days, weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   What is not a dead-lock cinch _ and this is the
truth-is-stranger-than-fiction part _ is that Jordan will play for
the Chicago Bulls next season.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this bluffing game has come down to in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jerrys (Bulls owner Reinsdorf and general manager
Krause) are about to learn a lesson they should have learned long
ago. They should have learned it, because they've heard about it
happening to Jordan's own teammates in sessions at the team's Berto
Center practice facility in suburban Deerfield, Ill., and they've
seen it happen to Jordan's opponents around the league.
</P>
<P>
   They are about to feel the full fury of Jordan's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   They are about to get a taste of what it's like to be on the
receiving end of Jordan's insatiable taste for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, when he feels wronged, is passionate in defining and
exacting his own brand of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Jordan, who feels monstrouslsy wronged in this
process, may well decide to devour the Jerrys.
</P>
<P>
   In briefest briefest review of the situation:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has led the Bulls to six NBA titles in the past
eight years, said he wouldn't play for any coach other than Phil
Jackson, who recently quit after the team won that sixth
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerrys hired Tim Floyd, ex-head coach in the college game at
Iowa State, as the director of basketball operations. Floyd, long
speculated to be Jackson's bench successor, also has long been the
butt of Jordan's jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerrys, however, now have pulled a joke of their own.
Indeed, they hired Floyd. But they gave him a fancy title, and said
Jackson could have the coaching job back if he wanted it. (Jackson
declined faster than a Jordan dunk, which put Floyd back in
successor's posture.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Jerrys can say they've done everything possible to
accomodate Jordan ... and Jackson. The Jerrys can say Jordan's
quibble should be with Jackson for leaving him, not with them.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, though, will argue that the Jerrys drove Jackson away.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing Jordan will not allow is for the Jerrys to
drive him out of the game, too. The desire to quit on his own terms
has always been Jordan's mantra _ it was his theme when he
``retired'' after the 1993 title season _ and if he walks away now,
it won't be on his own terms no matter how loudly he insists
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So, what recourse does Jordan have?
</P>
<P>
   He can take his Superman act elsewhere, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerrys are gambling with a gambler. They have called and
raised Jordan in a high-stakes game of poker, and it's Jordan's
turn to call the topped-out pot.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerrys' problem? Jordan holds the hole ace.
</P>
<P>
   He can leave Chicago without leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   He can leave the rebuilding process to Toni Kukoc and Jerry R.
and Jerry K. and the man he disdainfully calls ``Pink'' Floyd. He
can bolt for an on-the-cusp-of-a-championship team with lots of
millions to spare (Phoenix?), take the small-end chunk in a package
deal with teammate/fellow free-agent Scottie Pippen and win another
trophy. Or, in ultimate snub, he could work for minimum NBA wage _
secure with endorsement portfolio _ and try to win a crown while
playing for one of the Bulls' nastiest Eastern Conference rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Patrick Ewing together in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Reggie Miller together in Indiana?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Pat Riley together in Miami?
</P>
<P>
   Dream, Heat fans, dream.

 &HT;    Strickland, for now, still man in the middle
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The greatest motivator for a football
player near the end of his career is the prospect of being
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Strickland, one month shy of his 32nd birthday, was getting
dangerously close to that point. Some suggested he was over the
hill. Washed up. Damaged goods. Overweight. Lazy.
</P>
<P>
   The player who signed a two-year, $1.2-million contract to play
for the Dallas Cowboys admitted some of the criticism was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   The middle linebacker knew his career was in jeopardy after last
year's 6- 10 disaster. Almost every player was highly scrutinized.
To blame Strickland for the losing season, though, is like blaming
Sylvester Stallone for all bad movies.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland was only part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Don't explain that to his boss, defensive coordinator Dave
Campo. He challenged Strickland to return this year in good
physical condition, something the veteran player lacked last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age factor caught up with him,'' Campo said bluntly. ``He
never changed his routines.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Strickland is too old to be unproductive. The
Cowboys have a young and talented player who eventually will play
the middle but, for now, Randall Godfrey, a third-year player from
Georgia, will remain at outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   After one week of training camp, Strickland has proven that his
attitude and work habits have improved. The player who led the team
in tackles just two years ago has been so impressive that talk
about his eventual departure has practically ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland looks like the player who dominated the defense in
'96, not the one who was a major disappointment in '97. After a
recent workout, a drop of blood trickled down from the bridge of
his nose, a badge of honor for someone at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a little frustrated and a little upset by all the talk
(of losing a job), but I won't get upset because that's just part
of the business,'' Strickland said. ``You go with it and compete.
This will make people see who is going to be the better guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland's improvement is no accident. He hired a personal
trainer for the first time in his career, meets regularly with a
dietitian and spent the entire off-season in Dallas instead of his
home in Upper Saddle River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland blames his poor '97 season on two factors: Leon Lett
missed 13 games at defensive tackle, and a strained knee limited
his own agility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line wasn't all there,'' Strickland said. ``Leon
wasn't there. That was a big loss for most of the season. Still, I
thought I played well enough to come back and be a starter this
year. But that's their decision, and they've made that clear to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett's absence hurt the entire defense. He was suspended from
the NFL for violating the league's drug policy, and the Cowboys
compensated with young, inexperienced players. That forced
Strickland to take up the slack, a difficult task for someone
hobbled with a bad knee.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has returned, and Strickland is healthy again. The Cowboys
can only hope they don't get pushed around like they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas might not have a middle linebacker controversy now, but
the Strickland-Godfrey battle is worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   If the season started today, the linebackers would be Godfrey
and Dexter Coakley outside and Strickland in the middle. That group
had a combined 417 tackles last year.
</P>
<P>
   When veteran Broderick Thomas went down with a season-ending
knee injury Sunday, that ended speculation that Godfrey would be
shifted to the middle. Thomas was expected to lend depth at outside
linebacker, and some considered him a threat to crack the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys cannot afford to lose another outside linebacker,
especially one who had 148 tackles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said Strickland, meanwhile, has earned the right to stay
at middle linebacker. For now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred's kicked up his routine in the off-season,'' Campo said.
``He came back knowing he was going to be in a battle with Randall
Godfrey. That brings out the best in everybody. That's what
competition is all about.''

 &HT;    Palm beach firm to be a major Czech player
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ In a deal that would create the largest
American-owned industrial operation in the Czech Republic, SDC
International Inc. has agreed to buy Tatra Inc., a 100-year-old
truck manufacturer once owned by the Czechoslovakian government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which is expected be complete by Sept. 30,
Palm Beach-based SDC International will buy a controlling stake in
the company and assume Tatra's bank debt. In all, the price exceeds
$43 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the handcuffs caused by former state ownership and
capital restrictions, Tatra, after serious losses in prior years,
seems to have turned the corner,'' said Ronald A. Adams, chairman
of SDC International (OTC BB: SDCN, $2.25), a small holding company
with branch offices in Fort Lauderdale and Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disintegration of the company's markets caused by the fall
of communism choked Tatra's earnings for many years,'' said Adams.
``We want to lift the yoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatra made a profit of $2 million (U.S. dollars) in 1997, said
Adams, citing the company's most recent audit report, which was
certified by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young. The company
generated 1997 revenues of $290 million. It has about 7,500
employees at its headquarters in Koprivnice, in the eastern end of
the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, Tatra was
controlled by the Czechoslovakian government. The company was
privatized in 1990, a year after Czechoslovakia broke from the
Soviet Union and began establishing a democratic form of
government. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into two nations _ the
Czech Republic and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   SDC International, which calls Palm Beach home solely because
its chairman lives here, was formed in 1994 to find high-quality
products in Eastern Europe and market them to developing nations in
Central and South America. SDC has since grown into a holding
company and Adams said future acquisitions are being explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to move products out of the old communist world
and into developing nations,'' said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   SDC's stock now trades on the NASD's Bulletin Board, but Adams
said the Tatra deal should qualify the company to move onto one of
the larger U.S. exchanges. If SDC converts Tatra's $30 million bank
debt into equity _ which it has the right to do _ Adams said Tatra
would have a book value of about $100 million.

NEW JAPANESE PREMIER IS CHOSEN OVER STRONG OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: JAPAN-OBUCHI-PROFILE)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was elected
president of the governing party Friday and will become prime
minister, despite an extraordinary open revolt against his
candidacy within his own party and overwhelming public sentiment
against him.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has reigned
over postwar Japan virtually unchallenged except for a brief fall
from power in 1993, Obuchi will be Japan's 23rd prime minister
since World War II. He could assume the post as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   He will take the job as Japan faces its worst financial crisis
in decades, with banks staggering under bad loans, a pension system
on the verge of bankruptcy, and rising unemployment. Japan's allies
will be pressing Obuchi to take quick, decisive measures to revive
Japan's economy, or risk dragging the rest of the world into a
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi will also have to restore the confidence of Japanese
voters, many of whom are wracked with concerns about their future
as unemployment rises and the public pension fund is running dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to eliminate people's anxiety,'' Obuchi said at a
press conference following his election.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi has no record of bold leadership, and his economic
pledges have already been criticized for failing to go far enough.
Obuchi has promised to cut taxes and spend additional money to
stimulate the economy, but many economists believe he must make
fundamental changes in Japan's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, believe that Obuchi can capitalize on
the very consensus-building strengths that enabled him to win the
election despite opposition. ``His election reflects the sense of
the LDP, although it is not the sense of the people,'' said Yukio
Okamoto, a political consultant. ``Mr. Obuchi has an advantage in
that expectations are so low at the beginning that whatever he
does, he can turn it to an advantage if he steps forward in a
decisive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became party president after a spectacle all but unheard
of in Japanese politics: an open effort to defeat a candidate
anointed by most of the ruling party elders, and a public race to
compete for the post of party leader. In the past, a party
president emerged from a smoke-filled room after hours of wheeling
and dealing among faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, supporters of Obuchi's rivals, Seiroku Kajiyama
and Junichiro Koizumi, actively lobbied party elders, even passing
out copies of newspapers containing public opinion polls showing
Obuchi's lack of popularity. Obuchi's challengers spoke their minds
in endless rounds of television shows and actually tried to
campaign on policy, although they were hampered somewhat by the
fact that they shared many of the same ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether these stirrings of rebellion
foreshadow changes within the Liberal Democratic Party. Many of the
rebels ended up voting for Obuchi, and most pledged their support
for him Friday. But voter disenchantment has been growing as
Japan's economy falters, and public opinion polls suggest that the
party might lose control of the powerful lower house of the
Legislature if elections are held soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders are already calling for a dissolution of the
lower house. They hope to capitalize on public anger and win a
majority there. Japanese voters sent a warning message of their
displeasure in upper house elections July 12, when the LDP
unexpectedly lost control of the chamber. The party's defeat led
the current prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the LDP president who was greeted with the biggest
amount of disappointment ever,'' said Kazuo Shii, chief secretary
of the Japan Communist Party, which has been gaining popularity
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi recognizes his lack of voter appeal. ``I am inferior to
the other candidates in general popularity,'' he said. ``I know
well that popularity among the people and popularity in the party
should match each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would try to travel around the country and the
world to expose people to his way of thinking and his personality.
``It is now difficult to achieve anything with only support in
Nagatocho and Kasumigaseki,'' Obuchi said, referring to the areas
in Tokyo where the party and the government, respectively, are
located.
</P>
<P>
   The markets, which favored Kajiyama because he promised to
restructure the banking system, reacted with barely a quiver.
Obuchi has been regarded as the front runner for some time, and the
yen actually gained against the dollar after news of his election
broke. The stock market closed before the vote was completed.
</P>
<P>
   But the despair among those who supported Kajiyama and Koizumi
was palpable. Kajiyama received 102 of the 411 votes cast, while
Koizumi captured only 84, indicating that members of his own
faction voted for his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was betrayed,'' said Makiko Tanaka, a non-aligned party
member who voted for Koizumi, currently the health and welfare
minister, in spite of a recent, widely quoted comment in which she
characterized him as eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   She said she voted for him because her constituents favored him.
``Among the public, opinion of Koizumi-san is very high,'' she
said. ``And I think it is the job of a Diet member not only to act
on one's own thoughts but also to listen to constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   That's rare thinking in the party, although there are
undoubtedly more than a few junior members who voted for Obuchi who
are worrying about how their constituents will react. Many voted
for the foreign minister under pressure from factional leaders,
although people back in their districts had encouraged them to
select one of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Obuchi's victory strongly suggest traditional ways of
handling party business are alive and well. While many were
predicting that he would fail to secure a majority on the first
vote, 225 members wrote his name on their ballot sheets, giving him
a comfortable margin of support.
</P>
<P>
   That vote underscored Obuchi's one proven strength: his ability
to coax a fractious party membership to coalesce. He used his
advantage as the leader of the largest faction to attract other
faction leaders, who then pressured their members to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of votes was just what we expected,'' said Yoshimi
Watanabe, an Obuchi supporter. ``From now on, LDP will not be
split. We will unite under the new party chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity, if achieved, will help Obuchi push through the tough
measures that will be needed to fix the banking system, revise the
tax system and bolster the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised a 6 trillion yen tax cut and a 10 trillion yen
supplementary budget, although at his press conference Friday he
said they were not ``completely a concrete figure.''
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed his commitment to overhauling the tax system,
saying he would like to lower both the highest individual income
tax bracket and the corporate tax rate, both of which are high by
international standards. ``Otherwise, we should worry about a large
amount of capital flight in this globalized economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is talk of defections from the party or withholding
votes when the lower house officially votes to elect Obuchi as
prime minister, even his biggest critics say they will cast their
vote for him. ``At least he should be given a chance,'' said Taro
Kono, a young legislator who worked tirelessly on behalf of
Kajiyama's campaign. ``He is now our president. I will vote for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kono and others are keenly awaiting Obuchi's cabinet picks.
If his choices are regarded as ``the appropriate people for the
appropriate posts,'' a phrase now of the lips of everyone in the
party, he will gain the confidence of the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Should he fill his cabinet and the party's ranks based on
factional seniority, however, their worst fears will be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, factional considerations governed this vote, in spite
of junior members' demands that factions be disregarded in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, given the open campaign for party president,
they were. And, in the end, a few party members did brave their
leaderships' wrath and crossed faction lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the power of the party's hierarchy
prevailed. Up-and-comers in the senior ranks like Koichi Kato, the
party's secretary-general, and Taku Yamasaki, chairman of its
Policy Research Council, feared that their own chances of becoming
prime minister in a few years would dim if the factional system
were thrown to the wind, and they worked hard to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is clear that generational politics will
continue to threaten that system. The challenge will come from
younger members who are educated abroad and have less ability to
distribute pork to their constituents than more established
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation went about this in a really
straightforward manner,'' said Kono. ``The others, they all thought
about their futures. I don't think they thought about the people or
the party or the country.''

   WASHINGTON _ The shots fired on Friday were the fourth such
incident in the U.S. Capitol, a structure that has been the scene
of several acts of violence, including three bombings, in its
nearly 200-year history. Among the other incidents:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  November 7, 1983 -- A bomb that exploded in a window seat in
the corridor of the empty Senate chamber in November of 1983
stunned the capital and led to a security crack down. Soon
afterwards, Capitol police set up metal detectors at entrances and
began requiring identification tags for staff and journalists.
Three people later pleaded guilty in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1, 1971 -- A bomb demolished a restroom in the old
Senate wing, doing extensive damage to a hearing room and the
Senate barber shop, but not injuring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 2, 1915 -- A homemade bomb damaged a Senate reception
room. It had been placed there by Erich Muenter, a former
instructor of German at Harvard University who was upset by private
sales of U.S. weapons to the Allies in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  March 1, 1954 -- Five members of the House were wounded on the
floor of the House of Representatives by three gun-wielding Puerto
Rican extremist nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  July 12, 1947 -- Sen. John W. Bricker, R-Ohio, was shot at
twice in the subway tunnel under the Capitol. His attacker was a
disgruntled former Capitol policeman. The senator was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  February 28, 1890 -- Charles E. Kincaid, a correspondent for
the Louisville Times, shot former Rep. William P. Taulbee, D-Ky.,
in a stairway in an argument over a scandal report in the
newspaper. Taulbee later died from his wounds.

FOR JAPAN'S NEW PRIME MINISTER, A QUIET RISE TO THE TOP  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: With JAPAN-OBUCHI) 
(js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For someone who has been plying the treacherous waters
of Japanese politics since 1963, Keizo Obuchi has made scarcely a
ripple. He is not identified with any major government policies,
has no memorable personality traits, and has not been tarred by any
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only time he ever commanded the attention of his
countrymen was on a winter morning in 1989, when Obuchi announced
the name of Japan's new Imperial era, following the death of
Emperor Hirohito. And that bit of history fell to him only because
he was the government's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet political experts here say it is precisely Obuchi's
unobtrusive style that brought him to the top of Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and has made him the designated successor
to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. At 61, Obuchi has mastered the
art of staying out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of his success is to fly low,'' said Takashi
Inoguchi, a political science professor at Tokyo University.
``Nobody feels threatened by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Obuchi has assiduously cultivated his low profile, it may
have grown naturally out of his early political career. His home
district produced two of Japan's most powerful postwar politicians,
Takeo Fukuda and Yasuhiro Nakasone, who eclipsed the young Obuchi.
He once likened his No. 3 status to being ``a noodle shop that
stands between two high-rise buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous silk manufacturer, Obuchi was born on
June 25, 1937, in Nakanojo, a bucolic town in the mountains 60
miles northwest of Tokyo. Obuchi's father had his own political
ambitions, and won a seat in Japan's parliament, though his career
was marked by more defeats than victories.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Obuchi had little taste for politics, setting
out to study literature. His academic record, however, was
mediocre, and he failed the entrance examination for the
prestigious Tokyo University three times. Obuchi eventually
enrolled in Waseda University in Tokyo to study English literature.
Like many English majors in Japan, he does not speak English.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Obuchi's father during his freshman year persuaded
him to switch his interests to politics. He joined a debating group
to hone his speaking skills and even began lifting weights on the
then reasonable assumption that if he were elected to parliament,
he might come to blows with his fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to join parliament came at the age of 26, when
Obuchi won a seat from his home district of Gumma. In a gesture
that some political observers have described as evidence of his
small-town roots, he brought his mother to witness his swearing-in
ceremony. Japanese news programs on Friday showed pictures of a
boyish Obuchi, mugging for the cameras from his seat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   From then on Obuchi stayed in the background, rising quietly
through the ranks of the Liberal Democratic Party. He became an
acolyte of Noburo Takeshita, helping to engineer Takeshita's rise
to prime minister in 1985. Takeshita, who is now 74 and is one of
the power brokers of the party, returned the favor by championing
Obuchi's candidacy this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has Takeshita behind him, and that's all he needs,'' said
John Neuffer, a political analyst at the Matsui Marine Research
Institute. ``He is going to be prime minister because Japan's
`shadow shogun' put him there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was Takeshita who gave Obuchi his moment in history, by
appointing him chief cabinet secretary, a post that carried with it
the once-in-an-era requirement to announce the name of the new
Imperial reign. So on Jan. 7, 1989, Obuchi somberly held up a
plaque with the Chinese ideograph for Heisei, the name the
government had chosen for the reign of Emperor Akihito.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Obuchi was the perfect messenger. Heisei
translates roughly as achieving peace, and by then Obuchi had
already made his name in the Liberal Democratic Party as a deft
consensus-builder _ even in a party where consensus-building is
considered almost a prerequisite for membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``His talent is in aggregating support,'' Inoguchi said. ``In
one sense, it's unfair to say he's had no impact. He's actually had
a lot of impact simply by amassing so much support behind his own
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was elected to the parliament in the same year as
Hashimoto. Although the two men are not particularly close, Obuchi
had become so powerful within the Liberal Democratic Party by the
mid-1990s that Hashimoto appointed him to the politically sensitive
post of foreign minister in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last May, Obuchi characterized his relationship with
Hashimoto as a straightforward series of favors given and received.
``When I became leader of the faction, Hashimoto supported me,'' he
said. ``It's my turn to support him now. Then next time, he might
support me.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's skills as a back-room politician were dramatized in
Friday's party election. He beat back a threat that members of his
faction might abandon him for two party officials who are more
charismatic, Seiroku Kajiyama and Junichiro Koizumi. In the end,
Obuchi won 225 of the 411 votes cast, a better-than-expected margin
that vindicated his years of internal party politicking.
</P>
<P>
   People who know him say Obuchi has a warm demeanor and seems
incapable of offending people. Despite years of living in Tokyo, he
has not lost the accent of his country home, a trait that Inoguchi
said puts him in the tradition of ``folkish, paddy-style Japanese
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Obuchi also knows how to take criticism. Last
week, Neuffer described him in an interview with The New York Times
as having ``all the pizazz of a cold pizza.'' The comment was
picked up by the Japanese news media, and Foreign Ministry
officials took umbrage.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi was unfazed. Last Sunday, when reporters were camped
out in front of his home in Tokyo, Obuchi ordered several pizzas
and had one of his aides distribute them to the crowd. They were
warm.

 &HT;    Think tank in N.C. has become a hotbed of scientific studies
into ESP phenomenon
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 27: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. -- A shadowy figure in a small, dark room plops
pingpong balls over your eyes, gently wiggles a pair of goggles
over your face, hands you a set of earphones and softly urges you
to kick back in an overstuffed chair.
</P>
<P>
   The door creaks shut, and suddenly you're bathed in a weird,
reddish glow. Undulating sounds of a gentle sea wash over you like
warm ocean waves _ background noise that, combined with the red
light, is supposed to tune out distractions and turn on your
ability to enter an ``internally focused state.''
</P>
<P>
   Your mind's supposed to start picking up thoughts beamed your
way by someone in another room, a ``sender'' who tries to transmit
a mental picture of a scene chosen randomly out of 156 images.
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 minutes, you describe all images that pop into your
head, all recorded by a scientist in another room. If the
experiment works, you see what the sender does.
</P>
<P>
   Is there really something to ESP _ extrasensory perception?
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans think so. The latest Southern Focus Poll by The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that 58 percent of people in the
South, about the same as in the nation, believe in ESP.
</P>
<P>
   As you sit there, babbling random thoughts, you wonder. Soon,
the lights go down and the music stops. The sender and the
scientist stroll in and turn on a TV. You're shown four images,
including the one the sender tried to implant. If you pick the
right one, you've scored a hit. The scientist who's been jotting
down your thoughts checks your choice against your
stream-of-consciousness descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Chance says you should score a hit 25 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   No telepathic ``hit'' was scored this day. But in thousands of
such experiments here, at the Rhine Research Center, and at other
parapsychological institutions around the world, the average hit
rate has been about 30 percent, significantly above chance, says
Cheryl Alexander, one of four full-time Rhine researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did one series here with 51 subjects and had a 37.3 percent
hit rate,'' she says. ``We did studies with sibling pairs,
parent-child pairs and spouse pairs. The parent-child pairs had a
hit rate of 53.5 percent, the sibling pairs 71.4 percent and only
19 percent for the spouse pairs. They were all fairly small
samples. But taken altogether, the end result is proof.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhine Center, originally the Duke University(N.C.)
Parapsychology Laboratory, was founded in 1927 by psychologist J.B.
Rhine. He took the institution private in the 1960s, moving into a
huge, spooky old white frame house, full of tiny rooms and secret
doors and a musty-smelling basement jammed with file cabinets
packed with moldy records.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its historical connection to Duke, with its worldwide
reputation as a major medical research center, the Rhine Center is
seen by many scientists as a mecca of mysticism. Phillip Costanzo,
chairman of psychology at Duke, says ``those who research this are
on the fringe.'' Evidence for ESP, he says, isn't compelling.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK with Richard Broughton, 51, the psychologist who runs
the Rhine Center, He says with a hint of crankiness that
parapsychology is grossly misunderstood, especially in America.
ESP, the study of which began in England in 1882, has been proven
scientifically valid, yet, like Rodney Dangerfield, still gets
little respect, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   He spends a lot of time talking to media types and finds those
from overseas less skeptical, while their American counterparts
seem more inclined to lump ESP with UFOs, trolls and leprechauns,
just another topic for wild-eyed kooks like the weirdo scientist in
the ``Back to the Future'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   But if parapsychology isn't a real science, he wonders, why did
the CIA admit in 1995 that it had spent $20 million over two
decades studying clairvoyance and training people to see and locate
Iraqi bunkers used by Saddam Hussein during the Persian Gulf War?
</P>
<P>
   Why do police departments hire psychics? Why are businesses
pumping money into the center to support precognition research? And
why are ESP experiments being done not only in America but at
universities in the Netherlands, Britain, Japan, Brazil and
Scotland?
</P>
<P>
   Duke historian Seymour Mauskopf, author of the 1980 book ``The
Elusive Science,'' says parapsychology, which he has studied for
years, ``flies in the face of any kind of physical science. It
seems associated with spiritualism, like seances. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, there are good scientists doing this. It's
not a simple `Yes, it's true' or `No, it's false.'''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Rhine Center:
</P>
<P>
   -- At the Princeton University Engineering Anomalies Research
Center in New Jersey, humans have successfully influenced the
behavior of a variety of mechanical, electronic, optical,
acoustical and fluid devices, solely by mental volition. Machines
that are supposed to produce random numbers have been affected by
human thoughts, even thoughts projected from thousands of miles
away, Princeton researchers says.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jessica Utts, a professor of statistics at the University of
California-Davis, was commissioned by the CIA to review its study
on remote viewing. She concluded the technique works.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem, who also was a government
consultant, said that during the Gulf War, the Pentagon ``wanted to
locate Saddam's underground bunkers. They'd give the remote viewer
the latitude and longitude and ask what he saw there. He'd say, `I
see something underground at this level, large walls. I see what
looks like a possible rocket launcher.''' Bem says he has done
successful ESP experiments himself. ``There is evidence for
telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and for having intuition
about the future. I have come to believe that there are powers of
the mind that we don't know yet. We're going to have to have a
different worldview about how the world works.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Rhine Center, researcher Robert Bourgeois conducts
experiments in remote viewing, quite different from tests for
telepathy. One recent morning, he ushered a visitor into a large
closet as a computer in a nearby room selected one of 100 images at
random.
</P>
<P>
   The task for the guinea pig: Think about the image you've been
told is on the TV screen down the hall, which no one is seeing, and
say or sketch whatever comes to mind. You feel you're on the top of
a building, looking at trees. You see a long strip, with a dot that
might be a car, and draw it. Then your mind's eye sees what appears
to be sloped roofs of houses. You write and draw feverishly as he
tells you periodically to stop and start again.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, you both go to the room with the TV. You're
shown four images, including the one that was on the TV screen
while you concentrated. You don't see a match, but Bourgeois does.
The sloping mountains are similar to the slanted roof lines you
drew, and there's a highway with a single car, and in front of the
mountain range is a modern city, full of tall buildings. He gives
you a score of two, on a scale of zero to four.
</P>
<P>
   Not great, but better than average. And that's more than enough
to keep the Rhine Center researchers busy trying to prove to the
world's skeptics that ESP isn't just BS.

TEXAS' $17.3 BILLION TOBACCO DEAL SIGNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal judge Friday signed off on a nearly
$17.3 billion settlement between Texas and the tobacco industry,
putting an end to a six-month battle over details of the historic
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But a potentially bigger fight could erupt next year when state
lawmakers decide how to spend the multibillion-dollar windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that overall, the agreement represents a tremendous
victory for the state and an unprecedented opportunity to promote
the public health in our state,'' said Texas Attorney General Dan
Morales, who filed suit against the tobacco industry and helped
broker the final settlement, the largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there is no more worthy objective than to direct
these funds towards the well-being of our children and the
well-being of those who are in need of assistance,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will get $15 billion over the next 25 years, while
counties and hospital districts will divide nearly $2.3 billion,
the bulk of which will be placed in a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute over how much to pay the private lawyers Morales hired
to fight the tobacco industry will be handled by a special
arbitration panel later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were signed by the parties involved and flown to
U.S. District Judge David Folsom in Texarkana, where he signed them
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Morales sued the tobacco industry two years ago in an effort to
recover the costs Texas had incurred in treating smoking-related
illnesses. The night before the trial was to begin in January, the
state and the tobacco companies reached a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But disputes over legal fees and compensation to counties and
hospital districts delayed finalization of the agreement for some
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led the challenge against a provision in the
settlement that would have paid $2.3 billion to the attorneys hired
by Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said the tobacco industry would pay all the legal fees,
but Bush said he was concerned Texas taxpayers might somehow end up
paying some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an arbitration panel that convenes in November will decide
how much to pay. The lawyers can challenge the panel's decision,
but Morales and Bush have said they would fight any attempt to use
any of the settlement to pay the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased to represent the state of Texas. We're pleased
all this is behind us,'' said Tom Banning, a spokesman for the
private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The second dispute involved a group of counties and hospital
districts that had complained they were unjustly left out of the
settlement. Under an agreement reached last week, counties and
hospital districts across Texas will share $2.275 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money was made possible under a clause in the
agreement that no other state would get a better deal than Texas.
Minnesota recently negotiated a better settlement that allowed more
money to flow to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have reached agreements with four states
that total $39.1 billion. The other two states are Florida and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 days, nearly $400 million will be put in the state
treasury. Texas will get almost $1.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   The counties and hospital districts will get their first payment
of $300 million on Jan. 4. An additional $450 million will be
distributed to them over the next three years, and about $1.8
billion will be placed in a trust fund over five years. The income
from that fund will be directed to counties and hospital districts
starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said $264 million will be designated for a pilot program
intended to reduce the use of tobacco products by minors. A ban on
using billboards for tobacco advertising also took effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature cannot change the terms of the money
allocated to the counties and the hospital districts, Morales said.
But lawmakers, who meet again in January, will decide how to spend
the rest of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see this money preserved and protected
specifically for public health care investment,'' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would make his own recommendations on how to
spend the money if he is re-elected this fall.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Critics' windy pronouncements ignore gems
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    BY Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't behoove those of us who write for a living to take
out after literary critics, but I'm telling you that Modern Library
group who picked the alleged ``top 100 English-language novels of
the 20th century'' can't read!
</P>
<P>
   If they can read, they missed the most stirring, unforgettable,
totally readable book of our time. ``Gone With the Wind'' was
completely ignored. They also overlooked ``To Kill a Mockingbird,''
easily one of the all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been something about flawless writing, although
looking over the winners, I can't believe that was a standard. I
don't think anybody ever noticed the quality of Margaret Mitchell's
prose. We were too engrossed in the story.
</P>
<P>
   She herself said she wasn't a good writer. In fact, she said she
couldn't be paid enough to reread some of her book. She said her
aim was to tell a story _ and what a story! Millions of people all
over the world read it and feel as close to Scarlett and Melanie
and Rhett as they do to their own blood kin.
</P>
<P>
   Babies were named for them, Tara subdivisions went up all over
the place, newspapermen from faraway Japan come to town regularly
and want to know from those of us who knew her if Mitchell was ``a
nice lady.''
</P>
<P>
   One family in South Georgia takes tourists to their bathroom to
see the toilet they were told came out of Mitchell's now
nonexistent home on Peachtree Street when it was torn down to make
way for an office complex.
</P>
<P>
   All this from an inferior, unnoticeable book? Well, it won a
Pulitzer Prize. It was made into an Academy Award-winning movie
that continues to play today. I saw ``Gone With the Wind'' playing
in France and in Germany almost half a century after it was made.
Can they say the same for any other book on the top 100 list?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the books on that list are favorites of mine. I have
read ``The Grapes of Wrath'' two or three times and commend it to
all the young people in my family who never knew the Great
Depression. I thought Robert Penn Warren's ``All the King's Men''
one of the most absorbing political stories I ever read. (Edwin
O'Connor's ``The Last Hurrah'' was pretty good, too.)
</P>
<P>
   For many years I thought Somerset Maugham's ``Of Human Bondage''
was my favorite book. But then I surrendered ``Of Human Bondage''
in favor of a lot of excellent ones I kept meeting. I don't think
the judges on this dumb list were as flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't they mention Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' ``The
Yearling''? It would have given Southern writers their 10th nominee
out of a hundred. They tossed us a crumb, but if they could make a
list without Eudora Welty being mentioned, what do they know
anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   And Toni Morrison is not a Southern writer (Ohio, I think), but
her subject matter is familiar to Southerners, and I think as a
Nobel winner she is worthy of the attention she didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   As for Margaret Mitchell and Harper Lee and, of course, Miss
Welty, could it be they are for us readers and too good for
literary list makers?

 &HT;    A tale of two rankings: Students' choices more diverse
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 26: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Random House Modern Library panel that selected the 100
greatest English-language novels since 1900 included one woman _
British author A.S. Byatt _ and nine men: Modern Library editor
Christopher Cerf, author Gore Vidal, former Library of Congress
librarian Daniel J. Boorstin, author Shelby Foote, Carnegie Corp.
director Vartan Gregorian, historian Edmund Morris, art scholar
John Richardson, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and author
William Styron.
</P>
<P>
   The project was launched more than a year ago, said Random House
spokesman Tom Perry, when several of the board members gathered for
lunch and started scribbling down titles. ``They came up with a
long list and then they would phone or fax in other selections,''
Perry said. ``We ended up with a list of 400 books, and that was
sent to all of the board members for their votes. The books that
received the most votes were ranked highest.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about a month ago, Cerf asked some 100 students enrolled
in the renowned Radcliffe Publishing Course to compile their
choices as a comparison to the Modern Library board's. That list
turned out to be more diverse _ and more contemporary _ with nearly
a third of the novels written by women and African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Modern Library panelists were satisfied with
their final selections. Calling the list ``typically American,''
Byatt regretted that the Australian Nobel Prize-winning novelist
Patrick White had not been chosen and said there was ``definitely
room for more women.''
</P>
<P>
   Like American author Styron, she regretted the absence of
British writer Doris Lessing and American novelist Mary McCarthy.
Styron said he was surprised, too, by the omission of White and
wished the list had included American writer Eudora Welty.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregorian said he and several other judges had thought they
should choose only books that had been in print a long time, thus
showing that they ``have really stood the test of time.''

 &HT;    'Heaven's Harlot' looks back on Jesus freak days
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUTLEDGE, GA. -- Miriam Williams is perched on a weathered porch
rail at Hard Labor Creek State Park. Sitting in a chair beside her
is her friend Sharon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering summer weekend, they are here with the birds
singing and the insects buzzing for a family reunion of sorts _ a
gathering of people who have left a controversial religious group
that began as the Jesus freaks of the hippie era. Now called the
Family, it is known more for its almost-anything-goes attitude
toward sex (including, former members say, sex with children) than
for its end-times theology.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions have been held annually since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had considered ourselves family, so this is a family
reunion,'' said Williams, 45, a Cobb County resident who has become
something of a celebrity with the publication this summer of her
book, ``Heaven's Harlots'' (Eagle Brook/Morrow, $23). The title of
the autobiographical book comes from the practice of offering sex
to potential converts, called ``flirty fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastoral setting and communal lifestyle of the park's cabins
and campgrounds are appropriate for this get-together. Many of the
several dozen participants traveled the country in
psychedelic-painted buses and lived together in communes sharing
resources during the heyday of granny dresses and bell-bottoms. In
those days, they were called the Children of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning were wonderful principles of putting someone
else above yourself and loving one another unconditionally,'' said
Wilson, 49, who left her Southern Baptist roots in White Pine,
Tenn., for Miami Beach, where she met the Children of God in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who now lives in Braselton, stayed with them for nine
years. ``When I first met the group, I didn't have a long dress.
One girl had two. She gave me the pretty one.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Williams said, males and females were strictly
separated. But over the years, founder David Berg, who called
himself Moses David, had a series of doctrinal ``revelations'' that
loosened the rules about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had joined the group in 1971 in upstate New York,
attracted by its members' ``radical Christianity.'' For some of the
time, she was among an elite group of singers and musicians who
lived in Europe, held concerts and made record albums under the
name Les Enfants de Dieu. Among them was Jeremy Spencer, who left
the original band Fleetwood Mac in its heyday to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says she accepted what she now sees as Berg's
authoritarian rule, dictating at times everything from the mates to
the reading material of his followers. She says she rationalized
his position that sexual sharing among adults and even ``sacred
prostitution'' were acceptable. She shared the beds of many men who
were part of the group, brought another woman into her marriage as
a second wife for her husband, and had sex with men she met in the
hopes of bringing them into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among our first `fish' were an Italian businessman, an
American lawyer, and the son of a famous actress,'' she writes in
her book. ``I found it easy to perform my role without any
emotional attachment or moral dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing she could not rationalize was the sexual
exploitation of children. When she found anatomically correct
sexual pictures drawn by a child who lived in her communal home,
she began to fear for her own five children, who now range in age
from 11 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Her involvement in the group spanned 17 years and two marriages
_ one of them forced by the group's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask my daughters periodically whether they remember any
abuse,'' she said. ``So far, they have told me no.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the group in 1988, she divorced her second
husband, moved to Cobb County, graduated from Kennesaw State
University with a 4.0 grade point average and enrolled in graduate
school at Georgia State University, where she is studying
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   She has set up a Web page (http://www.excognet.com) for former
members of the Family, which she calls ``a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Family today
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of people such as Wilson and Williams left the
Family in disillusionment over the years, others have stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Family functions with an estimated 9,000 members and
thousands of other adherents who do not live communally but
consider themselves part of the group, said spokeswoman Claire
Borowick, who is based in Washington. Two communal homes, with
about 20 people each, are located in metropolitan Atlanta at
undisclosed locations. ``Missionaries'' work around the world and,
in the Atlanta area, Family members sing at hospitals, pass out
food to the homeless and volunteer at local ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The Family places little emphasis on recruiting new members now,
Borowick said, but adds to its membership by reproduction since
birth control is strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Borowick says sex with children under age 16 is forbidden and
``flirty fishing'' was abandoned in 1987. But the ``law of love''
still applies. It says any sex between adults _ inside, outside or
in spite of marriage _ is fine as long as it is done ``in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Berg died in 1994, his wife and successor, Maria, and
other Family members report receiving revelations not only from
Berg but, on occasion, from dead celebrities including Elvis
Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Richard Nixon. ``Basically what we'd
say is that we believe God uses the spirits of departed saints on
occasion to deliver messages to his people,'' said Borowick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the post-Berg variations on the sex theme is the idea of
fantasizing a sexual relationship with Jesus while engaged in a sex
act, whether alone or with someone else. Borowick says the ``Loving
Jesus Revelation,'' published in 1996, is based on ``bridal
theology,'' which sees the church as the bride of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Family leaders ``see nothing sinful or blasphemous about
including the creator of sex as a participant during their times of
sexual loving and enjoyment,'' she said. She stressed that the
practice is not required of members.
</P>
<P>
   The hippie days
</P>
<P>
   David Brandt Berg, born in Oakland, Calif., in 1919, was the son
of two Christian evangelists who became an itinerant preacher. He
revealed many of his feelings about his background to his followers
in regular dispatches known as Mo Letters.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter, full of capital letters and partial sentences, he
described himself as ``A VERY LONESOME LITTLE BOY,'' who was
``frail, shy, and very reticent, a veritable bookworm and
recluse.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg moved to Miami with his mother when she founded a church
affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance, a
conservative movement, but the church closed in the midst of the
Depression. Berg was ordained by the group in 1941, according to
Stephen A. Kent, a University of Alberta professor who has studied
Berg's group extensively.
   He met Jane Miller and married her in 1944, but continued to
travel with his mother on the revival circuit. The couple had four
children.
</P>
<P>
   Berg held various pulpits and positions within the denomination
over the next 23 years. He returned to California with his family
at his mother's request in 1967 to help her with a coffeehouse
ministry on Huntington Beach in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Berg was soon drawing teenagers with a blend of evangelical
Christianity and California culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT HAD TAKEN ME 49 YEARS (GOD'S NUMBER SEVEN TIMES SEVEN!) TO
FIND MY LIFE'S WORK!'' he later wrote, ``and there we found it
among the poorest of the poor _ the poor hippies of Huntington
Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg had about 100 regular followers in 1969 when Sam Ajemian,
an Armenian born in Greece, met him in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ajemian, now 52 and a participant in the reunion, was living in
Berkeley ``trying to be part of the hippie scene,'' he said, when
he fell under Berg's spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was joining a normal, dedicated Christian
missionary group,'' he said. ``I really believed we were the
chosen, elect of God, and David Berg was the greatest prophet who
ever lived after Jesus Christ _ more important than St. Paul and
St. Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg and his followers began traveling from coast to coast and
up and down the country, and eventually set up a commune on a Texas
ranch. Along the way, they absorbed a Georgia commune called the
House of Judah.
</P>
<P>
   Their lifestyle was documented on NBC television in 1971 on a
program called ``The Ultimate Trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 20 years old and it was great,'' Wilson recalled. ``We
slept in buses in layers with boards across the seats. It was so
much fun back then; we didn't know what the future would bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg often traveled in a motor home with his wife and two other
women _ eventually abandoning his first wife _ but followers never
considered that anything untoward might be going on with their
leader, Wilson said. ``We were serving God. That would be filthy to
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Berg began to describe himself as ``the
voice of God'' and his followers as the Children of God.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, he urged them to scatter around the world
about the time a New York crime commission began investigating
allegations of fraud and child molestation. No one was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, many of Berg's disciples remained abroad and
kept a low profile. Controversial doctrine, along with
investigations in several countries _ regarded by the Family as
persecution _ eventually brought many back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Berg communicated with his diaspora through his Mo Letters,
offering advice on everything from hygiene to seduction. As early
as 1971 he wrote about sex in ``Love-Making in the Spirit,'' a
letter whose cover bore a drawing of a bare-breasted woman being
fondled by a bearded man. But over the years, the letters about sex
and marriage became more radical.
</P>
<P>
   First he introduced the idea of ``sharing,'' which meant women
should have sex upon request with men in the group. But he forbade
birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four children before the age of 25,'' said Marina
Sarran, 37, an Italian woman in town for the former members'
reunion. ``You had to have sex because God wants you to do that.
You had to have children because God wants you to do that. ...
Women had to submit to men. Who was I to question God?''
</P>
<P>
   Berg's next step was the doctrine of ``flirty fishing,'' or
``FFing'' _ using sex for conversion. He compared it to Jesus'
crucifixion. If the son of God could give up his life for the
cause, surely women could give their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 letter called ``You Are the Love of God,'' he told
women to ``lie down on the bed and open your arms, naked ... and
say ... I was made for you because God loved you.''' A husband who
didn't approve of his wife's participation was weak in the faith,
according to Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Family spokeswoman Borowick said she did ``a small amount'' of
flirty fishing in the 1980s. ``It didn't bother me,'' she said. ``I
felt like I was reaching out and witnessing to lost souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more controversial were Berg's writings about children and
sex. A 1977 letter suggested marriage at about age 12 or 13 because
of the need for sex at that age. A 1979 letter showed naked women
in various sex poses with a small boy, and a book of advice on
child-rearing suggested interesting children in reading with sex
words such as ``nipple'' and ``breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Former members said they tried to deny the true meaning and
impact of the writings.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of controversy and an epidemic of venereal disease,
according to some former members, Berg abandoned ``flirty fishing''
in 1987. He also forbade sex with children, but made it clear in a
1993 letter that the prohibition was ``because it is against the
laws of Man in most countries today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you don't practice something doesn't mean you
don't believe the general principles behind it,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ajemian left the group in 1979 after a moment of epiphany
standing in front of the Acropolis. He had already contracted
venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sarran left in 1990 after learning that her two daughters, 8 and
6, had been molested by a 35-year-old man in her communal home.
</P>
<P>
   They and other former members say they have spent the time since
their departure attempting to come to terms with their life in what
they now consider an abusive cult. Some gave up opportunities for
education to spend their developmental years in the group and found
themselves on the outside with no training, no money and no
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us, we didn't have an identity,'' said Wilson. ``When
we got out, we were trying to create one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were idealistic,'' said Williams. ``We wanted to change the
world. Instead, we were duped and manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ajemian, are strong Christians. Others, like Wilson,
have rejected any church affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the God words are like knives that just cut to parts of
your heart, because they were so used to abuse us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Wilson and some of their friends now express concern
about the second generation of Berg followers, the children who
were raised in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children did not choose this life. They were born into
it,'' Williams said. ``I feel some responsibility for them. If it
wasn't for people like me making money so Mo could continue his
perverted lifestyle, this group would have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sarran, Ajemian, Williams and Wilson, who are trying to
publicize what they see as the dangers of the group, Jackie Roberts
says she is content to stay in.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 46, lives with about 20 other people, including her
husband, two other couples, some young single adults preparing to
go abroad as missionaries, and several children in a nine-bedroom
rented Fulton County home where they share household chores.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts does not say explicitly whether they also share sex, but
says, ``We believe that consensual sex between consenting adults,
if it is done in real love, is not a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, the mother of eight children, said she finds it ``sad
that our sexual beliefs, which are an internal affair, have been so
expounded on publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The real message of the group remains ``salvation through Jesus
Christ,'' she said. ``We're out to be a blessing and a help.''

   Hostas, lots of hostas, grow neatly around the blue and white
two-story brick house that sits on West Grand Boulevard, next door
to the James H. Cole Home for Funerals. And cotoneaster, a wealth
of these shrubs, along with a few others and some small trees.
</P>
<P>
   I like hostas as well as anyone, and cotoneaster has fine form.
It's a berry producer, which always makes it a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But as neat and nice as these are, they are not what I want to
find on this hot day. Not at this shrine to the Motown sound, where
echoes of the Supremes hum in my ears: Baby love, my baby love ...;
where the Four Tops swing through my mind: Sugar pie, honey
bunch....
</P>
<P>
   No, I am here hoping for something else, something somehow
evocative of that long-ago innocence in music, when the Temptations
were singing ``My Girl,'' when Michael Jackson wasn't whoever he is
but was one of the Jackson Five, bouncing around bubble gum hits
such as ``ABC'' and ``I Want You Back.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's obvious I've come in search of a slice of my youth,
hoping to find it in plants that could remind me of Motown when it
was kicking out the jams _ when that music accompanied my heated
pleasure in making my own hits. Just what those plants might be
(graceful willows, lovely swaying ornamental grasses to recall
Diana Ross? A great oak signifying the Four Tops' longevity?) I
can't say. But I know hostas and cotoneaster are not the ones.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking help in this search, I chat with Thomas Lykes, Motown
groundskeeper. What plants make you think of Motown hit makers, I
want to know. What plants might they have liked?
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about it for a moment, answering: ``They used to like
sitting on the grass a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Grass, of course. What could be more right for Motown's days and
nights? Grass. It's sweet and simple; its uncomplicated nature
meshes perfectly with a recording era uncluttered by today's
supremely high technology that leaves you wondering if what you've
heard is real or synthetic.
</P>
<P>
   I come now in praise of grass, even though I do not grow it.
But, like many plants I don't cultivate, grass appeals to me in
someone else's space.
</P>
<P>
   Even on this scarlet day in Detroit, the lawn looks green, cool,
inviting; it could be a carpet to lie on, a floor to dance on, a
chair to sit in sipping something cool, talking about what the next
hit will be, who next will sing her way to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes, Lykes and I stand gazing at the grass. I see
a dream of the past; he sees reality of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep it green,'' he says, noting that the grass
sits ``right out in the sun. We rely on the rain, and we haven't
got much of that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, do I ever know what he means. I feel my plants in Atlanta
and McCaysville suffering so much, I think of taking a midday train
to Georgia. But I can't. Motown memories really got a hold on me.

 &HT;    Don't let your lawn or garden be a victim
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead. Grab it with both hands. Steady that aim.
</P>
<P>
   But before you begin blasting away, think about what you're
doing. With one shot of that hose, you could be about to level your
lawn or garden.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there's a real science to watering. Think of
water as a chemical; if you use it incorrectly, you could do more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Water for too long and you invite fungus to invade plants and
lawns. Water too little and roots become shallow. Water in the
evening and insects come out to feast. Water from too high and
nearly half the moisture evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do is to go out after work and
sprinkle the lawn for 10 minutes,'' said Wayne McLaurin, a
University of Georgia horticulture professor.
</P>
<P>
   Drowning in confusion? Join the crowd. Water crimes are being
committed all day and all night.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say homeowners need to become more aware of their habits
regarding such a precious resource.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 3 percent of the world's water is available for use,
McLaurin said. ``But when you see a sprinkler going round and
round, you're using about 300 gallons of water per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's windy, about 40 percent of that water is tossed into the
air, where it evaporates. That's why McLaurin recommends soaker
hoses and drip irrigation over sprinklers, so water will be
delivered directly to roots.
</P>
<P>
   What's the most heinous hose crime when it comes to lawns?
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to water enough at one time,'' said Walter Reeves,
horticulture educator with the DeKalb County(Ga.) Extension
Service.
</P>
<P>
   In summer heat, lawns growing in Georgia's heavy clay soil
typically require an inch of water per week, which takes a
sprinkler about 90 minutes to deliver to one area, Reeves said. Yet
a common sight is the well-meaning homeowner, armed with the latest
in hose attachments, waving a quick spray across his centipede
before retreating minutes later to the cool comfort of the den.
</P>
<P>
   And, typically, that takes place in late afternoon or early
evening. Unfortunately, watering at that time of day allows lawns
and plants little time to dry before darkness falls. And drying is
important because wet foliage attracts disease and insects. In
addition, water evaporates most quickly in the heat of afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The net result of light waterings is shallow root systems, which
promote heavy top growth and, eventually, a matted layer of thatch.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and shrubs, especially recently planted ones, require
direct watering. ``You want to give them a real good soaking at
least every week to 10 days,'' McLaurin said. ``Take care of them,
because you've probably got a lot of money in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they are such big consumers of water, trees can suck
needed moisture from nearby plants. ``People need to establish
priorities in their landscapes,'' Reeves advised. ``It may be
easier to take down a tree they don't care about rather than
struggle with flat after flat of impatiens.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to plants in containers, most require daily
watering, because roots and soil are confined. Don't allow the soil
in pots to dry out, Reeves warned, because then the soil will
shrink, forming a well around the root ball instead of allowing
water to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   If all that watering sounds like a lot of work, help is
available. A layer of mulch, such as composted leaves, pine straw
or pine chips, placed around the base of plants will help soil
retain its moisture.
</P>
<P>
   And mulching cuts down on water consumption. ``When you do
water, make it count,'' McLaurin said. ``Just don't waste it.''

COMMENTARY: TWO SICK NATIONS, ONE CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's Saturday's news quiz:
</P>
<P>
   1. Is there really any difference between Boris Yeltsin and
Suharto or between Russia and Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   2. Isn't the real reason that the IMF is giving Russia $17
billion and Indonesia only fish bait simply the fact that Russia
has 20,000 nuclear weapons still pointed at the West, while
Indonesia is only capable of shooting itself in the foot?
</P>
<P>
   Let's answer these one by one. First, Indonesia and Russia are
suffering from the same general disease _ microchip deficiency
disease. It is no accident that the Soviet Union, General Motors,
IBM and centrally directed Asian capitalism all were forced to
restructure in the same decade. They could not deal with the new
dynamic created by the microchip and the personal computer _ which
made dispersed systems of business, production, information
gathering and governance much more efficient than centrally
commanded ones.
</P>
<P>
   As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers likes to put it:
``Communism, planning ministries and corporate conglomerates all
ran into great difficulties in the same era because with the PC and
the microchip it became much more efficient to empower individuals,
who could get more information and make more decisions themselves,
rather than having a single person at the top trying to direct
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies and countries that did not empower individuals that
way ended up with a lot of obsolete people, which breeds
counterproductivity, misallocated resources and ultimately
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   GM and IBM restructured. Russia and Indonesia, however, went
from one extreme to the other. They went from centralized states _
where the bloated center dominated everything _ to non-states, with
no strong, legitimate institutions to collect taxes, regulate
capitalism or provide a social safety net. Both Russia and
Indonesia are now learning a fundamental truth about this
high-speed, free-market era: The state and institutions matter
more, not less. While you need to get the SIZE of your government
down, you need to get the QUALITY of your government up. Otherwise
your free market is all freeways and no stoplights, and that breeds
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no doubt the IMF backs Russia because it has
20,000 potentially loose nukes. But there is another reason. Boris
Yeltsin, for all his faults, is a real reformer, freely elected,
with a team that understands the challenge of this era and is on
the right side of history. That is simply not the case in
Indonesia, where President B.J. Habibie is an unelected, kinder,
gentler Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's top negotiator with the IMF, Anatoly Chubais, remarked
in Washington last week that despite all the tough conditions being
imposed on Russia by the IMF, anti-Western feeling in Russia has
not been growing _ because an increasing number of Russians get it.
True, Russia's Communist Party still regularly smears Chubais as an
agent of the CIA, the IMF and the Mossad. `` `OK,' I tell them,''
said Chubais of his debate with the Communists, `` `Chubais is a
spy for the CIA and IMF But what is your substitute? Do you have
(any alternative) workable ideas?''' They have none, which is why
even some of the Communists are now coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently,'' said Chubais, ``I was testifying before the Duma
and (a Communist member) challenged me: `What is the level of money
supply you are planning to have? What is your M2 target? You gave
us wrong M2 numbers.''' Such a conversation with a Communist was
unimaginable six years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news, and it justifies the IMF's bet on Russia.
But let's be clear: It's still a bet, because this is hard stuff.
To use a computer analogy, Russia first needed to get a whole new
operating system _ capitalism _ plus the software to go with it,
i.e., the rule of law. Indonesia had the operating system _
capitalism _ but it stuck with an old, centrally directed version
(DOScapital 1.0) that was fine in the 1970s but unsuited for the
high-speed '90s. And Indonesia had very little software.
</P>
<P>
   Getting your operating system and software up to speed requires
cultural changes and institution-building, often in an environment
of economic inequality, democratic chaos and global competition.
Politics in places like Russia and Indonesia is going to be about
managing this painful process. That they have no other choice is
for sure. That we have no other choice but to support those who
``get it'' is for sure. The outcome, though, is not for sure.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wenders' great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Clockwatchers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this wicked take on workplace hell, four temps (Toni
Collette, Lisa Kudrow, Alanna Ubach, Parker Posey) bond over
happy-hour wings and shared grievances about working in a place
rife with petty politics and ubiquitous Muzak. Fledgling filmmaker
Jill Sprecher has some plot problems, but when she sticks to the
subtle nuances of the typical dysfunctional corporate ``family,''
she's dead-on. So's her cast, especially Posey as a born rebel who
keeps herself sane by minor acts of sabotage. Rated PG-13 for
language. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   High Art R
</P>
<P>
   Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives us a stunning lesson in the
high art of acting as a once-famous photographer who becomes
involved, both personally and professionally, with an ambitious
young editor (Radha Mitchell) at a chi-chi manhattan magazine. In
the film's pivotal role, Sheedy is all wired intensity and wary
irony. Rated R for language, drug use, nudity and sex. 1 hour, 42
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox
News Service) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Mafia! PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Francis Ford Coppola is sobbing. But his masterpiece,
``The Godfather,'' isn't the only movie to take a hit in this
ridiculous spoof by writer/director Jim Abrahams, part of the trio
who brought us ``Airplane!'' and ``The Naked Gun'' series. There
are also jabs at ``Casino'' and ``Il Postino.'' The late Lloyd
Bridges plays the head of a crime family; Jay Mohr (``Jerry
Maguire'') is his ruthless son. Rated PG-13 for profanity, violence
and drug content. 1 hour, 33 minutes. (Knight Ridder Newspapers)
Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Marie Baie Des Anges R
</P>
<P>
   How do you say ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' in French? OK, so this
tale of two teens _ sultry Marie (Vahina Giocante) and foxy Orso
(Frederic Malgras) _ on the Riviera is a lot hotter than anything
Frankie and Annette ever tried. Still, despite its sexy aura and
divine setting, it comes off as an unintentional parody of those
``hot'' art ficks from the early '60s. Like its gorgeous young
leads, it's all attitude, without a coherent thought in its pretty
head. Rated R for nudity, brief violence and sexually charged
situations. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil
schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert blend of
panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor. Rated PG-13
for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jealousy R
</P>
<P>
   A small-scaled, smart-talking charmer. Eric Stoltz is so jealous
of his new girlfriend's (Annabella Sciorra) romantic past that he
joins a therapy group to spy on her ex (Chris Eigeman). Noah
Baumbach's hip neurotics may not be like Woody Allen characters,
but they're a lot like people who grew up on Woody Allen movies.
And while the film never entirely satisfies as a rich romantic
comedy, it's an accomplished, pleasant diversion. Rated R for
language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the. But
Walken is terrific, bringing a wry humor and an intimidating temper
to his down-but-hardly-out mobster. Rated R for language and
violent situations. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit, and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM)

 &HT;    Franklin Graham finds common thread of faith
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Franklin Graham, 46, founder of the international relief
organization Samaritan's Purse and recognized successor to his
father, evangelist Billy Graham, told the story of his own life in
his first book, ``Rebel With a Cause.'' Now, in ``Living Beyond the
Limits,'' he recounts the stories of other people who have made an
impression on him. He lives with his wife and children in Boone,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Where did you find, and how did you choose, the people you
write about?
</P>
<P>
   A:These are people I've met along life's road that have made
impressions on me, lessons I've learned from them, values I've
adopted. There's a common thread that runs through each of them.
Each person is a person of faith, a person of prayer, and a person
who's 100 percent sold-out to almighty God.
</P>
<P>
   I believe there are a lot of people ... who are living a life
that's unfulfilled. They may go to church and Sunday school, but
something's not clicking. I believe God has a plan and a purpose
for every child of his. I want that person to know God's plan and
to experience it. To do that, we've got to be in sync with God.
We've got to surrender ourselves to him. We've got to be able to
trust him. That's hard to do. We like to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are some of the lessons you learned from the people in
the book?
</P>
<P>
   A:The first chapter is on facing our fears. I had a fear a
number of years ago about going to Angola during the war, but I
really felt there was something calling me and drawing me to
Angola. I went. It's the only place I've ever been where I was
afraid, and I had a feeling in my soul I wouldn't come back. As I
look back, I think God was using that to teach me to face my fears.
I'm sure the Apostle Paul, when he had to go to Rome, was afraid.
He was shipwrecked. He had a chance to run, but he didn't. As a
result, he's changed history.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Describe someone whose story you tell in the book.
</P>
<P>
   A:There was a woman from West Virginia named Mary Damron. We
call her Mama Gump in the book. She was helping with a project
collecting shoeboxes filled with Christmas gifts for children in
Bosnia. She showed up with 1,200 shoeboxes. I was impressed with
this woman of humble background who collected 1,200 shoeboxes on
her own, without any help from me and without even being asked. The
next year, she collected 5,000. Somebody in the White House heard
about it and invited her to Washington to meet President Clinton.
She said she didn't want to go. She said she didn't know anybody up
there. She said she'd go if I would go. I told her I wasn't
invited. I called the White House and tried to explain. ... We get
up there, and the president is honoring people in volunteer work
who had been working in Bosnia. He was getting ready to sign the
Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he asks me to meet with him privately in his office.
He said, ``How're your mom and dad?'' We chatted, and he asked me
how I met this woman from West Virginia. I told him I hadn't found
her, she had found me. He said, ``She's the most powerful woman I
ever met.'' ... He invited Mary to come back in. She asked me, ``Do
you think it'd be OK if I prayed for that-there president?'' We go
back in, and Mary said, ``Mr. President, can I pray for you?'' He
looked a little surprised and said, ``Yes, Mary, please.'' She
prayed a very simple prayer. It went something like, ``We pray for
the president and all the responsibilities he carries that affect
all our lives. We pray he will make the right decisions. In Jesus'
name, amen.'' There were tears running down the president's cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   I've been back to the White House several times. Each time he'll
ask me, ``How's that woman from West Virginia? How's Mary Damron?''
</P>
<P>
   She made an impact on the president because she was bold. She
realized that what the president needed was not advice, not another
policy _ it was a prayer invoking the power and wisdom of almighty
God.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Does your mother or father collect stories of people?
</P>
<P>
   A:My mother has been kind of a pack rat all of her life,
collecting stories and illustrations, recording things. She's
working on a book now _ ``How to Be Married to a Preacher and
Remain a Christian.'' I think she's got Dad a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What about your father? After all these years, do you think he
still learns from the people he meets?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think we all do, to some degree. We can learn good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Would you expand on that idea?
</P>
<P>
   A:I've always in life tried to look for those people that can
strengthen my life, and what principles they have used, and try to
copy or follow the same example. If we want, we can do the same for
bad. We can look for the evil, for the wicked, and copy those too.
... What we need to do is follow the example that Christ set,
follow him.

 &HT;    Brennan's icy beauty never quite thaws
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bono, the lead singer for the Irish rock band U2, first
heard the voice of Maire Brennan, it almost killed him. In a
magazine interview, Bono said he lost control of his car and
skidded into a roadside ditch when he heard Brennan's voice on his
car radio because he was distracted by its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan's voice does that to people. It is haunting. And it can
be heard on the soundtrack of the film ``Patriot Games'' and
through the music of Clannad, the Irish band that helped kick off
the Celtic craze in the United States (at one point Brennan's
sister Enya also sang for Clannad).
</P>
<P>
   With ``Perfect Time,'' Brennan has ventured into the world of
Christian music for the first time. Though it is her first solo
Christian album, it sounds like Clannad's music. It is full of
luscious background harmonies, dreamy synthesizer textures and
assorted acoustic instruments that evoke images of a mist-shrouded
Irish countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the songs on the album blend English and Gaelic
language lyrics. Two songs, ``Song of David'' and ``Na Paisti''
(``The Children''), are sung completely in Gaelic. The album's
title track is the strongest song. It opens with the gentle sound
of an uilleann pipe and rich background harmonies. Brennan sings
about abandonment to God with a childlike simplicity that makes the
song even more endearing.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Heal This Land,'' Brennan tackles a more difficult subject
_ religious conflict in Ireland. She does this over the trademark
Clannad sound: soothing harmonies and floating synthesizers. ``O
Lord, you can heal this land,'' Brennan sings. ``Honor and glory
tied up in chains. Blind to the future that keeps us in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked this album, but only in measured doses. Brennan's voice
and music are soothing and polished, yet for an extended listen it
sounds too soothing. What is missing is a sense of emotional
abandonment. Brennan's music and vocals have an icy beauty that
never quite thaws.

 &HT;    More than 30,000 Lutheran teenagers in Atlanta for one of the
largest gatherings of young Christians ever held.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Brace yourself, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of young people will descend on downtown Atlanta
today. They will fill hotels. They will jam subway stations. They
will dance into the night.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no party. The visitors are Lutheran youths who are
coming to Atlanta to serve, not to party.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30,000 teenagers are expected for the National Lutheran
Church-Missouri Synod Youth Gathering, held at the Georgia World
Congress Center and the Georgia Dome today through Wednesday. It's
one of the largest gatherings of young Christians ever held.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will be hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Look for kids wearing red backpacks emblazoned with the
gathering's theme, ``Called to Be,'' a biblical phrase taken from
the Book of Romans: ``And you also are among those who are to
belong to Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The teens will fulfill that call in the streets of Atlanta. They
will distribute canned food, work in soup kitchens and clean parks.
One group will even build a Habitat for Humanity house _ inside the
Georgia World Congress Center. The home will subsequently be moved
to a prepared site in East Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not go unnoticed,'' said Eric Cannedy, 15, of
Marietta, who will participate in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The national youth gathering, founded in 1980 and held every
three years, draws young people 15 to 18 years old from all over
the United States and from as far away as Germany and Japan. Among
Christian youth gatherings, it is surpassed in size only by the
Catholic Church's World Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
   The event virtually has become a rite of passage in the Lutheran
church. Many of the participants' older siblings attended previous
gatherings. Now they say it is their turn. The goal: building
friendships and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited to meet people from around the country and
around the world,'' said Eric, whose parents attended a previous
youth gathering. ``We get a chance to welcome them in our city and
in our homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Johnston, 38, one of the conference's organizers, said the
gathering is designed to reach out to young people in a way the
traditional church often does not. Many of the events are geared to
keep teens' attention. Every night, participants will meet for
Christian music and games. Tuesday night will feature a rock opera.
Teens also can take classes on contemporary issues such as living
in a blended family, chastity and racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want these kids to come away feeling that each of
them as an individual counts, that God loves them and that they
will take that message to someone else,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Jones, 19, of Marietta, who is helping to organize the
event, said Atlantans shouldn't worry that the teens will trash the
city.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this group prefers to clean up trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to change the community for the better when we leave
it,'' she said.

NBA AND UNION TO RESUME TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the backdrop of two legal actions taken by the
players association, the league and the union will resume
bargaining Aug. 6 in an effort to move closer to resolving the
disputes that have left the National Basketball Association in a
lockout for more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled session, which was announced Friday, will be the
first time the two sides have bargained since an unproductive
30-minute meeting June 22. Since then, the union has fired off two
legal shots at the league: a grievance on behalf of players to be
paid during the lockout, and a charge filed with the National Labor
Relations Board challenging the owner-imposed lockout as unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal actions have been in response to what the league has
done,'' said union executive director Billy Hunter. ``At the same
time, we are pursuing collective bargaining, and the legal actions
have not delayed that process in any way. We have scheduled a
bargaining session Aug. 6 and intend to follow through with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the players association borrowed a page from its major
league baseball counterparts when it filed a charge with the NLRB
alleging that the league had imposed the lockout without having
come to an impasse, as required by law. With the NLRB's help, the
1995 baseball strike was brought to an end. After deciding that the
owners had not bargained in good faith up until the point that the
baseball players went on strike, the labor board asked U.S.
District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor to restore the original work
rules. Judge Sotomayor granted an injunction and ended the strike
on March 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA owners have made multiple proposals, while the players
have refused to budge from their first offer,'' Jeffrey Mishkin,
the league's chief legal officer, said in response to the union's
charge. ``The only refusal to bargain here is by the players.
Arbitration, charges of unfair labor practices and threats of
decertification will not end this lockout. That will occur only if
there is good-faith negotiations leading to a new collective
bargaining agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association's latest charge follows a grievance
filed by the union with arbitrator John Feerick on behalf of
players whose contracts call for them to be paid during the
lockout. In response, the NBA sued the union, contending that the
league should not have to pay players during the lockout and that
it should not have to go to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The league also asked that Feerick, who reduced Golden State
guard Latrell Sprewell's suspension by the league for choking his
coach, be removed as arbitrator on the grounds that his term had
expired. Feerick will hear arguments next Thursday concerning
whether he has jurisdiction in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the dispute is the owners' desire to put a
ceiling on how much players can earn in a system they reluctantly
approved three years ago. &QL;

FAMILY OF BOMBING SUSPECT MAY BREAK SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ala., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ In a development that federal authorities say
could help lure out of hiding an accused abortion-clinic bomber,
someone representing one of his relatives has asked to make a
public statement here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that the representative, whom they did
not identify, may be a lawyer working for the mother of the
fugitive, Eric Robert Rudolph, who has eluded law-enforcement
agencies for nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
   He has been charged with setting off a bomb at a Birmingham,
Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and
injured a nurse. He is also wanted for questioning in three
bombings in Atlanta, including one that killed one person and
injured 111 at the 1996 summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be an encouraging sign,'' said Earl Woodham, a
special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
a spokesman for the federal, state and local law-enforcement
agencies that have been searching for Rudolph in the mountains of
western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not participating in this,'' he added. ``But the family
wants to make a statement through their representative, and they
want the publicity. That could be a positive sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodham said that someone who claimed to represent the Rudolph
family contacted the FBI and expressed a desire to speak in
Andrews, where reporters wait for periodic updates from the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   He said the conversation with the representative was ``not
adversarial,'' but he declined to speculate on why the family is
choosing to comment now, after months of intensive search efforts
by as many as 200 agents. He conceded that one possibility is that
they might ask Rudolph to give himself up and face charges, rather
than risk a dangerous confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hears it,'' Woodham said of the representative's
message, ``it may hit him. The handwriting is on the wall.
Everybody wants the man to give himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter, has touched off what Woodham
described as one of the United States' largest fugitive searches in
recent years in terms of the number of agents involved, the amount
of time they have been searching and the sophisticated equipment
they are using to comb acres of rugged terrain. The mountains
around Andrews are generally virgin forest, with thick underbrush
and heavy foliage. The area is home to wild boar, bears and snakes.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators, who have been tracking the region, say they
have a general idea where Rudolph has been spending his time. In
addition to finding a pickup truck he recently took from an
acquaintance, George Nordmann, authorities say they have found
fingerprint samples at campsites he might have used while in
hiding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Woodham also said other evidence suggests that over his six
months in hiding, Rudolph has lost ``a significant amount'' of
weight, has grown a beard and may be wearing his hair in a
ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   Woodham said authorities may have additional evidence of his
whereabouts, but it would not necessarily be in their interest to
divulge it. ``If we said what we have and he has a radio, we're
telling him what we know,'' Woodham said.

 &HT;    On deck: Pittsburgh Pirates
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Three Rivers Stadium
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (10-8, 3.62; 1-1,
3.54 lifetime vs. Pirates) vs. RHP RHP Francisco Cordova (8-8,
3.13; 1-3, 1.04 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Cordova appears to have recovered from an awful string of
performances when he went seven starts (June 6-July 10) without a
win. His last two outings may have been his best consecutive starts
of the year _ eight shutout innings against the Cubs, followed by a
one-run, six-inning perfromance against the Mets. How the Braves
have beaten him three times is a mystery. He has pitched carrer 26
innings against Atlanta, given up three earned runs and still has a
1-3 lifetime record against the Braves. The Braves last defeated
him 3-1 at Turner Field April 16. Neagle should improve over his
last start, or heaven help him. Stuck without an effective
changeup, Neagle was ravaged for eight hits and nine runs by the
Cubs last Monday in the worst start of his career and the worst by
a Braves starter in six years. He has been encouraged by his recent
side sessions and is determined to throw more breaking balls this
time, a pitch he simply forgot to use against the Cubs. The Pirates
are a challenge for him. The Pittsburgh crowds have been hard on
him when he returns to his old town and the bulk of the Pirate
order _ Jason Kendall, Jose Guillen, Tony Womack and Kevin Young _
have a combined .394 career average against him.

 &HT;    Falcons' FB is Christian in name and spirit
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Falcons fullback Bob Christian has come a long way
since breaking into pro football, so maybe it's fitting that he
traveled all the way to South Africa and Zimbabwe in the offseason
to spread the message that faith makes anything possible.
</P>
<P>
   Christian, 29, was concerned that he would not be able to
communicate, when he traveled to Cape Town in February with
Athletes In Action. As it turned out, his story communicated for
him.
</P>
<P>
   American football is foreign in that part of the world, but when
the 5-foot-11, 230-pound Christian explained how he never gave up
during a tough career, he felt like his message was heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if I was going to be able to get the message
across,'' said Christian, who last season was one of the leaders of
the Falcons' Bible study group. ``I ended up telling how I
struggled, getting cut three times, and perservered to end up doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in some ghettos like you couldn't believe, and you
could see how maybe some people, if they failed at something, might
give into despair. But I could see in their eyes, some of them,
that they were receiving the message: Don't give in, don't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian's group, which also included former Falcon defensive
back Darnell Walker and team chaplain Charles Collier, went from
South Africa to Zimbabwe. They went to a small village, and
Christian discovered a very different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things probably haven't changed there in 1,000 years. They
were all barefoot and carrying things in baskets on their heads,''
he said. ``They didn't have any electricity or running water.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eye-opener for Christian that put his career in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   After setting several school rushing records at Northwestern,
Christian was cut by the Falcons in 1991. Then he was cut by the
London Monarchs of the WFL in 1992, and again the same year by San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But he made the practice squad for the Bears the same year,
played in the last two games, and then two more years in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 with Carolina, he caught the first pass in franchise
history _ against the Falcons. He missed the 1996 season after
tearing a pectoral muscle in the preseason, and the Falcons signed
him as a free agent last year.
</P>
<P>
   He carried the ball seven times for 8 yards, but he caught 22
passes, one for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he threw a lot of lead blocks for Jamal
Anderson and Byron Hanspard and helped pick up blitzing
linebackers. He's a critical special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chance I get to tote the rock, I love it, but I don't
expect to be the main runner,'' said Christian, who is still
looking for his first career rushing TD after carrying 63 times for
214 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of satisfaction out of laying a good block to
spring Jamal for a good run, even if nobody notices. I kind of like
being about to go out and not have anybody recognize me.''

 &HT;    1997 second-rounder Davis quits Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- What was considered the Atlanta Falcons' big reach of
the 1997 NFL draft turned into a massive flop on Friday, when
second-year defensive tackle Nathan Davis quit on the second day of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a second-round draft choice, walked away from a drill
eight minutes into the morning practice and told coach Dan Reeves
his heart wasn't in it. Reeves didn't try to change Davis' mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him so many times it doesn't make any
difference,'' Reeves said. ``When he said he just didn't have it,
and he didn't feel like he wanted to play, I didn't want the door
to hit him in the back on his way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was a non-factor as a rookie, reporting to Suwanee last
summer injured, out of shape and overweight despite a three-year,
$1.74 million contract. He achieved ``active'' status for only two
games during the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been highly regarded by many NFL personnel people
after his senior season at Indiana, but the Falcons had hoped he
would fill needs on a thin defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of training camp Thursday, he played poorly at
backup right tackle. A medical report revealed he was playing with
a ``stomach illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he lost 13 pounds by taking diuretics on Wednesday
night in an effort to get down to 295 pounds, a preassigned
reporting weight. He weighed in at 313 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Davis played at 285 pounds as a college senior,
when he was slowed by a pelvic injury that lingered into last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't feeling it, and at this level you can't play that
way,'' Davis said after quitting. ``The past two days I went 180
degrees from where I was the night before camp started. I was
feeling good, in better shape, feeling strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I (lost) 13 pounds that night ... taking Vivarin (a
non-prescription stimulant), a lot of them. That didn't work too
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was put on the ``reserve/did not report'' list, and the
Falcons got a requested roster exemption from the NFL to fill his
spot. The team brought in William Gaines, a 6-foot-5, 318-pounder
for a tryout on Friday afternoon. Gaines played with the Redskins
last season. The Falcons are expected to fill the opening today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts when you have a second-round draft choice you're
hoping is going to be a player,'' Reeves said. ``But you make a
mistake, you admit it and move on. We tried everything we could to
make him a player, but it's got to come from inside. You can't
change a man's heart.''

FEUDS TAKE TOLL ON DIVISIVE ZAPATISTA MOVEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, July 26) 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASOJA SHUCJA, Mexico _ Gnawing through its fifth year, the
stubborn Maya Indian rebellion of southernmost Mexico continues to
devour lives and tear psychic wounds within communities that may
take decades to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Rent by clashing visions of their people's place in the world,
Maya parents have disowned their children, cousins have killed one
another, villagers have forced neighbors they've known since birth
to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict grinds on with scant hope for easy settlement,
the Zapatista rebel movement that once seemingly promised renewal
for Mexico's impoverished Maya has become mired in personal
rivalries, village backbiting and religious schisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left our brothers, our mothers, our fathers,'' says Mario
Torres, a 24-year-old Roman Catholic lay leader and rebel supporter
who led his family and five others into exile in this farm hamlet
in northern Chiapas state three years ago. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We don't know when we can return,'' Torres says, as scores of
pro-rebel refugees nod in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Maya all, the rebels and their enemies sprout from the same thin
soil. They work the same land, eat the same foods, worship the same
Christian God and traditional Maya deities. But, encouraged by
insurgent and government leaders, they have thrown up barriers
between themselves, often resorting to bloodshed to settle their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Maya villages here were solidly Roman Catholic
and controlled by traditional leaders, or ``caciques,'' who kept
them solidly in the camp of Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Now, communities are splintered between the PRI and opposition
parties, between Catholicism and a host of Protestant faiths,
between reactionaries and radicals, between those who oppose the
Zapatista rebels and those who support them.
</P>
<P>
   Feuding across eastern and northern Chiapas has killed hundreds
of people since the mostly Maya Zapatista National Liberation Army
staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994. The Zapatistas are
demanding greater indigenous rights as well as economic, social and
political reforms in Chiapas and throughout Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees from one side or the other have been
forced to flee their homes, first as the Zapatistas seemed to gain
the upper hand and then as government forces regained military
control over much of rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, and those who love them, claim the government has
stoked the violence by pouring guns and money in, favoring certain
groups over others, playing on old hatreds and new ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates claim that at least a dozen
``paramilitary'' organizations, which they say have been financed,
armed and trained by the Mexican government and the PRI, operate in
the Maya areas of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Zapatista Maya complain that the rebels have been
heavy-handed in trying to force everyone to join their rebellion
and reject the public works bonanza that the government has
showered on Chiapas since the uprising began.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides blame the conflict on a shortage of good
land and on economic deprivation, as common here as corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without bread, work or social justice, there is no peace,''
says Roberto Albores Guillen, 55, the fifth PRI governor of Chiapas
in six years. He took office in January after allegations of
government involvement in a massacre of pro-rebel Indians forced
his predecessor to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catalyst for the violence is poverty,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a time-honored formula for buying peace in Mexico, the
government has poured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
roads, schools and health clinics into the state's Maya areas.
Government officials are promising the creation of some 300,000
jobs over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from the beginning, the Chiapas conflict has been as much
about religion as about politics or poverty. The Protestant
transformation that has swept the Maya communities since the 1970s
has driven yet another wedge among people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the (Catholic) Church took a radical,
ultraradical, attitude in this area,'' says Samuel Sanchez, a
Chol-speaking Maya schoolteacher and PRI state congressman who
helped found a pro-government group known as Paz y Justicia, or
Peace and Justice, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates claim the group is among the most deadly
of the anti-rebel organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have rejected the diocese for promoting conflict in the
region and conflicts between indigenous brothers,'' Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONFLICTING LAND CLAIMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista movement came late to Masoja Shucja and dozens of
other Chol Maya villages in the spooky, misty mountains near the
ruins of Palenque, the majestic city that many believe ranks among
the purest expressions of ancient Maya culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas launched their rebellion in Tzeltal-, Tzotzil-
and Tojolabal-speaking Maya settlements of the Lacandon rain
forest, a swath of canyons and river valleys along the Guatemala
border. The rebels quickly gained a following in some Tzotzil Maya
villages near San Cristobal de las Casas, the largest city in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But not long after the Zapatista uprising rebellion began, Chol
farmers invaded thousands of acres of ranch and plantation land
that they claimed had been stolen from their ancestors. A peasant
movement sympathetic to the Zapatistas and linked to the opposition
Democratic Revolution Party quickly gained popularity. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Generations of rage and resentment made the Chol, like other
Maya groups, ripe for rebellion. After losing much of their land in
the Spanish conquest, many Chol villagers worked as virtual slaves
on coffee plantations and cattle ranches owned by German and U.S.
companies as late as the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Zapatista idea arrived in the Chol communities, it
swept through the area like a religious revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas were talking about the poverty of the people,''
says Torres, the Catholic lay leader, or catechist, in exile in
Masoja Shucja. ``When they rose up, we had to find a way to express
ourselves, to join them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-rebel villagers, who opponents say were encouraged and led
by Catholic priests and catechists, pressured their neighbors to
join.
</P>
<P>
   No fence-sitting was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started having problems because they didn't want to
join them. We felt very threatened,'' says Marcos Albino Torres, a
32-year-old farm union activist in Tila who, human rights group
say, is a military leader of Paz y Justicia. ``In those days, there
was no justice for us. No army, no police, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the squabbling has been about land, as it has been for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual eye, the land seems abundant and productive
enough. In the summer rainy season, gray and white clouds drape
hump-shouldered mountains. Small villages dot hillsides and sit in
valleys among a mosaic of fields planted in corn, beans, fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But families of eight or more children are common in these
villages. Farmland granted by the Mexican government in the 1930s
has been divided among sons and grandsons. The average Chol farm
has shrunk from about 50 acres to less than 10 acres. A growing
number of families has found it all but impossible to make a living
from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caciques'' and non-Indian ranchers hold a disproportionate
amount of the land. Conflicting claims have spurred bloody disputes
among families and villages. &QL;

   ``Let's not let a single second go to waste,'' observes
 &UR; Miriam Goodman &LR; , who reports that exercisers pedaling away the
pounds on two stationary bikes at the YMCA in San Francisco are
thereby creating enough energy to activate the attached computers.
</P>
<P>
   This gives the fitness enthusiast a chance to work out while
surfing the Net, shopping electronically, watching TV, &LR;  or checking
out e-mail. In addition, says the center's health and fitness
coordinator  &UR; E.J. &LR; , an incentive program earns gift certificates
for CDs; last month, exercisers earned frequent-flyer miles for
every mile pedaled.
</P>
<P>
   (Goodman's observation came the same day the New York Times

   At the Rite-Aid pharmacy in San Francisco last weekend,

front by some kids arguing with the cashier over whether they'd won
a free Coke in a contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on for a few minutes,'' writes Chris, ``until a tall
blond woman waiting in line said, `Look, we're in a hurry here. Why
don't each of you kids grab a Coke from the cooler. It's my treat.
Just hurry!' ''
</P>

up his saxophone Thursday at a 90th birthday party for  &UR; Lionel &LR;

of the films they're creating. If a composer were commissioned to
write for ``Mighty Ducks,'' for example, he shouldn't write a song
about ducks playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to picture some bony Canadian foghorn belting out one
of them eternal love anthems,'' writes Was, ``that work with
anything from ship sinkings to killer asteroids. Vagueness and
dime-store sentiments should always prevail when writing for the
movies.

`fashion.' ''

MASOJA SHUCJA, Mexico: families and villages. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We have been left with nothing,'' shrugs Cristobal Gomez, 42,
who frets about dividing his 10 acres among four sons. ``We have no
corn, and we have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and Savelino Torres, his friend and fellow Presbyterian in
the village of Tzaquil, were among those who balked at revolution.
(Savelino Torres, Marcos Albino Torres and Mario Torres are not
related. After centuries of intermarriage among the 200,000-odd
Chol Maya, Torres and a few other last names predominate in the
region.)
</P>
<P>
   Because Savelino Torres had lived for a time outside of Chiapas
and was thus considered worldly, his father and other pro-Zapatista
elders in Tzaquil wanted him to lead their movement, he says. But
Savelino Torres, who had renounced the Catholicism of his family to
become a Protestant, was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we peasants were going to take away everything the
merchants had,'' Savelino Torres says. ``I didn't like that. I
didn't want to be with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In anger, his father, an uncle and several cousins beat him
unconscious on the village basketball court in November 1994,
Savelino Torres says. On the same day, pro-rebel villagers killed a
teen-age boy, who also had declined to join the Zapatista movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own father was going to kill me,'' Savelino Torres says,
shaking his head at the thought. ``They said they were going to
harm anyone else like me who refused. We felt very threatened. The
majority of us were going to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Savelino Torres and other Zapatista opponents in 83
villages across the Chol highlands formed Paz y Justicia. Human
rights advocates say the group acquired guns from the government or
from local ranchers and merchants, then began pushing back at the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing bloodshed, at least 69 members of Paz y Justicia
and 23 Zapatista supporters were killed. Zapatistas were expelled
from pro-government villages. Government supporters were run off
from rebel strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in the Chol region mirrored that sweeping Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces _ encouraged and, many believe, armed by
local PRI leaders _ massacred 45 unarmed Zapatista supporters in
the mountain hamlet of Acteal in December. Last month, army and
police forces killed eight Zapatista supporters in the town of El
Bosque after stepping into a squabble between pro- and
anti-government villagers.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, 19 pro-rebel families, including cousins of
Savelino Torres, fled down the mountainside from Tzaquil to the
Zapatista village of Masoja Shucja, where Mario Torres had taken
refuge with people from his own town. Many of the families from
Tzaquil have since negotiated with their anti-rebel neighbors and
returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Torres, who remains in Masoja Shucja, admits that he
served as Zapatista leader in his hometown of Miguel Aleman. He
says he had to leave after a pro-government faction gained the
upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government Maya block all the roads leading into Masoja
Shucja and other Zapatista villages. No one can enter or leave
without their permission. And permission is rarely granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who left are our cousins,'' Savelino Torres says of the
rebel supporters who fled from Tzaquil to Masoja Shucja. ``We think
about it a lot. We feel bad about it. But those who have stayed out
there still think they will win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CULTURAL INTOLERANCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, among others, argue that the Maya are
feuding today largely because that's what they've always done.
</P>
<P>
   Ruins of ancient cities dot the mountains and forests where the
Zapatista uprising simmers. Some scholars believe that interminable
warfare among these city states eventually destroyed classic Maya
culture _ famous for its architecture, written language,
mathematics and astronomy _ a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of languages and dialects spoken by the scarcely 6
million Maya in Mexico and Central America today are a legacy of
that fragmented ancient society.
</P>
<P>
   The ``quarrelsome culture'' explanation infuriates Zapatista
supporters, who say there would be no conflict if the government
did not encourage it. But even some scholars sympathetic to the
Zapatista demands say that cultural intolerance plays a role in the
current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a mechanism for pluralistic expression,'' says
Gary Gossen, an anthropologist at the State University of New York
in Albany who has made the Tzotzil Maya of the Chiapas highlands
his life's work. ``You're either in or you're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapatista supporters tend to portray the rebels as the only true
indigenous activists in Chiapas. But the Zapatistas represent just
one of many pro-Indian social movements that have sprung up in the
state's Maya areas over the past three decades. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Supporters of the rebels tend to be loyalists of Samuel Ruiz,
the Catholic bishop in the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas
and a proponent of ``liberation theology,'' which holds that it is
a Christian's duty to actively promote change benefiting the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-rebel Maya largely come from conservative Catholic families
or from the many mainstream Protestant or evangelical churches that
have gained followings in Chiapas in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Paz y Justicia leader Sanchez and other Zapatista opponents
claim that Ruiz has used Catholic lay leaders to push the Zapatista
rebellion among poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Samuel (Ruiz) has always talked of the injustices, and
that's why they said he caused this,'' says Mario Torres, the
Catholic catechist finishing his third year as a refugee in Masoja
Shucja. ``But Samuel didn't invent our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights activists blame Paz y Justicia for last
November's ambush of a convoy in which Ruiz was traveling that left
several catechists wounded. The pro-government group continues to
prevent priests and pro-rebel catechists from entering the villages
that it controls.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Catholic-linked human rights group complained that
Paz y Justicia members were intimidating a priest in Tumbala, a
Chol village near the market town of Tila.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONEY ROLLS IN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An avalanche of government money has fallen on the Chol
communities in the years since the Zapatista rebellion came here.
But, as in other indigenous areas of Chiapas, almost all of the
money has gone to areas controlled by pro-government Maya.
</P>
<P>
   Zapatista supporters ``see us as a counter-revolutionary force,
a defender of the ruling party and of the government,'' Sanchez
says after a Paz y Justicia meeting in Tila in which slates of PRI
candidates for October's local elections were proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the PRI has been using us for 70 years,'' Sanchez says.
``Now we can use the party for our own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   New hospitals, water treatment plants and schoolrooms have been
built in Tila and the farm villages that surround it. The roads
connecting Tila to nearby towns have been widened and paved. Shiny
new aluminum roofing covers houses that relied on thatch before.
</P>
<P>
   Army units control the highways, and state police patrol
pro-government areas. Crime has dropped, villagers say, and people
feel safe again.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo helicoptered into Tila earlier this
month to make a showy donation to Paz y Justicia. Human rights
groups say the money likely will go for weapons. Sanchez and the
group's other leaders say the money will be used for agricultural
development projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing, so the only way to advance is to work with
the government,'' Marcos Albino Torres, the Paz y Justicia leader,
says as he meets with followers in the concrete-floored front room
of his small house in Tila. ``We go with whatever party is
ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunkered in their villages, Zapatista supporters sneer at what
they consider the sellout attitude of Paz y Justicia. The more
money the government dangles before them, the Zapatistas say, the
more resolved they are to hold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have sold themselves for just a little money,'' Mario
Torres says of anti-Zapatista Maya.

   ``Let's not let a single second go to waste,'' observes
 &UR; Miriam Goodman &LR; , who reports that exercisers pedaling away the
pounds on two stationary bikes at the YMCA in San Francisco are
thereby creating enough energy to activate the attached computers.
</P>
<P>
   This gives the fitness enthusiast a chance to work out while
surfing the Net, shopping electronically, watching TV, &LR;  or checking

coordinator  &UR; E.J. &LR; , an incentive program earns gift certificates
for CDs; last month, exercisers earned frequent-flyer miles for
every mile pedaled.

   At the Rite-Aid pharmacy in San Francisco last weekend,

front by some kids arguing with the cashier over whether they'd won
a free Coke in a contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went on for a few minutes,'' writes Chris, ``until a tall
blond woman waiting in line said, `Look, we're in a hurry here. Why
don't each of you kids grab a Coke from the cooler. It's my treat.
Just hurry!' ''

   Thinking the car was in trouble, Walton kept watching as his own

   ``Better to picture some bony Canadian foghorn belting out one

GM DEALERS FEEL PINCH OF STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As the General Motors strike drags into its seventh
week, Arizona car dealers are beginning to feel the pinch in repair
parts and are running out of the more-popular GM vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area is better supplied with GM cars and trucks than
some other areas of the nation, according to local dealers, though
they fear that a prolonged strike will cost them sales and the
goodwill of regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part, they say, is that the strike has kept customers
from shopping in GM showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing the showroom traffic we usually see in
July,'' said Tony Komandina, president and general manager of the
Biddulph automotive group in Glendale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are seeing that dealers are low on
cars and they think we're raising prices,'' he added. ``That's
really not true. We still need to move our inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   GM cars are still fairly plentiful, dealers say, but trucks are
in short supply across the state, especially the popular full-size
sport-utility vehicles _ Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, and the GMC
Suburban and Yukon _ with smaller dealerships running out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all out of Yukons and Suburbans,'' said LaVelle McCoy,
owner of McCoy Motors in Flagstaff, Ariz., which deals in Pontiacs,
Buicks and GMC trucks. ``I delivered my last Yukon over the
weekend. They're the hotter merchandise, and they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm missing business, particularly in that segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mullan, a fleet manager for Bill Luke Chrysler who also
supplies GM vehicles for lease customers, said that in the Phoenix
area, ``most of the trucks are gone, and it's getting worse and
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have cars to sell, but they don't have trucks to sell,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the strike hit June 5, GM unveiled a retooled line
of full-size pickups and sport-utility vehicles that the
dealerships were anticipating with enthusiasm for the fall. But
very few of them were built, and their arrival will most likely be
pushed back several months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger dealerships, such as Biddulph, are holding up mainly
because of the volume of their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley (Phoenix area) dealers really do have good
inventory,'' Komandina said. ``There are some areas of the country
where they are out of cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his supply of Yukons and Suburbans, usually about 100
``on the ground,'' is now about half that, he said, raising
concerns that he could run out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this is affecting us is in (GM) parts,'' he said.
``There are shortages in sheet metal (body parts) and high-volume
parts, like alternators, air-conditioners and transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, GM's not out of parts, but locally, we can't
replenish.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said his dealership has a customer's Suburban waiting for
repair after a fender-bender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any idea when we'll get the parts to fix it,''
he said. ``We're trying to locate parts, but it's probably not
going to be fixed until the strike's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming on the horizon, people are going to have trouble
getting parts for their existing GMs.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy agreed with Komandina's assessment that the strike is
costing dealers business not so much because of shortages but
because of public perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that the strike is definitely dampening the public's
desire to shop for a GM vehicle,'' he said. ``We have inventory,
but business is lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, who's been in the car business for 30 years, said he's
seen several major GM strikes but believes this one could be the
most serious ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like this is going to be the mother of all GM
strikes,'' he said. &QL;

ALARMS (Phoenix) - If you believe the numbers, Phoenix-area
homeowners have more to fear from Christmas decorations, billowing
drapes, and feisty ferrets than from robbers. That's because 65
percent of the alarms called into Phoenix police are false, wasting
millions of dollars and thousands of hours annually. False reports
are now fined, and the worst offenders go to False Alarm School. By
HANNAH MILLER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMMIGRANT-BOMBS (Undated) - In deadly summer heat, illegal
immigrants crossing the southern Arizona desert are increasingly at
risk of being blown up by bombs. Rising numbers of trespassers are
traveling through the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range
northwest of Yuma, a site controlled by the Marine Corps but used
by all military branches, even NATO, to train bombing pilots. The
danger is advertised on warning signs in Spanish in English, but
that hasn't deterred crossers. In just two weeks between June 19

the increased traffic will cost lives. By GRACIELA SEVILLA. Story

RYAN-SNAFU (Phoenix) - Steven Spielberg ran into a first-class
snafu Friday morning, when copies of the new World War II film
``Saving Private Ryan'' failed to show up in some of the nation's

Harkins, AMC and United Artist theaters, leaving matinee filmgoers
to find some other film to save them from the summer heat. By
RICHARD NILSEN. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAR DEALERS (Undated) - Arizona dealers in General Motors cars and
trucks find supplies on vehicles and mostly parts getting tight,
though it's not as bad in AZ as it is in some other parts of the
country. The hot-selling Suburbans and Yukons are gone, in some
cases, and customers' cars are stacking up waiting for parts. Worse
is the public perception that dealers are out of cars entirely or
trying to gouge customers for scarce vehicles, resulting in empty
showrooms and and lax sales for July. By BOB GOLFEN. Story movedin

 &QL; 
ASTEROID - A mile-wide asteroid that could one day collide with our
Earth, and destroy life on our planet, was discovered recently by
Arizona scientists using a new device specifically designed to
search for potential killer space rocks. Dubbed ``1998 MQ,'' the
asteroid is the first near-Earth space debris discovered by Lowell
Observatory's Near-Earth Object Search, or LONEOS, which began
scanning the night skies from Flagstaff in March. LONEOS is part of
a larger project funded by NASA, which has the goal of discovering
at least 90 percent of all near-Earth objects within the next

DOG-CAT - (undated, NYT) - Everybody splits the world into two

RIGBY-PROFILE (Phoenix) - When Cathy Rigby soars above audiences in
``Peter Pan,'' youngsters see only a wondrous creature, a ``boy''
who can really fly. Their imaginations are engaged. Their elders
can't help seeing a different Rigby, a shyly smiling 15-year-old
with blond pigtails and amazing moves who roused spectators at the
1968 Mexico City Olympics. The more thoughtful recall the
vulnerable young woman who struggled with bulimia and self-image
problems. Never a tragic figure perhaps, Rigby had her share of
dark corners waiting for the light. Unlike Peter Pan, she grew up.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I would have felt sorry for Chelsea Clinton if I
hadn't been so busy feeling sorry for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us, a couple of rows apart, was devoting the afternoon
to one of the least fashionable pastimes in this company town _ the
theater. The play, ``Sweet Bird of Youth,'' was fast devolving into
a farce Tennessee Williams did not intend. Fifteen minutes into the
performance, a fire alarm sent the cast and audience scrambling
into the street. When it was determined that the cause of the alarm
was an errant child pulling an alarm-box lever _ a future drama
critic? _ we all went back inside to see a star performance (by
Elizabeth Ashley) of the sort that's prized in a city where the
acting style is set by filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered: Would the Secret Service agent in the seat in front
of me rather be here or under interrogation by Kenneth Starr?
Either way, he and the first daughter were trapped, whereas I could
exercise my constitutional rights and take a hike at intermission.

<P>
   The Shakespeare Theater _ the site of ``Sweet Bird'' _ usually
operates at a higher level. As I left the theater I was struck
again by its bravery. Situated since 1992 in a redeveloped
retail-and-residential building called the Lansburgh _ after its
former occupant, a department store that died not long after the
1968 riots _ it is a flagship enterprise in an effort to revitalize
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Shakespeare Theater is a critical and popular
success, downtown Washington still seems as sleepy as it has been
since 1968 _ if not before. Even back in 1951, a guidebook titled
``Washington Confidential'' described Washington as ``Peoria on the
Potomac'' and said its ``Main Drag,'' F Street, was ``an insult''
to the whole idea of urbanity: ``Any night, Saturday included, the
heart of America's heart is dark and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Lansburgh is near the new MCI Center and such
high-culture institutions as the National Portrait Gallery (housing
a smartly done exhibit on ``Celebrity Caricature in America'') and
the National Museum of American Art (with a revealing Stuart Davis
retrospective), it would take perpetual fire drills at all of them
to make the neighborhood pass for a lively urban environment. The
abandoned hulks of F Street's other lost department stores, Hecht's
and Woodward &AMP; Lothrop, still cast long shadows.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the most pertinent cultural event here right now is a
tiny, unsung exhibit at the National Building Museum, in the
palatial old Pension Building at Fourth and F. Titled ``Building
Culture Downtown,'' the show features the architecture of six very
new American cultural centers, from Newark, N.J.'s Performing Arts
Center to the San Jose (Calif.) Repertory Theater, that represent
``new ways of revitalizing the American city.''
</P>
<P>
   Will these revitalizations work? It's too early to tell, but
some skepticism is called for. Beautiful cultural centers, no
matter how architecturally splendid, do not in themselves mandate
sophisticated culture: one new building featured in the exhibit,
the just-opened Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas, is
currently hosting one of the aged road tours of ``Phantom of the
Opera. Nor does culture in itself and in a vacuum necessarily
mandate downtown rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   In their new book persuasively arguing for less grandiose, more
indigenous urban renewal, ``Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for
Downtown,'' Roberta Brandes Gratz and Norman Mintz write that ``a
collection of visitor attractions does not add up to a city,''
whether those attractions are cultural centers, convention centers,
aquariums, stadiums or enclosed malls.
</P>
<P>
   Their words were echoed by the entry of a visitor to the
``Building Culture Downtown'' exhibit's comment book: ``Almost all
these structures are built outside the life areas of the cities.
They become isolated, dead architectural events. Cities are where
the people are.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that each city has its own genes. What works in New
York (where Times Square has been revitalized by the pop culture of
Disney, not the high arts) won't work in Detroit. In Washington,
there's talk of throwing still another cultural facility _ a
National Music Museum _ into a downtown that lacks, among other
urban amenities, a single movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling irony that one strolls out of Washington's
``Building Culture Downtown'' exhibit into a downtown full of
culture and all but devoid of life.

 &HT;    CAPITOL TOURISTS 'SHOCKED,' 'SCARED' BY SHOOTING INCIDENT
 &HT;    With CAPITOL-SHOOTING-0725.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the whirlwind of police cars, television cameras
and hurried reporters swirled around the Capitol grounds following
Friday's fatal shoot-out, vacationing onlookers stared at the scene
with shock and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really shocking and scary that he could get passed
security,'' said Carolyn Brunson, a 20-year-old visiting from
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   `` It's sad that this happened in such a public place -- in the
focal point of Washington, D.C.,'' added Chris Brown, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Once the scene was roped-off and reporters were moved far from
the Capitol building, tourists became curious spectators of the
chaotic scene outside. Vacationers joined groups of reporters
bunched up around witnesses relating their harrowing tales over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Nichols, 15, who had been on a different floor of the
Capitol at the time of the shooting, stood with her parents and
little sister, Jenna, near a podium covered by dozens of black
microphones.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, were waiting for the official update.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty scared. There was so much yelling. I want to know
what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three sisters from Hawley, Minn., who had been at the Capitol
building earlier Friday morning, stood on the grass, staring at the
marble structure.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, they were at the Library of
Congress across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just saw a bunch of lights,'' said Carlene, 23. ``I thought
somebody fainted in the heat and needed an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the last thing on my mind,'' she added, declining to
give her last name. ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, Connie, 17, said the news was frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary because the female tourist (victim) was just
20-years-old,'' she said about one of the shooting victims. ``It
could have been me.''

GYMNASTICS GREAT CATHY RIGBY SOARS AS STAR OF `PETER PAN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Stars always travel with baggage. Not Louis Vuitton,
though there's plenty of that. Expectations. Who they have been,
who the public thinks they are. There's no escaping the past when
the future is a hostage to memory. It's the black hole of fame.
</P>
<P>
   When Cathy Rigby soars above audiences in ``Peter Pan,''
youngsters see only a wondrous creature, a ``boy'' who can really
fly. Their imaginations are engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Their elders can't help seeing a different Rigby, a shyly
smiling 15-year-old with blond pigtails and amazing moves who
roused spectators at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics to a sustained
roar of ``ole!'' as she dominated the U.S. gymnastics effort. Or
maybe they remember the Rigby of four years later, when, still a
teenager but also a budding beauty, she inspired similar cheers in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The more thoughtful recall the vulnerable young woman who
struggled with bulimia and self-image problems and who, after her
second Olympics, moved into the equally competitive arena of show
business, fighting to secure a place in a world where she no longer
was supple enough to work the balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   Never a tragic figure perhaps, Rigby had her share of dark
corners waiting for the light. She doesn't pretend otherwise or
chide her fans for bringing up the past. Unlike Peter Pan, she grew
up. One can forgive her for thinking she made rather a nice job of
it.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, she is a respected actress, with her own theater and a
Tony Award nomination to her credit. She is a crusader in the fight
against eating disorders, speaking openly about her personal
battles. More importantly to her, her marriage is a byword in a
business where relationships are ephemeral, and her four children
are proof that living in the spotlight doesn't necessarily lead to
a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   That engages the imagination, too. In a way that
rigging-assisted flight never could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have been one to put my mind on what lies ahead of
me,'' Rigby says. ``I don't look back. It isn't easy. I wouldn't
tell you that it is. But if you want to be happy, you must take
control of things.''
</P>
<P>
   She does look back, of course. She can't help it. There was no
escaping the clips of her Olympics achievements when ABC's ``Wide
World of Sports'' named her one of America's Most Influential Women
in Sports. And hardly a month goes by that ESPN doesn't mention her
name in some context or another. (``Honestly, I don't own stock,''
she says, laughing.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she raises the memories herself. She has become a
national spokeswoman in the fight against eating disorders. Her
video on the subject is a bestseller, and she spends as much time
at the podium giving motivational speeches as she does on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's purely business. And fun.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Rigby came through Phoenix in another
production of ``Peter Pan,'' earning rave reviews and big box
office. The success was duplicated on Broadway, where she had the
added joy of earning a Tony nomination (as did the show). Fans
loved the musical and kept asking her to revive it. Finally she
did.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the press kit says. She seems to be under
the impression she's appearing in ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is really terrible here in Kansas,'' she says
during a phone interview. ``We had tornado warnings last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse us, Dorothy, but we placed our call to Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my gosh, I'm not doing that show, am I?'' she giggles. ``I
can't believe I said Kansas. I did it on the radio once. Got the
place completely wrong. What can I say. Touring drains the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   An interview with Rigby is like putting on a pair of those bunny
slippers: warm and fuzzy and who cares how dumb they look when they
feel so good? Or, in this case, how dumb the questions must sound
to a woman who's heard them all before. She never lets on that
she's bored. No wonder she was America's Mother of the Year in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I adore playing Peter Pan. Who wouldn't? You never
have to grow up and you have all those wonderful songs. And you get
to fly. Really, really fly. I love that part. A new company is
handling my rigging on this tour. They're mostly young, and we get
each other into trouble. On the first tour, when I would say I
wanted to go higher and further out over the audience, the people
in charge would say, `Now, Cathy . . .' These guys _ they just get
this excited look and say, `Cool!' My husband gets very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because Tom McCoy is co-producing the show with
Rigby. She falls, he loses a star. To be honest, chances of that
happening are slim because (A) McCoy supervises that rigging like a
husband in love and (B) Rigby says, ``I've actually had fewer
problems than I did on the first tour. I joke about it, but we're
really very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, McCoy and Rigby accepted an offer from La
Mirada, Calif., to take over operation of the city's performing
arts center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came at a really good time,'' she says. ``We were thinking
of moving to the East Coast because we thought it might be easier
to pursue our careers there, but our families are in California.
That's no small matter. I'm one of five and Tom is one of 11. To
take the children away from that would have been difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple stage up to six musicals a year at the theater along
with numerous special events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have the best of it,'' she says. ``Tom does the dirty
work, like putting together the budgets. I handle the artistic
side. I sit out front and say, `This is what I think.' Tom lets me
get away with it because he knows that, if I weren't stuck behind
that desk, we'd be in Connecticut!''
</P>
<P>
   This second tour of ``Peter Pan'' is a result of a successful
revival at La Mirada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew people liked the first version, but even so we were
surprised at the response to the revival,'' she says. ``I guess we
shouldn't have been. A new generation of children has come along
that hasn't seen the show. I don't know what there is about the
Peter Pan story, but it absolutely engages kids. And their parents,
too. I think all of us secretly wish we had never grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time she toured through Phoenix, her children
accompanied her. This time, Ryan, 18, and Theresa, 16, have other
plans for their summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep them in Never Land, no matter how hard you
try,'' Rigby sighs.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaitlin, 13, is traveling with her mom and Buck, 22, is in
the show, playing the roles of the Crocodile who stalks Captain
Hook, and Nana, the dog who looks after the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I'm a mother, so sue me, but Buck is wonderful,''
Rigby says. ``It couldn't have been easy auditioning for his
parents, but he got the job because he was right for the parts. The
response has been incredible, especially for Nana. I tell you _ he
just gets into that dog.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stephen Granoff, an analyst for the John Hancock
family of mutual funds, was fairly confident that the stock of
Computer Associates International would soon reach a record high.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by good earnings prospects, the shares of the company, a
giant in business software, had been sailing upward for months, and
on Tuesday were trading in the high $50s.
</P>
<P>
   But Granoff, like many investors, was stunned on Wednesday when
the stock opened at a distressing $39.50. It had lost 31 percent of
its value overnight after company executives warned that the Asian
economic crisis was cutting into the earnings of its large
multinational customers, which, in turn, would put a six-month
brake on Computer Associates' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite quarterly earnings that were slightly better than
expected, investors fled, apparently alarmed by a warning that
raised as many questions as it answered. The stock ended the week
at $39.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff struck hardest at mutual funds with big bets on the
company, which is based in Islandia, N.Y. Several large fund
companies were major holders of Computer Associates stock when they
most recently reported their portfolios, most notably John Hancock,
Massachusetts Financial Services and Putnam Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies typically report holdings only twice a year,
making it hard for investors to know which stocks their funds hold
without calling the manager.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, Putnam reported holding 38.2 million
shares, scattered among a number of funds. If Putnam still holds
that many, it has a bigger stake in the company _ 7 percent _ than
Computer Associates' chairman, Charles Wang, who held 37.6 million
shares on July 6, according to the company, including a
controversial stock grant it made to him two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam declined to discuss its interest in Computer Associates
stock, as did MFS. But elsewhere, the ranks of big believers may be
shrinking. Hancock, which has been a big investor in the company
for at least 10 years, decided last week to trim its position
slightly, Granoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't comfortable with the uncertainty surrounding
the stock,'' Granoff said. ``There's uncertainty as to who their
largest customers are _ it's tough to get the names out of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's also very difficult to determine why they decided to
come out with this information right now,'' he added, referring to
the warning about Asia. ``We're only three weeks into the new
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the stock grants that Wang and two other executives
received in May _ together worth $1.1 billion at the time _ as a
bonus for tripling the company's market capitalization in three
years? Lingering investor resentment over the grants may have
exacerbated last week's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   But Granoff played down the resentment. Technology companies
commonly hand executives lucrative stock and option packages early
on, he pointed out, while Computer Associates postponed the rich
reward until after the executives had achieved something specific,
getting the stock price to meet or exceed a preset threshold over
an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exactly how the stock made it above the threshold has
been the subject of recent speculation. A shareholder lawsuit filed
on Thursday contended that the company had been issuing overly rosy
statements about trends in its business. A Computer Associates
spokesman said the company had no comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, one Morgan Stanley analyst, Chuck
Phillips, bucked the tide and raised his rating of the stock to
``outperform'' on Thursday, saying it looked cheap compared with
those of competitors. &QL;

TORRID FORT WORTH IMPOSES WATER RESTRICTIONS AFTER WATER MAIN
BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth and 25 of its Tarrant County
customers on Friday imposed mandatory outdoor water restrictions
until Monday after a catastrophic water main break hobbled the
massive delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   The fracture of a 36-inch water main that feeds much of the
central city, and the subsequent flooding of the North Holly
pumping station and water treatment plant, reduced by about 10
percent the city's capacity to deliver water during the area's
second-hottest summer on record.
</P>
<P>
   With no water to chill commercial air-conditioning units, it
also made for a long and hot night for patients in southside
hospitals and guests at downtown hotels and prompted thousands of
government and corporate employees to dismiss employees on what
turned out to be the 19th consecutive day of 100-degree
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The city estimated the break affected 100,000 people for at
least some time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though one top official declared Thursday night's failure
one of the city's worst water disasters in modern history, a number
of people breathed a sigh of relief that it didn't occur in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, there is no perfect time for it to happen,'' said
Laura Van Hoosier, a spokeswoman for Harris Methodist Fort Worth
hospital, which went without water and air-conditioning for nine
hours. ``But thankfully, it was during the middle of the night and
the city fixed the problem fairly quickly, so we were able to begin
the day with a pretty normal operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The water main break occurred on Fournier Street just west of
downtown about 10 p.m. Thursday and was repaired about 3:30 p.m.
Friday. While the break was large, it probably would not have been
major news except that escaping water flooded the pumping station
and water treatment plant next door.
</P>
<P>
   The North Holly plant treats and pumps about 80 million gallons
of water a day to downtown Fort Worth, the medical district, down
to about Berry Street, north to 28th Street and west to the naval
air station.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Fisseler, deputy water director for the city, said he would
put the incident as the third- or fourth-worst water-related
problem in modern history, ranking somewhere behind the 1949 flood
and the drought of the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   City officials suspect the cast-iron pipe snapped under
prolonged stress from water demand and the shifting of dry, cracked
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to have a water main break in the summer,''
said Pat Svacina, a city spokesman. ``What's so different about
this was that it was next to a pumping station. It got elevated
from a routine water main break to a distribution problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the water department can dry out and clean the eight pumps
and get the treatment plant back on line, the other pumping
stations will remain under greater stress than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fixing the line will help the system in terms of pressure, but
we still have a problem with capacity,'' Fisseler said. ``We know
we've got enough for domestic use and fire protection, but if
people irrigate, we think it will jeopardize the system.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Fort Worth and the 25 municipalities and other
entities to which it provides water have banned outdoor water use
such as watering lawns, filling pools or washing vehicles at least
until Monday. They also encouraged cautious use of water indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials urged a voluntary compliance, the water
department can cut off water to people who do violate the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that everything will be back to order by early next
week,'' Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said. ``I don't think anybody
will lose a lot of grass or shrubs in this period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Svacina said city officials hope to keep water use to about 240
million gallons a day, down from the 275 million gallons averaged
the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washing clothes, taking a shower, washing dishes, those do not
create peak demands like when people come home and turn on those
lawn sprinklers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the smaller cities and water companies supplied by Fort
Worth acted swiftly in issuing water restrictions after Fort Worth
asked each to cut back about 10 percent. Many were posting signs,
putting notices on cable television channels, mailing fliers to
residents and going door to door to alert people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't said they would send us any less. They just asked
us to cut back and we have obliged them,'' said David Vestal,
Forest Hill's city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom Park, which only started buying Fort Worth water this
month to augment its wells, is beginning its own rationing program
after Monday, with residents in even-numbered addresses watering on
even days and odd-numbered addresses on odd days.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, which usually consumes 5.8 million to
6 million gallons per day, has also cut back on its outdoor
watering and ``will rely more on Dallas water until the emergency
subsides in Fort Worth,'' spokesman Joe Dealey said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who receive water from the North Holly plant
probably experienced short-term problems, city officials said, but
downtown and the medical district took longer to recover.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 7 a.m. before Harris Methodist began receiving
water again and about 5 to 6 a.m. at Cook Children's Medical
Center, both of which use water for their air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Neither hospital reported any emergencies, just some discomfort
among patients and employees. Fire departments in Fort Worth,
Burleson, Everman and Rendon provided water to help the chillers at
Cook's, but Harris Methodist's chillers are too large for that type
of temporary fix, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses at both facilities used fans, bottled water, ice and wet
towels to keep patients comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose and thousands of downtown workers poured into
hot office buildings with no working bathrooms, managers and
executives began sending some of the lucky home early, including
employees from the Tandy Corp., Harcourt Brace book publishing in
City Center II and the Pier One offices.
</P>
<P>
   Although water pressure was returning to normal in Tarrant
County buildings by mid-morning, the inside temperatures were
deemed too high to continue working, County Judge Tom Vandergriff
said.
</P>
<P>
   He sent all county employees home at 11 a.m., with the exception
of those in the jail, security and data services departments. The
district attorney's office, however, didn't wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there was a problem when I couldn't fill up my
coffee pot,'' said Richard Alpert, chief of the misdemeanor
division. ``I knew it was going to be a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of the taller buildings had cooled off by mid-day, but
early Friday, security guards were dissuading people from taking
the elevators in the 32-story Chase Texas Tower and the 38-story
City Center II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to discourage people from going to their
offices for their safety,'' said M.G. Smith,, project manager of
the City Center towers. ``We were very concerned about the
elevators because of the heat in the building. We were worried that
it could affect the motors.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem even reached the ice skating rink at the Tandy
Center, where the surface was empty and a bit soupy Friday morning.
Rink employees said they turned away quite a few customers, but
11-year-old Kim Koirtyohann learned about the rink the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It covered my whole blade,'' said Koirtyohann, referring to
the water that had settled on the rink.

HOUSE PASSES HEALTH-CARE BILL BUT LEGISLATION'S FUTURE REMAINS
UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.D.)  (js) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turning to a popular election year issue, the House
on Friday passed a contentious Republican bill that would expand
the rights of millions of patients who are dissatisfied with their
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill, which faces a possible presidential veto,
would guarantee coverage of emergency medical care in certain
cases, allow consumers to appeal disputed decisions to an
independent board, assure open communication between doctors and
patients, and permit women to go directly to obstetricians and
gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   It also aims to decrease the number of uninsured by expanding
the use of medical savings accounts and allowing businesses to band
together to buy insurance, two provisions the White House and
Democrats vigorously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up its own proposals in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats have traded a flurry of barbs and
advertisements over patient protections in the past few months, and
lobbyists have spent millions of dollars trying to frame the
debate. The issue is one of the few to spark voters' interest in a
humdrum election year, in large part because consumers feel
frustrated that they are not getting the care they deserve from
cost-conscious managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the partisan wrangling over the issue, the House
legislation squeaked to victory by a 216-210 vote, with 10
Republicans opposing the bill and three Democrats supporting it.
Still, the bill's passage gives Republicans something to offer
voters on the campaign trail and it helps mute Democratic attacks
on a Republican ``do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic measure, supported by the American Medical
Association, that would have included more sweeping, but costlier
protections, failed Friday by a 212-217 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a patient today or think you might be one in the
future, you ought to thank your lucky stars that this bill passed
today,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who has championed
patient protections for the past two years and who pushed his
leadership to take up the issue. ``In general I can go home and
tell my folks they are on second base.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation's prospects are far from certain as the
issue wends it way to the Senate, back into negotiations with the
House and then on to President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked the legislation on Friday as a ``sham'' and a
``fig leaf,'' and the White House said that Clinton would likely
veto it, dampening prospects that the bill will become law. Adding
to the uncertainty, Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., said Friday that
he was ``very pessimistic'' a bill would be signed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There are also considerable differences between Senate and House
Republican bills, which could prove difficult to iron out. The
Senate is expected to act on its legislation in the coming weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House decided to move forward with the legislation after
late-night negotiations on Thursday with Republican moderates and
conservatives, who were unhappy with the bill for different
reasons. In fact, most members did not see the final legislation
until shortly before debate began on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that Republicans were trying to ram the bill
through, without committee hearings, to keep them from scrutinizing
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling the congressional battle over managed care down to its
ideological essence, Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Friday that
Democrats sought only to enrich one of their truest constituents
and contributors with their bill _ trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   One major difference between Democrats and Republicans on the
issue centers on granting patients the chance to sue their managed
care plans and recover substantial damages for denial of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give you better treatment, faster with medical specialists
at lower costs,'' Gingrich said. ``But we do one thing that our
good friends can't stand. We don't make the trial lawyers
richer.'' &QL;

IRISH LEADERSHIP SEMINAR ENDS IN DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ A weeklong effort to bridge the gap among Northern
Ireland's politicians ended by showing just how far the two sides
have to travel, as members of two Protestant parties refused to
attend a final press conference because it included ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   A confusing, contentious scene unfolded as a result, much to the
chagrin of the event's organizers. The dissenters tried
unsuccessfully to stage their own briefing in the same room after
the first one ended. They were told that they had to talk to
reporters in the adjoining hallway instead.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of this week's executive program at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government was to teach leadership skills to
members of the various Irish factions and to improve the atmosphere
as they talked with one another. And, by all accounts, a good deal
of that goal was accomplished. Moreover, all the participants
agreed there was far more diversity of opinion, openness, and even
camaraderie this week than at a similar program in 1996,
demonstrating the progress made in Northern Ireland during the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have forged friendships with people here ... and I think
that's a very, very important step on the road to reconciliation,''
said Dara O'Hagan, a member of Sinn Fein who was recently elected
to the Northern Ireland Assembly. She was among the six officials
of Catholic and Protestant parties who spoke at Friday's official
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   All the politicians praised the program they had just completed
and the people who presented it. But historic animosity dies hard,
and Friday's dramatic detour from the path that Kennedy School
officials had drawn demonstrated just how rough a road lies ahead
for them back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never sit at a podium with terrorists of the IRA-Sinn
Fein,'' said Jim Wells, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly
from a Protestant faction, the Democratic Unionist Party. In
addition to rejecting Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Wells
said his party also objected to the presence of parties linked to
Protestant paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   After the official press conference, leaders of the two parties
that staged a boycott, the Democratic Unionists and the Ulster
Unionist Party, entered the briefing room and removed the name tags
of the half-dozen participants who had just left.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that seemed to confuse nearly everyone who watched,
the two parties' politicians then sat at the table and prepared to
address the reporters present. Within seconds, organizers asked
them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   While there is basic agreement between the two Protestant
factions about the Irish Republican Army, there are differences
that demonstrate the complexities of politics in Northern Ireland.
Democratic Unionists say they will never interact with anyone in
the IRA or its branches under any circumstances. The Ulster
Unionists, the largest Protestant party in the North, say they will
do so once the IRA meets conditions including giving up its weapons
and renouncing violence.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both Protestant parties said progress was made at
this week's program and praised its organizers. But Democratic
Unionists took pains to state that neither they nor Ulster
Unionists had interacted with members of Sinn Fein during the
classes, parties, and other events held for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Democratic Unionists criticized Kennedy School
officials for not sufficiently understanding the sensitivities they
were dealing with when they suggested a single press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The event's sponsors, the Kennedy School and the New York-based
Foundation for a Civil Society, did not want to discuss the
controversy. When pressed, they said the 35 Irish attendees,
representing 16 parties, had agreed beforehand that only a single
briefing would be held.
</P>
<P>
   But Stuart Deignan, a Democratic Unionist spokesman, said his
party and the Ulster Unionists had voiced their disapproval of the
arrangements Thursday and were told only Friday morning that they
could not hold their own press conference. ``I think it reflects
badly on the university and on the organizers,'' he said. ``It does
leave a bit of a bad taste that this happened ... at the very
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, an Ulster University professor who helped put
together this week's events in Cambridge, said that the core
concept of promoting unity and group decision-making would have
been undermined by giving any party or parties a separate forum.

GOP TRIES TO END SPECULATION ON 2000 CONVENTION CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Furious competition among eight cities seeking the
Republican presidential nominating convention in 2000 has created
so much speculation that the head of the party's site-selection
committee moved Friday to quash it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no front-runner,'' Jan Larimer members of the
Republican National Committee who are attending a three-day summer
meeting at the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech to the committee Friday, New York Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani managed to slip in ``just one plug'' for his
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place to have convention,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce competition among the eight cities and intense
lobbying have spurred horse-race handicapping, speculation and
rumors, Larimer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to New York, the cities bidding for the convention
are Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Indianapolis; Minneapolis; New
Orleans; Philadelphia; and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the cities have jockeyed for attention. Former
Rep. Tom Loeffler, co-chairman of San Antonio's Convention 2000
Host Committee, said earlier this week: ``Our frequent appearance
at these meetings has helped catapult San Antonio to a front-runner
position in the convention contest.''
</P>
<P>
   And North Carolina House Speaker Harold Brubaker said Charlotte
appeared to be a top choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Chicago is out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The party conventions, largely beauty contests for candidates,
are highly coveted. In addition to bringing attention to the host
city, they pump millions of dollars into hotels, restaurants and
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Laird Stabler, a site-selection team member from Delaware, said
the race remained ``wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I would be hard pressed to pick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site selection committee has toured several of the cities,
and heads to Indianapolis on Sunday and Minneapolis afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans to narrow the field to three cities by Labor
Day, Larimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the final three are chosen, the site-selection panel will
return to each for further review. A decision is expected later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Republican Party picked San Diego over San Antonio
in part because the Texas city lacked hotel rooms needed for 25,000
delegates, family members, news media and sponsors. Thousands of
hotel rooms have since been added, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Host committees in each of the cities have bid on the
convention. New York has pledged $40 million; Philadelphia $35
million; Charlotte $26.5 million; and Chicago and Indianapolis $25
million each; San Antonio $21.5 million; and New Orleans $20
million in cash and incentives. Minneapolis has yet to announce its
bid.

PURNELL BLOCKED IN QUEST TO BECOME TIGHT END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ When Lovett Purnell emerged on the scene
three years ago, he was considered the heir apparent to Ben Coates
as the Patriots' tight end. It hasn't quite worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Purnell has receiving ability but lacks blocking skills. That
prompted the Patriots to seek a big tight end who could block like
Coates, use him on third-down running situations, and eventually
develop him as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   This year's heir apparent is second-round draft pick Rod
Rutledge, a 6-foot-5-inch, 260-pounder from Alabama, where in a
primarily wishbone offense, he got more chances to mow down
linebackers and defensive ends than he did to catch a football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to replace Ben Coates, I'm here to complement
him,'' said Rutledge. ``I'm here maybe to do some things he can't
do _ though he can do everything. I'm here to help out more on a
blocking standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge knows Coates is on a Hall of Fame career track. Just
28, the 6-5, 245-pound Coates isn't exactly ready for a rocking
chair. But eight years removed from tiny Livingstone College in
Salisbury, N.C., where the football field often didn't have lines,
Coates has endured extreme punishment from the double coverage he's
received ever since he supplanted Marv Cook in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Such grace and toughness may not be seen again. And the undying
faith quarterback Drew Bledsoe has in Coates makes for a special
combination which has produced a prolific tandem.
</P>
<P>
   For Purnell and now for Rutledge, the trick to advancing will be
to study Coates up close, take in everything he has to offer, and
attempt to duplicate what he does on the field.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Coates catches hundreds of balls a day, not only from the
quarterbacks but from the throwing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Purnell has always been impressed by Coates's dedication and
hard work during the season. And this past offseason, Coates, who
like Bruce Armstrong had skipped the regular conditioning program,
took part in the majority of the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's a great guy,'' said Rutledge. ``He watches me go out and
play and improves what I'm doing wrong and helps me do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hard to learn from the best, because that
person's talent level is so far superior to the next guy's. It's
impossible to teach how Coates can get downfield with linebackers
and safeties hacking at him and still manage to catch a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Either you have that ability or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   In Rutledge, the Patriots drafted a big body who they know can
block smaller, quicker defensive ends and perhaps surprise one and
all with his receiving. Most of his blocking has come against
Willie McGinest and Chris Slade during practice, and word is he's
holding his own and then some against arguably tougher competition
than he'll face in games.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who covered Rutledge regularly saw a kid who ran very
well as a sophomore and a junior but then sprained his knee during
spring drills before his senior year and seemed to lose speed. He
wound up starting every game and caught 15 passes. Some of them
were of the spectacular variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those kids who is going to get better and
better,'' said one scout who watched Rutledge a lot. ``No, he's not
the finished product yet, which is good, because he's going to be
able to catch the ball. He's going to be a pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious last season that the Patriots lacked a second big
tight end, especially on short-yardage third-down situations to
block for the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, the tight end is a big emphasis in this
offense,'' said Rutledge. ``When Ben's gone, they have to replace
him with someone who's as good. That's why I'm trying to learn as
much as possible. Technique is very important. Shannon Sharpe isn't
the biggest guy, but see what good technique means to him. Everyone
at this level is gonna be a great athlete, so technique comes in
very handy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge feels he's a different type of tight end from Coates or
Purnell. He believes he'll provide something the Patriots need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovett is sort of like Ben; he's a smaller guy (6-3, 245),
more of a receiver than a tight end,'' said Rutledge. ``He can't
block as well. My first priority is to block, and that's what I
come here as. They'd like for me to do both, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Patriots have tried to test Rutledge's receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can throw me the ball and see if I get open,'' he said.
``They're giving me opportunities, and hopefully, I can open some
eyes. I know I can catch the ball. I have soft hands, but I never
had much of a chance to be a receiver because of the offense we had
at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've opened some eyes with my work ethic,'' he added.
``The new environment and the pressure is tough on a rookie. I'm
trying to keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   He's done everything the coaching staff has asked. He came to
the minicamps in June weighing about 272 pounds. Pete Carroll told
him he needed to lose 10 pounds. Rutledge lost 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made sure I did that,'' he said. ``They felt I was too
heavy. Being lighter always helps with the speed. It could take
away from the blocking some, but not a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's apparently true. Slade and McGinest go up against
All-Pro-caliber tight ends and often make them look silly. It's
happened a time or two against Rutledge, but the big man with the
deep voice has won respect, including from Coates, who has
applauded the rookie's work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Many draft gurus thought Rutledge was taken too high for what he
brings to the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was the type of guy we needed,'' said Carroll. ``Our
need was a blocking tight end, and we feel we have a good one.''

<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ Maybe it was the shifting cultural and
demographic tides. Maybe it was corporate guilt over a badly
neglected brand. Or maybe it was the phone call from the man who
had spent his career in the poultry industry and was still
confounded by a piece of fried chicken in his TV dinner that he
could not trace to any particular part of the bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers like to be able to recognize what they're eating,''
observed Murray Kessler, president of the Swanson frozen foods
division of Vlasic Foods International, which is based in this
Philadelphia suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever finally forced the decision, this much is clear: after
decades of inertia, the Swanson TV dinner, the archetypal frozen
meal born in the 1950s, is getting an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Swanson calls it, anyway. The company, after all,
still features a menu that seems lost in a time warp, with main
courses like fried chicken, Salisbury steak and roast turkey served
with potatoes, corn and maybe some green beans. Some dinners still
tuck a brownie into its own individual compartment, and the turkey
still has a gooey cranberry concoction at its side. Swanson even
acknowledges the stodginess of its product with a certain perverse
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have missed every single trend since the Korean War,''
said Jeffrey Kanter, an analyst with Prudential Securities. ``It's
one thing to miss the Thai food craze, but it's another to miss
Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   But for an American icon like the TV dinner _ named and packaged
that way when the first ones came out in 1954 in order to suggest
the meals represented all that was modern and sophisticated _ even
modest tinkering can, perhaps credibly, be labeled an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   What Swanson is changing is that the fried chicken, its biggest
seller even though it is now produced from fowl hacked into 19
illogical pieces, will be made from more appealing and recognizable
cuts of meat.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, in the Swanson saga, a note of corporate drama
worthy of, say, ``Dynasty'' or ``Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernstock, now Vlasic's chief executive, lost a bid for
the top job at Campbell Soup Co. last summer. And now that Vlasic
has been spun off by Campbell, Bernstock wants badly to show his
stuff. ``The whole goal,'' he said of the latest changes, ``was to
do something significant and symbolic of how we could operate as a
company.''
</P>
<P>
   It was high time Swanson did something. TV dinners _ the label
has stuck, even though the industry years ago dropped that
couch-potato term from its packaging _ are a $300 million business
for the company. But competitors have proliferated, market share is
plunging, and consumer complaints (``Need a microscope to find the
chicken,'' one said) are at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the division was also losing money. The
numbers are depressing: Vlasic has just 9 percent of the $4.5
billion frozen prepared-foods category, running fourth to Nestle,
owner of the Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine brands, which has 26.4
percent, and Conagra, maker of Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's
and other brands, which has 19.8 percent, and H.J. Heinz, with 9.3
percent, according to Information Resources Inc., which tracks
sales in supermarkets and other large stores.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasic is betting on the revamping of the TV dinner to become a
benchmark success that could make the company seem a good bet for
Wall Street, and set it on a path toward profitability and growth
denied by its former handlers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created a year ago from what can best be
described as leftovers. It was spun off as a hodgepodge of food
businesses, including pickles, mushrooms and Argentine beef, that
Campbell Soup decided it could get along better without. Bernstock
is a kind of Campbell leftover, too, having lost his bid for the
chief executive's job to Dale Morrison, an executive best known for
producing impressive growth with Pepperidge Farm cookies and
snacks.
</P>
<P>
   While at Campbell, Bernstock headed the condensed-soup business,
and he readily recalls what low priorities the businesses that now
constitute Vlasic were. ``It's a Statue of Liberty kind of
analogy,'' he said. ``Give us your tired, your poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that set of circumstances begets a certain aggressiveness, a
will to prove something, that some analysts predict could turn into
healthy profits. ``There's a lot of opportunity at Vlasic, because
every one of these businesses was a forgotten child under the
Campbell umbrella,'' said Kanter, the analyst. It might even
outperform Campbell, he said, which is laboring mightily to
increase profits and sales from soup.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Vlasic, that will take time, not to mention money.
``After years of being neglected, you can't turn these businesses
around overnight,'' said Erika Gritman Long, an analyst with J.P.
Morgan. ``It's going to take some significant, up-front investment
that will hurt your earnings before you can turn them around.''

</P>
<P>
   She projects Vlasic earnings for the current fiscal year, which
closes at the end of the month, will total just 49 cents, down from
an initial forecast of $1.29 made when the company was spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The TV dinner emerged from the technological and societal
changes of World War II, said Michael Stern, a columnist for
Gourmet magazine and culinary historian. ``During the war, there
was a lot of promise that the techniques developed to feed the
troops would spill over into civilian life and do what everyone
seemed to want in the late '40s and '50s _ provide more leisure
time,'' he said. ``The TV dinner was a great step in the
convenience revolution. It goes hand in hand with the move out to
suburbia.''
</P>
<P>
   And by helping to do away with daylong cooking of elaborate
family meals, he said, it contributed to ``the unraveling of the
nuclear family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not that people would eat them in front of the
TV,'' he added, ``but that they were as modern as television.''
They also had an element of sophistication, as upwardly mobile
families served them to underscore the point that they did not have
a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   As Stern pointed out, of course, it is the upwardly mobile
people today who enjoy showing off their bread-baking and other
old-fashioned skills.
</P>
<P>
   The way the TV dinner was revised shows where Bernstock's
business priorities lie. He chose Vlasic's best-known line and
largest category, and rather than add one new product, he decided
to work on everything at once.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of saving money, some products, like an
all-dark-meat dinner, were eliminated in favor of a mix of white
and dark. A boneless white-meat dinner was added. New, slightly
smaller chickens were tested and approved, because there would be
less waste from discarded parts, and the company's plant in
Fayetteville, Ark., was reconfigured to handle the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, the Swanson president, recalled visiting factories
around the country shortly after starting his new job in February.
``When I got to the fried-chicken line, one of the people said to
me, `I'm not proud of our fried chicken right now,''' he said.
``They weren't proud mostly because of the way we were cutting up
the chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Practices like ``parts management,'' an effort to economically
control how chicken was used, had failed, he added, and the
elimination of ribs from breast meat, for example, made it
difficult for people to tell what part they were getting.
Complaints soared to 250 for each million unit sales, ``and in this
company, a red alert is about 10,'' he said. As profits fell the
last five years, advertising was yanked away, and the stage was set
for Swanson's big decline.
</P>
<P>
   Once the chicken was reorganized, Bernstock ordered a new
advertising campaign, one whose slogan will be ``Make New Memories
With Swanson,'' aimed directly at families. While one commercial
from the '50s showed a mother swishing out the door in a fur stole,
two commercials the company is now considering show parents
enjoying TV dinners alongside their children.
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending, including the first TV commercials in a decade,
will increase this year to $10 million from $5 million. In the
1980s, though, some $80 million was spent annually on advertising
for Swanson and Vlasic's pickle brands. Executives are in the
process of meeting with retailers around the country, to push
orders of the dinners, and longtime distribution issues are being
ironed out, Bernstock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all ate these things as kids, but we want to generate
interest for a whole new generation of kids,'' he said, adding that
his own four children, ages 14 to 21, eat their share of TV
dinners. The typical frozen-dinner consumer is increasingly older,
well beyond 21, though considered responsive to changes in
packaging and product content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinz has seen benefits from revamping its Weight Watchers
products,'' Ms. Long said. ``Before they changed the products
themselves, they changed the packaging, and their volumes went up.
You've got core users who need to feel there's some variety and
some change there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what else may be coming down the pike, Vlasic officials
offer plenty of hints, but no details, about a new pickle product
that is supposed to be unveiled in October. Analysts are puzzled
about just what that may be, though Vlasic saw huge sales of its
horizontally sliced pickles after it introduced them in 1995. ``I
don't know what they could do with a pickle,'' Kanter said. ``I
mean, Mother Nature grows cucumbers a certain way.''

REVISED PACT IS APPROVED IN SMITH BARNEY BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge approved a revised settlement Friday
of the sex discrimination case at Smith Barney Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Constance Baker Motley, who rejected an earlier version of
the settlement plan last month, gave final approval to the
settlement of the class-action suit in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan after several amendments were made in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant new amendment grants more court
jurisdiction if a new mediation system for resolving employment
disputes runs into difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The new system for settling employment disputes at Smith Barney
would replace mandatory arbitration, allowing employees to take
their claims to an independent arbitration panel instead. That
three-member panel would always include at least one woman and at
least one person with experience in employment law.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Smith Barney painted a tawdry picture of sexual
harassment and discrimination, detailing a ``boom-boom room'' at
the firm's office in Garden City, N.Y., where carousing male bosses
would grope and harass their female subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already had broad repercussions, chipping away at
the securities industry's established system of settling employment
disputes through mandatory industry arbitration _ a system that
critics said favored securities firms and put employees at a
disadvantag.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith Barney case has also influenced a similar class-action
lawsuit filed by women brokers at Merrill Lynch that is scheduled
for a final federal court hearing in Chicago in September. It also
played a part, lawyers say, in the recent decision of the National
Association of Securities Dealers to shelve its requirement that it
adjudicate discrimination claims.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement approved Friday covers some 22,000 women who
worked at Smith Barney between May 1993 and November 1997. Smith
Barney, a subsidiary of Travelers Group Inc., acquired Salomon Inc.
in 1997 to become Salomon Smith Barney. Under the pending merger of
Travelers and Citicorp, that firm would become the
investment-banking group of what would be the United States'
largest financial-services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased and frankly surprised at how soon after the
hearing the judge approved it,'' said Mary Stowell, the Chicago
lawyer who along with her partner, Linda Friedman, has represented
the plaintiffs in both the Smith Barney and the Merrill Lynch
suits. Ms. Stowell said Friday that she hoped national legislation
would ``outlaw mandatory arbitration in all professions.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her law firm are now receiving claims related to the
suit. ``We have had well over 1,000 phone calls and queries about
the Smith Barney settlement,'' Ms. Stowell said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a memorandum sent to employees Friday, James Dimon and Deryck
Maughan, the co-chief executives of Salomon Smith Barney, expressed
satisfaction at the settlement, saying that it ``focuses on
effecting real change and progress rather than simply delivering
monetary rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, the two executives said, will ``give additional
impetus to diversity initiatives already under way at the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement drew criticism from those who argue that it
is not much of a step forward since mandatory arbitration is so
inimical to civil rights in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a sad statement that Smith Barney gets lauded for
merely allowing people to bring claims in a neutral forum as though
that's some great achievement,'' said Cliff Palefsky, a
civil-rights employment lawyer and an avowed opponent of mandatory
industry arbitration. ``But the reality is the system they have set
up is far better than the securities arbitration system.''

RALEIGH CHURCH MAY BREAK WITH SOUTHERN BAPTISTS OVER WOMEN'S
SUBMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Mabel Claire Maddrey, who was born 13 years
before the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, stared at
her television set in bewilderment last June as women delegates at
the Southern Baptist Convention raised their hands in support of a
declaration that asks them to graciously submit to their husbands'
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A Baptist herself, this delicate 91-year-old woman with the soft
and gentle voice does not consider herself a feminist. Yet, for
much of this century, she has followed her own mind, and rarely
submitted to any man's opinions just because she was the one in
sensible heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do remember one time in a small town in eastern North
Carolina, when I was speaking before a congregation in a Baptist
church on behalf of my college,'' said Mrs. Maddrey, thinking back
to 1928. ``I walked right up to the pulpit, and I don't think the
preacher was comfortable with women up there. He said maybe I would
like to speak below the pulpit. So, I took one step down, but I was
elevated, still. That was the only time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others here in the prestigious, influential First Baptist
Church of Raleigh, she cannot understand why, in 1998, any woman
would vote to sacrifice the independence of other women.
</P>
<P>
   The 186-year-old church, a mainstream Baptist congregation but
one that has historically included women in leadership roles, is
expected to vote sometime in the next few months to break from the
Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1,300-member church votes, as expected, to leave the
Convention, it will be the first large, long-established church to
do so over the submission declaration, which asks husbands to lead
their families and wives to serve as gracious, uncomplaining
helpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an 18-year-old daughter, and how could I look at her
and tell her that her opinion does not mean as much as some
man's?'' said Carolyn Dickens, 46, who heads the Deacon Board at
First Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Southern Baptist Convention, 16 million
members strong, said they are not concerned with the church's
impending exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it is a statement of their integrity to finally
say, `We don't like the Southern Baptists, we don't believe in what
they're doing, and we're not going to keep holding on to the
fiction that we are a Southern Baptist church,'' said William
Merrell, vice president for convention relations.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said the declaration is intended to organize Christian
families, ``in a way that reduces the amount of tension and
conflict that American families in many cases are characterized by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of the male should be one of sacrificial love, so
that, as in the case of Jesus, a husband should be prepared even to
die for his wife. The attitude of the child should be one of
obedience to the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of a Christian wife,'' he said, ``should be an
attitude of submissiveness, as opposed to argumentativeness, or
demand, or attempt at conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   At First Baptist, Raleigh's oldest and largest church, the
declaration was the last straw for a congregation that has grown
weary with an organization that it sees as increasingly rigid and
right wing, church members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the wives want to submit, that's their business,
though I don't quite understand it,'' said Mrs. Maddrey, a widow
who was married to the same man for 50 years, and does not recall
submitting very much. ``The problem is with me, when I am a member
of a denomination that seeks to impose someone else's standards and
wishes upon the entire denomination. I'm a Democrat, but I don't
bring that to church with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's decision is important, symbolically and otherwise,
historians say, because the exit of a leading ``first church'' is
proof of the disenchantment some congregations feel with the
Convention's conservative direction. Traditionally, ``first''
Baptist churches are cornerstones of Protestant communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the
resolution, a huge amount, even in churches that are not as large
or sophisticated as First Baptist,'' said Dr. Furman Hewitt,
director of the Baptist studies program at Duke University. ``I
know of rural churches where there is a great deal of
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The stand by First Baptist will embolden other, more moderate
churches in the Convention, he said. ``There will be some who will
follow that lead,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Conservatives took over the leadership of the Convention in
1979, and this is just the latest conflict with its more moderate
congregations. But in the stately old First Baptist, rich in
stained glass and history, congregants say it is a question of
basic freedom to interpret one's faith, and Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation say over and over that they do not
enjoy the attention they are receiving over the expected split, but
they are amused at the notion that some in the Convention consider
them radicals.
</P>
<P>
   In a dinner and business meeting Wednesday night in the church's
auditorium, an elderly woman walked up to the pastor's table and
insisted that someone go fix the American flag. It was being
displayed slightly out of its traditional place near the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people ate barbecue sandwiches and brownies at long
tables before beginning a routine discussion of church business.
When it was a time for a prayer, most of the heads that bowed were
crowned with silver hair. Mrs. Maddrey was a tad late for supper,
but she has been a little flustered since the test she recently
took to renew her driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in the darkened sanctuary, the late afternoon sunlight
stabbed through the stained glass and caused the air above the
wooden pews to glow in lavender, green, gold, pink and red. The
massive Bible near the pulpit was opened to the story of the Good
Samaritan. The pews were padded with velvet cushions, for those
days that the sermons light run a little long.
</P>
<P>
   This is anything but a radical, liberal church, said its
members. A roll call of its membership would would show the pews
filled with religious, political, business and education leaders,
people long bound by Baptist tradition and heritage. They vote both
sides of the ticket, though one woman said many members would
consider themselves conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rich deposit of people who use their brains to interpret
their Bibles,'' said the Rev. Daniel Day, the pastor at First
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Such people feel uneasy toward a Baptist organization that,
people here say, is rejecting long-held traditions of autonomy and
individual conscience, freedoms that their faith was founded on.
</P>
<P>
   But if a confrontation with a large, historic mainstream church
was going to come, it was not unexpected that it came with First
Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Women hold positions of power here. For more than 100 years, the
church has elected women as deacons and half the seats on the
deacon board are held by women. Voices of women in the
congregation, especially those of older ones, are valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a family of strong, independent women,'' explained
Mrs. Maddrey, whose mother served on the Ahoskie, N.C., town
council in 1917, a time when women in politics were rare. ``Not
abrasive, I hope, but independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of her life she has served on civic committees and
charities, usually headed by men. ``But that didn't bother me,
because women are smart enough to get work around the men and get
done the things they want,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickens, who directs a literacy program when she is not
helping with church business, said there is nothing radical about
having women head the deacon board, though some churches have been
slower to allow women into such positions of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very presumptuous to preclude another person's gifts of
leadership,'' said Mrs. Dickens. ``That goes against being a
Baptist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although spokesmen for the Southern Baptist Convention say they
do not know how many, if any, churches may be planning to exit, it
is unlikely that the issue will usher anything close to a mass
exodus. An increasing orthodoxy, like its conservative leadership,
seems to sit well with many members, said Baptists on both sides of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumblings that the Convention is mixing religion and
politics, its membership has gradually grown, from 36,979 churches
in 1985 to 40,887 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell of the Convention said: ``It might be healthier for a
church that is not in sympathy'' to leave the Convention. ``If they
think they have to change us, it is very difficult to do with a
convention of our size.''
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the Southern Baptist Convention can be loosely de-
fined, as churches decide individually to send money, or use the
conven- tion's literature in church, and also may participate in
other Conven- tions, like the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, an
organization of more moderate churches that was formed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist does not use Southern Baptist Convention
literature, for instance, in Sunday school. It no longer sends
money to the Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is rare, historians say, for a large, influential Baptist
church to formally vote to abandon the Convention.
</P>
<P>
   For such a church to come to that point is a process that often
takes years, even decades, said Hewitt, as ``people think about
whether they can separate themselves from the religious community
that birthed them.''
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist of Raleigh predates the Convention. It was founded
in 1812, 33 years before the Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to officially declare itself disassociated with the
Southern Baptists is still ``in committee,'' church members said,
and will require a vote of the congregation. But the church's
pastor said there seems little opposition to it. ``The die is
cast,'' said Day.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Maddrey has made up her mind. She is asked if her late
husband would have expected her to submit, automatically, to his
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noooooo,'' she said.

TEXAS OFFICIALS WORK ON SAFETY AFTER INMATES DIE OF APPARENT HEAT
STROKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State prison officials said Friday they have
begun safety measures to reduce the risk of heat-related health
problems to inmates and employees following the deaths of two
prisoners from the Houston area earlier this summer from apparent
heat strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But the executive director of a prisoner rights organization
said the prison system's efforts are too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Archie White, 48, died June 29 at the Hendricks Medical Center
in Abilene after riding for about two hours on a prison bus without
air conditioning. He was being taken from the Montford prison in
Lubbock to the Robertson prison in Abilene, said Bob Koenig,
director of risk management for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice. White had been sentenced to 28 years for burglary and drug
possession in Brazoria County.
</P>
<P>
   The other inmate, 27-year-old Alfred Wilder, died May 29 at the
Crosbyton Clinic Hospital after he collapsed on an outdoor
recreation yard where he had been playing basketball, Koenig said.
Prison records show that Waller had been sentenced to 15 years in
Waller County on burglary and several drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   White was en route to the Robertson Unit on a medical transfer
to a psychiatric facility in Rusk, Koenig said. He arrived at the
unit at 4:15 p.m. and showed signs of heat exhaustion when he got
off the bus. He was pronounced dead about three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said temperatures can reach 105 degrees inside prison
buses while they are parked, but while they are moving the air
flowing in the windows drops temperatures to a much lower level.
</P>
<P>
   TDCJ spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said the buses _ about the size
of a full-size public school bus _ can be unloaded in a matter of a
few minutes, although felons are chained in pairs while being
transported.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said records indicate that Wilder had been playing
basketball in the recreation yard at the Dickens County
Correctional Unit, when he went up for a lay up and collapsed. He
was taken to the Crosbyton hospital, where he was died. Koenig said
he does not know how long Wilder had been playing ball in the sun;
he was being housed in a privately operated county facility from
whom TDCJ leases bed space.
</P>
<P>
   The day after White's death, another prison inmate who had been
bused from the John Sealy Hospital in Galveston to the Estelle Unit
north of Huntsville was hospitalized with signs of heat stroke, but
he recovered, Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   White's death and the other inmate illness on a prison bus
prompted Koenig to order about 100 fans for the buses plus some
large fans at the prison gates to force air through the buses while
prisoners are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also altered the bus schedules ... so we're not
transporting any prisoners between noon and about 5 or 6 in the
afternoon,'' the hottest part of the day, Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have taken a variety of other steps, including
placing water misters in ventilation systems at some units,
altering work schedules _ particularly for those who work outdoors
in the farm fields _ and providing additional rest and water
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda Marin, executive director of the Texas chapter of
Citizens United for the Rehabilitation of Errants, said TDCJ's
efforts are not beginning to meet prisoner needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned because you've got 140,000 people with
major problems, whether they're physical or emotional, and the heat
just makes conditions worse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventilation (at some facilities) is not good, so people are
really roasting,'' Marin added. ``It's absolutely miserable. People
with continuing medical problems are suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that although TDCJ may be taking preventive measures at
some units, the efforts are not consistent statewide.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because August is around the corner and you still haven't
planned your summer vacation, don't despair. The Internet can help
book a quick _ even bargain-priced _ getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com has generated a big buzz since its start-up in
April, when it kicked off a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign, promoting a ``name your own price'' service for buying
discounted plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's online auction, though, is only one of the most
recent additions to the Internet's fare deals. Depending on how
nimble a traveler you are _ and how much inconvenience you can
endure _ various travel opportunities are only a click away. Each
week, the World Wide Web sites of individual airlines post deeply
discounted fares for travel that weekend. Other sites gather and
update information on inexpensive fares from several sources.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Priceline has made a sizable impression in a relatively
short time. Jay Walker, chairman of the company, based in Stamford,
Conn., said it had already sold 40,000 tickets, generating revenues
of more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Priceline has satisfied some customers, its lengthy list
of requirements has frustrated others. And most major domestic
airlines do not participate in the service, as they promote their
own specials online to fill their empty seats; this limits
Priceline's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   To use the service, customers complete a ticket request on its
Web site, saying where and when they want to travel and how much
they are willing to pay. (Travelers without Internet access can bid
by phone.)
</P>
<P>
   If a bid is much lower than published fares, it will be
rejected. To determine a reasonable price, customers should
research the standard range of fares on the route.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bid is submitted, Priceline sorts through the airline
seats at its disposal. It says it can notify customers within an
hour whether a bid for a domestic flight has been accepted or
rejected _ 24 hours for international flights.
</P>
<P>
   In submitting bids, customers also provide their credit-card
information. If a bid is accepted, a ticket is automatically issued
and the credit card is billed; if the bid is rejected, travelers
can submit other bids using different airports or different dates,
but cannot rebid with higher amounts using the same itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   There are other restrictions: Tickets are not refundable or
exchangeable and are not eligible for frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's services are free for travelers using electronic
tickets, which are generally available only on domestic flights; if
travelers require a paper ticket, they pay a $12.50 overnight
delivery fee.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the rules for getting tickets. The flights
themselves may challenge an individual's notion of ease and
comfort. Travelers must be willing to leave any time between 6 a.m.
and 10 p.m. on their selected date if flying domestically, or any
time if flying overseas. Flights may also require a stop or a
connection en route.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially bigger obstacle is that the auction site seems to
have the cooperation of only a few domestic airlines. Eight of the
10 major U.S. airlines _ Alaska, American, Continental, Delta,
Northwest, Southwest, United and US Airways _ say they have chosen
not to work with Priceline. The other two _ America West and Trans
World Airlines _ declined to comment, though industry executives
say they do work with the service.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say you can't get tickets on the major carriers
through Priceline's auctions. As a licensed travel agency, the
company offers discounted seats on major airlines through the
Worldspan computerized reservations system and its inventory;
Priceline also sometimes resells the wholesale seats offered by
consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, though, said that less than 5 percent of the tickets
Priceline sells are through Worldspan or consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to identify which major U.S. carriers worked
with his company, saying only that a total of 15 U.S. and
international carriers are giving Priceline seats to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on inventory can stymie bidders, as Michael Spohn, a
21-year-old student at the University of Missouri, has discovered.
Since late May, Spohn, an intern in the retail advertising
department of The Des Moines Register, has placed bids with
Priceline nine times to fly from Omaha, Neb., or Des Moines, Iowa,
or Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to his hometown, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, he said, he has bid three or four days before he
wanted to travel and set a price $10 to $15 above the lowest
available published advanced-purchase fare; in his research, he
also found that seats were still available on these routes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each bid was rejected. He said he suspects that Priceline
simply had no seats to sell on those routes. ``I don't understand
why they can't do it,'' he said, ``especially if you offer bids
above the airlines' lowest fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Priceline could not offer seats in all markets,
acknowledging that it had ``no lift in small cities that have no
lift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be willing to drive to a bigger city,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Priceline has its fans, including George Miller, 54, the
artistic director of the Theater Outlet in Allentown, Pa. Several
weeks ago, Miller bought two round-trip tickets, at $550 each, to
fly on Aer Lingus from Newark, N.J., to Dublin, Ireland, for his
honeymoon, which begins Sunday. The lowest published fare offered
by the airline for the same date was $598.
</P>
<P>
   Ashita Patel, 34, a pharmacist from Edison, N.J., is also happy:
Earlier this month, she bought four round-trip tickets, at $300
each, for her family to fly on United from Newark to London for a
September wedding. United's lowest published fare on that route for
that time was $788. (Prices do not include tax.)
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites also offer deeply discounted tickets; in some
cases, they can arrange for cheap hotel rooms and car rentals, too.
</P>
<P>
   Most major U.S. airlines offer special weekly Internet fares,
usually for travel that weekend; prices are much lower than their
cheapest advance-purchase fares. The drawback, of course, is that
destinations are limited: You have to go where they want to take
you.
</P>
<P>
   Online travel agencies including Previewtravel.com,
Expedia.msn.com and Travelocity.com have special features that help
track low fares. Preview offers low fares and announcements of
airlines' latest specials. Expedia, owned by Microsoft, and
Travelocity, controlled by AMR, the parent of American Airlines,
send regular e-mail to travelers listing the lowest published fares
on the routes of their choice. Travelocity also posts a list of
each day's lowest fares.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaptickets.com, a consolidator based in Honolulu, sells
published and unpublished discount fares for flights on domestic
and foreign airlines; Michael Hartley, its president, said it
obtains the unpublished discounts from carriers far in advance.
Travelers must provide credit-card information before they can
conduct a fare search; requests result in a choice of 25 fares,
which the customer can accept or decline.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Bestfares.com, based in Dallas, has sections with
general access to rate information and others only for subscribers,
who pay $60 a year to get more detailed travel data and more deals.
</P>
<P>
   A site operated by 1travel.com, a Zionsville, Pa., travel
agency, provides another path to discounts. It publishes all
airlines' weekly Web specials and will send e-mail lists of them,
customized to the traveler's requirements. It also provides data on
deeply discounted international tickets sold by several large
ticket consolidators.

U.S. TRIES NEW TACTIC TO UNITE IRAQ'S OPPOSITION AGAINST SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of the pragmatism that now rules U.S.
policy toward Iraq, the Clinton administration has invited to
Washington the Kurdish leader who betrayed the CIA's covert action
program against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Massoud Barzani was seen by the CIA as the
Quisling of Iraq. But State Department officials said Friday that
Barzani will come to the United States for high-level talks later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also planning to attend that meeting is Jalal Talibani, the
leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Barzani's bitter
rival for leadership of the Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision to invite the two men to the
United States is part of a new campaign to unify the Iraqi
opposition, and to demonstrate to Saddam that he still cannot
exercise control over northern Iraq, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important signal to Bagdad,'' said a U.S. official.
``Saddam is a gangster, and we want to show that he doesn't control
all the corners in his neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, U.S. officials are now willing to forgive and forget,
convinced that Barzani's betrayal of the CIA in August 1996 was
simply a temporary ``tactical move'' prompted by internal Kurdish
politics. U.S. officials say Barzani never formed a permanent
alliance with Saddam. As a result, U.S. officials believe it is
important to strengthen relations with Barzani in order to make
sure he continues to stay out of Saddam's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game is to keep the Kurds at a distance from Bagdad,'' a
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move to embrace Barzani also underscores how few options
Washington has in its long-term strategy to counter Iraq. Any
effort to work against the Iraqi leader from within his country
must rely in part on the support of Iraqi minority groups, either
the Kurds in northern Iraq or the Shia Muslims in the south.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the wake of the Persian Gulf War, the United States began a
covert-action program that sought to unite Barzani's Kurdistan
Democratic Party and Talibani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan under
the umbrella of a CIA-backed anti-Saddam organization known as the
Iraqi National Congress. Both Barzani and Talibani were placed on
the CIA payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1996 Barzani was in the midst of one of his
periodic battles with Talibani, who was then backed by the Iranian
military. Kurdistan Democratic Party officials say Barzani invited
the Iraqi army to move north into his territory to counter the
Iranian support for Talibani. The Iraqi army took advantage of the
opening in order to attack the Iraqi National Congress, and shatter
what was left of the CIA's presence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi army quickly pulled back, and Barzani's reward was to
gain control of Irbil, the major city in the Kurdish region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his betrayal, the Clinton administration soon decided it
could not afford to give up on Barzani, since his deal with Saddam
had turned him into the dominant Kurdish leader.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials reopened talks with him soon after Saddam's
move to crush the Iraqi National Congress, and this month David
Welch, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, met with both Kurdish leaders to try to mediate
peace talks between them. A fragile cease-fire has been in effect
between the two groups since October.
</P>
<P>
   Now, U.S. officials believe that the fact that Baghdad has
expressed anger over Welch's visit and Barzani's decision to
re-engage with the United States is the best evidence that the
administration's policy is the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at a signal it will send to have Barzani standing
here,'' said a U.S. official.

   NEW YORK _ Wall Street saw a darker strain of trickle-down
economics last week as several companies with little to no direct
exposure to the Asian malaise warned that their businesses were
beginning to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A was Computer Associates. A mere 5 percent of the
software company's revenues come from Asian customers. But big
multinational clients are not ordering as much of Computer
Associates' mainframe software, apparently because the Asian
decline is hurting their operations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine the trend continuing, funneling down
to outfits that depend on Computer Associates or on the spending of
its employees _ the company that cleans its office buildings, for
instance, or the guys that fix the copy machines, or even the
corner coffee bar where employees stop in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, apparently agrees.
``We have yet to see the full effects of the crisis in East Asia on
U.S. employment and income,'' he told Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into Greenspan's comments was a reprise of a recent Fed
warning to banks that the loans they have eagerly been making to
businesses could come back to haunt them if the economy slows,
whatever the cause.
</P>
<P>
   That problem could funnel down, too. Many banks have shrugged
off the Fed's warning because they have unloaded one-quarter or
more of their lower-quality loans onto ``loan participation
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, those loans are considered below investment grade,
meaning that they have been made to companies whose prospects raise
doubts about their ability to repay. Moreover, the loans themselves
are illiquid and cannot be resold easily.
</P>
<P>
   But the funds, also known as ``floating rate'' or ``prime rate''
funds, have been snapped up by individuals seeking higher yields
than those offered by short-term Treasuries or money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the biggest such offering in a decade, Van Kampen
American Capital raised $1.6 billion for a new fund that invests
almost solely in floating-rate loans _ and, moreover, borrows money
to leverage its bets. Most of the big mutual fund companies, like
Franklin Templeton, Merrill Lynch, Eaton Vance and Aim, offer
similar funds; others, including Fidelity Investments, are
considering joining the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of loans held by these funds grew fivefold over the
last three years, to $26 billion at the end of the first quarter,
according to the Loan Pricing Corp. Over the same period, the
assets in equity mutual funds merely doubled, and the assets in
bond funds rose just 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the funds are not able to turn the loans quickly into
cash when investors want to redeem their shares, most of the funds
allow investors to withdraw money only periodically, generally once
a quarter. In doing so, the funds offer to repurchase a certain
number of shares _ say, 5 percent of the fund's total.
</P>
<P>
   If more investors want to cash out, too bad; each shareholder
gets only a portion of his shares redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Making illiquid loans to companies with questionable ability to
repay is not necessarily the best business to be in when a crisis
hits. If the Asian malaise spreads more broadly in the United
States, many of the loans held by these funds could turn sour.
Panicky investors could have a difficult time getting their money
out. And the pain will have trickled all the way down.

   Adding Up the Losses
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The long-term costs are becoming clearer after the
collapse of a construction elevator tower at the Conde Nast
construction site in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday. At least 600
people were left homeless, and many local businesses and some
Broadway productions had to shut down. City officials hoped to
reopen Broadway and some other streets in the Times Square area to
vehicles and pedestrians over the weekend.

<P>
   EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Bad Day at Boeing
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co., hurt by production difficulties, the costs of its
acquisition of McDonnell Douglas and payment problems with its
Asian customers, reported earnings that shocked Wall Street and
sent its shares 13 percent lower. Boeing, the world's largest
aerospace company, also said results for the rest of 1998 and for
1999 would be about 40 percent below Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, earnings fell 46 percent, to $258
million, or 26 cents a diluted share, from $476 million, or 48
cents a diluted share, a year earlier. The average forecast was 33
cents a share. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $13.4 billion from $12.3
billion. Investors dumped the stock, and it fell $6.5625, to
$41.1875, on Thursday, with more than 28 million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   Bleak Week on Wall Street
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, in fact, led Thursday's free fall in stocks, and
accounted for 27.8 points of the day's rout of the Dow Jones
industrial average, which plunged 195.93 points, or 2.15 percent,
to 8,932,98. Coming on top of smaller but significant drops in the
three previous sessions, it was the Dow's third-largest drop this
year and its first close below 9,000 since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip measure ended the week with at 8,937.36, more than
400 points below its high of 9,337.97 at the end of the previous
week. Boeing, though, is just one of a diverse group of companies,
including Merck, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and DuPont, that have
cautioned investors that earnings in the second half could falter,
in part because of the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also rattled by two days of congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
reiterated that inflation was still the central bank's biggest
concern and warned that the Asian crisis was far from over.

<P>
   Star Power in St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the National League standings: the St. Louis
Cardinals seem to be mired in mediocrity. With the baseball season
nearly two-thirds completed, the Cardinals are barely managing to
stay close to the .500 won-lost mark and are bringing up the rear
of the Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   So is it lonely at the middle? Not in St. Louis, where the
marketing clout of Mark McGwire's assault on Roger Maris'
37-year-old record of 61 home runs in a season is packing fans into
Busch Stadium at a pace 17 percent ahead of last year. After 49
games at Busch, the Cardinals had the fifth-highest home attendance
in the National League, and McGwire's drawing power was also
pulling in an average of more than 33,000 fans on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, meanwhile, were only 14 percent above last
year's home attendance. While New York has by far the best record
in baseball _ playing at a better than .700 clip _ and has led the
American League's East Division for much of the season. it has no
star home run attraction this year.

   A Fallen Star
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Joseph Jett was an impressive bond trader at
Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co., earning millions of dollars in bonuses and
generating hundreds of millions of dollars in business. But in
April 1994, Jett was dismissed by Kidder, which accused him of
manufacturing $339 million of fictitious profits to hide trading
losses and earn those large bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two years after an administrative court hearing,
Jett was ordered to repay $8.2 million of bonuses, fined $200,000
and barred from the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the first extensive review of the case, Carol Fox Foelak, an
administrative law judge at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
found that Jett had kept false books and records; she did not,
however, find him guilty of securities fraud, ruling that his phony
transactions did not involve the actual trading of real securities,
so they could not constitute securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Jett plans to appeal the ruling, In an interview a day after the
finding, Jett, who is black, proclaimed his innocence and strongly
suggested that racism had added to his troubles.

<P>
   A Split Over Tax Cuts
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate decided not to push for a big
tax cut this year, widening a split within the party. The move by
the leadership infuriated the party's conservative tax-cutting
wing, especially those House Republicans who have been pushing for
a cut of historic proportions as the fiscal health of the United
States improves.
</P>
<P>
   Party aides said the Senate leaders saw no possibility of
passing a big cut because they probably could not muster the votes
required. The aides said that waging a symbolic battle with
congressional Democrats and the White House would have risked the
likelihood that President Clinton would accuse Republicans of
endangering Social Security's long-term health in order to give tax
benefits to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, House Republicans said they were intent on
following through with plans to vote in September on a tax cut of
as much as $700 billion over the next decade.

Microsoft and for the computer and software industries over all,
the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, D.C., was hearing
complaints from executives of competing software companies that
Microsoft uses predatory marketing practices to squelch

CLINTON-STARR NEGOTIATIONS INDICATE STRATEGY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorneys for President Clinton are negotiating
with the independent counsel over how Clinton can provide testimony
to the federal grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky
allegations without appearing in person, White House officials
acknowledged Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, carried out between Clinton's personal
attorney, David Kendall, and Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, signal a possibly dramatic strategic shift by the president
in his response to the probe, and are yet another in a string of
indications that the investigation, begun in late-January, may now
be hurtling towards a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that Mr. Kendall will try to work out something
with Mr. Starr's office so that the grand jury or Mr. Starr gets
the information they need,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry
said Friday. ``I can't tell you what the status of discussions are
that the lawyers are having.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing secrecy rules, McCurry refused to say whether Clinton had
received a subpoena from independent counsel Kenneth Starr to
appear before the grand jury, though there was no indication that a
subpoena had been issued. Legal analysts said such a subpoena would
be unprecedented and would likely be fought by Clinton all the way
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand jury proceedings are held in secret, and deliberations
related to grand jury proceedings are secret because we don't rush
to the assumption that people are guilty merely because grand
juries are meeting,'' McCurry said. ``Remember?''
</P>
<P>
   Within the administration, officials said privately that Kendall
is attempting to reach an arrangement with Starr that would allow
the president to voluntarily provide videotaped testimony recorded
from the White House, rather than visit the grand jury room in
person. Under this arrangement, Clinton could avoid what aides
believe would be a demeaning drive to the US District Court and the
walk up the courthouse steps that would play countless times on the
network news.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials increasingly regard a subpoena from Starr
as an inevitability, and launched this latest round of discussions
in an attempt to cut the best deal they could, according to aides
and analysts. ``It's an effort to look purer than the other guy,
Starr,'' said Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown Law Center.
``They are trying to look like they are being open and making
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials within the White House also said that Clinton's
lawyers have been engaged in discussions with Starr's office, on
and off, for several months, though those discussions have taken on
a new, more hopeful tone within the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgement of legal negotiations by the White House
came hours after reports that a uniformed Secret Service officer
testified before the grand jury this week that he and former White
House aide Harold Ickes saw Clinton alone with Monica Lewinsky in a
small study off the Oval Office on a Saturday morning in early
1996. Ickes, now a consultant and informal adviser to Clinton, has
emphatically denied the assertion, and the report carried no
indication that the two men witnessed anything sexual between the
president and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press report, a White House operator
contacted a Secret Service officer standing guard outside the Oval
Office door saying there was a telephone call for Clinton. The
guard, in turn, saw Ickes walking by and asked him to alert Clinton
to the call. When Ickes and the guard went inside the Oval Office,
they did not see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The two men walked down a short hallway to a private study just
off the Oval Office and saw Clinton and Lewinsky inside the room,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person on the record in that story is Mr. Ickes, and
he is saying it didn't happen,'' said James Kennedy, a spokesman
for the White House legal counsel. ``Beyond that, I have no
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a January depositition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit that he had no recollection of ever being alone
with Lewinsky. That assertion was called into question by retired
Secret Service officer Lewis Fox, who told the grand jury that he
recalled Clinton and Lewinsky were in the Oval Office for 40
minutes, alone as far he could tell, one Saturday while he stood
guard outside. Lewis later said through his attorney that he could
not be certain, from his vantage point, that the two were alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president did not speak truthfully in the Jones case,
he would be in a very precarious position now,'' said Jonathan
Turley, a criminal defense lawyer and professor at George
Washington University law school. ``If he lied under oath, he would
have to admit an earlier act of perjury or recommit an act of
perjury. If the president commits perjury, few Democrats in
Congress could treat the matter lightly in an impeachment vote.''
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's daily briefing, McCurry attempted to stave off rapid
fire questions on whether Clinton had received a subpoena and why
he was negotiating over his possible testimony. For months, Clinton
aides have privately speculated on the president's possible
testimony, with many advisers believing that his refusal to testify
might prove catastrophic to the Democratic party, especially the
congressional candidates in the autumn elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, the level of intensity in Starr's
investigation has surged. First, Starr brought Pentagon aide Linda
Tripp, who made the secret tape recordings of Lewinsky, before the
grand jury, in a signal that he was reaching the end of his witness
list.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he won a crucial US Appeals Court ruling that
required Secret Service agents to honor subpoenas and testify
before the grand jury, marking the first time a president's
bodyguards were forced to provide information about the man they
are supposed to protect. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling the
following day, and Starr immediately brought several uniformed
officers before a grand jury to begin taking evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he shuttled Ickes and Clinton's personal secretary,
Betty Currie, back before the grand jurors, and called in Secret
Service agent Larry Cockell, the head of Clinton's elite security
detail. Starr summoned the federal grand jury to the courthouse on
Wednesday, which is normally a day off for the jurors, and on
Thursday he actually used two separate grand juries to hear
testimony in an apparent effort to hasten the pace of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has appeared so busy that he actually postponed the
completion of Tripp's testimony at least until next week.
</P>
<P>
   All the activity has been followed closely by Clinton, his aides
and his lawyers, who have seen their legal appeals and various
manuevers dissolving in the face of various legal rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who has been working at a somewhat leisurely pace,
to now move to two grand juries at the same time shows he is moving
faster,'' said Ann Lewis, Clinton's communications director. ``We
see what everyone else can see that he is in a state of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three known potential witnesses remain, Clinton being one
of them. The other two are Clinton's deputy legal counsel and close
confidante, Bruce Lindsey, and Lewinsky herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has been subpoenaed to testify, but Clinton's lawyers
are trying to block that testimony on the grounds that it violates
attorney/client privilege. Starr is asserting that Lindsey is a
government attorney, and thus would not be covered. The case is
pending in federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors appear unsure about whether they will indict
Lewinsky for perjury, grant her immunity or summon her before the
grand jury and provide her limited immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need Monica Lewinsky desperately, Starr does, or he has a
circumstantial case,'' said Paul Rothstein, a Georgetown Law Center
professor. ``He would like to have Bruce Lindsey because Lindsey
was close to everything going on. And he would like to get the
president on record and catch him in a lie in a more serious
proceeding than the dismissed Paula Jones case.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ While many investors have reacted to the Asian
financial crisis by moving their money to the high ground of Wall
Street, money managers at the Franklin Templeton Group are thinking
in the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic about the world, though not about
America,'' said Mark Holowesko, lead portfolio manager for the
Templeton Growth fund, as he outlined the the group's overall
investment strategy on Thursday at the fund's 44th annual
shareholder's meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Most funds' investors rarely get a chance to meet their managers
face-to-face _ especially when world markets are in such turmoil.
Some 2,500 shareholders took advantage of the opportunity at
Templeton.
</P>
<P>
   J. Mark Mobius, portfolio manager of the Templeton Developing
Markets funds who addressed the meeting via a fiber-optic link from
Vancouver, said in response to a shareholder's question about
investing in Asia: ``After the peso crashed in '94, I told my
sister-in-law to invest'' in Mexico, ``and she slammed the door in
my face. Now I'm going to tell her the same thing about Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Templeton Growth, founded in Canada in 1954, now has about $7
billion in net assets under management and has investments in 34
countries. In the United States, Templeton Growth I, has assets of
$14.02 billion and has had a five-year annualized return of 15.59
percent, outperforming the average world stock fund by a
half-percentage point, according to Morningstar Inc., but its
return this year, through Thursday, has been only 4.23 percent,
trailing its peers' 15.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It still follows the investment strategy laid out by its
founder, Sir John Templeton of Nassau, the Bahamas, of buying
stocks at bargain-basement prices and hanging on to them for the
long-term gain. His company merged with Franklin Resources of San
Mateo, Calif., in 1992, forming Franklin Templeton, which now
manages $235 billion for 5.30 million investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the meeting, Holowesko cited ``extremes
of valuation'' between overvalued and undervalued companies in
emerging markets. ``It is huge and represents a phenomenal
opportunity if you are willing to take a five-year view of
investment,'' he said, adding that ``value managers love
volatility; investors don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Reed, portfolio manager of the Templeton International
Stock fund, agreed, saying, ``Because of the situation in Asia, a
lot of the markets have become basket cases, and it is our job to
identify the survivors.'' Templeton fund managers say there are
strong companies with low stock prices that will rebound in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Japan and Korea, but they declined to identify
their new picks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the conditions in those countries have stabilized, the
devaluation of their currencies will bring in foreign exchange and
the bear markets will eventually pass, Mobius predicted. ``But if
we anticipate a recovery in Asia,'' he said, ``then we can expect
the markets to anticipate a recovery as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy the group used in Latin America after the
peso fell in 1994, Mobius said, and their Latin American
investments gave huge returns last year, although they have
suffered this year as the Asian crises have made investors wary of
emerging markets in general.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Holowesko is becoming wary of the American markets.
They are so overvalued, he said, that ``it's difficult to find
cheap stocks in the United States.'' It is time to unload some
long-term American holdings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The group largely pulled out of Japan in 1987 when that market
was overvalued. It now has just over 1 percent of its portfolio in
the country _ in companies including Sony, Hitachi and Makita _ and
now hopes to invest more there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for ideas in Japan and finding some, mostly in
the smaller companies,'' Holowesko said. &QL;

<P>
   Icos is anything but a typical development-stage biotechnology
company.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, like others in the field, it has yet to market a product or
to make a profit from operations. (It announced on Thursday that it
had lost $9.4 million in the second quarter, or 24 cents a share, a
bit more than analysts had forecast.)
</P>
<P>
   And a familiar kind of industry hype has begun to swirl around
one of its projects _ a compound that bullish analysts predict will
supplant Pfizer's runaway hit impotence drug, Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   But look who's behind the Icos Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a field populated by shoestring operations run by starry-eyed
scientists and littered with failures, Icos, based in Bothell,
Wash., has managed to attract some of the bluest of blue-chip names
in corporate America to its board. Its roster of directors, which
would make any Fortune 500 company proud, never mind a 275-employee
fledgling, includes heavyweights like Walter B. Wriston, former
chairman of Citicorp; Frank T. Cary, former president of IBM; James
L. Ferguson, former chairman of General Foods, and William H.
Gates, chairman of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk up the A-list board to the credibility of Icos' chairman
and chief executive, George B. Rathmann, whose previous effort in
the field yielded the Amgen Corp., the world's largest
biotechnology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, his enormous success at Amgen gave anyone who was
contemplating this thing a lot of confidence,'' said Wriston, who
holds a stake in Icos valued at about $3 million and _ like the
majority of the board _ has been with the company since its
inception in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these luminaries have invested more than their time and
reputations. Gates and Rathmann are Icos' two largest shareholders
and have injected capital into the company several times. ``If
there was an equity offering, we would always be available,''
Rathmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates became involved in 1990, when Paine Webber was setting up
Icos' first round of financing. ``We had dinner, and the next day
he put in $5 million and joined our board,'' Rathmann said of
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, having the country's richest man on the team is no
guarantee of success. But it adds substance to the buzz surrounding
Icos' potential Viagra replacement, a compound called IC351.
</P>
<P>
   Too new to have a brand name, IC351 works in a way that is
similar to Viagra and will be available in pill form, as Viagra is.
But IC351 appears to be more selective than Viagra in blocking an
enzyme that can prevent erections; the advantage may eliminate
side-effects associated with Viagra, including a temporary
blue-green tinge in vision.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Murray, senior biotechnology analyst at Lehman Brothers,
said, ``IC351 could be as large or larger than Viagra,'' which
Lehman expects to generate $900 million in sales this year and $1.5
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts say Icos' drugs run a below-average risk of
flopping in clinical trials because Icos does more careful
laboratory groundwork than many biotechnology hothouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icos is very well known for the high quality of the research
they do,'' said Mary Ann Gray, senior vice president at Raymond
James &AMP; Associates. ``They take their time and do things correctly
and have a solid background.''
</P>
<P>
   But Icos isn't depending on IC351 alone. In its research
pipeline are a number of promising drugs aimed at large markets _ a
fact that cheers David Simpson, manager of the WM Northwest Fund
and the WM Emerging Growth fund. The two funds bought Icos in 1995
and now have a $13.4 million stake.
</P>
<P>
   Icos is conducting preliminary trials of four drugs to treat
nine diseases and conditions, including stroke, multiple sclerosis
and asthma. Its goal is to have at least two of those compounds,
possibly including IC351, in the pivotal third and final stage of
clinical trials by the end of the year, said Lacy J. Fitzpatrick,
the company's associate director for investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   The great challenge faced by most biotechnology companies _ how
to keep the bills paid until products are ready to market _ doesn't
look like it will faze Icos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to capital for that company is not going to be
difficult, especially with a strong stock price and the board they
have,'' said Jay Silverman, senior biotechnology analyst at
Robertson Stephens. Most biotechnology companies find themselves
having to trade away rights to their discoveries to raise
development cash from richer partners, but Icos can afford to hold
tight to its rights and the profits they promise, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Icos turned to creating limited partnerships, a way of
raising development capital that fell out of favor in the
biotechnology field in the early 1990s after several product
failures. The company has raised about $150 million so far by
transferring rights to three of its compounds (but not IC351) to a
partnership and selling interests in it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sharing in royalty income from the drugs, the
limited partners get warrants to buy company stock; Icos retains
the right to buy back the partnership interests. Gates and Rathmann
have each bought partnership stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree to which we control our destiny is more important
than anything else,'' Rathmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, the fund manager, is impressed with Icos' ability to
retain its independence. ``If they chose to partner with one of the
big pharmaceutial companies, they don't have to give away all the
value in order to get money for research,'' he observed. Icos has
forged alliances with Abbott Laboratories and Japan's Suntory,
under which Icos shares but does not surrender rights. Analysts
expect something similar for IC351.
</P>
<P>
   Given Icos' advantages, is the company's $20 stock price a good
value? A growing number of short-sellers apparently believe the
stock is headed for a fall: As of June 15, the uncovered short
interest in Icos stock had swollen to 2.28 million shares, triple
the level of a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Simpson disagreed with the short-sellers. ``I don't think
it's overvalued,'' he said. ``It's tough to find biotechnology
companies with nine drugs in phase 2 trials. If they all flop, you
are overpaying, but if just one of them works, you're well
rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say investors in the volatile biotechnology field must
take the long view. ``I would never recommend someone buy the stock
unless they were long-term holders, by which I mean at least three
years,'' said Andrew Heyward, director of research at Ragen
MacKenzie of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Icos expects to have at least one product on the
market _ all it should need to turn a profit, Rathmann said. &QL;

GLENN IN HOSPITAL TEST OF SLEEP DRUG DOSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Donning a special night cap that picks up his brain
waves and a motion-sensing wrist device that tells researchers when
he's asleep, Sen. John Glenn spent Friday night in a laboratory at
Brigham and Women's Hospital while researchers monitored his
biorhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's laboratory sleepover began a unique experiment that will
culminate three months from now, when the once and future astronaut
will rocket into space for the second time in his long life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.
This fall the Ohio senator, who turned 77 a week ago, will become
the oldest human to escape the planet's bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now pioneering a different kind of frontier,'' said Dr.
Charles A. Czeisler, who is running the experiment _ and who
recalled Friday evening at a hospital press conference how thrilled
he was, as a boy of 10, when Glenn orbited the Earth in his tiny
Friendship 7 space capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really know how to make a guy feel old,'' quipped the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's new frontier might be called space gerontology _ the
study of the physiologic changes induced by space travel, which in
many respects are curiously similar to the slower ravages of age.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he wanted to be a doctor before World War II came
along and turned him into a celebrated fighter pilot and member of
the first elite group of astronauts, Glenn listed the parallels
between aging and space travel effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sleep changes, immune system changes, cardiovascular
changes. Bones become thinner and muscles break down even though
you exercise,'' he said. ``If we can determine what turns these
systems on and off, we will not only benefit astronauts but will
have made a great step forward in benefiting the old and frail here
on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of all elders have trouble sleeping, Glenn said. (He said
he isn't one of them.) Disordered sleep patterns impair the health
of one-third of all elders, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty sleeping well and staying alert when they must has
plagued astronauts since the dawn of space travel 36 years ago.
During orbital flight, day and night alternate every 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler, a specialist in circadian rhythms, began working with
NASA in the early 1990s, when an astronaut read a newspaper article
about his success in using precisely timed doses of bright light to
reset the circadian clocks of shift workers.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting the Harvard Medical School researcher, the astronauts
quickly became convinced of the effectiveness of the light
treatment _ they took to calling Czeisler ``Dr. Light'' _ and
insisted on retrofitting their crew quarters with bright-light
devices to put them in synch with their flight schedules before
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Now Czeisler and his colleagues are studying Glenn and his
fellow astronaut Dr. Chiaki Mukai, a Japanese cardiovascular
surgeon who will be on the same Space Shuttle flight, to see if
their internal clocks can be reset less cumbersomely, by well-timed
capsules of melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   Melatonin is a natural hormone the brain manufactures every
night to tell the body it's time to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The pills that Glenn and Mukai will take in space are the same
stuff many travelers swallow in the hope it will alleviate jet lag,
except the astronauts' pills contain pharmaceutical-grade melatonin
at a dose that mimics the brain's nightly output.
</P>
<P>
   The melatonin pills many people purchase at their local pharmacy
or health food store elevate blood levels of the hormone 50 to 100
times more than normal, which mean daytime levels are higher than
they should be. Furthermore, the over-the-counter hormone is often
adulterated with other chemicals that may render it useless.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies, such as one the Harvard researchers conducted
on astronauts aboard a space shuttle flight last April, suggest
that a tiny dose of pure melatonin, a mere 0.3 milligrams, may work
best.
</P>
<P>
   The April experiment and the upcoming one involving Glenn and
Mukai, Czeisler pointed out, are the first rigorously conducted
trials of any pharmaceutical ever done in space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn responded to skeptics who note that science can learn
little from such tiny experiments _ and imply that the real reason
for Glenn's flight is to fulfill a US senator's personal wish to
return to space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, where do you start except with a data point of one?''
Glenn said. ``This is more than a one-shot deal.''

`SILICONE SURVIVORS' TAKE FIGHT OVER IMPLANTS TO CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They came in wheelchairs and leaning on canes, with
violet-colored ribbons pinned to their lapels. Tearfully, they
disclosed their symptoms: chronic fatigue, mysterious fevers,
bizarre rashes, painful joints.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years of litigation and scientific dispute over the
safety of silicone breast implants, Friday was a chance for the
women who call themselves ``silicone survivors'' to come to the
nation's capital and be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the final day of a three-day scientific meeting
held by the prestigious Institute of Medicine, which is conducting
an independent study of the implants' safety. The study will not be
completed for at least a year, but for the dozens of support group
leaders who came to Washington, as well as the thousands of women
they represent, the meeting marked a turning point in their quest
to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels wonderful, as if finally we have a gag order off our
mouths,'' said Martha Murdock, founder of the National Silicone
Implant Foundation, based in Dallas. She, like many others,
implored the panel to press for more research, dismissing as
inadequate more than a dozen major studies that have found no link
between the implants and established diseases, including autoimmune
disorders and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know why I came here? I'll tell you why I came
here,'' said Merry Grant of Metarie, La., in an interview. ``I hurt
all the time. I burn all the time.'' To the committee, she pleaded,
``We need research and I'm asking you to help us, because I am
dying one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session took place a little more than two weeks after
Dow Corning Corp., an implant manufacturer, agreed, without
admitting wrongdoing, to pay $3.2 million to 170,000 women who say
they have been injured by their implants. Dow Corning scientists,
who testified on Wednesday, hav said they welcome the Institute's
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, yet another lawsuit is under way. Kathy Keithley Johnston,
a Columbia, Mo., nurse who is president of a group called Toxic
Discovery Network, announced Friday that her group had filed a
class-action lawsuit in federal court in the District of Columbia
against the Food and Drug Administration and the American Society
for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. The lawsuit says surgeons failed to
inform patients and the FDA of the dangers of implants.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks to compel the FDA, which removed silicone implants from
the market in 1992 but still permits them to be used on an
experimental basis, to prohibit implants entirely. An agency
spokeswoman said officials were unaware of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Johnston announced the filing at the hearing, it drew
enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begged, pleaded, yelled, cried for you to hear our
voices,'' she told the committee, ``and all we have received is the
label of hysterical females.'' She accused the plastic surgeons'
group of breaking ``all moral and ethical codes,'' a charge that
Dr. C. Lin Puckett, the society's president, quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an impressive body of evidence,'' Puckett said in an
interview, ``that would tell us that these implants are safe
systemically.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not all the women present Friday were opposed to implants. Susan
Scherr, a breast cancer patient, said she received a silicone gel
implant as part of her reconstructive surgery and has had no
problems. She said that although she was sympathetic to women like
Ms. Johnston, she did not want to see access to implants cut off.
``It's our feeling that there needs to be good science, and now
there is good science,'' Ms. Scherr said.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic of just how good, or how complete, the science on
implant safety is remained a contentious one Friday. While
epidemiologists repeated the evidence that shows cancer and
autoimmune disorders occur with the same frequency in women with
implants as in women without them, several doctors and scientists
Friday offered evidence to counter the large epidemiology studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Raymond Harbut, a specialist in environmental
medicine at Wayne State University in Detroit, said he had found
that a type of platinum used in the manufacture of the implants can
leach out, causing allergic reactions similar to those seen in
people who are exposed to platinum in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   He was later contradicted by Alistair Winn, an industry
scientist who described the platinum issue as ``a red herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology at Tulane
University Medical School, presented evidence that more than half
of women who reported complications with their implants exhibited
antibodies that react with silicone, suggesting that implants are
causing an immune response. He developed a test for the antibodies,
and that has made him something of a hero to the women who
testified about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many have spent years going from doctor to doctor, looking to no
avail for an explanation for their curious symptoms. For these
women, Garry's findings offered proof that something is medically
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tested with Dr. Garry,'' said Anne Stansell, a photographer
from Los Lunas, N.M., who attended Friday's hearing. ``When I got
the news on that test, I cried.'' &QL;

COWBOYS TACKLE SEEKS EDGE FROM TRAINING IN MARTIAL ARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ He is one of the more celebrated former
residents of this military town, having cut his teeth for 13 months
here in pilot training at Sheppard Air Force Base from 1988-89.
There are now thousands of Wichita Falls residents claiming they
hung out with Chad Hennings before his professional football days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the focus on Hennings wanes when it comes to talk about the
Cowboys' defensive line. Fans go crazy if Leon Lett does anything
extraordinary on the practice field; they scream his nickname,
``Big Cat,'' in approval. Assistant coaches have gone crazy
preparing tenderfoot ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman for NFL
action.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings, entering his fourth season as a starting defensive
tackle, has been an afterthought. That is not to say Hennings is
not expected to make a big difference this year. In fact, after
eight days of camp, defensive line coach Jim Bates has already
declared that Hennings ``is on the way to having his best year.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know Bates, then you know he is pretty enthusiastic and
positive about everything. But when you consider that Hennings is
finally healthy after two years of nagging groin and elbow injuries
and his work with a tae kwan do expert to take some of the
``stiffness'' out of his pass-rushing technique, then you can see
why Bates is ebullient.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Hennings will have something new to throw at
opposing offensive linemen in 1998. Perhaps that alone will equate
to a few more big plays for a unit that was 18th in sacks and 24th
against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Leon was out and I was injured, which caused a lot
of problems for us,'' Hennings said. ``Then the frustration with
things not going well set in and that caused some penalties and a
lack of turnovers created by our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennings refused to put the entire blame on injuries. He knew he
needed to improve. His coaches knew as well. Look at him. He looks
like he could play the part of a superhero with his 6-foot-6,
295-pound chiseled frame, and his bench press of well over 500
pounds. But his impact the past few years has not quite measured
up.
</P>
<P>
   He has 9.5 sacks the past two years, fewer than most Pro Bowl
tackles get in a season. He has only seven tackles for losses,
three pass knockdowns, and two forced fumbles in the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad has always been steady, but making more plays _ like
pressuring the quarterback, knocking balls down, sacking the
quarterback, getting hits at the line of scrimmage in the running
game, that's where he can pick it up,'' Bates said. ``And we expect
him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that, the Cowboys hired former tae kwan do champ Joe
Kim to work with the defensive line. A medalist for the United
States at the 1989 Pan Am Games, Kim was the perfect candidate to
show Cowboys linemen how to use their hands to escape the grips of
offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Hennings was Kim's first client.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Day One in working with Chad, I found him to be a little
robotic, kind of mechanical,'' said Kim, who first used his
martial-arts skills with Cleveland Browns linemen from 1991-95.
``Now, watching him, he's very fluent. His hands never stop.
Instead of thinking about what to do, he just does it. It's like
somebody learning to dance. After the first few moves, you are in
the flow of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiff? A little bit,'' Bates said, ``things weren't happening
fluidly. Now, though, everything is working together. He is quicker
with his hands in getting the offensive lineman's hands off of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope, now, is that Hennings can combine this new-found
technique with brute strength to make offenses key on him with the
same kind of energy that they use on Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens will not be known for at least another
month, Hennings said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a difference,'' Hennings said, ``but until we play a
real game, you just won't know for sure.''

YARAFAT ANNOUNCES MORE MEETINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Rumors of the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian talks
on the peace process seem to have been greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said Friday the two sides
would have more meetings next week to try and bring an end to the
16-month deadlock on the handover by Israel of more West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's announcement came at the end of a week in which the
Palestinians said that three days of direct talks had collapsed,
and the Israeli government appealed to the United States to step in
to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Peace moves have been deadlocked mainly over Jewish settlement
building, Palestinian suicide bombings and the scope of an Israeli
troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   With the process long stalled, the United States has continued
to back away from its active mediating role and told the two sides
that they must resolve how to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told reporters Thursday at the White House
that he still believes the talks can get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't thrown in the towel because I think it is a lot
better to get an agreement, to get them in final status talks, than
it is to give up and let this thing drift dangerously toward
conflict,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is easy to be confused by US policy on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the US State Department publicly talked
tough about the ``endgame'' and warning that the ``ball was in
Israel's court'' to act on the US proposal which lies at the center
of the current debate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has proposed a 13.1 percent further withdrawal
from the West Bank at this stage without clearly defining whether
there would be a third withdrawal before the so-called final status
talks as outlined in the historic 1993 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians accepted the US proposal, although it is far
short of their expectations of a 30 percent withdrawal at this
stage. The Israelis have rejected it, saying that they can accept
no more than a 10 percent withdrawal while still ensuring security
and protecting water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the current hurdle is cleared, most analysts say the far
more complex and potentially irreconcilable differences between the
two sides will emerge in the final status talks on Jerusalem.
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and sees it as part of its
eternal and indivisible capital. The Palestinians see East
Jerusalem as the site of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   The final deadline of the peace agreement is May 4, 1999. Arafat
has vowed to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state at that
point. That declaration, combined with deep frustrations and failed
promises on both sides, could embroil the Middle East in what many
experts -- Israeli and Palestinian alike -- believe could be a
military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk has termed it an
``explosive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high stakes and the tough talk earlier this month by
State Department officials, now the United States is calling for
patience as the clock ticks on.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts believe domestic politics play a large
part in the delay. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be
trying to buy time until the end of this month when the Israeli
Knesset recesses for the summer. That, experts believe, would help
Netanyahu avoid the no-confidence vote that the far right and even
hawks in his own cabinet, such as Minister Ariel Sharon, have
threatened to use to topple the fractious coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, a Gallup poll released Friday confirmed that 59
percent of Israelis support the US-proposed transfer of 13 percent
of the West Bank to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rubin, an expert on the peace process for Bar Illan
University's BESA Center for Strategic Studies, says the fact that
each side is entrenched in its own position and threatening to walk
out shows the process is close to moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he says, the essence of Middle East bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers around the world are interpreting that as the edge
of a breakdown. It is not correct. As long as it makes progress, as
long as both sides want to keep the talks alive, it will work,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is not a tightrope that we can fall off
of,'' he adds. ``It is a roller-coaster that will go up and down
but stay on the tracks.''

<P>
   CRYSTAL, N.D. _ Back in Jersey, they would never believe it.
</P>
<P>
   First, Vinnie Amato Jr., a Buick salesman from Newark, gets
himself elected mayor of Crystal, N.D., population 222 in a good
year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hizzoner gets the proverbial boot _ and some jail time _
after an unfortunate and still somewhat shadowy incident involving
rabbit hunting, arm wrestling, some stunning fettuccine Alfredo and
a drive-by shoot-'em-up in the neighboring town of Hoople. (More on
that later).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Amato wins his old job back. How? On the night of June
23, someone flipped a coin and Amato called it in the air. Heads.
Now he is mayor again.
</P>
<P>
   The coin-flipping was perfectly kosher. In fact, because Amato
was neck and neck with another candidate, the coin flip was
explicitly required by North Dakota law.
</P>
<P>
   Other states do the same. Coin flips have decided tie votes in
Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, for example. When
candidates tie in Virginia, the winner's name is plucked out of a
hat.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago in South Dakota, the man who had been the Stanley
County prosecutor for 22 years was unseated when he lost a game of
poker _ five card stud _ to a pair of red tens. In Arizona, a card
game determined the winner of a 1988 City Council seat in Show Low
(named, coincidentally, for a game played there in 1876 to see
which of two rival businessmen would have to leave town).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure beats the heck out of dueling pistols,'' said Doug Lewis,
executive director of the Election Center, a nonprofit group for
election officials.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a new election would be ``very, very expensive,'' said
Richard Smolka, editor of Election Administration. ``The number of
votes cast is very, very small. The voters tried. They couldn't
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota this summer, 12 elections were decided by
tossing a coin or drawing lots, said Cory Fong, the state elections
director. Of course, Fong and others who butter their bread with
democracy would love things to be different. But with small towns
getting smaller, it is hard enough to find someone who wants to run
for office, let alone want to run again to break a tie.
</P>
<P>
   Fong tells the story of one longtime town official who decided
not to seek re-election this year and was excoriated by his
constituents. ``They said: `You've been serving our town for so
many years. We still have potholes. We're overtaxed. And now you
have the nerve to not even run again.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is,'' Fong added. ``Something has to happen
that inspires people to serve.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Vinnie Amato, one of the truly inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Love brought Amato, 41, to this remote, flyspeck of a city in
the northeastern corner of North Dakota. After selling Buicks,
Dodges and Toyotas for 18 years in New Jersey, Amato went to Miami,
where he fell in love with a woman named Nancy Salwei from Crystal.
In 1993, he followed her home.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal was the polar opposite of everything Amato had known, a
blink in a blanket of farmers' fields, silos instead of
smokestacks, endless echoing miles of wheat, potatoes and sugar
beets, an astronomical plant-per-person ratio. Most folks, politely
laconic farmers of Scandinavian descent, had never met someone with
his Popeye physique, ponytailed hair, chunky gold rings and gold
Italian horn dangling from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was,'' Amato said, ``an adjustment period.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Amato had become a sensation by opening Vinnie's Pizza
and Pasta in the back of a bar in Hoople. ``An Italian is making a
ripple here in the heart of Norwegian potato country,'' said The
Grand Forks Herald, the regional newspaper, quoting patrons who
called his fettuccine ``to die for'' and liked his concession to
cattle country, the Philly cheese steak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Amato ran for mayor of Crystal. He got 21 votes. There
was no other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going fine. The municipal dam was fixed and city
officials got raises (the next mayor's annual salary would increase
to $600 from $400).
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend told the police that Amato had committed a
drive-by shooting in Hoople. Amato admits that he was in a Ford
Bronco, coming back from rabbit hunting, angry at three young men
who had bloodied his friends after arm-wrestling matches in the bar
where he cooked his pasta. He also admits that someone in the
Bronco fired a semiautomatic rifle at the apartment building where
the young men lived, injuring no one but driving the young men out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   Amato says he was railroaded into pleading guilty to a felony
charge of reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he attended City Council meetings while on work
release from the county jail, where he was serving 110 days. But
then someone in Crystal realized that it is illegal in North Dakota
to be mayor while incarcerated. A new mayor took office, but quit
after only one year.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, when Amato, still on probation and now the
proprietor of the Corner Bar in Crystal _ its slogan: You Don't
Have to be Bad to Sit in the Corner _ sought the mayor's job again,
things looked good. The only other candidate moved out of town and
had to drop out. Then somebody started a write-in campaign for Gary
Barclay, a city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   Each man received 29 votes, a tie that might have been avoided
if Barclay's wife had gone to the polls or if a friend of Amato had
remembered to vote. And so it was up to a quarter, tossed by the
outgoing mayor and landing on the floor, George Washington-side up.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who plans to frame the quarter and display it in his bar,
is excited about the future of Crystal. In a community where the
biggest issue is ``dogs at large,'' the new mayor is systematically
surveying residents about their concerns. ``I'm going to make it
the hub'' of Pembina County, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to bring a little Jersey here,'' Amato
said. ``I'm pretty much direct. I say, `This needs to be done and
that needs to be done _ let's go do it.' It's not an ego trip. I
firmly believe that small towns can survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, ``If I went to Jersey tomorrow, they'd say,
`Who'd you pay for a double-headed coin?' ''

CLINTON UNWILLING TO TESTIFY BEFORE LEWINSKY JURY, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has told an adviser that he does
not want to testify voluntarily before the federal grand jury
investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter and become the first
sitting president in history to appear before a grand jury, the
adviser said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawyers on both sides refused to say Friday whether
Clinton was recently subpoenaed or if a subpoena was threatened,
Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, is actively discussing
other options for the president's testimony with independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, senior administration officials and lawyers
close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said he did not know
whether Starr's office had subpoenaed the president. He also said
he did not know if Starr's prosecutors have told Clinton's lawyers
that a subpoena was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kendall has been trying to work out with Mr. Starr
something that would help insure that the information is provided
that is needed, consistent with the president's view that we should
cooperate,'' McCurry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prefers to answer questions at the White House, where he
has given sworn testimony several times to Starr and his
predecessor, Robert Fiske, on a variety of Whitewater-related
matters. Portions of his testimony were later read to grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers close to Clinton said the president would much
prefer cooperating with Starr's prosecutors by providing them with
a videotaped deposition in a White House session or sworn answers
to a list of written questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history,'' one lawyer said. ``We have found ways in
the past to comply with legitimate requests.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Clinton has refused as many as six invitations
by Starr's prosecutors to voluntarily appear before the federal
grand jury that is investigating whether he had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 25-year-old former White House
intern, and then sought to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   According to an adviser of Clinton who insisted on anonymity,
Clinton expressed ``strong'' feelings in a recent conversation that
he did not want to appear in person before Starr's grand jury,
which is impaneled at the federal courthouse near Capitol Hill. The
adviser said Clinton views Starr's inquiry as unfair, politically
motivated and even illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   When told about those remarks, a member of Clinton's legal team
said the president is prone to fits of anger and frustration with
the six-month-old Starr investigation. The lawyer said Clinton's
strategy is to attempt to negotiate a compromise with Starr's
office, rather than risk provoking a constitutional confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars are sharply divided on whether a sitting
president can be forced to take the stand in a criminal
investigation, or whether a grand jury can return an indictment
against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   With several clear signals that Starr's inquiry is winding down,
speculation was widespread in Washington on Friday that Starr had
recently threatened to subpoena Clinton unless he agrees to
voluntarily cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors and White House lawyers also have very
different views over whether a criminal subpoena of the president
is constitutionally permissible. Starr's office believes that such
a subpoena will pass constitutional muster, but Clinton's lawyers
believe only the House of Representatives has such authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, declined to comment
Friday about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said very little about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. In January, shortly after the Lewinsky accusations
surfaced, he and his staff pledged to cooperate in the inquiry. He
said he would like to clear up questions raised by the Lewinsky
matter ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starr chose to subpoena the president, rather than negotiate
the terms of his testimony, the move could prompt Clinton to claim
that constitutional protections shield him from such inquiries. A
member of his legal team, W. Neil Eggleston, is researching the
legal and constitutional questions arising from such a challenge,
but he declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr subpoenaed the president and Clinton chose to fight it,
the court battle surrounding such a move could delay Starr's
inquiry for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous amount of speculation that there
has been a subpoena or the threat of one,'' McCurry said. ``At
least until now, Kendall and Ruff prefer to be in a cooperative,
rather than a confrontational, mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and Fiske have also questioned Hillary Rodham Clinton at
the White House about the Clintons' business affairs in Arkansas.
In early 1996, Starr ordered Mrs. Clinton to appear before a grand
jury in Washington. Her appearance was demanded after a copy of
some of the billing records from her old law firm mysteriously
surfaced in the residence of the White House nearly two years after
they were first subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday, McCurry said that he did not know the
status of discussions with Starr's office, which began in March.
``I can't tell you what the status of discussions are that the
lawyers are having,'' he said. &QL;

BAY STATE SEX-OFFENDER LAW UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Supreme Judicial Court upheld Friday the state's
sex offender registry law which requires all sex offenders to
notify police of their presence in the community in which they
reside.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-1 decision, the court rejected two Superior Court rulings
which held that the law improperly gives the power to classify
offenders to the Sex Offender Registry, an appointed board, instead
of a court.
</P>
<P>
   The two judges who made that ruling did so after two unnamed sex
offenders argued that the current law has no procedure to let them
challenge the board's conclusion that they should be classified as
Level 3, or most likely to offend again.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men was convicted of raping his 12-year-old
step-daughter and the other of raping his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The offenders also had argued the board used the so-called
``preponderance of the evidence,'' standard to make its
classification, instead of the stricter standard of ``clear and
convincing evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Superior Court judges declared the entire sex
offender registry law unconstitutional and the other ruled that
part of it was. Both judges, aware of the controversial nature or
their rulings, reported their decisions to the Appeals Court, but
the SJC independently took the case for direct review.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page opinion written by Justice Roderick Ireland, the
court threw out both Superior Court rulings, but it also orders the
state sex offenders review board to hold hearings again on the two
cases.
</P>
<P>
   If the board finds that both men should be classified as Level
3, the court ruled, it must back its judgment with specific
reasons, and it must so find by a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The SJC declined to declare the law unconstitutional. The court
said that when a law makes no provisions for appeal hearings, they
had in the past required such hearings and had helped devise
appropriate procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in dissent, Justice Margaret Marshall agreed with the
majority opinion _ that the state sex offender registry board, a
comparitively new body, should be allowed to make its own rulings
on an offender's dangerousness, and that the board should have time
to establish its own procedures before the SJC is asked to decide
if they are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``due process requires that proof be by clear and
convincing evidence,'' Marshall wrote,
</P>
<P>
   The law was patterned after New Jersey's, which was drawn up
after 7-year-old Megan Kanka was raped and murdered in 1994 by a a
paroled repeat sex offender who had moved into her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law was passed in October 1996. The registry
board consists of five unpaid members who work without a staff, and
offenders are required to register under the honor system.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went into effect, the sex offender registry law has
been repeatedly challenged in court, and critics have pointed out
numerous loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gilberto Sanchez, a convicted sex offender, was
arrested after he allegedly entered the room of a sleeping
12-year-old girl in Framingham and fondled her. Sanchez had been
registered as a sex offender in Boston, but moved from Boston to
Framingham without telling police.
</P>
<P>
   A new sex offender registry bill, in the House Ways and Means
Committee, would plug some of the holes. Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci
has been pushing for the bill to emerge for a vote before the
legislative session ends July 31.

 &HT;    Atlanta man leads cyberspace rescue
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- His computer screen said there was a message pending,
but Michael Cline went to lunch. When he returned, his heart sank:
Melissa from Colorado was going to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you read this I will be gone. Gone as in dead. I
have tried before and now know what will work,'' wrote Melissa, 24,
on Tuesday. She said she was an alcoholic and pregnant. ``And I
hate the person I have become.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote personal goodbyes to the sign-on names of a dozen
faceless on-line friends as far away as Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Cline lives in the Druid Hills area and is a Hare Krishna
believer. Melissa was searching for something and often questioned
him about his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, Cline immediately created an on-line chat room to get
his cyberfriends working on finding her. And he frantically called
the Internet service provider America Online, trying to get it to
find her through their records.
</P>
<P>
   A passerby found the woman later that day, unconscious, on a
park bike path in Westminster, a Denver suburb. Her stomach was
pumped and she survived.
</P>
<P>
   Cline and another chat buddy, Don Viner, of Omaha, Neb., said
Friday they had bombarded AOL with calls but were frustrated by the
service's seeming indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they handled it was terrible,'' said Viner, who was
trasferred within AOL and dumped into voicemail boxes.
</P>

   Viner, who installs computers for a living, took over the
``command-central'' Cline had set up. Viner used three phone lines:
one for e-mail, one for incoming calls and another for outgoing
calls. He and his cyberbuddies called metro Denver police
departments looking for a needle in a haystack _ a girl they only
knew as Melissa.
</P>

   ``We thought she might be lying there dying,'' said Cline. ``I
talked to AOL and later got a form letter. It said it might take
the company 72 hours to respond.''

   AOL officials declined to comment Friday, but said employees are
trained for such emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our protocol is to treat (possible emergency calls)
seriously,'' said John Ryan, AOL assistant counsel for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Westminister police said they could find no evidence AOL called
the department during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled everything I could find and we don't show AOL
calling, '' police spokesman Jim Buckner told the Denver Post.

 &HT;    House passes wide-ranging health care legislation
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Prodded by a growing public frustration with health
insurance companies, the House passed legislation Friday that calls
for dramatically changing the way health care is administered
across the country by giving patients a way to appeal when they are
denied treatment and imposing steep penalties for failing to
address the needs of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted by a narrow 216 to 210 margin to pass the
wide-ranging bill, despite a veto threat hovering over the measure
and despite an attempt by Michigan Democrat John Dingell and Iowa
Republican Greg Ganske to offer a bill that would have gone even
farther than the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a day for Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood, a
dentist, who has made overhauling managed care the central thrust
of his two terms in Congress. Norwood did so against the wishes of
the Republican leadership and the business community that helped
him get to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have wanted this to happen for a long time,'' said a smiling
Norwood, following the vote. ``For the first time since 1974,
health care is going to go back to two people: the patient and the
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill will impact 161 million consumers with private
insurance. Managed care plans now insure more than 75 percent of
Americans and hold down costs by limited access to doctors and
tests.
</P>
<P>
   This bill attempts to open up that access by allowing women for
example to go directly to their gynecologist and children to go
directly to their pediatrician. The bill would also make it easier
for patients to seek emergency care and lift rules that prevent
doctors from having full discussion with their doctors about health
care choices. Most importantly, it gives patients access to an
external review process if they are unhappy about decisions made by
their health management company.
</P>
<P>
   That appeals process would be enforced with fines of up to $500
per day up to $250,000 for decisions that are made by insurers ``in
bad faith.'' Health plans that ignore the advice of the doctor
would also face fines, which Republicans say gives a judge the
opportunity to make a punitive damage assessment against
out-of-line health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill does not remove the liability protections that
Norwood and a bill proposed by Dingell and Ganske had sought. Those
liability protections were at the heart of the rancorous dispute
over how best to regulate managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 1974 law known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. The law, which was set up to address concerns that
corrupt pension managers were illegally taking money from federal
pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The law has come under fire today because it precludes
individuals from suing their insurance companies for punitive
damages. Under current law, a patient can not collect more than the
cost of the denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight now goes to the Senate chamber where a managed
care bill could come up for a vote as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will protect consumers from abuses in the
managed care industry while increasing access to affordable
alternatives,'' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, during debate on
the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for the Dingell-Ganske bill was close enough that it
showed the splinter in the GOP, with some Republicans balking at
the idea of supporting a measure that would grant liability
protection to the managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier vote on the Dingell-Ganske measure, the House
voted 217 to 212 to reject the measure, which had the strong
backing of Georgia Democrat John Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many patients are paying more and getting less,'' Lewis
said. ``The differences are clear. Democrats are concerned about
protecting patients. Republicans are concerned about big business
and insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the health care system is clearly broke when a
``doctor had to fight his insurance company to get coverage to
treat his cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe in the free market, if you believe in the power
of individual choice, if you believe our private health care system
is really the best in the world, then listen up,'' said Rep. Jim
McCrery, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bill has a long way to go before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of Management and Budget said in a
statement the GOP bill ``provides too few patient protections, and
it contains unnecessary and irrelevant provisions that undermine
the chances for bipartisan agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto
this bill if it were presented to him by the Congress,'' the
statement said.

 &HT;    King faces many challenges as SCLC President
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When Martin Luther King III is sworn in today as the
fourth president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
he will face several challenges, including how to bring the
old-line civil rights organization into the future. He also will be
searching for a diplomatic way to heal wounds inflicted in April
when the SCLC board vote 10-9 to sever ties with SCLC/W.O.M.E.N.
</P>
<P>
   King had hoped to have that challenge behind him before he
headed to Washington for the organization's 41st annual convention,
which begins today and ends Wednesday. But when he met last week
with Evelyn Lowery, founder and president of SCLC/W.O.M.E.N., they
were at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgement, we made a mistake on voting on terminology
that created this particular rift,'' King said. ``The intent was to
bring SCLC/W.O.M.E.N. back under the umbrella of the organization
and restructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery - whose husband, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, is immediate
past president of SCLC - was quoted in the Washington Post as
saying the reason given was ``that we were competing with them ...
for money, I guess.'' She did not return numerous phone calls last
week, and when a reporter visited her office, a worker said through
the intercom that Lowery was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But Clayola Brown, a member of both boards, characterized the
discussions as ``relatively productive, although not conclusive.''
She did not attend the meeting, but she remains hopeful resolution
is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of SCLC, including women, have played a role in making
sure human rights have been protected,'' Brown said in a phone
interview from her New York office. ``I'm hopeful the women's
element within SCLC can take on more aggressive leadership roles
within the organization and help format where SCLC is going.''
</P>
<P>
   SCLC/W.O.M.E.N. has sponsored a Civil Rights Heritage Tour,
awarded scholarships, held an annual Strengthening the Black Family
Conference and participated in prison ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, William Boone, an associate professor of
political science at Clark Atlanta University, wondered why the
SCLC board would tinker with the women's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon the news reports, that was definitely a boo-boo,''
Boone said. ``You do not begin an organization's new thrust by
alienating the base.''
</P>
<P>
   But King said SCLC will rise up from this impasse a unified
organization. And he said he has already begun to formulate goals
that he'll present during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue suit, striped white shirt and a multi-colored
tie, King spoke candidly from his modest Auburn Avenue office about
how he intends to breathe new life into the organization his
father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., founded in 1957 with the
Rev. Ralph David Abernathy Jr., Lowery and other ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three to five years, King said the organization's
focus will be on mentoring youth, preserving affirmative action,
caring for the elderly, improving education, forming corporate
partnerships, recruiting new members and erasing environmental
injustices in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for bringing those goals to fruition, he said, will be
hammered out in August when he convenes a meeting with SCLC
staffers and board members.
</P>
<P>
   Some are wondering whether the 40-year-old King has what it
takes to lift the organization to the level of notoriety it enjoyed
in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Martin King is untried,'' Boone said. ``He served on
the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, but I'm not quite certain
that's the kind of experience one needs.''
</P>
<P>
   What King does need, according to Boone and others, is
organization skills and the ability to raise money. He also needs
to immediately organize a coherent, unified national staff and to
develop a mission plan for chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``SCLC will require a lot of rebuilding,'' said the Rev. Timothy
McDonald, who left SCLC in 1989 after eight years as director of
Operation Breadbasket and special projects. ``It has kind of lost
its bite.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald suggests reinvigorating the organization by mobilizing
communities around ``prevalent issues for African Americans,'' like
affirmative action, AIDS and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Another key will be attracting young African-Americans, many of
whom are oblivious to the struggles of the '50s and '60s that
necessitated the creation of organizations like SCLC, said the Rev.
Gerald Durley, an SCLC member.
</P>
<P>
   Boone agreed, describing the younger generation as ``a different
kind of black people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're younger, more affluent and can't relate to the
oppression of the past,'' Boone said. ``So SCLC will have to figure
out a way to reach them.''
</P>
<P>
   King offered assurances last week that he's up to the task
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have the beginning stages of the apparatus to not just
talk about and raise issues, but to execute results,'' he said.
``Little by little as people evaluate us, they're going to be
pleased with the direction we take as an organization.''

 &HT;    UGA's Landers in talks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ University of Georgia women's basketball coach Andy
Landers interviewedFriday for the head coach/general manager
position of the to-be-named Minnesota franchise of the WNBA, a
school official said.
</P>
<P>
   Landers, a three-time national coach of the year, attended the
Nike All-America girls basketball camp in Indianapolis on Wednesday
and Thursday. Landers, whose wife, Pam, said he was expected to
return to Athens late Friday night, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had candidates in this week, but they haven't
announced anything,'' said Kent Wipf, director of media relations
for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the NBA team that will operate the
WNBA franchise. ``I don't expect them to do anything until
September because they still haven't met their ticket depository
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota and Orlando were awarded WNBA franchises April 22,
with final approval dependent upon each city selling 5,000 season
tickets by September 1. The Timberwolves announced July 17 that
deposits for only 2,337 tickets had been received. The team would
begin competition in the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves chief financial officer Roger Griffith, who will
serve as president of the WNBA franchise, didn't return telephone
messages Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Landers, 45, is the only full-time women's coach in Georgia
history, with a career record of 459-141 in 19 seasons, the
third-best mark among active Division I coaches with as much
tenure. He is just one of four coaches to make four trips to the
Final Four, with runner-up finishes in 1985 and 1996, and has won
six Southeastern Conference titles.
</P>
<P>
   Landers is the second-highest paid coach at Georgia, earning a
base salary of $117,600 in 1996 and a total package of $202,600,
which includes a $50,000 consulting fee from Nike. Landers and
gymnastics coach Suzanne Yoculan threatened the school with Title
IX sex discrimation suits in 1994, but Bulldogs athletics director
Vince Dooley averted the issue by awarding significant pay raises
to both.

`SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' PRINTS DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg ran into a first-class snafu Friday morning
when copies of the new World War II film ``Saving Private Ryan''
failed to show up in some of the nation's theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, about 20 prints were late arriving at area Harkins,
AMC and United Artist theaters, leaving matinee filmgoers to find
some other film to save them from the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for ``Lethal Weapon 4'' right now and catch
``Private Ryan'' later,'' said Blaine McCollum of Phoenix, voicing
the sentiment of many of the approximately 60 people in line who
were turned away from AMC's Arizona Center 24 theater Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. Friday, AMC theaters had received all their prints.
</P>
<P>
   Prints for movies opening on Friday typically arrive at local
theaters Thursday night, where they are built up in the projection
booth for Friday's opening matinees.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the prints never
arrived. Eventually, the theater managers received notice from the
movie studio that there was a problem with distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally out of our control,'' said Allison Frost of
AMC.
</P>
<P>
   She said that most people who came for the early shows simply
came back later to see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Harkins Theaters was partially lucky. Three of its theaters
received prints early Friday morning, in time to prepare them for
the matinees.
</P>
<P>
   Harkins hoped to have prints at all theaters for Friday night's
prime-time shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never tell us what the real problem is until it's not
important anymore,'' said Kelly Maloney of Harkins Theaters. ``They
always say the same thing: It's a problem at the depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Prints are sent from the studio to a central depot, where
they're shipped to cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Studios typically don't cut prints until the movie is about to
be released to prevent piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The missing prints of the film, which was produced by
Spielberg's studio, DreamWorks, were supposed to be delivered by
Technicolor Labs of North Hollywood, where the actual prints were
struck.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks spokesman Mike Vollman said, ``We, as a movie studio,
use a vendor, Technicolor Labs, to dupe and distribute the prints
and ship them to theaters. And they had a problem with the
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not universal, he said, but did occur
sporadically across the nation. He did not say which cities were
most affected, except that Phoenix was one of the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Vollman said. ``They screwed
something up. I don't know where the ball fell apart, but when we
got the word we got right on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Technicolor did not return calls. &QL;

INDIANA JUDGE DISMISSES STATE SUIT AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a victory for tobacco producers, a judge for the first time
has thrown out a state lawsuit seeking to recover billions of
dollars in smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by Indiana Attorney General Jeffrey Modisett was
part of a wave of actions filed since 1994 by 40 states and Puerto
Rico. But, while some of those cases have been weakened by rulings
in some states, Friday's decision by Marion County Superior Court
Judge Gerald Zore in Indianapolis marked the first time that a
state anti-smoking case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Zore held that to recover damages, the state would have to
effectively prove claims for each affected resident on a
case-by-case basis, and then demonstrate the excess Medicaid
expenses associated with their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order did not elaborate on his reasoning. Cigarette
producers, however, have long argued that states should have to
prove their cases in such a fashion, and they said they were
pleased by Friday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general said he would appeal the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana now has the dubious distinction of being the only
state in the country where all of a state's claims against the
tobacco industry have been dismissed,'' Modisett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McKim, assistant general counsel for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., a division of RJR Nabisco Holdings, said in a
statement: ``Judge Zore's sweeping ruling is clear and concise and
strikes at the heart of similar suits around the nation. It
confirms our position that the suits brought by attorneys general
to recoup their states' Medicaid costs are simply without legal or
factual merit and should never have been filed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Little, the associate general counsel for Philip Morris
Cos., sounded a similar theme. ``We are delighted to see that
courts across the country are following the law and ignoring the
politics of tobacco litigation,'' Little said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, other defendants in the
Indiana case included Brown &AMP; Williamson, which is owned by BAT
Industries; Lorillard, a subsidiary of Loews Corp., and U.S.
Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of UST Inc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a group, the state claims have moved forward because other
judges have allowed state officials to bring claims representing
residents in a single action and then use statistical models to
prove alleged damages.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Zore also threw out all other elements of the
Indiana case, including claims that tobacco companies had conspired
together, deceived the public about the dangers of smoking and
unjustly enriched themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana lawsuit did not state a specific amount of damages.
But Modisett said he estimated that Indiana's share of last year's
proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement would have ranged from
$3.5 billion to $4 billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zore's ruling Friday came on the eve of another round of talks
between state attorneys general and industry negotiators aimed at
reaching a new tobacco settlement agreement; the talks are
scheduled to begin Monday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, tobacco producers have paid out about $36 billion to
settle with four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and
Texas. &QL;

SHOOTING TURNS VICTORY PARTY TO TRAGEDY IN MAJORITY WHIP'S OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate had quit for the week and most
lawmakers were on their way home on Friday when Rep. Tom Delay's
staff broke out some cake to celebrate a big legislative win and
the promise of a beautiful weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The party ended in chaos when a gunman shot his way into the
Capitol just outside the House Majority Whip's suite of offices, a
floor below the building's stunning Rotunda. The violent incident
turned a good-times Friday afternoon into a nightmare of confusion,
fear and death.
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, screaming tourists dove for cover as Capitol police
officers returned fire. The gunman burst through a door leading to
DeLay's extensive office complex, where he was shot by Officer John
Gibson, a member of DeLay's security detail.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and another officer, Jacob Chestnut, were fatally wounded
in the shootout. The gunman and a tourist were hospitalized with
gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Police and witnesses said the gunman did not target DeLay, a
conservative from Sugar Land, but the incident left the Republican
lawmaker and his staff shaken and glad to be alive. The staff had
been celebrating House passage of a Republican health care bill
when the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of scary around here,'' said John Feehery, DeLay's
communications director. ``There was all kinds of commotion.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who called the shooting a ``horrible incident,'' issued a
statement praising the slain officers. He said he considered Gibson
a member of his congressional family.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and the members of my
staff,'' DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted
quickly and with great bravery, as he did, others would have been
killed. I cannot express the depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos at the shooting site contrasted with the
business-as-usual mood in the rest of the Capitol complex. Two
floors above the carnage, aides to another Texas Republican, House
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving, were oblivious to the danger.
The hard-to-find suite became a sanctuary for scores of frightened
tourists who were directed out of the line of fire by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hear anything,'' said Michele Davis, Armey's press
aide. Horace Cooper, another Armey aide, said one tourist was
separated from her child in the confusion, but they were later
reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol offices are reserved for top House leaders in both
parties, so most rank-and-file lawmakers were nowhere near the
shooting. Republican Reps. Kay Granger of Fort Worth and Joe Barton
of Ennis were on their home to Texas. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas,
learned about the shooting after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   But for lawmakers and tourists alike, the incident was another
reminder that senseless violence can strike anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the times that we're in,'' said David Arroyo, a visitor
from Pasadena. ``It's an unfortunate thing. Nowadays no one is
surprised when something like this happens. It's sad to say, but we
have gotten used to violence in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Capitol shooting seemed to strike a nerve among
tourists who had come to marvel at the seat of representative
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad because this is the people's house, our house,'' said
Jerry Price of Boulder, Colo. ``No one has the right to do this.''

THE CONGO MASSACRES: THE U.N. STEPS ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An investigation into massacres in Congo, an
issue that rights groups consider critical to the credibility of
U.N. human rights operations, has been virtually shelved.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has chosen to take no action in response to
a report presenting evidence that troops now under the control of
Congo and Rwanda were implicated in the deaths of thousands of Hutu
refugees driven out of camps in what was then eastern Zaire in late
1996 and early 1997. Reports of violations of human rights, often
based on ethnicity, still flow out of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Security Council asked both governments to look into
the allegations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International called the inaction shameful. ``It is
extraordinary for the Security Council to have abdicated its
responsibility and for it to expect the very authorities which have
been identified as being responsible for such horrendous atrocities
to bring the perpetrators to justice,'' Amnesty International said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat disagreed, saying the Security Council had
put both governments on notice that the issue would be revisited in
the fall, when progress would be assessed and action considered.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Rwandan government, the United Nations has
also closed a human rights office in Rwanda, the most important of
a few centers set up in countries with large-scale violations.
There are similar offices in Burundi, Cambodia, Colombia and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi-led Rwandan government snubbed Secretary General Kofi
Annan when he visited this year. Rwandan leaders have been furious
with the United Nations since 1994, when Washington blocked the
Security Council from sending peacekeeping forces to prevent
massacres of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi by Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, the government of President Laurent Kabila obstructed
the human rights team sent by Annan until its work became
impossible and it had to be withdrawn. That team wrote the report
on which the Security Council had been asked to act.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups were quick to link the fate of the Congo inquiry
to the position that the United States, a friend of Rwanda, took at
a recent conference in Rome setting up an International Criminal
Court: Washington argued for Security Council control over which
issues were to be turned over to a court judging those accused of
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups say that the aborted Congo investigation is
exactly the kind of case the Security Council might face, and that
its actions did not inspire confidence. Kenneth Roth, executive
director of Human Rights Watch, noted that the Security Council
also refused to act when Iraq gassed Kurds in 1988.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the Rome conference ended, the Security Council was left
with the power to stall proceedings but not prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said that
in Congo, ``we see a real regional retreat'' by the West. He said
the United States and others had chosen stability and good
relations with regional governments over accountability for
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concern about security in the region is trumping human rights
when in fact the protection of people is a key to stability,''
Brody said. ``Look at the Congo, where you have a United Nations
team saying crimes against humanity have been committed. Yet the
Security Council can't muster the political will to act. Clearly
many members of the Council have ties to the governments that are
implicated and don't want to see human rights concerns weaken those
governments.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Enmeshed last May in a two-and-a-half-hour traffic jam
on his way to a Moscow airport, the driver of a city bus decided to
save his passengers some time by taking a short cut through the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Not on a road. Through the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accredited city bus, driving through a park from one
side of the block to the other, but via the grass,'' said Dona
Johnson, a Canadian living here who was stuck in the same jam.
``Finally it just came over the sidewalk on the other side, cut off
a trolley bus and proceeded down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Most world capitals have traffic problems. Then there is Moscow,
where traffic is not just awful, but boisterously, exuberantly so.
Free for eight years to buy anything they can afford, Muscovites
have bought cars with an absolute vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   They drive them that way, too. Never have so many cars driven by
so many novices descended so quickly on such an unprepared
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, when the Communists ran things, Moscow traffic
was as orderly as the line at Lenin's tomb. Now it is better
compared to the obligatory scene in a grade-B western where riders
gallop their horses through the town saloon.
</P>
<P>
   People also get killed. There are about 20 serious accidents on
Moscow streets each day, many involving pedestrians, and roughly
7,500 injuries and 800 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one learns to drive in Moscow, there isn't any other city
in the world in which to be scared,'' said Andrei Schavelev, who
heads the propaganda department of the State Automobile
Inspectorate, known everywhere by its Russian acronym GAI
(pronounced guy-EE). ``In Switzerland, I could drive with one
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Russians have always had a reputation as zestful
drivers. But for decades hardly anyone noticed because there were
so few cars. The Soviet Union limited the production of cars, and
those that were made usually went to Communists and the
well-connected.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, a city of 8 million, counted only about 320,000 autos in
1981. When the Berlin wall fell in 1989 there were still but
877,500 _ barely one car for every 10 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nine years later the ratio is closing in on a car for
every three people _ more than 2.2 million cars on the city
registry, plus an estimated 300,000 more registered elsewhere. Five
years ago, when the total was half that, the appetite for cars was
so voracious that drivers snapped up more than 150,000 Japanese
models that had been rushed across the continent _ with right-hand
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Such force-feeding would give any city indigestion. Moscow is
positively bloated, for even in the best of times this was not a
place for a leisurely Sunday drive. As in any 850-year-old city,
the downtown street grid is a crazy quilt. Even the more modern
roads frequently change names from block to block, making
map-reading an exercise in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic signals are relatively infrequent _ the city has fewer
than Washington, a city of 550,000 people _ and they tend to change
according to their own unwritten rules. Many stoplights are not yet
synchronized to speed the flow of cars. Increasingly, the thump of
traffic has proven too much for Moscow's old streets, which have
begun to cave in with alarming frequency, occasionally parboiling
unfortunate victims in a spray of broken steam pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking of all are the city's traffic rules, which to
Westerners can seem inscrutable, if not wrongheaded. ``No Parking''
can often be translated as ``Park on the sidewalk, not the
street.'' Left turns are largely banned, except when they are not;
signs do not always distinguish the two.
</P>
<P>
   U-turns are encouraged, but only on busy streets, and only in
certain spots. The preferred method of making a left turn is to
continue driving past one's destination, sometimes for several
minutes, until the car reaches an overpass or a U-turn zone. With
that, it is possible to turn around, backtrack to the destination
and make a legal right turn.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the only way to make a left turn is to turn right,
then navigate a maze of U-turns and side streets to reach a traffic
signal that will allow you to cross the street you were on to begin
with. In that case, a left turn from, say, the Novy Arbat onto the
Garden Ring entails a right turn, two U-turns, three more turns and
a trip around the Russian White House and the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   None of this mattered much when there weren't many cars in
Moscow. Today it creates a 24-hour probka _ Russian for ``cork,''
and slang for traffic jam _that brings out the cowboy in many
motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, Russian drivers are less disciplined than
elsewhere,'' said Andrei Karlov, a senior expert at the All-Russia
Society of Motorists, a rough equivalent of the American Automobile
Association. ``The rules are good. But there are no conditions
under which to observe them.''
</P>
<P>
   The official city speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour, or
about 37 miles per hour, exists largely on the books. On the
busiest roads _ the broad prospekts that stretch like spokes from
the city center, or the 10-lane ring road that circles downtown _
the white lane dividers are, in effect, pleasant decorations.
Drivers establish their own lanes by muscling at high speed to
within a few inches of less courageous cars, and waiting for them
to back off.
</P>
<P>
   The most intrepid of these men _ women drivers were virtually
unheard of until a few years ago _ will do almost anything to avoid
a backup. It is not uncommon for a car to take to the sidewalks for
short distances when traffic stops on the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago that cars were spotted on one major Moscow
street nonchalantly climbing and descending a ramp for the
handicapped in order to get around a city bus. The bus had hit a
large pothole, which then turned into a sinkhole, swallowing it.
</P>
<P>
   None of this behavior was learned from Emily Post. Much of it
undoubtedly stems from the fact that many Muscovites are relative
newcomers to the road. Some of it is surely due to the city's
understandable problem in channeling this flood of new cars onto
proper routes.
</P>
<P>
   Schavelev, of the GAI, blames a growing culture among new
motorists _ especially rich ones with foreign cars _ to flout
traffic laws as evidence of their wealth and power. Moscow is rife
with Mercedes, and while European cars like Volkswagens and Volvos
are the most popular imports, costly American sport-utility
vehicles have lately become cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``They drive in any lane and think they can pay any fine,'' he
said. ``Sometimes they throw packs of money to inspectors, as if
they are dogs, so we won't detain them.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlov, the traffic expert, lays some blame at the feet of the
Communists, who he says drove as if they were the only people on
the road, which, of course, they often were.
</P>
<P>
   Money would help. Moscow needs another 175 miles of streets just
to accommodate today's traffic. The GAI, which operates a
traffic-control center in downtown Moscow and employs 7,000 traffic
policemen and inspectors, wants to hire 5,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's big-spending mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has made traffic a
priority. The city has nearly completed construction of a second
major beltway around Moscow's outer regions, and is building new
pedestrian tunnels downtown. And it has nearly completed the
freeway-quality reconstruction of the so-called ``Death Road'' _
the MKAD, the outermost of the three ring roads that encircle the
city.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a problem: a spate of collisions along stretches
of the road that permit a new, higher speed limit of just over 62
mph. But there is a ready explanation: ``Drivers are not used to a
road of such quality,'' the head of the GAI, Nikolai Arkhipkin,
said this month.

TOURISTS STUNNED IN AF TERMATH OF SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of tourists stood outside the Capitol in
near silence, stunned as they watched ambulances and helicopters
take away the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, tourists fled in panic as they realized the sounds they
heard were gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People . . . started pouring out of the old Supreme Court
chamber as well as the various corridors screaming at the top of
their lungs and running,'' said Allison Applegate-Slatter, a staff
assistant for Rep. John Hostettler, R-Ind., who was conducting a
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, luckily, right by a hallway, and an officer poked his
head around the hallway and said, `Please go out this way. Run.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to tell me twice. I ran.''
</P>
<P>
   The glory of a sun-washed summer day at one of the nation's
symbols of freedom was broken Friday afternoon by a gunman who
forced his way past security at a ground floor door, shot two
Capitol Police officers and a 24-year-old woman before he was shot
inside the office suite of Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House business had broken up nearly an hour before and most
members had started home _ by car, train, or plane _ but as the
news came over congressional office televisions, perpetually tuned
to all-news stations, chiefs of staff took head-counts and ordered
interns to call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to send everyone home a few minutes early,''
said Fran McNaught, chief of staff for Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ``I
had all our interns call (home). In fact, I had all our people call
and let people know they were all right.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaught said one of her interns was shocked when he realized as
he crossed the Capitol grounds that the hundreds of tourists who
were milling there had fallen almost entirely silent.
</P>
<P>
   Among Capitol Hill staff there was a certain resignation to the
inevitability of something like the shooting happening in the
nation's seat of power.
</P>
<P>
   No one ran around terrified, said Mike Paranzino, chief of staff
for Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., though he acknowledged that would be
one way to handle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other view is, `Let's stay put until they have the suspect
in custody.' We're all staying put.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is going to mean even more heightened security,
despite fortifications installed after the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all just speculating on what will be shut down next,''
said Elisabeth Hickey, press secretary for the House subcommittee
on the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sobering,'' she said. ``If you're not safe in the Capitol
where there are police all around, where are you safe?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., who was interviewed from his plane
as he headed back to Arizona, said he would hate for increased
security to mean more limited contact between members of Congress
and their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things we could do is try to cloister members
of Congress away from the people they serve,'' he said. &QL;

STATES THREATEN ANTITRUST STEPS AGAINST AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 25 states voiced their support Friday for
a Clinton administration proposal to promote more competition in
the airline industry. If the initiative fails, however, the states
may file an antitrust suit against the major carriers, the leader
of the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, who drafted the joint
position paper, said the states would prefer to see the
administration enact the guidelines proposed in April, which were
intended to prevent the large airlines from driving low-cost
competitors out of major airports. If the administration backed
down, he said, the states might bring suit against the airlines for
predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, attorneys general from 20 states set up a
task force focused on the airline industry and headed by Miller and
Dennis Vacco, New York's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to predatory pricing, the states also plan to
examine the three alliances announced earlier this year that would
pair off the country's six largest airlines. Other issues include
the extent to which major carriers control gates and takeoff and
landing rights at the United States' most crowded airports.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same issues are also addressed in pending bills in
the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The states announced their support for the administration on the
last day of a four-month period of public comment on the
guidelines. This week, both supporters and opponents held news
conferences and presented experts to bolster their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate since April has been dominated by a
multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign financed by the major
airlines that accuses the Clinton administration of trying to
``reregulate'' the airline industry and hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper advertisement, for example, by the Air Transport
Association, the industry's chief lobby in Washington, showed an
overweight government official with his feet on his desk under the
headline: Meet Your New Travel Agent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater invited the
chief executives of the major airlines to his office to talk about
the proposed rules. One person at the meeting said Slater reminded
the executives that they would have to work with the administration
on many aviation issues after the debate on the guidelines was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an honest disagreement over how the situation ought to
be handled,'' said Leo Mullin, the chief executive of Delta Air
Lines, who was at the meeting. ``The secretary asked us to come in
and talk about it and create a better understanding. It was a good
move on his part and I think we had a good dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the industry charges, the Transportation Department has
repeatedly voiced its support for the deregulation of the airline
industry, which it says has reduced average air fares by 35 percent
since 1978. But it adds that much of that benefit has been a result
of the competition introduced by low-cost competitors who in recent
years have been driven out of many markets by larger carriers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the administration, the number of cities served by
more than two airlines has declined 41 percent since 1989. At the
same time, air fares for last-minute travel have risen dramatically
and the major airlines are reporting record high profits.
</P>
<P>
   Small carriers have complained that when they try to compete,
the major airlines match their lower prices and flood their routes
with so many new seats that they are forced to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines would put the airlines on notice that the
administration would order them to stop and might even assess fines
if they responded to new competition by adding so many new seats
that they lose money. The assumption is that the only reason for
taking such action would be to drive the new competitor out of the
market, leaving the major carrier free to raise prices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a draft position paper, the Transportation Department cites
four recent examples of such predatory behavior based on its
investigations of the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In one example from early 1997, an incumbent airline responded
to a new entrant by dropping its fare on one route to under $75
from between $351 and $425. The incumbent sold 46,000 tickets _ six
times the number sold by the new entrant _ and saw its revenue
decline 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines respond that they are not responsible for the
failure of small carriers and that the guidelines will ultimately
hurt consumers by preventing the big airlines from lowering their
prices to match new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their lobbying campaign, the major carriers increased
their contributions to lawmakers in Washington in the last election
cycle by 66 percent, compared with 1996, to $2.2 million, according
to a study by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they were handed a defeat last month, when the
House Transportation Committee refused to adopt a proposal backed
by the major airlines that would have forced the Transportation
Department to study the issue for a year before putting the
guidelines into force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bill states that the administration must give
Congress 12 weeks' notice before adopting the rules and must
present the lawmakers with a study of airline deregulation. The
proposed legislation, which is still awaiting passage by the full
House, also gives the Transportation Department the right for the
first time to review proposed airline alliances before they can
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the final version of the guidelines
could be in force by November.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Northwest Airlines released a paper highly critical
of the rules written by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of
President Clinton's National Economic Council who left the White
House in December to become dean of the Haas School of Business at
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Tyson said the regulations would go beyond
current antitrust laws and would put the Transportation Department
in the impossible position of having to judge what constitutes fair
competition. ``There is no public policy case here for
intervention,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, Iowa's attorney general, strongly disagreed. `` I've
been a consumer protector for a long time,'' he said. ``I am really
leery when the industry argues that they are helping consumers.''

JURY FINDS FORMER AIR FORCE CADET GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ In a jury decision hailed as
``courageous'' by the victim's tearful family, former cadet David
Graham was convicted of capital murder Friday for the 1995 slaying
of a 16-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Like his former fiancee, Diane Zamora, Graham was automatically
sentenced to life imprisonment and will serve a minimum of 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Air Force Academy cadet took the verdict
stoically, ``like a soldier,'' said attorney Dan Cogdell. But he
wept during a private meeting with his parents afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared shaken when, moments after the verdict was
read, state District Judge Don Leonard allowed the parents and two
teen-age brothers of the slain girl, Adrianne Jones, to address the
silent defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that everyone remembers our daughter with the integrity
that she has, because she is still among us, watching us,'' said
mother Linda Jones. Fixing her gaze on Graham, she added, ``I
remember her eyes with joy. You will, with fear. I am sorry for you
and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's brother Justin Jones said, ``I have no hate for you
because I can't hate an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another brother, Scott Jones, his voice cracking with emotion,
thanked jurors, saying, ``What you did was very, very courageous.''
He chastised Graham for making ``bad choices'' that ``ruined so
many lives, so many families.
</P>
<P>
   ``And unlike my brother, I can hate an animal. And I hate David
Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   With their verdict after eight hours of deliberation, jurors
accepted the prosecution theory that Graham fatally shot Jones to
please Zamora, who was consumed by jealousy after Graham falsely
told of a sexual relationship with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said they did not buy the defense argument that
prosecutors had not proven Graham, now 20, was at the crime scene.
He did admit helping Zamora cover it up for nine months before
their arrests, which made national headlines and ended promising
two careers _ he with the Air Force in Colorado Springs, Colo., and
she as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The murder was committed in Tarrant County on Dec. 4, 1995, when
Graham and Zamora were high school senior sweethearts; they have
been in custody since September 1996. Their romance fizzled soon
thereafter when they were pitted against each other in court.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence showed that Graham, then a Mansfield High School
senior, called the sophomore track star a few hours before her
death and convinced her to leave her house for a late-night
rendezvous, ostensibly to discuss Zamora's irrational jealousy.
Graham, who appeared to be alone in the car when he arrived at
Jones' home, convinced Jones to go for a ride, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The drive ended near Joe Pool Lake, where Zamora sprang from
hiding in the car's trunk and struck Zamora, prosecutors said.
Injured and stunned, Jones fled a few yards before collapsing,
where Graham finished her off with two gunshots to the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``David ... you betrayed her trust, when she was just there to
help you with a problem,'' Jones' mother told him in the hushed
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mike Parrish said Graham was convicted largely
because of his confession, which provided explicit details about
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confession was obviously impossible to overcome,'' Parrish
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strangest thing about this case is not that David and
Diane did it, but that they did it for a fabricated reason,''
Parrish said. ``David Graham never had sex with Adrianne Jones.
David Graham did tell Diane Zamora he had sex with Adrianne, but it
was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of telling his girlfriend he had made this up, once
she demanded it _ she did lead and she did call the shots _ he went
along with it. That's the amazing part of this story.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors took one vote to reach their conclusion, said foreman
William Everett Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a confession, it would have been a whole different
deliberation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell's decision not to present defense witnesses was
surprising, Wright said, but ``the jury considered it a legitimate
tactic.`` The Jones family's comments to Graham were ``tough to
take'' for jurors, Wright said, as was the decision to ``put a
young kid away for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said the verdict was expected and Graham was prepared
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's spending 40 calendar years in a cage somewhere. He's not
a real happy camper. Neither am I,'' he blustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told David going in that the odds of us winning this case
were about the odds of me flying an F-16 upside down under and
overpass with a martini in my lap and not spilling the olive,'' the
Houston lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he would appeal the verdict ``as soon as I can get
to a word processor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got at least three families that have been devastated by
what did or didn't happen,'' he said. ``And there ain't no winners
in a deal like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's parents and other family members departed hastily after
the trial without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones family said they will spearhead efforts to create a
``serenity park'' in their hometown in Adrianne Jones' memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a strong family,'' Linda Jones said, ``and we are going
to process our grieving and go on like normal people do.''

TOUR DE FRANCE BIKERS PROTEST AS NEW DRUG ALLEGATIONS EMERGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE CAP D'AGDE, France _ The 85th Tour de France nearly unraveled
Friday as at least five expelled riders admitted they had used
illegal drugs, a second team was warned about possible ouster and
the remaining riders went on strike for two hours to protest
harassment in the doping scandal that has engulfed the world's
greatest bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   In a climate of innuendo, rumor and anger, widespread doping
practices that have long been suspected in bicycle racing are now
surfacing in the sport's showcase. The tour, which began in 1903
and has been held every year since except during the world wars, is
not only the richest and most prestigious bicycle race but it is
also an integral part of French culture, watched by hundreds of
thousands of fans at the side of the road every day and by millions
more on television.
</P>
<P>
   Angry riders among the 150 competitors that remain in the
three-week race refused to start Friday to protest what they called
hounding and criticism by the news media. Race director Jean-Marie
Leblanc said the riders cited a French television segment Thursday
night that examined the garbage of the Asics team from Italy and
displayed medical paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, three members of the expelled Festina team from
France, including the world road race champion, Laurent Brochard,
admitted to the police that they had used performance-enhancing
drugs. Two other members of the nine-man team were also reported to
have admitted using the drugs by late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great sense of relief at having confessed,'' said one
rider, Armin Meier, who is Swiss. ``But I feel victimized. It's
like everybody is driving 100 kilometers an hour on a highway with
a 90-kilometer limit, and they pull only us over.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, police continued to hold two officials of the
TVM team from the Netherlands and a magistrate said that a search
of the team's hotel had revealed ''a large quantity'' of ``doping
products'' and masking agents, substances used to flush drugs from
the system to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc warned the Dutch team that he and the International
Cycling Union, which governs the sport, were paying close attention
to the police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is revealed that this team has not respected the rules
and the ethics of the Tour de France and International Cycling
Union,'' Leblanc said, ``the team will be immediately expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the riders would protest again Saturday
morning. Leblanc said he used the popularity of the race to
persuade them to start Friday's stage. ``We negotiated with the
riders, we explained our position,'' Leblanc said. ``We cited the
multitude of fans who were awaiting them to encourage the riders
and show their appreciation. In the end, they understood.''
</P>
<P>
   He added regarding the Friday segment, ``If the stage had been
canceled, it might have been the end of the 1998 tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc said he would meet before Saturday's stage with an
official of the French Cycling Federation and a rider from each of
the 21 teams in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The three Spanish teams _ Banesto, ONCE and Vitalicio _ and the
Mercatone Uno team from Italy were reported to have led the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some pretty harsh stuff in the Spanish media and
a lot of the riders were hurt by it,'' Stuart O'Grady, an
Australian with Gan who wore the overall leader's yellow jersey for
three days, said Friday. ``It cut deep. A lot of teams didn't want
to take part in the race today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the central French city of Lyon, the nine members of the
Festina team plus three of its officials who had been in custody
were released. Apart from the five riders who were said to have
confessed, three others _ including Richard Virenque, the team's
leader and the second-place finisher in the last Tour _ reportedly
continued to deny that they had been involved in a systematic
program of doping.
</P>
<P>
   Citing media attention to the case and the Festina riders'
objections that they had been treated harshly by the police, the
riders who gathered Friday morning in the town of Tarascon sur
Ariege in the Pyrenees decided they had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   They slowly rolled about two miles from the ceremonial start to
the real one and then stopped, dismounting their bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert, the Frenchman who is ranked No. 1 in the
world, approached Leblanc in his lead car and spoke with him.
``Since the start of this Tour we have talked only about scandal
and not sport,'' Jalabert said. ''The riders are disgusted. We have
been treated like cattle and we will act like cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is interested in the sport side of the race. We won't
ride. It's finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing and sprawled on the road, the riders conferred among
themselves and with their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sick and tired of everybody being blamed for what
Festina did,'' said Frankie Andreu, an American with U.S. Postal
Service. He favored not racing.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, the riders were persuaded to start but they
rolled so slowly that they covered only 16 kilometers in the next
hour. Then the racing started in earnest with bursts of
accelerations. Jalabert went on a long attack with two other riders
and was later said to have done so because he was so angry that the
pack had agreed to start that he wanted racers to suffer at high
speed in the sultry heat.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first strike by riders. In 1978, they refused
to cross a finish line to protest long transfers between daily
stages and in 1991 they refused to start a stage to protest the
mandatory wearing of helmets. In both instances, the tour softened
its rules.
</P>
<P>
   In another legal development, Judge Patrick Kiel, who has been
leading the Festina investigation in the northern city of Lille,
released ``under strict conditions'' Willy Vogt, the team masseur
whose arrest unleashed the drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Vogt, a Belgian, was seized July 8 at the French-Belgian border
with an official Tour de France car reported to be holding a huge
quantity of such drugs as amphetamines, steroids, masking agents
and EPO, a potentially lethal drug that thickens the blood by
multiplying the red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to the
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, just before the tour began on July 11 in Dublin,
Ireland, news of his arrest was made public. Festina coach Bruno
Roussel at first denied that Vogt was part of his tour entourage.
On July 14, Vogt changed his story that the drugs were for his
personal use and said through his lawyer that he was acting on team
orders.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, a day after the race reached France, Roussel and the
team doctor, Eric Ryckaert, were taken into custody. The next day
Roussel was suspended by the International Cycling Union and the
day after that, he said that he had supplied the illicit drugs to
his riders, which they denied. Under French law, drug users are not
liable to imprisonment but suppliers are.
</P>
<P>
   That night, July 17, the Festina team, which ranks first in the
world, was expelled from the race in the first such action in the
tour's history.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, the team doctor said that the riders had contributed
up to $70,000 of their prizes to a fund to buy
performance-enhancing drugs. The riders were summoned to court in
Lyons on Thursday, the same day that police raided the TVM team's
hotel in Pamiers and took four officials into custody. The team's
coach, Cees Priem, and its doctor, Andrei Mihailov, remain in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial the newspaper Le Monde said, ``The 1998 Tour is
finished. It is a race without faith or law. If it dies it will
bury our childhood dreams with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour is seriously ill,'' responded Marie-George Buffet,
the French minister for sport, responded, ``but there's no reason
to kill it.'' &QL;

THE CAPITOL: AN OPEN SPACE PRONE TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>

CAPITOL-GUNMEN, CAPITOL-VIOLENCE-CHRONO) 
(hlw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Capitol has been the scene of bombings,
shootings and other forms of mayhem since the early days of the
Republic. In 1835, a gunman tried to kill President Andrew Jackson
in the Rotunda; his pistols misfired. In 1890, a Louisville
newspaper reporter shot a former Kentucky congressman to death on a
staircase after a long feud. But the two events with the most
lasting effect occurred in 1971 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn hours of March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded in a
men's restroom in the Senate wing, causing about $300,000 damage to
surrounding rooms. The radical Weather Underground organization
claimed responsibility for the bombing _ retaliation for U.S.
military activity in Cambodia, it said.
</P>
<P>
   That bombing, which was never solved, prompted elaborate new
measures: guards at the entrances began inspecting briefcases,
purses and packages. Surveillance devices were installed at
strategic points. X-ray machines were put at 10 entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those steps, a bomb was detonated shortly before 11 p.m.
on Nov. 7, 1983, in a second-floor alcove only 30 feet from the
Senate chamber. There were no injuries or structural damage, but
the bombing left lawmakers and Capitol security officials deeply
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   That very day, top lawmakers had agreed on new security measures
inspired by an incident only three weeks before, when an Israeli
tourist with a homemade bomb under his shirt was arrested in the
House gallery after threatening to blow up the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is the symbolic capital of the world,'' a Washington
police officer said after one incident. ``If you want to strike a
blow against the United States of America, you don't go to Des
Moines and blow up a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1983 bombing (to which three self-described Communists
pleaded guilty seven years later) accelerated the rush to tighter
Capitol security, ushering in measures that have become familiar _
and others that remain little-known, even secret.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors no longer had their pick of 10 doors; they could use
half that many. Metal detectors were installed at all entrances.
Concrete barriers (sometimes topped incongruously with flowers)
were erected at driveways. Parking and car traffic were restricted.
The Capitol Police force, 622 in 1971, grew to 1,265 by 1990.
People with regular business in the Capitol were assigned badges.
</P>
<P>
   And bulletproof steel plates were installed in the chairs on the
floor of the House of Representatives to guard against terrorist
attacks. The Senate's sergeant-at-arms decided against bulletproof
chairs, but assured the public that new secret new precautions had
been put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the tighter security of recent years, and for all
its importance as a center of government and national symbol, the
Capitol remains a relatively open place.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of tourists are shepherded through on a typical day, and
they have access to many rooms and corridors. The Capitol Police
are generally friendly, treating tourists as guests _ which, of
course, they are.
</P>
<P>
   Given the history of violence there, it may be surprising that
the building is as open as it is. &QL;

   July 2, 1915 _ The Senate reception room was damaged by the
explosion of a homemade bomb placed there by a young Cornell
University professor who was protesting arms sales by the United
States to countries that later became its allies in World War I.
After the explosion, additional officers were added to the small
Capitol Police Force.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 13, 1932 _ A young man entered the House gallery, drew a
loaded revolver and began waving it wildly, demanding time to
address the House. A member of the House approached the gunman and
talked him into dropping the gun. Police arrested the gunman
without a shot being fired.
</P>
<P>
   July 12, 1947 _ Sen. John Bricker, R-Ohio, was shot at twice as
he entered the Senate subway. Both shots missed. The gunman was a
former Capitol policeman who had lost money when an Ohio building
and loan firm was liquidated fifteen years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   March 1, 1954 _ A band of Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire
from the House visitors' gallery wounding five representatives. The
three assailants, and a fourth member of the group who was captured
later, received prison sentences. After the shooting, more police
were hired and, for a time, thought was given to enclosing the
galleries in bullet-resistant glass.
</P>
<P>
   March 1, 1971 _ In the pre-dawn hours, a bomb ripped through
part of the Senate wing of the Capitol, demolishing a restroom and
causing extensive damage to six other rooms. The radical Weather
Underground organization said it set off the bomb as an act of
retaliation for U.S. military activity in Cambodia. The actual
perpetrator was never found. In the aftermath, tighter security
measures were installed, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Guards at the entrances to the Capitol and Senate and House
office buildings would inspect briefcases, purses and packages of
all persons, including members of Congress. At 10 entrances, the
guards would be aided by X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ An electronic surveillance system was installed at strategic
points throughout the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Capitol Police Force was increased to 1,265 by 1990 from
622 in 1971. Police would patrol the buildings throughout the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7, 1983 _ Shortly before 11 p.m., a powerful device
exploded in a second-floor alcove about 30 feet from the Senate
chamber. There were no injuries or structural damage. In May 1988,
seven people describing themselves as a ``communist
politico-military organization'' were indicted for the bombing.
Three of the accused pleaded guilty on Sept. 7, 1990, clearing the
way for prosecutors to drop charges against the remaining
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol building security was again tightened.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visitor access was limited to four or six doors. Metal
detectors were installed at all entrances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lobbyists and tourists no longer were permitted in the
hallways immediately outside the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vehicle traffic and parking on the East Front lot were
restricted; delivery trucks were searched.
</P>
<P>
   _ Concrete barriers were erected at driveways and large trucks
were parked at entrances to the Capitol grounds.

 &HT;    Reeves concerned about conditioning
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It didn't take long to see the effects of multiple
practices as the Atlanta Falcons were somewhat ragged in the second
day of training camp Friday _ the first time the squad practiced
twice. In a two-hour, full-pads workout in the morning, the team
started out working in groups, including placekicking specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stryzinski was the chief holder for kickers Morten Andersen
and David Akers. Coach Dan Reeves paid special attention to this
group.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the team went for two hours in helmets,
shoulder pads and shorts, and at the beginning, instead of
placekicking, Reeves was watching Stryzinski and Akers punt.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of practice, Reeves put players through ``grass
drills,'' a condititioning exercise where they jog in place and hit
the ground, shuffle left, right, forward, and sometimes crawl
depending on the orders Reeves gives while standing atop a tractor
so he can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is concerned about conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things we try to emphasize because a lot of
times in the fourth quarter you're tired and you start feeling
sorry for yourself and you start making mistakes,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense has really looked good, and what made us a good
defense last year (second in the NFL in sacks, sixth in
interceptions, eighth against the run, 20th overall) has carried
over ... 11 guys hustling to the football.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons today will practice at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., both times
in full pads. Both sessions are open to the public at team
headquarters in Suwanee, off exit 44 on I-85 north. The team will
be off Sunday except for evening meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Turning down the heat
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two months of torturous heat in Atlanta, the
Falcons have been spared. At the start of the morning session, it
was 77 degrees and overcast with 87 percent humidity. There also
was a breeze. In the afternoon, it was a modest 88 degrees with 60
percent humidity under partly cloudy skies and again, there was a
breeze. Thursday, it was 93, but humidity was less than 50 percent,
and it was breezy.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the quarterback situation: Chris Chandler _ Got
most, if not all, reps with the No. 1 unit in all drills, including
some 9-on-9 and 11-on-11 work. In the afternoon, he fumbled one
snap from center Robbie Tobeck, but threw several exceptional
passes. Tony Graziani _ Worked at No. 2 all day, throwing high a
couple of times and getting intercepted a couple of times, once in
a goal-line drill by cornerback Lenny McGill in the end zone as he
threw a fade to rookie receiver Tim Dwight. Steve DeBerg _ Worked
at No. 3, and also as backup holder on placekicking drills. At one
time, while Chandler and Graziani were working passing drills,
DeBerg was working on the next field handing off as most of the
offense worked on the running game. Brian Brennan _ Pretty much the
same kind of day as DeBerg minus holding duties.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: On a screen pass to running back Byron Hanspard, reserve
guard Scott Adams (6-feet-6, 315 pounds) flattened linebacker Eddie
Sutter (6-3, 239) in the open field. ... Bad: Receiver Kevin
Thornal ran a nice flag route on the right sideline to beat McGill
in a passing drill, but when Chandler threw a nearly perfect
45-yard pass, it bounced off Thornal near the goal line. ... Ugly:
While the QBs were warming up in the afternoon, Graziani turned
away and got beaned in the head on a 20-yard toss _ ``Thwack!'' _
from Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to the love, fellas?'' _ Safety William White,
in the morning, when some defensive backs were jawing with
receivers during one of the earliest drills.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains

<P>
   Friday was more problematic than Thursday with cramping
especially being a problem. Several players had to be helped from
dinner, in fact, when their legs tightened up. Cornerbacks Randy
Fuller and Juran Bolden limped from the field after afternoon
practice with undisclosed injuries. Others: RB Harold Green
(sprained thumb), LB Cornelius Bennett (Achilles'), LB David
Brandon (foot) and DT Shane Dronett (foot). It was unclear if any
players would be held out today.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   At every lunch and dinner, the team has pasta, poultry and fish
options. At dinner, there also is a red-meat option, and a few
times a week that option is steak. On those days, the kitchen cooks
250 prime cut 14-16 oz. New York strips and filets.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding ``Big Nate''
</P>
<P>
   While the sudden departure Friday of second-year defensive
tackle Nathan Davis surprised nobody, starting left defensive end
Lester Archambeau was disappointed. ``I was hoping for him that his
(disastrous) first year would prove to be a learning experience,
and he would realize he was getting another chance,'' he said. ``I
think it's a shame anytime a man has a chance to play pro football
and he gives it up.'' By putting Davis on the ``reserve/left
squad'' list, the Falcons will not have to pay his $335,000 base
salary, but under the complicated rules of the salary cap the team
will gain a little more than $100,000 in cap money, leaving the
team nearly $2 million under it. The Falcons will be charged
$220,700 against the cap for the prorated portion of Davis' signing
bonus, and also for the $25,000 he picked up for an offseason
workout bonus. Backup left guard Adams said, ``As a guy who's been
making the NFL minimum most of his career, I sure would like some
of his money.'' Adams re-signed with the Falcons in the offseason
for $375,000 (a $100,000 raise), $50,000 more than the minimum. He
also got a $25,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Musical chairs
</P>
<P>
   After Davis walked off, defensive end Barry Mitchell moved from
defensive end to tackle for several rotations in the morning
practice, but that won't last. The 6-3, 273-pounder, who made last
year's practice squad as an undrafted rookie out of Idaho, is too
light to play inside. ... Bob Christian (5-11, 230) and rookie free
agent Darren Fisk (6-1, 230) are the only fullbacks on the roster,
but reserve running back Gary Downs (6-1, 216) and reserve tight
end Brian Kozlowski (6-3, 255) have been getting work there.
</P>
<P>
   Dog of the week
</P>
<P>
   Got to be ``Dino,'' the 4-year-old, 4-pound white miniature
Maltese that belongs to 6-4, 298-pound deep snapper Adam Schreiber.
Dino is staying with the 15-year veteran for a couple weeks. He can
be seen between practices bouncing around outside the Falcon Inn
motel, scouting for outhouses, if you catch the drift.

 &HT;    Gym Dogs visit with President
 &HT;    By Samar Abulhassan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Kim Arnold, finishing her last season as a
member of the undefeated national champion University of Georgia
gymnastics team was sweet enough. But Arnold, the NCAA national
gymnast of the year, says the grand finale came with
congratulations from President Bill Clinton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing made us feel very special,'' said the 21-year
old All-American senior, speaking on the White House north lawn
shortly after the Georgia team met with the president in the Oval
Office. ``This was the best way I could have ended my career as a
gymnast.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 14-member top-ranked squad took the NCAA championship
last April, they were invited to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Gym Dogs won the NCAA title by the largest margin in more
than 10 years. It is the first Georgia team to meet the president
since the 1990 national championship baseball team met
then-President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Suzanne Yoculan, who accompanied the team along with
assistant coach Doug McAvinn, said the invitation signified a
stepping stone for womens' sports. Jenni Beathard, national
champion on bars, said the president chatted with the team about
gymnastics, applauded their 35-0 season, and accepted a polo shirt
which he promised to wear during his next golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person we've met has been excited to see us,'' said the
21-year-old senior. ``We are the ones who are honored. We'll
remember this for a long time.''

DRIVER DROVE `ICE MON' TO SHOW WARMTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Bertha suffers a broken neck today. Or, at the very least,
she's banished to a dark spot in the back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the titanium driver in my golf bag with its persimmon
predecessor in my garage seems an appropriate way, on this somber
occasion, to honor a local sports legend. Heck, THE local sports
legend.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it has been exactly one year since Ben Hogan left the
earth, leaving a legacy of greatness that placed Fort Worth on the
global golf map.
</P>
<P>
   When fans stop today to reflect on Hogan's wondrous career, most
will conjure images from his 63 PGA Tour titles and nine major
championships. But I'll recall a broken driver in the bag room at
Shady Oaks Country Club that eventually led a couple of teen-agers
from west Fort Worth to develop a deep respect for a very private
man.
</P>
<P>
   It is a journey that began 20 years ago, with a lethal mix of
bad judgment, attempted humor and teen-age bravado. It began with a
single set of clubs waiting to be washed by a pair of golf shop
employees. One was me. The other was longtime friend Brann Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs, alas, belonged to Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   After washing them, Jeter did what came naturally to a Shady
Oaks bag boy intent on impressing a fellow 18-year-old with his
derring-do. He removed Hogan's driver, placed it across his knee
and pretended to apply pressure.
</P>
<P>
   I rolled my eyes, having used the same trick on countless
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never break it,'' I said, issuing a tongue-in-cheek
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he responded. ``But what if I just bent it a little?
He'd never notice.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, wiser heads would have laughed and walked away.
But we were cool. We were daring. We were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   We foolishly pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did you have in mind?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe two or three degrees,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not enough,'' I said, sneering. ``You'd have to get to
five degrees before anyone would notice.''
</P>
<P>
   We went back and forth, laughing the entire time, before
agreeing that a five-degree bend would be worth $10. Once again,
Jeter placed the driver across his knee and feigned pushing on the
respective ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There,'' he said, holding it aloft. ``That's five degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver remained pin straight. Both of us knew it. Having
done club repairs, we realized that any golfer _ especially Hogan _
would recognize the slightest bend of the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Our ongoing joke was nearing an uneventful conclusion. But I
couldn't resist getting in another dig. It proved to be a tragic
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't do anything. You've got to apply some pressure to
bend a golf club,'' I said, never dreaming that Jeter would try to
one-up me a final time.
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed the driver against his knee a third time. He
applied minimal pressure. And the stiff shaft snapped like a twig
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God!'' he said, eyes wide and body trembling. ``What
are we going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I replied, staring at the incriminating
evidence in his hands. ``We didn't just break Ben Hogan's driver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're part of this,'' he insisted. ``You're an accomplice.
You're as guilty as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, I knew he had me. So we did what most teen-agers
would do in a similar predicament. We cooked up a story and stuck
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, we related to head golf pro Art Hall, my buddy had
tripped while carrying Hogan's bag. The clubs tipped forward,
almost spilling. In an effort to regain his balance, Jeter grabbed
the head of the driver and snapped the shaft against the rim of the
bag. It was a freak accident but one that could be corroborated by
an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a pleasant man prone to high blood pressure, turned
absolutely crimson as he heard the tale. A chain smoker, he must
have polished off a carton of cigarettes while waiting for Hogan to
arrive at the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years I've been at Shady Oaks, and we've broken one
golf club. And it's Ben Hogan's $%&AMP; &LR; ! driver,'' he said, shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   But he bought the story. And he passed it along to Hogan, who
listened and nodded toward Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever let that red-headed boy touch another one of my
golf clubs,'' Hogan said, fuming.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a delivery truck from the Hogan factory arrived at
Shady Oaks. Its payload: one reshafted driver, which met with the
Hawk's approval.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, Jeter arranged to be in the cart barn, on
the practice range or otherwise occupied when the golf legend
arrived for his daily visit to the club. Others shagged balls for
Hogan and cleaned his clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, something very unusual happened. Hogan strolled through
the golf shop one day and noticed Jeter. He invited him to shag
balls. The two talked and cleared the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Hogan's way of saying, `This is behind us now,' ''
Jeter said. ``He was much cooler about it than I expected him to
be. After that, he was as cordial to me as if nothing had ever
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wee Ice Mon, it turns out, knew how to forgive and forget.
Even in the case of a couple of irresponsible teen-agers who have
grown to regret their transgression. But without the initial
mistake, there would have been no opportunity to glimpse a kinder,
gentler side of a local legend that few golf fans saw. A quiet,
decent man worthy of admiration and respect.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I got to see that. I'm sorry that more people never
realized that Ben Hogan, reclusive champion golfer, had a heart as
pure as his golf swing.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the rest of the world reflects today on favorite
memories of a champion golfer, I'll focus on repaying a
longstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bertha is headed to the sideline, with or without a broken
neck. I'm unsure of her ultimate punishment. In her place, however,
will be a persimmon model, just like the one I used to clean at
Shady Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   One that is solid but forgiving, just like its namesake. A Hogan
driver.

ANALYSIS: IN SUDAN, ONLY THE STARVING FAVOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Hunger has been a weapon of war since Homer's
time, but perhaps nowhere in modern history have starvation and
food supplies been so entwined with military tactics as in Sudan's
interminable civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in a decade, a famine is growing in the
southern part of the country, and the catastrophe is as much
man-made as natural. Almost everyone who has studied Sudan says
famines will continue until there is peace, but peace has proved
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: It is in no one's interest except the wretched and
politically impotent farmers who must watch their children die.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest indication of the scope of the famine, a
nutritional survey released Friday by Doctors Without Borders said
at least 120 people were dying every day within a three-mile radius
of Ajiep in the southwestern state of Bahr el Ghazal, one of the
hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said the mortality rate had skyrocketed in the last
10 days, to about seven deaths per 1,000 people each day from about
1.7 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the government nor the main rebel organization puts a
high priority on concerns like feeding the masses. Both are more
concerned with winning the 15-year-old war. Again and again they
have manipulated the U.N. relief operation to their own tactical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Islamic government in Khartoum, the Sudanese
capital, will not allow the United Nations to deliver food to the
rebel-held areas in the central Nuba Mountains but does allow
relief supplies to go to the towns and ``peace camps'' in that
region.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this policy is to draw hungry Nuba people away from
the rebel-held territories into the towns and camps, where they can
be easily controlled and pressed to convert to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In Bahr el Ghazal, where the current famine began, both sides
ignored the precarious situation of farmers earlier this year when
fighting suddenly resumed, sending more than 100,000 people
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   As 1998 opened, the people in Bahr el Ghazal had lived through
two bad droughts and poor harvests. Constant raids by Kerubino
Kuanyin Bol, a former rebel leader who was siding with the
government, kept many communities from planting at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Kerubino chose this year to switch sides again,
rejoin the rebellion and attack the government-held town of Wau.
</P>
<P>
   Kerubino's decision set off a wave of fighting that displaced
tens of thousands of people at a time when they should have been
preparing to plant before the March rains.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the government immediately imposed a
flight ban on all but four airstrips in the region for most of
February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Again the reason appeared to be tactical. Khartoum did not want
the United Nations shipping massive amounts of food into rebel-held
territories at a time when government troops were trying to hold on
to Wau and defeat Kerubino's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy international pressure, the government relented in
April and opened the region to air traffic, but government-backed
militias continued to raid farms in northern Bahr el Ghazal,
disrupting aid operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the rebel side, the massive airlift is a godsend. Like
everyone else, soldiers have to eat. The rebel's civilian arm
levies a ``tax'' on people within its territories, taking a portion
of the grain that the United Nations hands out after relief workers
leave, aid officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unclear how much grain ends up in the hands of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, some aid organizations, like
Doctors Without Borders, have estimated the amount to be as much as
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The taxation has continued despite the growing famine. That is
why well-fed rebel troops can be seen in the same villages where
displaced people are at death's door. In Nairobi, U.N. officials
from Operation Lifeline Sudan, as the airlift is known, have
objected strenuously to rebel leaders about the practice, but it
continues in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is the taxation,'' Michelle Quintaglie, a
spokeswoman for the World Food Program, acknowledged Friday.
``These people give a portion of their relief food to the
community. The amount they have been giving recently is far greater
than they had been giving before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the rebel food tax, the massive infusion of aid
helps the insurgents' military position, because their leaders do
not have to pay the political price for causing the people they
declare they are liberating to starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. is willing to ship 10,000 tons of food to the
front line, don't tell me that doesn't have an impact,'' said one
diplomat in Khartoum, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of stalemate, it is beginning to look as if the
war is unwinnable. Neither side appears to have the logistical
capability and resources to support a sustained offensive that
could prove decisive, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have proved unable to take and hold major towns like
Juba and Wau. The government has proved unable to rout the rebels
in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks have limped along in Nairobi, under the flawed aegis
of a regional association, several of which, like Uganda and
Ethiopia, actively support the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of talks is scheduled for next month, but the two
sides are far apart. The rebels continue to demand a secular
government and a united Sudan, something the Islamic government in
Khartoum cannot agree to without going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Khartoum's Islamic leaders have proved masterful at dividing the
rebellion. They have reached separate accords with several small
rebel factions and have successfully played rogue rebel commanders
off one another, creating insecurity and chaos in several crucial
regions.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side has found a knock-out blow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the war drags on, the United States and its allies in western
Europe have done relatively little to pressure the two sides to go
to the negotiating table, diplomats say. Indeed the secretary of
state, Madeleine Albright, met with rebel leaders in December and
openly expressed moral support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this is that peace does not necessarily suit U.S.
interests, aid officials said. U.S. foreign policy in the region
hinges on protecting the secular government in Egypt, the largest
recipient of U.S. aid, and containing Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the Moslem hard-liners in the National Islamic Front, who
control Khartoum's government, are seen as a direct menace to
Egypt's moderate government because they are sympathetic to the
fundamentalist terrorists there, notably the Islamic Brotherhood.
In short, the ongoing civil war in Sudan serves to weaken Khartoum
and strengthen Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A de-stable Sudan amounts to a stable Egypt,'' said a U.N.
official, insisting on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the rebels are hopelessly fractured along
tribal lines and have been unable to unite long enough to push the
government troops out.
</P>
<P>
   Their movement has also been made less effective by several
commanders who are little more than warlords and profiteers. These
men profess to be rebels but have switched sides several times and
appear to be more interested in reaping a profit from the war than
in winning it. They have little to gain from peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the rebellion's weakness that the SPLA began
in the 1980s as a communist revolt, when it was supported by the
then-Marxist government of Ethiopia, but it now professes to be
fighting for the principles of Jeffersonian democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as no surprise to most Africans since the rebels'
current backers _ Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea _ are all firm
allies of the United States, who receive U.S. military aid and, in
turn, give similar aid to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a grass-roots movement,'' said one aid official.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus is growing among aid officials that until the major
industrialized powers apply heavy pressure on both the rebels and
the government to come to terms, the tragedy of Sudan is doomed to
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the problem lies is that Western democratic governments
are using Operation Lifeline Sudan and humanitarian assistance as a
substitute for any real policy on Sudan,'' complained one U.N.
official in Nairobi, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``They should be seriously engaged at the highest political levels
to end the conflict.''

Mark Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. 
 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brokers are to stocks what Will Rogers was to people. Hardly
ever do brokers meet a stock they don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what the First Call Corp. discovered from its data base
of buy, hold and sell advice from brokerage firms. Using a
five-point scale in which 1 is a strong buy and 5 a strong sell,
the average recommendation for all stocks is a bullish 2.2. Fewer
than 1 percent of the recommendations that brokerages issue are
sells; only about one-third are holds. That means that roughly
two-thirds of all brokerage recommendations are buys.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is clear: Brokers won't tell you what or when to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   What to do instead? The best answer may be to decide now on a
strategy for selling stocks _ and then have the discipline to stick
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline is the key. The investor without it gets caught up in
bullish enthusiasm at each market top and second-guesses every sell
signal, like the guy on the beach who threatens to beat up anyone
who steps over the line he has drawn in the sand _ but, when
challenged, simply draws a new line.
</P>
<P>
   Such investors are always reacting to what already has happened,
selling stocks after they have disappointed and switching into
other stocks after they have rallied. Because these investors are
constantly buying high and selling low, they are likely to be among
the biggest casualties when the market decides to head south.
</P>
<P>
   The Hulbert Financial Digest has monitored the performance of
investment newsletters for 18 years, and their track records
highlight the importance of discipline. The clear lesson is that
almost any decent strategy will work, as long as it is followed
strictly over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, even the most theoretically flawless strategy
won't work if it is not followed with discipline. For almost any
strategy, there is at least one investment letter in the Hulbert
Financial Digest data base that has done well with it and another
that has done poorly.
</P>
<P>
   One example can be found in the newsletters that pursue the
so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy. The variant of this approach
that is most popular among newsletter editors calls for buying the
lowest-priced, highest-yielding stocks among the 30 companies in
the Dow Jones Industrial average each Jan. 1 and then holding these
stocks for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Following the strategy requires discipline, because it favors
stocks that already are down in the dumps _ stocks that often keep
languishing for a few months before turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Newsletters that followed the strategy last year with discipline
realized a creditable 23 percent return on their portfolios. One
that didn't _ BI Research, edited by Tom Bishop _ returned just 8
percent. Four months into the year, AT&AMP;T, one of the Dow dogs of
1997, was off 15 percent. Bishop acknowledged in his newsletter
that a purist would continue to hold AT&AMP;T, but nevertheless wrote
that he was kicking it out of his portfolio and replacing it with
Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's Law immediately kicked in: Exxon far underperformed
AT&AMP;T through the end of the year, gaining about 8 percent, compared
with 83 percent for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Newsletter editors aren't alone in their lapsed discipline.
Terrence Odean, a professor of finance at the University of
California at Davis, recently documented that Bishop's experience
was the norm among individual investors, too.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing trading records for 10,000 accounts at a large
discount brokerage firm, he found that the stocks sold by investors
did 3.2 percent better, on average, over the next year than the
stocks they chose as replacements.
</P>
<P>
   On average, investors would make 3.2 percent more per year _ not
to mention saving the cost of trading commissions _ if they held on
to the stocks they wanted to dump and refrained from buying the
ones they were so sure were better bets.
</P>
<P>
   Why is investment discipline so rare a virtue? Because losses
exact an intense psychological toll.
</P>
<P>
   An experience of the Value Line Investment Survey makes the
point. Value Line's ranking system has such an impressive long-term
record that even skeptical academics have conceded that it beats
the market. One would think that this record would earn Value Line
a little slack in the face of short-term underperformance, but not
so.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of 1992, its system stopped working:
its least-favored stocks were outperforming its most-favored ones.
Value Line received a lot of bad press and came under great
pressure to tinker with its stock-picking model.
</P>
<P>
   As Samuel Eisenstadt, its research director, recounts the
episode, the company chose to resist that pressure _ and was amply
rewarded. By the end of 1992, its top-ranked stocks had roared
back, more than erasing losses incurred during the first half of
the year. Caving in to the pressure at midyear might have made life
easier for Value Line, but it would have been costly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discipline, investors may also need advisers who
don't have an aversion to the ``S'' word. A top-performing
investment letter might fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Editors of newsletters have less of an aversion to offering
``sell'' advice than most other players in the investment advisory
arena. Most of the newsletters monitored by the Hulbert Financial
Digest recommend selling stocks as often as buying them.
</P>
<P>
   But remember: Even the best advice is little help without the
discipline to follow it over the long haul. &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. basketball team grows up quickly
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Goodwill Games journey that began with so little
promise for the fledging U.S. team has instead emptied into Friday
night's gold-medal basketball game. They grow up so quickly in the
big city.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's semifinal was a stressless 89-76 victory over
Lithuania for the U.S. collegians, who met Australia for Goodwill
gold. Earlier Thursday, the Aussies disposed of Puerto Rico 86-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what to do to bury this team (Lithuania). That's how
far we've come. Sunday (in losing to Puerto Rico), we didn't know
how to bury a team,'' said Mississippi guard Keith Carter, whose 12
points, all in the second half, threw several shovels of dirt on
the Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. built a 16-point lead at the half behind the
inside-outside combination of Georgia's Jumaine Jones (nine points)
and Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak (13 points, 3-of-5 from beyond
the arc).
</P>
<P>
   It grew to as much as 25 points in the second half before the
Lithuanians did some cosmetic work on the scoreboard late in the
game. Szczerbiak, who grew up in nearby Long Island, led the
Americans with 20 points, followed by 15 from Duke's Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   That opening loss to Puerto Rico, in which the U.S. gave up a
19-point second-half lead, seems another lifetime. Since, they have
shown steady improvement, with a 15-point victory over China, a
31-point victory over Brazil and the never-any-doubt job against
the Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud and very excited to be playing for the gold,''
said U.S. coach Clem Haskins. ``After Sunday, we were a little
down. But these guys have bounced back and are playing some
outstanding basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   For the gold, they had to cope with another experienced,
physical opponent. But, warned Donn Nelson, an assistant coach for
the Lithuanians, ``Now that they're (the U.S.) coming together at
the right time, they're going to be tough to beat.''

 &HT;    Dams pose a problem for Texas
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Substandard dams pose a growing threat to people
and property in Texas, and the state's inspection program to keep
track of the problem is woefully inadequate, according to a task
force appointed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without public pressure to improve conditions, it is only a
matter of time before dam failures will begin to take their toll on
life and property on a more frequent basis,'' a report issed this
month by the task force concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-member task force, whose members included city officials,
dam owners, engineers and others, called for sweeping changes in
state policy. Among the recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   -- Beef up the state's dam-safety team, which now numbers six
people, compared with 45 about 20 years ago. The team currently
inspects only about 2 percent of the roughly 7,200 dams in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   -- Grant soil and water districts authority to impose taxes,
impact fees and capital development fees to finance improvement of
dams for which the districts are responsible.
</P>
<P>
   -- Require dam owners to prepare emergency-response plans for
all dams in populated areas. Such plans identify areas that would
be in danger if a dam collapsed, as well as evacuation routes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Modify state regulations to give owners of substandard dams
options short of fortifying dams to withstand worst-case flooding.
For example, owners could adopt a combination of risk-reduction
measures, such as lowering the level of the reservoir or lake
formed by the dam, installing an early-warning system and stepping
up inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Few dams in Texas are in imminent danger of collapsing. And most
large dams are in good shape or scheduled for improvements. But
more than 300 dams, primarily small and medium-sized structures,
could collapse in unusually severe floods, unleashing deadly waves
onto downstream houses, shopping strips, schools and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous substandard dams are located in Central Texas,
including more than a dozen on Brushy Creek and its tributaries in
Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Austin American-Statesman identified the
substandard dams and the shortcomings of the state's inspection
program. The conservation commission subsequently formed the task
force, and House Speaker Pete Laney ordered a separate review by a
special subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The task force report has been given to the subcommittee. The
conservation commission is also reviewing the report and plans to
issue its own recommendations, said Jeffrey Saitas, executive
director. The subcommittee is expected to issue recommendations
later this year for lawmakers to consider during the next
legislative session, which opens in January.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, which spent a year preparing its report,
concluded that the dam-safety team is so short-handed that it
cannot perform basic duties. For example, dams in populated areas
are inspected once every 15 to 30 years. The federal government and
most independent experts recommend once every five years.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also found regulatory gaps. Smaller dams that
form detention ponds for stormwater runoff must meet state safety
standards, but construction plans for such dams do not have to be
filed with the conservation commission.
</P>
<P>
   Public and private owners of dams, including individuals,
property associations, hunting clubs, water districts and counties,
frequently lack the money to upgrade. Improvements can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, for each dam.
</P>
<P>
   Besides recommending that soil and water districts be granted
taxing and fee authority, the task force made no finding on how
money for other dams should be raised. It said lawmakers might want
to grant the conservation commission the power to charge fees to
help finance a larger inspection staff.

 &HT;    Morales delivers agreement, ending tobacco lawsuit negotiations
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas tobacco war officially ended Friday
when U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana signed off on
final compromises involving the state, the tobacco industry,
counties and the state's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales, who filed the suit in March 1996
amid general indifference from other state officials, held a press
conference Friday to underline its end. He called the settlement
``a tremendous victory for the state and an unprecedented
opportunity to promote public health in our state, particularly the
health of our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit sought compensation for smoking-related health care
costs incurred by poor Texans and covered by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said that although Gov. George W. Bush and the
Legislature had not expressed much interest in the anti-tobacco
suit when he filed it, ``I do think that they're willing to accept
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will trigger a flow of $17.3 billion to the
state, counties and hospital districts over the next 25 years. The
issue of how much the industry must pay the state's private lawyers
who were hired to handle the suit was turned over to an arbitration
panel that will meet in November.
</P>
<P>
   The first payment of almost $400 million should be paid to the
state within a month, Morales said, with a total of $1.3 billion to
be paid this year.
</P>
<P>
   The final settlement of $17.3 billion includes $15 billion,
which the Legislature will decide how to spend. Originally, the
state was to get $15.3 billion, but the state gave up about $300
million of that to secure an additional settlement of $2.3 billion
for counties and hospital districts, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.3 billion will go directly to counties and health
districts for indigent health care, with the first payments in
January. That first payment will include $10 million to Travis
County, $2.5 million to Williamson County, $1.1 million to Hays
County and $675,000 to Bastrop County, state figures showed.
</P>
<P>
   Morales announced the settlement in January, but it quickly
bogged down in legal skirmishing. Some critics, especially Bush,
argued that the lawyers should not get the $2.3 billion they said
they were owed under their contract with the state. And the
original settlement did not satisfy the claims of the counties and
health districts, although the tobacco industry maintained it
covered them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, however, got a break: After Texas reached agreement
with the tobacco industry, Minnesota settled its lawsuit on even
more favorable terms, triggering the ``most favored nation'' clause
in the Texas settlement. That clause said that the industry would
pay Texas more if other states later got better terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota settlement generated an additional $2.3 billion
for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By committing that money to the counties and health districts,
their claims were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry said Friday that the revised settlement
terminates the most favored nation clause.
</P>
<P>
   As for the private lawyers, a spokesman, Tom Banning, said
Friday only that they ``look forward to presenting our case to the
arbitration panel in November.''
</P>
<P>
   If the lawyers don't get as much money from the tobacco industry
as they think they should, they can go back to court to enforce
their contract with the state, under which they would be paid $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even a group that was highly critical of the lawyers'
claims, Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees, said it was ``unlikely''
that the state would have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the governor, Linda Edwards, said he was
pleased that Texas will soon start getting its money and that the
issue of attorney fees had been separated from the settlement.

GLOBAL JOINT VENTURE AT HAND FOR AT&AMP;T 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to significantly expand its presence outside the United
States, the AT&AMP;T Corp. is close to an agreement with British
Telecommunications PLC to form a joint venture serving
multinational business customers, executives close to the
negotiations said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The venture could be announced as early as Sunday, executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership between AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance
carrier, and British Telecom, Britain's biggest communications
company, would perhaps be the foremost international
telecommunications venture. Demand for advanced communications
services is growing even faster overseas than it is in the United
States, according to many analysts, and big businesses are the most
lucrative segment of the international market.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, an agreement with British Telecom would represent
another piece of the puzzle that C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman, is putting together as he tries to reinvent AT&AMP;T as a
powerful yet nimble player in the highly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement were unclear Friday, but the executives
close to the talks said that the two companies could be expected to
devote significant resources to a new business that could generate
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a new strategy for AT&AMP;T, which has seen its
efforts to expand internationally largely founder in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem has been that the company has generally
shied away from investing significant sums to ensure lasting
relationships with its foreign affiliates. Rather, AT&AMP;T has formed
loose agreements to cooperate with more than a dozen foreign
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of that path became clear in April 1997 when
Telefonica de Espana SA, the largest communications provider in
Latin America, defected from an AT&AMP;T alliance to join a group that
was then led by British Telecom and the MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecom and MCI had agreed to merge and form a new
multinational communications giant called Concert, though that deal
later fell apart and MCI agreed to be acquired by Worldcom Inc.
instead.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Fernando Panizo, chief operating officer of one of
Telefonica's main subsidiaries, said, ``The commitment of AT&AMP;T to
new investment has not been as strong as BT-MCI.''
</P>
<P>
   After MCI agreed to be acquired by Worldcom, Telefonica chose to
work with those two companies instead of with British Telecom.
Sprint Corp., the No. 3 long-distance carrier in the United States,
is partly owned by Deutsche Telekom, Germany's dominant
communications company, and France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   That left British Telecom with dozens of international partners
but no fast friends in the United States at the same time that AT&AMP;T
was looking to revamp its overseas agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And Armstrong, who took over as AT&AMP;T's chairman last fall after
running Hughes Electronics, has demonstrated that he is not afraid
to move swiftly when he perceives opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he took the job, Armstrong agreed with outside
analysts that two of the main areas he needed to focus on were
expansion in the local communications market and expansion
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has committed the company to spending more than $40
billion to shore up those areas.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AT&AMP;T announced that it had agreed to acquire
Teleport Communications Group Inc., a new local phone company, for
$11.3 billion. That deal was AT&AMP;T's main bid to get into the local
communications market for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company announced an agreement to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's No. 2 cable television
company, for $31.8 billion in an attempt to buy local line access
to millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and British Telecom declined to comment, but in an
interview two days after the TCI deal was announced, Armstrong said
he was turning his attention to the international arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of buying a PTT or two,'' he said, using
telecommunications jargon for big foreign communications carriers.
``If that's the qualification for boldness, I'll disappoint you. On
the other hand, I think that we will announce something that indeed
satisfies that we have really a strong international global
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the telecommunications industry, a strong global strategy
generally requires a strong business serving multinational
corporations. International consumer calling continues to rise, but
big corporate customers are largely driving the consolidation of
the telecommunications industry with demands for advanced data
services that offer higher profit margins than everyday phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In today's business world, a top-notch communications system can
provide companies a strategic advantage over their less-advanced
competitors; big multinational companies demand seamless global
communications. And seamless communications can be provided only by
telecommunications carriers with presence in major markets around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   So for British Telecom, an alliance with AT&AMP;T could represent a
recovery from its aborted merger with MCI, AT&AMP;T's archrival.
Forging a deal with AT&AMP;T, with its vast financial and technical
resources, would give British Telecom unparalleled access to U.S.
market, the world's richest.
</P>
<P>
   And British Telecom would still have the means to make another
big move. When Worldcom completes its acquisition of MCI, British
Telecom will receive more than $7 billion in cash for its 20
percent stake in MCI.

IT'S THE THREE STOOGES, ALL OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a great trifecta for Toronto. Talk about the Three Stooges
making a comeback. Mo Money, the Texas Con Man, and Wrong Way Jose
all under one roof in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Con Man went north two years ago because he wanted to
play for ``a winner.'' Wrong Way Jose left a little while later,
wanting to be with a winner, in Oakland. Mo Money said a year ago
that he wanted the Red Sox to spend more money on better players so
he could be with ``a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly they forget about winning. Amazing, isn't it, how
these players forget about the talk and take a walk right to the
money?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens left Boston, had a phenomenal year in Toronto in
'97, and said the reason was better fielding behind him. Of course,
it had nothing to do with the extra 30 pounds he was lugging around
in Boston that he shed in Toronto. And the message also was that
the guys he left behind in Red Sox uniforms, his former teammates,
couldn't field a lick.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mo Vaughn talks about being comfortable in Toronto with his
former mates and another manager after he becomes a free agent at
the end of the 1998 season. This leads us to believe he is not
comfortable with his present teammates and manager.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco? He pulled a Mo Money when the Florida Marlins came
to Toronto earlier this year. Jose lives in Florida and sent the
message back home that he would love to finish his career with the
Marlins. So much for winning.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the owners of the Blue Jays can't wait to open their
wallets for Mo Money. The Blue Jays lost $34 million a year ago
when they added the Texas Con Man to help boost their sagging
attendance. He won the Cy Young Award, and no one cared. When he
pitched, they averaged about 500 more fans a game, clawing and
scratching their way to the empty seats in SkyDome to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what. This year's class of Red Sox defectors has Toronto
fans staying away in record numbers from SkyDome, where the Jays
are on course to draw 100,000 fewer fans than they did a year ago.
Do you think the Toronto owners want to shell out another $10
million (American) to have Mo Money join Clemens and Canseco in
baseball's version of welfare?
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Con Man was right when he told Mo that heading north
could add four or five years to his baseball life. In Toronto, you
can lose all you want, get paid big money, and no one cares.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what someone perhaps should have explained to Mo. In
Canada, the dollar is worth only about 75 percent of the US dollar.
So before the season starts, the Jays have to take in about $15
million extra just to break even, because almost all their payroll
is in American money.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Blue Jays' history will tell you that the
great fans up there were turned off by the baseball strike of 1994
and decided not to come back in record numbers. Falling attendance,
the conversion rate on the dollar, and bad teams have the
organization taking an annual bath financially, with no apparent
way out. But perhaps, because Mo is such a great leader of men,
they would like him to join the rest of the conscientious objectors
and add another $10 million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the phone was ringing off the hook at Fenway Park,
with fans delivering a strong message to get Mo Money out of town
immediately, the Red Sox will not. Unless.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan is still to try to win the American League
pennant. As long as Mo keeps playing well and doesn't become a
major distraction to the team, they will not trade him. This was
decided before the season and it will not change, unless the team
starts to fall out of playoff contention and some other team is
willing to part with something for Mo.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, the Sox will not be snookered the way
they were by the Texas Con Man, who claimed all along that he
wanted to come back to Boston. Remember when Clemens said on the
record that if he left Boston, he could never go to another
American League team because he would not want to play in Fenway
Park against the Red Sox? Of course, that was before Toronto showed
him the money. The Red Sox made the mistake of waiting for him to
make a decision in 1996; meanwhile, other free agents were being
signed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This year Mo will be given a take-it-or-leave-it offer as soon
as the season is over and have a short period of time to decide. As
soon as he makes it official _ as if he hasn't already with his
comments _ that he wants to leave, the Red Sox will take the $10
million they offered him and spend it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To this humble scribe, the most interesting part of Mo's
comments to Toronto writer Mike Zeisberger was not that the Blue
Jays are his first choice but this: ``It's a situation where you
would take a good deal and try not to break the bank. It's not
something where you try to set a new (salary) standard.''

   Last fall, the Red Sox offered Mo Money $30 million over three
years. Not enough. In spring training, they offered him $22 million
for two years, or $11 million a year. Not enough. At the All-Star
break, they offered him $37 million over four years. Not enough.
Evidently, he doesn't feel any of those offers are what he would
consider a ``good deal.''

   The FleetCenter, just two years old, will be getting a facelift
in the near future. ``I still haven't figured out for sure how we
are going to do it, but it will be part of the new development,''
says Bruins owner Jerry Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   When the demolition of Boston Garden is completed, Jacobs says
the next phase of the project will be to open the side of the
building facing Causeway Street to enlarge the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we have to do this,'' says Jacobs, ``and the
project would be moving along faster if I would sit down and decide
what I want done there. That is up to me, and it is something I
should start to get to work on. We defenitely need more space. We
have to create more room for our lobbies and corridors. We were
confined when we built the building, but now with the old Boston
Garden down, we have a chance to add more space to the new
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs says the project will be complicated because he also has
to factor in what space will be left for the rest of the
development, which is supposed to include a hotel plus office and
retail space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do something that is upbeat and that will blend
with the future of the area,'' he says. ``Boston's economy is
vibrant. What they are doing in town with the Big Dig and the rest
of it will be fantastic. We have to look at our business a little
differently. We have to take a look at what they are doing in other
parts of the country with theme restaurants and what we think will
serve our customer best. The building has been successful _ in
fact, in several ways, more successful than we thought it would be
at this point in time. What we have learned in the last couple of
years is that you have to keep on producing teams that people want
to watch.''

   ``There were guys that bet againt us,'' said Walker, referring
to the gambling scandal at Boston College in 1996, his next-to-last
season, ``and guys who just bet on things like the World Series.
There was so much backbiting. We didn't know who to believe. The
team was so factioned out. You didn't even trust guys who block for
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were racial things. The team basically was divided.
There was a lot of stealing going on in the locker room. I had
never locked my locker because I didn't even know the combination.
It was a miserable time. You didn't want to talk with anyone. There
were all these things going on, and (Tom) O'Brien (who replaced Dan
Henning as coach last year) comes into this tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he had a fun year as a senior with O'Brien. ``It
wasn't draining and depressing like the year before,'' he said.
``We didn't win (4-7) but we were surrounded by good people.''

   Here is how the NFL intends to turn the new Cleveland Browns
into the most expensive team in sports history. Goldman Sachs of
New York, which once tried to sell the Patriots, has been employed
by the league to handle the bidding. Goldman Sachs will go to the
list of bidders _ at least a half-dozen on record and maybe more _
and ask for an initial offer. Then it will take the highest bid and
revisit the rest of the field, one by one, seeing who wants to top
it and dropping those who don't. It will go back and forth with
``managed bids'' until there is just one left _ the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Some think former Cleveland resident George Steinbrenner, owner
of the Yankees, could sell his baseball team once he sees what the
Browns are worth. Reportedly, one estimate is that the Yankees
could pull in $725 million if Steinbrenner decides to sell in the
current market.

TENSIONS RISE AS GM MOVES TO REOPEN A KENTUCKY PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Ind., Ky., Mich., Ohio, Tenn.)  (js) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ General Motors and the United Automobile Workers
union moved on Friday toward a confrontation in Kentucky even as
lawyers for both sides continued to argue before an arbitrator over
the legality of strikes at two GM parts factories here.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced earlier this week that it would use replacement
parts from factories elsewhere to reopen its Chevrolet Corvette
factory in Bowling Green, Ky., and a sport utility vehicle factory
in Silao, Mexico. Both assembly plants have been closed for more
than a month, along with virtually all other GM assembly plants in
North America, for lack of parts from the struck factories here.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to settle the strikes here have been complicated by
disputes popping up at a growing number of GM factories. Workers
are also threatening strikes at car assembly plants here and in
Tennessee and at parts factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues,
said in an interview on Friday that when workers show up at the
Corvette factory on Monday, they will probably object to the use of
replacement parts. When GM tried two weeks ago to reopen an engine
factory in Romulus, Mich., workers threw replacement spark plugs
from Japan on the floor and refused to use them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call workers back to the Bowling Green plant, they'll
have the same problems finding them cooperative that they've had
elsewhere,'' Shoemaker said, adding that GM had ended up asking the
Romulus workers to assemble other engines that did not require
replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   But Shoemaker said that though the local union leadership at the
Corvette factory had asked the national UAW leadership for
permission to call a strike, that permission had not been given.
The national leadership wants to watch the arbitration process here
and GM's other actions over the coming days before making a
decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful we can find a way to resolve all this without
resorting to that,'' Shoemaker added. If the national leadership
decides in favor of another strike, it will be required to give
five days' notice to GM.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman, said earlier on Friday that GM
still planned to reopen the Corvette factory on Monday. GM
officials did not return calls for further comment on Friday night
after Shoemaker spoke.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette factory is the only GM assembly plant in the United
States where the UAW has not reached a local labor agreement with
the auto maker since the last national agreement was concluded in
1996. That lack of an agreement would make it easier for the UAW to
call a walkout there.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's national leadership is often wary of granting
permission for local strikes, because once a strike begins, its
duration is partly determined by the local union leaders, who share
negotiating responsibilities with the national leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Corvette factory accounts for less than 1 percent of GM's
North American production, while the Mexican factory is somewhat
larger. The Kentucky factory produced just 2,768 Corvettes in May,
while a full-size GM assembly plant produces about 20,000 vehicles
a month. Of the company's 29 assembly plants, the only one still in
full production is the giant Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn.,
which is already using replacement parts, notably spark plugs from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn factory has a highly independent local union and a
strong tradition of working with management to preserve sales and
market share. The local union there has objected to the outside
parts, and workers authorized their leaders to call a strike if
negotiations failed on such other issues as Saturn's growing use of
parts made in other GM factories and by outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In Flint, both sides have been somewhat hopeful that they can
reach a settlement at the bargaining table after the arbitrator,
Thomas Roberts, reaches his decision. Lawyers for the company and
the union made opening statements before Roberts on Wednesday. GM
then presented its case on Thursday and Friday morning that the
strikes here violate the union's national agreement with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The union began presenting its case Friday afternoon and is
expected to continue doing so on Saturday. Roberts is allowed up to
30 days to deliver his decision, but he is expected to issue a
ruling quickly, perhaps next week, because of the strike's huge
cost to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   GM's national labor agreement with the UAW allows only
factory-level strikes over issues of health and safety,
productivity standards and subcontracting. The company contends
that the union made up such grievances at the factories here as an
excuse for strikes, and then began using the local strikes to
demand that the company invest more money here, which is not a
legitimate strike issue. The union contends that GM has bargained
over investments during many previous local strikes, so that the
national contract should be interpreted as allowing factory strikes
in which investments are among the issues.

   WASHINGTON _ A lone gunman shot his way into the Capitol Friday,
killing two policemen and scattering terrified tourists who hid
behind statues and fled down historic corridors in the world's
best-known symbol of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old female bystander was seriously injured with
gunshot wounds in the face and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Identified by Washington police as Russell E. Weston, the gunman
was said to be in stable condition at a Washington hospital with
multiple gunshot wounds in his chest and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said he was known to the U.S. Secret
Service because of reported threats to President Clinton two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The slain policemen were Jacob Chestnut, a uniformed member of
the Capitol police force assigned to the door through which Weston
allegedly entered, and John Gibson, a security specialist assigned
to House Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The woman bystander was identified by officials at George
Washington University Medical Center as Angela Dickerson,
apparently a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who had been briefed on the incident by
police said Weston had parked his car several blocks from the
Capitol, walked to a front entrance and walked around a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   When Officer Chestnut attempted to stop him, Weston turned and
shot him, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then went a few feet further into the Capitol where
he was confronted by Gibson. Seconds later, members of DeLay's
staff said they could hear the exchange of shots between Gibson and
Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William H. Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon, rushed to the
Capitol after seeing a television report on the shootings and began
giving victims first aid.
</P>
<P>
   He then accompanied the ambulance that transported Weston to a
Washington, D.C. General Hospital, helping paramedics resuscitate
the gunman, who had been shot three times.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was said to be in surgery. His condition was described as
``stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the shooting, Frist had presided over the Senate
and recessed it for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The House had finished its business for the day and was in a
period traditionally reserved for members to make one-minute
speeches on topics of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the staff of Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the
explosion of gunfire outside Boehner's Capitol hideaway office
echoed through the marble corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holt, a Boehner staffer, described hearing, ``Bang! Bang!
Bang! Scream!''
</P>
<P>
   Members of DeLay's staff said after the first gunfire, Gibson
pushed them into the office and closed the door before turning to
confront the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists who had been making their way through the statue- and
portrait-lined corridor, screamed and scrambled for exits.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he crouched behind a pillar and called to members
of his family, trying to determine if they were all right.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders deplored the tragedy in the Capitol,
traditionally known as ``the People's House'' and Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., canceled a weekend trip to Florida.

SANDERS MAKES DEBUT AT COWBOYS PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders
practiced at training camp yesterday for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has been sidelined since having arthroscopic
surgery on his left ankle May 29, worked out in the afternoon
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' presence was attention-grabbing. The most notable
sighting was a hit he put on running back Emmitt Smith although the
practice was without pads. After Smith broke outside on a running
play, the normally tackle-shy Sanders met him chest-to-chest,
knocking Smith back and startling the crowd, which cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders declined to comment on his return.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates and coaches, however, said they are glad to see
him back, including Smith, who offered a word of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see him out there,'' Smith said. ``But if he
keeps doing that, he'll be out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who hopes to deploy Sanders as a
receiver, said it will be three weeks before Sanders starts working
with the offense. &QL; 
IRVIN IN THE BACKFIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys continue to install the offense, new wrinkles are
being revealed daily. Yesterday, it was receiver Michael Irvin
catching a screen pass out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   The wrinkle partly shows how Gailey plans to free Irvin from the
numerous double-teams he faced last season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said he is used to catching the ball downfield but doesn't
mind the tricks, if they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like any new wrinkle that doesn't put the pressure on a team
to find a big-time receiver,'' Irvin said. ``The pressure is on
Chan. He's the man. It puts the pressure on him to move me around
and create mismatches not only with me but with other receivers,
and that's a great situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said he was ``loving it'' until ``I saw big Leon Lett out
there. If it had been a real game I might have been in trouble.'' &QL; 
HARPER TO BE EVALUATED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys receiver Alvin Harper, cut yesterday by Saints
coach Mike Ditka, could get a look from the Cowboys, team vice
president Stephen Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The team will evaluate the eight-year pro as they do all free
agents and decide whether he can help the team, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Making the prospect more intriguing is that Harper stated more
than one once the past few years that he wants to return to the
Cowboys, who have sought a No. 2 receiver to complement Irvin since
Harper left after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were Harper's third team in the past two years. He
was with the Buccaneers in 1995-96. He played with the Saints and
Redskins last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka, upset that Harper missed minicamps and didn't show up for
off-season work, cut him before the team had its first practice of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin is a good guy,'' Ditka said. ``I don't have time to hold
his hand.'' &QL; 
EMMITT RETURNS TO PRACTICE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith was back in his familiar role taking
snaps with the first-team offense after missing practice Thursday
because of fluid on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said an errant kick to the leg last week probably caused
the swelling. He said there was some swelling yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got the (magnetic resonance imaging exam), there was no
concern,'' Smith said. ``I wanted to know why it was swelling. It's
probably because last week I got kicked in the upper shin area. It
was swelling, and it probably moved up to my knee.'' &QL; 
MURPHY MARTIN RETIRES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murphy Martin, the Cowboys' longtime public-address announcer at
Texas Stadium, has decided to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will be replaced by George Dunham, co-host of the Dunham
and Miller morning show on KTCK/1310 AM.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will honor Martin before the regular-season opener
against Arizona on Sept. 6.

AUTHORITIES SEEK N.H. RAPE SUSPECT IN THE NETHERLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police in Manchester, N.H., sought warrants Friday for the
arrest of convicted rapist and New Hampshire fugitive Steven B.
Gordon after he admitted to a police detective Thursday that he
raped a Nashua, N.H. realty agent and two Irish women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did confess,'' Manchester detective Dan Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who police believe is still hiding in Amsterdam, made a
pre-arranged phone call to Brennan at the suburban Boston home of
his mother, who has been in regular contact with her son since he
fled New England last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, Amsterdam investigators, and at least four New England
police departments are trying to find Gordon, who is also suspected
in a series of Massachusetts robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified Gordon as a suspect in the rapes of the Irish
women in Portsmouth, N.H. July 18 through paperwork he filled out
to rent a car.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-minute phone conversation with Brennan, Gordon sounded
confused and discussed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But detectives hope to find him soon. ``It's a matter of time,''
Brennan said. ``He is running out of money, he doesn't have a place
to stay, he hasn't slept, he hasn't eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, posing as a home buyer, allegedly raped a realty agent
he asked to show him a house for sale on July 7. After the alleged
rape, he forced the realty agent to drive him to Nashua; Brennan
said he will face kidnapping charges in addition to the rape
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan said Gordon provided details that police believe only
the man who raped the realty agent would know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good evidence, but you still need to put together a
case,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   A police source said that a black pellet handgun Gordon's mother
allowed the Globe to photograph on Thursday does not appear to be
the weapon used in the rape of the realty agent.
</P>
<P>
   However, police believe Gordon did use a pellet gun in that
rape, and the source said the gun that was in his mother's
possession closely resembles the weapon the victim described to
police.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's reported confession to police Thursday came one day
after a man who said he was Gordon confessed to a Globe reporter
that he committed all three rapes. Gordon said he felt out of
control, regreted his actions, and neglected to take medication he
said was prescribed for mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also said he committed several armed robberies after he
raped the realty agent on July 7, including a Marriott Hotel in
Burlington, Mass., a Holiday Inn in Lexington, Mass., and a
D'Angelo's sandwich shop. There were robberies at those businesses
that night, and now police are investigating whether Gordon
committed them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other details of what appears to be a 2 1/2-week
crime spree by Gordon are beginning to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in Superior Court in New Hampshire by Gordon's
probation officer show that Gordon violated his probation to travel
to Las Vegas, Nev. from July 1 to July 5. Police are now
investigating whether Gordon may have committed crimes there.
</P>
<P>
   Records also show that Gordon flew from Logan International
Airport last July 19 to New York, where he is believed to have
boarded a plane to Amsterdam.

   WASHINGTON _ He wore khaki pants and a green fedora hat with a
feather, witnesses said, as any tourist might. But he was armed
with a six-shot Smith &AMP; Wesson .38-caliber revolver, and almost as
soon as he traded the July heat for the cool of the Capitol, he
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and authorities described a sudden and shocking burst
of shots after officer Jacob Chestnut asked Russell Eugene Weston
Jr. to pass through a metal detector, like every other visitor.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists screamed and stampeded, Weston left Chestnut
mortally wounded on the floor. His path into the Capitol was
blocked by other officers, so he turned left toward a door marked
private that opens onto the ``rabbit warren,'' as insiders call the
maze of offices belonging to Tom DeLay, the House majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the door Special Agent John Gibson was shouting at staff
to hit the floor. Witnesses and authorities offered conflicting
versions of what came next. What is clear is that Gibson and Weston
traded shots that cut each other down, but not before Weston
reached the first office of DeLay's extensive suite.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later some 10 officers surrounded Weston, their guns
trained at his head, said two of DeLay's aides. The office carpet
was soaked in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the echoing marble hallways of the Capitol's first
floor, the visitors' blend of boredom, curiosity and awe had turned
to bedlam as shell casings scattered across the stone floor, and
officers shouted at them to get out. In the fusillade, one
bystander, Angela Dickerson, was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors took refuge behind pillars; others simply crouched
where they stood. As his wife dove to the floor, one man covered
her with his own body, while a young woman lost a sandal in her
scramble for a revolving door _ which turned out to be jammed by a
boy's backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from England, said that he
bent over a wounded police officer _ it must have been Chestnut _
feeling for his pulse as the officer muttered words he could not
make out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled, get a stretcher,'' said Beamish, whose khaki pants
were stained with blood. ``There was blood coming from his head,
and one eye looked as if it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone had had the presence of mind to summon Sen. Bill Frist
of Tennessee off the floor of the Senate. The senator, a heart
surgeon, checked the pulse of one of the wounded, then helped
resuscitate Weston and rode with him to the hospital.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ A gunman with a history of Secret Service
investigation burst into the Capitol building on Friday afternoon
and killed two policemen in a corridor shootout that left a tourist
and the gunman lying wounded as terrified bystanders darted for
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Without uttering a word, the intruder stormed past a weapons
detector at an East Front entrance and immediately opened fire,
mortally wounding a policeman on guard duty and setting off a gun
battle by the office suite of Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican
majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   As the first officer, Jacob Chestnut, lay dying, DeLay's
plainclothes guard, Special Agent John Gibson, drew his weapon and
intercepted the intruder a short distance into the building. As
screams and gunfire reverberated through the halls of power, Gibson
suffered mortal wounds before the gunman was brought down in a
burst of a score or more bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone to come in with guns blazing,'' John
P. Feehery, DeLay's communications director, declared after the
gunman was felled in a bloody exchange near the legislator's office
and a gift shop busy with summer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was identified as Russell Eugene Weston, Jr.,
described by authorities as a man with a criminal record and a
history of mental disturbance who has been previously listed on the
Secret Service's watch list of hundreds of possibly troublesome
individuals, following reports that he had made threatening remarks
about President Clinton. Among the many reports the Secret Service
investigates, Weston was not considered as a major danger,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's driver's license described him as blonde-haired and
blue-eyed, with an address in Valmeyer, Ill., according to police
authorities who said he also had recent roots in Helena, Mont.
Authorities said he had used a 6-shot .38-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson
revolver in his attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet in our office is covered in blood,'' Tim Berry, a
30-year-old policy advisor to DeLay declared in describing the
scene as the gunman, in khaki pants and a green fedora with a
feather, was finally shot down. ``Ten police officers surrounded
the suspect with guns trained at his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry was drinking champagne amid a group of DeLay staffers in
the whip's suite of offices, celebrating the passage of health care
legislation when the gunman burst into the building, about 30 yards
from DeLay's inner office. Some of them dove under desks, others
darted for the back of the office suite.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman's siege erupted at 3:40 p.m. shortly after both the
Senate and House had ended their debating business for the week.
Alerted in minutes about the casualties, Sen. Bill Frist, a cardiac
surgeon, rushed from the Senate offices in the northern end of the
Capitol, administering to one of the dying police as well as to the
gunman, who was later reported in non-critical condition with two
gunshot wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was focused on keeping their heart and lungs going,'' the
senator said later after riding with emergency workers to the
hospital. ``This is a very serious catastrophe,'' he added,
speaking shortly before the extent of the tragedy was confirmed by
the lowering of the Capitol flag to half-staff in honor of the two
police slain as they denied the gunman deeper entrance to the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist wounded in the crossfire, identified as 24-year-old
Angela Dickerson, was listed in serious condition with wounds in
the face and the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   There was potential for far greater mayhem, for the gunman had
set off the weapons detector at one of the Capitol's main public
entrances, the Document Door passage at the top of the Capitol
steps that opens past the gift shop, with the historic Crypt area
beyond, below the Great Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of tourists at nearby turnings were suddenly propelled
into panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was making a purchase and I heard shots to my right,''
said Tyvon Crawford, a 20-year-old student and employee at the
gift-shop kiosk. ``I looked, and jumped down into the booth and
then a tourist jumped in with us. I was able to see downed bodies.
The gunman came in and fired one shot and security guards fired
back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from Gloucester, England,
stood and recalled the scene later, his pants stained with blood.
``We heard the shots go off,'' he said. ``Everybody scattered. I
saw an officer hit the floor. I went over to him and felt his
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to say something to me,'' Beamish continued. ``I
yelled, `Get a stretcher!' There was blood coming from his head,
and one eye looked as if it were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond, at the museum display cases on the Crypt floor,
Judson Threlkeld and his wife, Rachel, were studying a bit of
Capitol history when gunfire and screams startled them. ``We heard
a bang,'' he said later. ``She dropped to the floor and I got on
top of her. There was a pause and we were afraid he was going to
come into the open space and start firing.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple ducked behind a pillar as Capitol police came
through. ``They yelled, `Get out! Get out!' and about 20 of us ran
out of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was about to depart for a weekend at his Camp David
retreat in Maryland when the Capitol attack occurred about a mile
to the East. He was kept apprised of the attack, keeping to his
schedule, just as legislative officials emphasized that the Capitol
would be open on Saturday, with no curtailing of its routine. ``We
will not shut down the Capitol,'' insisted, Rep. Bill Thomas. &QL;

LATEST BREACH RAISES NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT CAPITOL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security at the US Capitol has been violated in
some high-publicity incidents over the years, including Friday's
shooting rampage, despite a 15-year effort that has markedly
tightened access to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, US Capitol Police have imposed a variety of measures
to improve security, including the installation of metal detectors
and closing the road directly in front of the Capitol. Overall,
officials stressed, the symbol of the nation's democratic system
must be secure but open to all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Capitol is more open than most federal buildings.
There are numerous entrances, including tunnels that connect to the
nearby House and Senate office buildings. At any moment during the
day, the maze of hallways and ornate public rooms are filled with
senators, representatives, lobbyists, journalists, and thousands of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The 181-acre grounds of the Capitol and the surrounding
buildings are patrolled by 1,000 uniformed members of the US
Capitol Police. The roads around the Capitol are lined with 758
concrete barriers and have 33 barriers that rise from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone can walk up to the Capitol building before going
through security, which is different from the White House, where a
gated security system rings the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's shooting, there were conflicting reports about
whether the gunman went through the metal detector and set it off
or whether he avoided it. Representative William Thomas, a
California Republican, said gunman ``went around the
Magnetometer,'' referring to the metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by an exchange of gunfire and the death of two
officers.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas's description of the assailant's entry is correct and
the gunman went around the metal detector, it raises serious
questions about whether the visitors' entrances are secure.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes at a time when the federal government
continues to evaluate the effectiveness of metal detectors and
other security devices. A 1996 government study of metal detectors
at airports found a 40 percent failure rate in detecting bombs,
grenades, guns and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a federal study found a broad range of deficiencies
in the government's ability to track terrorists who might attack
federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Arenberg, spokesman for the National Association of
Police Chiefs, said if a person is determined to get a gun past a
metal detector, he or she could probably do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who really wanted to get a device through could do so
in pieces and then put it back together again,'' Arenberg said. He
said the effectiveness of metal detectors depends entirely on the
person operating them. Such devices can be set to varying degrees
of sensitivity and must be watched closely to determine whether a
gun is present.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Capitol Police often search bags by hand, a
method that is not foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the congressional representative from
Washington, said on CNN after the shooting that she is satisfied
with the security at the Capitol and urged that there not be an
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a breach of security. This was a maniac barging
in,'' she said. ``You can't design security around a maniac. I
don't think there is a lot more they can do. We must not overact so
the people's house is no longer that.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of incidents in recent years have underscored that
security at federal buildings can be violated. Even the White House
has not been immune, with an airplane crash-landing on the South
Lawn and a shooting occurring at the gate. Then came the bombing of
the federal building in Oklahoma City, prompting a new wave of
security concerns at federal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the
White House has been closed to vehicular traffic since May 1995.
Most recently, a series of shooting at schools and elsewhere by
children have led to a debate over the easy availability of guns
and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol has been the scene of sporadic violence, but
Friday's incident was one of the worst ever. Most famously during
this century, Puerto Rican extremists in March 1954 went to the
House visitor's gallery and shot and wounded five congressmen on
the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of security measures began after a 1983 incident in
which a group opposed to US involvement in Lebanon and Grenada
planted a bomb outside the Senate chamber. That prompted the
Capitol Police to install metal detectors and X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1985, after a suicide bomber killed 241 Marines in
Beirut, Capitol Police closed off public access to the street
directly in front of the Capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been incidents since then demonstrating that
security is vulnerable. In 1989, columnist Jack Anderson sneaked a
plastic handgun into the Capitol and displayed it during an
interview with then-Senator Bob Dole. At the time, Capitol security
officials criticized Anderson for staging a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a man brought a .357 Magnum into a Senate committee
hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who work on Capitol Hill said security is notably
tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known a guard here five or six years, and she makes me
show the ID every day,'' said Jim Jones, press secretary for
Senator John F. Kerry.

THE FIRST CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS EVER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 18-years in the Capitol police force, Jacob
Chestnut was looking forward to his retirement. But the 58-year-old
officer remained so ebullient and outgoing with tourists that one
senator said he seemed like the Capitol's official greeter.
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson, an eight year veteran of the force worked in the
plainclothes division, assigned to guard Rep. Tom DeLay, the third
ranking member of the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Friday both men gave their lives stopping a gunman who barged
into the Capitol and opened fire. According to the Senate historian
it was the first time on record that Capitol police officers had
been shot and killed in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed _ and those who apprehended the
gunman _ are true heroes of democracy and every American owes them
a deep debt of gratitude,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich
</P>
<P>
   Police said both men were married and each had three children.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were members of the Capitol's own police force,
formed shortly after an 1828 incident in which a journalist slapped
President John Quincy Adam's son, who was on official business for
his father at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Now the force counts about 1,200 officers who guard the doors
and entry ways on Capitol Hill, investigate threats against members
of Congress and provide them with personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew the two men, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said,
``We passed them multiple times during a day. And you exchange _
you know, `How are you?' You don't expect an answer. And they're
there every day. And no one expects this to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, according to members of Congress was shot in the chest
when he stopped the gunmen and told him to go through the metal
detector stationed at the entrance that he guarded. &QL;

LAWMAKERS VOW TO RETAIN OPENNESS AROUND CAPITOL DESPITE SHOOTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
and TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress pledged Friday to retain the
openness that allows citizens to roam the Capitol's many corridors
despite the shootout that left two officers dead and a tourist
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the people's house, and I deplore the actions of the
person who brought violence within these sacred halls,'' said
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming white building that houses the House chamber on its
south side and the Senate chamber on its north side has withstood a
number of attacks from terrorists over the decades. But only in
recent years has access become more restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, recalled a time when staff could
drive cars past the east front of the building, a practice that
ended with a 1983 bombing outside the office of Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., and the Beirut blast that killed more than 200 U.S.
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to investigate the situation, but we need to do
everything possible to not restrict the people's access to the
capital. This is the shrine of democracy throughout the world. If
we were to become overly restrictive it would be like coddling the
terrorists, and I don't think we want to do that,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, recalled one of his biggest thrills as
a high school student was a tour of the Capitol building. ``This
building belongs to the people of the United States. I think there
will probably be an examination of the security, but I would
certainly hope we would not restrict the public's access,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol building is one of the most popular tourist
destinations in the city, and there has always been a delicate
balancing act between protecting the leaders and staffs who work
there and allowing public access.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several incidents _ both directed at the Capitol
itself and against U.S. targets elsewhere _ have prompted
authorities to take measures to increase security at the building.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bombed three times, and was once set on fire _ by
the British in 1814. There have been shootings and attempted
assassinations, and countless brawls and fights. However, on one
has ever died in an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more memorable and significant of those acts were the
attack in 1954 in the House of Representatives by Puerto Rican
nationalists, in which five lawmakers were injured by gunfire; a
bomb blast in a toilet in 1971 that caused extensive damage but no
injuries; and a bomb blast in the Senate wing in 1983 in which two
leftist radicals caused about $260,000 worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents directed at U.S. facilities over the years,
including the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in
1995, prompted even tougher security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Capitol remains open in comparison to the White
House. The president's residence is ringed by an iron fence.
Tourists must have tickets, pass through metal detectors and are
allowed inside for guided tours only. People with official business
must have their names and Social Security numbers given to the
Secret Service before being cleared onto White House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, tourists, lobbyists and journalists are granted
access to the Capitol building after passing though security
screens at each door. Tourists have unfettered and unescorted
access throughout the Capitol except for some hallways clearly
marked off limits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, prompted by constant protests by anti-Vietnam War
activists, the U.S. Capitol Police department was formed.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 metal detectors manned by armed guards screen
visitors to the Capitol and nearby offices. The entire complex is
surrounded by concrete barriers disguised as flower pots, virtually
every nook and cranny inside is scanned by television cameras, and
plainclothes officers supplement the uniformed force.
</P>
<P>
   At any given hour, at least 27 armed patrolmen, some with dogs,
walk the grounds. There are more than 1,200 officers now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, lawmakers proposed streamlining visitors' entry into
the building by constructing an $83 million visitors center
underground on the east side of the Capitol where all visitors
would pass through security before entering the building. The
Capitol Police also proposed erecting a fence around the entire
building. Both of those proposals are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Americans are ready to be told they can't come to
their Capitol,'' said Michael Sullivan, a spokesman for Rep. Ron
Paul, R-Texas. ``You can't stop the lone lunatic. It's a sad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said there may be some changes, but
``I don't anticipate a lessening of the openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the congressman expressed sorrow at the deaths of the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their dedication that keeps the freedom available,''
Lampson said.

A NIGERIAN REVISITS HIS PLACE IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNA, Nigeria _ Consider the general in his labyrinth,
ensconced beside the Oriental vases and the chocolate-filled glass
bowls, switching television channels with the same nonchalance he
has shown in defying Nigerian political gravity for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   At ease, one might say of this legendary African survivor,
Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB for short, military ruler of
Nigeria from 1985 to 1993, and still for many the real power behind
the country's enduring military government. But something, it
seems, is ruffling Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   That something is the fact that _ having talked for years about
Nigeria's need for democracy, having engineered many ``transition
programs'' _ Babangida annulled the presidential election of 1993,
ushering Africa's most populous nation into a five-year nightmare
under his former second-in-command, the late Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard for me,'' a barefoot Babangida said of the
annulment. ``In fact the agony I went through is really better not
imagined. But it was the price I had to pay. I was the chief
executive in 1993. You delegate authority but you do not delegate
responsibility. The buck stopped at my table. What we did was wrong
but we tried to rationalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the subject of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the opposition
leader who died in custody this month and whose apparent victory in
1993 he denied, the twinkly-eyed Babangida continued: ``Abiola was
my friend for 25 years, a very genuine friend. From the day we met,
there was a rapport. I had my friend there waiting to take over. It
would have been a great destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Destiny, however, led elsewhere: to the cruelty and crassness of
the Abacha regime. The general shook his head. Having survived two
coup attempts, he learned long ago to leave certain things unsaid.
Nigeria is a great, seething amalgam of tribes and religions, as
exhilarating as it is dangerous. But the general's son, Muhammed
Babangida, offered the following clarification of the riddle of the
fateful 1993 decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other generals, including Abacha, who said that if
power was ceded to a southerner like Abiola, the north would have
nothing left,'' the younger Babangida said. ``They put my father in
a corner. They threatened him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what degree of armed duress led
Babangida to deny Abiola. But what is clear, as Nigeria embarks on
yet another promised transition to democracy, is that the central
conundrum of this country remains unchanged: how to balance a
devoutly Muslim north, accustomed to power, with a mainly Christian
or pagan south that is increasingly restive.
</P>
<P>
   The oil reserves are in the south, and are of the highest
quality and good for several more decades. The big businesses are
in the south, in Lagos. The north without the south would be
barren, landlocked, dismal.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal military academy is in the north, in Kaduna. The
sons of northern notables, or emirs, have prospered in the armed
forces. And on the unspoken principle that economic and political
power cannot reside in the same place, no ruler of Nigeria since
1979, civilian or military, has come from the south.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took power when
Abacha died suddenly last month, is a longtime neighbor of
Babangida. They grew up together in this north-central town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head of state and I went to school together,'' Babangida,
who is 56, said. ``His home was next to mine. Our parents knew each
other. We are not really related, but we are very close, having
been together in a typical northern Nigerian society for about 48
years.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Babangida, as some newspapers here have suggested, behind
Abubakar's appointment and a speech he made on Monday? In that
speech he rejected opposition calls for the installation by Oct. 1
of a civilian government of national unity, but promised to hand
over power to an elected president on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, Babangida said, could be further from the truth. He was
not even consulted on the speech, he said. His role now, he added,
is to provide advice, but only when requested, and ``do what I can
to bring about the painful coexistence of nationalities and
religions in a united Nigeria.'' However, he added, it was a good
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The general feels his life has been dedicated to the
preservation of Nigeria _ in the civil war after the southeastern
Ibo tribe seceded and declared the state of Biafra in the 1960s; in
his attempts to curb the more extreme forms of Islamic zealotry in
the north; in his victory in 1990 against an attempted coup whose
southern instigators wanted to expel five northern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am from the crisis generation,'' he said. ``Turbulence,
turbulence, turbulence has been my lot. A supreme price was paid
for the unity of this country: the sacrifice of more than 1 million
people in the civil war. No matter what, 95 percent of Nigerians
now see themselves together. The question of Nigeria as one entity
is a settled one.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that widespread intermarriage, the presence
of different tribes in all parts of the country, the absence of
recrimination or revenge killings after the Biafran war, and a
palpable sense of being the big power in Africa have imbued the
Nigerian idea with an unlikely vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in a 38-year-old state that has never achieved
stable democracy, the issue of unity appears anything but resolved.
Indeed, Babangida's decision in 1993 to deny victory to Abiola, a
man with support in all parts of the country, clearly delivered
Nigerian nationhood a body blow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Criticism of Abubakar's program has centered on the absence
before elections of any democratic forum in which Nigeria's
structure could be discussed. Despite this criticism, and the anger
in the south over Abiola's death, Babangida said he was confident
that Abubakar would now steer the country to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a Third World political nation,'' he said. ``We
have a vibrant, well-trained population that wants to participate.
The military's esprit de corps has suffered from too much time in
government, and it is time to go back to the barracks. The world
has moved on, and as I have said many times since 1989, military
rule is now an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave a smile that somehow bridged the colossal gap between
his words and his actions. A man for all seasons, it seems. Written
off, plotted against, denounced, but as yet in the saddle. Perhaps
then, in retirement, a future democratic leader?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in politics, therefore no interest in
forming a party, and therefore no interest in elective office,''
Babangida said. ``I think I am out. People are scared I will rear
my ugly head again. But no, not really. They will have to find
somebody else as a target for their darts.''

LAWMAKERS SAY CAPITOL MUST REMAIN OPEN DESPITE SHOOTING 

</HEADLINE>

and TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress pledged Friday to retain the
openness that allows citizens to roam the Capitol's many corridors
despite the shootout that left two officers dead and a tourist
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the people's house, and I deplore the actions of the
person who brought violence within these sacred halls,'' said
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming white building that houses the House chamber on its
south side and the Senate chamber on its north side has withstood a
number of attacks from terrorists over the decades. But only in
recent years has access become more restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, recalled a time when staff could
drive cars past the east front of the building, a practice that
ended with a 1983 bombing outside the office of Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., and the Beirut blast that killed more than 200 U.S.
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to investigate the situation, but we need to do
everything possible to not restrict the people's access to the
capital. This is the shrine of democracy throughout the world. If
we were to become overly restrictive it would be like coddling the
terrorists, and I don't think we want to do that,'' Bentsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, recalled one of his biggest thrills as
a high school student was a tour of the Capitol building. ``This
building belongs to the people of the United States. I think there
will probably be an examination of the security, but I would
certainly hope we would not restrict the public's access,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol building is one of the most popular tourist
destinations in the city, and there has always been a delicate
balancing act between protecting the leaders and staffs who work
there and allowing public access.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several incidents _ both directed at the Capitol
itself and against U.S. targets elsewhere _ have prompted
authorities to take measures to increase security at the building.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bombed three times, and was once set on fire _ by
the British in 1814. There have been shootings and attempted
assassinations, and countless brawls and fights. However, on one
has ever died in an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more memorable and significant of those acts were the
attack in 1954 in the House of Representatives by Puerto Rican
nationalists, in which five lawmakers were injured by gunfire; a
bomb blast in a toilet in 1971 that caused extensive damage but no
injuries; and a bomb blast in the Senate wing in 1983 in which two
leftist radicals caused about $260,000 worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents directed at U.S. facilities over the years,
including the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in
1995, prompted even tougher security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Capitol remains open in comparison to the White
House. The president's residence is ringed by an iron fence.
Tourists must have tickets, pass through metal detectors and are
allowed inside for guided tours only. People with official business
must have their names and Social Security numbers given to the
Secret Service before being cleared onto White House grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, tourists, lobbyists and journalists are granted
access to the Capitol building after passing though security
screens at each door. Tourists have unfettered and unescorted
access throughout the Capitol except for some hallways clearly
marked off limits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, prompted by constant protests by anti-Vietnam War
activists, the U.S. Capitol Police department was formed.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 metal detectors manned by armed guards screen
visitors to the Capitol and nearby offices. The entire complex is
surrounded by concrete barriers disguised as flower pots, virtually
every nook and cranny inside is scanned by television cameras, and
plainclothes officers supplement the uniformed force.
</P>
<P>
   At any given hour, at least 27 armed patrolmen, some with dogs,
walk the grounds. There are more than 1,200 officers now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, lawmakers proposed streamlining visitors' entry into
the building by constructing an $83 million visitors center
underground on the east side of the Capitol where all visitors
would pass through security before entering the building. The
Capitol Police also proposed erecting a fence around the entire
building. Both of those proposals are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Americans are ready to be told they can't come to
their Capitol,'' said Michael Sullivan, a spokesman for Rep. Ron
Paul, R-Texas. ``You can't stop the lone lunatic. It's a sad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said there may be some changes, but
``I don't anticipate a lessening of the openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the congressman expressed sorrow at the deaths of the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their dedication that keeps the freedom available,''
Lampson said.

ENRON TO BUY BRITISH WATER COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Enron Corp., in a stroke of business alchemy meant
to turn its electricity and natural gas expertise into know-how
about water, announced a $2.2 billion cash purchase Friday of a
British water and sewage company as a base for global expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that Wessex Water PLC, though profitable and
efficient, was too limited in potential growth to be worth that
price. But Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called the purchase
essential for his company to enter the water market, where
privatization and annual investments around $100 billion are just
beginning. ``We think there are tremendous opportunities, probably
a lot more opportunities than there are companies able to take
advantage of them,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   As in the deregulation and privatization of global natural gas
and electricity businesses, he said, ``Getting in early and getting
in in a very substantial way can give you a strong competitive
position.''
</P>
<P>
   In just a few years, Lay added, Enron's water business could be
as big as its gas or electricity operations. While the company also
plans to exploit possible plans by many American cities to
privatize their water services, it intends to focus on Europe,
Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's offer of $10.33 a share, or 6.20 pounds, is 26 percent
above Wessex's Thursday closing price of 4.93 pounds in London.
Wessex shares surged Friday to 6.115 pounds, while Enron fell $1.25
to close at $55.25. Enron will also assume $255 million in Wessex
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Enron, based in Houston, has been a pioneer in turning natural
gas and electricity into global businesses. But some analysts said
the water and sewage industry was different in ways that Enron
might not expect.
</P>
<P>
   Where Enron's energy projects have often been fresh starts, its
water investments are likely to require the purchase of existing
companies with their current systems and employees. Enron might
have to lay off half the employees and spend heavily to upgrade
systems, said Richard Smith of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.
Enron's dealings with foreign leaders in its energy investments
might prove of limited value because water commonly is managed
locally. ``At this stage the international water market isn't as
easy as the international electricity market,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Enron also faces two huge French competitors, Suez Lyonnaise des
Eaux and Vivendi, which have long head starts in water projects
around the world. Enron quietly entered the business last month
with a group that paid $150 million for 70 percent of a newly
privatized water and sewer company in Mendoza province of
Argentina. But it lost a project in China to Suez Lyonnaise des
Eaux.
</P>
<P>
   Enron's admirers point out that it has already shown the
ingenuity to apply lessons learned in the natural gas business.
David Fleischer of Goldman, Sachs compares the Wessex purchase to
Enron's $2.9 billion acquisition last year of the Portland General
Corp., Oregon's largest power provider, as a base for attacking the
electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   In water services, Fleischer said, ``Enron has a lot of
capabilities, and the Wessex deal gives them the capabilities they
didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wessex, Enron would get a water company too small to realize
its own foreign ambitions but with managers who have greatly
improved its efficiency. ``The track record of Enron married to the
experience of Wessex is a formidable combination,'' said Nicholas
Hood, who will remain the Wessex chairman. He will also become vice
chairman of the new water division of Enron, which will be managed
by Rebecca Mark, Enron's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Enron said the acquisition will improve its earnings
next year, British regulators are considered likely to trim the
company's rates in 2000. Wessex, based in Bristol, provides water
for an area of 1.1 million people and sewage services for an area
of 2.5 million, both in southwestern England. Its sale is subject
to the approval of its shareholders and British regulators. While
British water companies were privatized in 1989, American cities
including Atlanta are just in the process of privatizing their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Enron said that other cities including New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago were considering whether to follow.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
(af) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As empires crumble and technology pushes ever forward, some
things remain unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   There's death, and taxes. And then there's pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' consumption of pizza is at a record high, market
researchers say, trailing only soft drinks, burgers and fries among
foods ordered in restaurants. Even chicken can't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it is also true that some of the most
enduring business lessons _ potentially applicable to everyone from
Warren E. Buffett to the lemonade-stand proprietor down the street
_ can be extracted from the ups and downs of the pizza industry, a
$21.8 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza, after all, is at once a global commodity and a local
enterprise, a candidate for high-technology marketing, and a
business that depends heavily on human capital.
</P>
<P>
   Interested in maximizing your share of the pie? Consider what
the executives of some of the leading pizza makers _ Papa John's,
Pizza Hut, Domino's, California Pizza Kitchen, DiGiorno and
Telepizza _ have picked up amid all the tossing and baking, slicing
and delivering.
</P>
<P>
   And hold the anchovies _ if that's what your customers want. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obsession is the byword at Papa John's International, one of the
country's fastest-growing restaurant chains. Its founder, chairman
and chief executive, John H. Schnatter, can be counted on to pop
into his restaurants without notice, checking on the cheese, the
sauce, the shape and quality of the crust.
</P>
<P>
   And to blow his stack if any aspect falls short. Five top
executives, including the president, quit over an 18-month period
in 1994 and 1995, all complaining about his management style.
</P>
<P>
   The company saw the departures as ``the natural evolution of a
high-growth company,'' according to a spokesman, and today's top
officials make no apologies about being relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to have better ingredients and better pizza,
and if we're going to live up to that, we have to be fanatical,''
said Blaine Hurst, vice chairman and president of the company,
which is based in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean testing other tomato sauces, even though the
company already believes it has the best-tasting sauce, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the corporate strategy is keeping operations and
offerings uncomplicated. At most Papa John's restaurants, you can
get two kinds of pizza _thin crust, or regular _ with various
toppings, of course, along with Coca-Cola products in bottles or
cans. That has propelled the company into fourth place among pizza
restaurants, with a 4.1 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a great job, coming out of nowhere,'' said
Mitchell Speiser, an analyst with Lehman Brothers who considers
Papa John's the biggest threat to Pizza Hut, the industry leader.
``They focus on the tradition and quality of their one pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant sales last year were $868 million, with companywide
earnings of $26.9 million. (Papa John's also has its own food
commissaries and a printing company.) The company projects that
restaurant sales will top $1 billion this year. Profit margins are
about 18 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for Pizza Hut and 15
percent for the fast-food industry in general, Speiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the chain has grown _ there are now 1,690 restaurants,
up from 400 just five years ago, when the company went public _
management's ability to keep its intensity has become more
complicated, in part because of rapid turnover of restaurant
workers.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up the intensity, Papa John's has a mantra, conveyed
through publications and exhortations, that centers on a set of
core principles: focus, accountability, superiority, attitude,
improvement and ``Papa,'' which, with a little imagination, stands
for ``People Are Our No. 1 Priority Always.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen an organization work so hard to put core
values into place,'' said Hurst, who before joining Papa John's was
head of technology for Boston Chicken, another fast-food company.
``I've been in restaurants where one of the managers will come up
to me and say, `Blaine, I don't think this is in alignment with
Papa.' We walk out of there saying either we've got to change Papa,
or we've got to change this thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 22.2 percent of the restaurant pizza business, twice as
much as its closest competitor, Pizza Hut is unquestionably the
pizza sales leader. But the chain's customers are more loyal than
its workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza Hut, based in Dallas, has seen high turnover not only
among its hourly workers _ a problem that afflicts the entire
industry _ but also among general managers, the people in charge of
making daily operations flow smoothly. Then a company-owned store
or franchise has to start over, with all the elaborate and costly
training that the chain's complicated operations require.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the turnover, Pizza Hut two months ago began awarding
stock options to managers _ ``Yum Bucks,'' after YUM, the trading
symbol for the chain's parent company, Tricon Global Restaurants,
which was spun off last October by Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, managers receive options for $20,000 in stock, issued
at a set price, usually below market on the day of the grant. The
options cannot be exercised for four years, a requirement intended
to bind employees to the company. After the initial $20,000 grant,
managers' option awards will vary, depending on their restaurants'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone stays in a restaurant for 25 years and can grow it
at a good rate, he or she could walk away with a million dollars if
the stock does well,'' said Michael Rawlings, the president and
``chief concept officer'' of Pizza Hut. ``If we can unleash the
power of the folks working in the restaurants, we're going to be
light-years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to front-line workers for the ideas that drive growth is
new for Pizza Hut. ``Within Pepsico, the culture was a little bit
more command and control,'' Rawlings said. ``We believe, long term,
that a collaborative system is going to be a better formula for
success. Many of our franchisees have been in this system for 35
years, and we're learning from them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax, the founders of
California Pizza Kitchen, figured that teaming up with Pepsico and
all its knowledge of the food business was a sure way to take their
business to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, former law partners and federal prosecutors, had
been fastidious in expanding the high-end pizza chain they
established in 1985, opening only in affluent, fast-growing suburbs
and urban enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's purchase of a 66 percent stake promised new marketing
muscle and capital for expansion. But the founders lost control of
the master plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from having 25 restaurants to 28 more in 1994,''
Rosenfield said. ``That didn't give us time to make the kind of
disciplined analysis we needed to make.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pepsico said the company would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   When Pepsico announced in 1996 that it was thinking about
getting out of the restaurant business, Flax and Rosenfield heard
about it on the news. ``We had an agreement with them that they
couldn't sell their shares without our permission,'' Rosenfield
said _ and that gave the founders a chance to go shopping for a new
investor.
</P>
<P>
   Their new majority partner, Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &AMP; Co., a
Manhattan investment group, is letting the two men set the
company's expansion pace. And with $160 million in sales from 80
restaurants in the United States and abroad, nearly all of them
owned by the company, that pace is now half of what it was during
the Pepsico days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build 12 company-owned restaurants a year for the next
couple of years,'' Rosenfield said. ``We've pulled the plug on
franchises for now. If you get too large as a franchising
organization, you lose your nimbleness, and the infrastructure
required to supervise franchises can be as large as the one to run
your business.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We see this growing, one business at a time. We are
in control of our destiny.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Domino's Pizza, taking the successful formula that made it
the No. 2 pizza company and transplanting it overseas seemed the
obvious way to grow in the mid-1980s, when Ronald Reagan was
presiding over ``Morning in America'' and people in other countries
were perceived to be clamoring for all things American.
</P>
<P>
   But the privately held company, based in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
stumbled badly, executives now acknowledge. Their mistake, they
say, was awarding the first few overseas franchises _ in countries
like Australia and Germany _ to people with proven track records in
American cities like Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The franchisees, trained under Thomas Monaghan, Domino's
hard-charging founder, were innocents abroad. They did not know
such basics as how to lease or buy real estate outside the United
States, nor did they understand local preferences in pizza.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, they continued to own stores back home,
so they tried to manage their offshore outlets by long distance.
For a cash business that needed hands-on attention, it was a recipe
for failure.
</P>
<P>
   After most of a decade, Domino's figured out a better way, said
Gary McCausland, managing director of Domino's Pizza International.
Instead of ``parachuting in the Tom Monaghan guys,'' he said, the
company went searching for home-grown Monaghans.
</P>
<P>
   The new master franchisees started with plenty of knowledge
about how to operate a business in their home countries and needed
only to be trained in the details of running a Domino's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out it's easier to teach someone from Australia the
Domino's system than it is to teach the guys from Dayton how to
make pizzas in Australia,'' McCausland said.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has about 1,600 stores in 60 countries outside
the United States, up from 684 in a handful of countries in 1993.
And the intelligence provided by local operators appears to be
making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, for instance, Domino's is selling $20 million worth a
year of mayojaga pizza, a bacon-and-onion pie that is finished with
slices of potato and dribbles of mayonnaise. Such a combination
could well have taken American operators a lot longer to put on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Domino's sells a lot of pizza topped with canned
corn and canned tuna. And in Iceland, the franchise holder decided
to market directly to drive-in theatergoers. Delivery people roam
the parking area, calling in orders over their cellular phones for
delivery in time for intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's earlier missteps were not a result of ``arrogance, so
much as ignorance about how you build a global brand,'' McCausland
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was lack of knowledge about how to respect the
different consumer preferences,'' he said, adding: ``The biggest
mistake U.S. companies make is, we come in and say, `Let me show
you how we do this in Ann Arbor.' We're not shy, and we sometimes
force ourselves on people. In a lot of cultures, that's
offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   There are elements of the original Domino's formula, though,
that work better abroad these days than they do at home.
</P>
<P>
   Operating overseas is less litigious, McCausland said, which
means that most franchisees are still promising 30-minute delivery
or a free pizza _ a promotion that was halted in the United States
over concern that it was causing too many traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of building brand awareness,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want more attention for your product? How about floating a
giant, garishly colored hot-air balloon with your logo on it over
dozens of American communities? If that doesn't produce the desired
result, why not follow consumers directly to the supermarket,
parking your mobile pizzeria in the parking lot and offering free
samples?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the higher-profile tactics being used to promote
DiGiorno Rising Crust Pizza, a freezer-case product from the Kraft
Foods division of Philip Morris. Others include a promotional link
with the Professional Golf Association tour and TV commercials,
focused on thirtyish singles, that try to give a patina of sex
appeal to frozen pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this brash mix, something is working: Since
DiGiorno's start in 1996, sales have spiraled, to $230 million last
year, for a 14.9 percent share of the $2 billion market for frozen
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to break through the clutter in an effective
way,'' said Tom Sampson, vice president for marketing at DiGiorno.
</P>
<P>
   The product is also trying to break through to consumers who
might not have been interested in frozen pizza before _ people who
have cash to spare but are time-starved and willing to pay $5.59
for a 12-inch pizza that you pop in the oven and finish cooking
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gap between frozen and carryout or delivery,''
Sampson said. ``That's what DiGiorno was intended to do _ to bridge
that gap.'' In this case, what it took to get people to walk over
that bridge was a ton of publicity _ including the sort of
spectacle that creates buzz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Pizza Hut was the only big multinational
pizza vendor in Europe. But Leopoldo Fernando Pujals, a
Cuban-American with a background in marketing at Procter &AMP; Gamble,
saw opportunity in competing against a giant.
</P>
<P>
   He chose a surprisingly pizza-hungry country _ Spain _ as the
first market for his new company, Telepizza SA. There, Pizza Hut's
marketing was coming from a central office in Europe that had
little idea what would appeal to Spanish consumers. And that
marketing wasn't being aimed at the consumers who were making key
pizza-eating decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chairman's policy,'' explained Barbara Zabalza,
Telepizza's director of investor relations, ``is focusing on
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   How? Children are drawn in by the company's two-for-one pizza
offers and marketing gimmicks, including a magic club that offers
children small prizes, usually simple magic tricks, with every
order, Miss Zabalza said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Madrid, also markets to children by
opening its restaurants to birthday parties _ kids go home with
logo-bearing hats and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been strong. ``The club is the biggest
membership club in Spain, with three million children enrolled,''
said Ann Popelka, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole product is geared toward children, which is very
clever,'' she added, ``since the fast-food industry in Spain is
still growing and there's no way anyone over 45 would plop down a
pizza on the table.'' All customers, regardless of age, are tracked
through an elaborate data base, she said, enabling the company to
market specifically to them with coupons and other freebies.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after Pujals first scanned the competitive environment,
Telepizza is sizzling. It has nearly 500 restaurants in Spain,
where its market share is 65 percent, versus less than 20 percent
for Pizza Hut, Miss Popelka said. It also has a handful of sites in
Chile, Poland and Mexico, and is planning a second chain, to be
called Telegrill, that will sell marinated grilled chicken and
ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Domino's, Telepizza promises delivery within 30 minutes.
Like Pizza Hut, it offers wide variety on its menu. Like Papa
John's, it says its secret is in quality ingredients. Like
DiGiorno, its marketing is relentless: in addition to the
magicians' club, televised soccer games in many Spanish cities have
Telepizza ads running across the screen along with the players. And
its prices are lower than many competitors', too.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is a stock that now trades at $9.20 a share in
Madrid, up 215 percent in the last year. There's got to be some
kind of lesson in that.

<P>
   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ As dozens of American soldiers
stood guard and a military helicopter hovered, Hasan Nuhanovic
nervously carried out one of the most basic of human rituals _
mourning the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after ambushes and mass executions by Bosnian Serb
soldiers here left 7,300 Bosnian Muslims presumed dead, he and 65
other men and women recently became the first group of Bosnian
Muslim civilians to peacefully re-enter this mining town in eastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   No violent confrontations erupted during the hour-and-a-half
visit, on June 11, to the site of the worst atrocity of the Bosnian
war. There were even brief conversations between once-bitter
enemies. One Serbian woman helped Muslim women cut back weeds at an
overgrown Muslim graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Nuhanovic, 30, a U.N. translator whose parents and brother
disappeared during the killings, found a Serbian policeman who
fondly recalled once working for his father. ``This big smile
spread across his face when he heard my father's name,'' Nuhanovic
recalled. ``But when I told him my father was missing, his face
went blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years after American troops arrived in Bosnia,
there is scant evidence that the peace accords are being carried
out in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials hailed the mourners' visit as an example
of how aggressive Western policies over the past year are producing
results _ even in a town with the bitterest ethnic hatreds.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, though, say the military force required to allow the
Bosnian Muslims to visit reflects the painstakingly slow progress
of the American mission. One Western diplomat predicted that the
tensions would require a foreign military presence for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, there was a minor grave-site visit,'' the diplomat said.
``But it's going to take decades for there to be reconciliation in
that area. There's been too much bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   The war wrecked the town. Srebrenica's two mosques were
dynamited. Muslim graveyards are the only trace of the ethnic group
that had made up 70 percent of the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Its water system, when it works, spews water too dirty to drink.
Its shrapnel-pocked schools lack classroom supplies and heating
oil. The mines south of the town lie idle, the factories to the
north are gutted.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an empty cafe on Srebrenica's deserted main street
one day last month, Radomir, a 39-year-old Bosnian Serb, bitterly
criticized the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, and
other nationalists. Radomir spoke on condition that only his first
name be used because he fears retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I fought for four years?'' he asked. ``To be a
beggar?''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Serbs, Radomir moved to Srebrenica after he lost
his home elsewhere in Bosnia. He said he has no future in
Srebrenica and hopes to return to the suburb of Sarajevo where he
lived before the war.
</P>
<P>
   His anger reflects the success of American and European efforts
to use economic pressure to influence Bosnian Serb public opinion.
Areas controlled by Bosnian Serb moderates are receiving economic
aid, while the economy in areas controlled by Serb hard-liners,
including Srebrenica, is withering.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mark Littel, the commander of U.S. forces around
Srebrenica, said he had seen a shift in Serbian attitudes that
mirrors Radomir's experience _ a dramatic shift away from hard-line
attitudes. ``Nine months ago we came to Srebrenica and asked Serbs
if they wanted to go home,'' Littel said. ``They said, `Never.'
Now, in increasing numbers, they're saying yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But such sentiments are clearly not held by Srebrenica's Bosnian
Serb nationalist leaders, and many Bosnian Serbs in the town have
no desire to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by Bosnian Muslims to win back control of the town by
democratic means have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Voting by absentee ballot in municipal elections last September,
Bosnian Muslims won most of the seats on the Town Council. But
efforts by the new council to take control of the town have proved
futile. A rock-throwing mob spurred on by the town's leaders turned
back the newly elected Muslim officials and American troops in
January, Littel said. Meetings between the two sides ensued, but
the new council has yet to meet and Srebrenica has no functioning
government.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Szulc, a spokeswoman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which organized the elections, said that
if the two sides do not agree soon, the organization would appoint
a five-member council led by an American diplomat to run the town.
``We always knew Srebrenica was going to be toughest one, and it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little progress in bringing the perpetrators of
the massacres to justice, which survivors say would go a long way
toward reducing the urge for revenge. While the United States and
NATO have taken a more aggressive stance on arresting low-level
war-crimes suspects, Karadzic and his military commander, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, who have been charged with genocide at Srebrenica by
the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague, remain free.
Both men are out of power; their whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Most galling to survivors is that three years after the town's
fall to the Serbs, only 1,000 bodies of the 7,300 missing have been
found. Only about 15 bodies have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Hajra Catic, a director of Women of Srebrenica who lives in
Tuzla, in the Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia, said thousands of
corpses litter the hills of eastern Bosnia, exposed to the
elements, looters and wildlife. ``It hurts so much,'' said Ms.
Catic, whose son and husband have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors complain that despite assurances from American
officials that the mass graves around Srebrenica would be monitored
by U.S. spy satellites and planes, the Bosnian Serbs have
systematically tampered with the graves. Officials of the War
Crimes Tribunal seeking evidence of atrocities say Bosnian Serbs
dug up almost all the original mass graves and reburied the bodies
in hidden locations.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of how chaotic the process of finding graves
remains, a NATO bulldozer widening a road 40 miles north of
Srebrenica this spring dug up human bones. Tribunal investigators
said they believe the area, near Hodzici, holds at least five mass
graves of bodies that were moved from their original sites.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Muslims missing, Serbian nationalists are able to
deny executions took place, or contend that Muslims were killed
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarajevo, Tuzla and other Muslim-Croat areas, Srebrenica's
Muslims have become a political force, organizing regular protests
over the last year that have increased pressure on Western and
Bosnian officials for arrests and exhumations. At a commemoration
of the third anniversary of the fall of the town, women from
Srebrenica covered a field in Staric Ravni, near the front line,
with pieces of cloth, each denoting one of the presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the peace accords ever take effect in Srebrenica may
depend on how average Bosnians respond to awkward reunions of
neighbors who became enemies.
</P>
<P>
   One person who would seem to be prone to revenge is Mevludin
Oric, 29, a Muslim who survived a mass execution three years ago by
hiding under his cousin's corpse. His father, his cousin and half
the men from his village are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking beer with friends in a suburb of Sarajevo in May, Oric
said, he was stunned to see Bosnian Serb women walking toward him.
The women were making a graveyard visit of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Oric confronted them. ``How dare you come here when I can't
return to Srebrenica?'' he hissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about it,'' replied one of the Serbian
women, visibly shaken. ``I'm an old woman,'' she blurted out. ``If
you want, you can kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oric and his friends berated the women, one of whom insisted
that they were not responsible for whatever occurred in Srebrenica.
Their conversation continued, and soon they were trading stories of
joblessness, complaining about leaders on all sides who profited
from the war and expressing gloom about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Oric calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the encounter days later, Oric and one of the
women said they were fairly optimistic _ assuming war criminals are
arrested and exhumations continue and nationalists are removed from
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in two years we will live as we used to live
before the war,'' Oric said. ``I don't want revenge on all the
Serbs. They are not all guilty.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While people all over Manhattan have been
inconvenienced by the collapse at the Conde Nast construction site
in Times Square, few have been as sorely tried as its neighbors at
1500 Broadway. Ever since the evacuation of the 37-story
black-glass tower on Tuesday, the 64 tenants _ scores of lawyers,
accountants, salesmen, public relations people, and the staffs of
two magazines _ have struggled to create offices in exile.
</P>
<P>
   They have coped with missing files, vanishing mail, and
overwhelmed voice-mail systems while worrying about the little
things, like exactly what was happening to the fruit and pastries
left in the conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruit flies,'' said Allison Wye, a senior vice president of
the financial division of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide. ``Fat
mice,'' said Carol Ruth, chief executive of the company.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, both women were standing in a small
conference room in the Renaissance Hotel on Seventh Avenue, four
blocks north of their usual offices. The room was buzzing with
about 20 young people talking on cellular phones and peering at
laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 300 employees at 1500 Broadway, Edelman was the
largest tenant in the building. Now it has people scattered all
over the region. Some groups are working from their bosses' homes.
Some are working in a building borrowed from a client, NCR Corp.,
just off the Lincoln Tunnel in New Jersey (shuttle buses run into
Manhattan every 90 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Almost as elaborate were the logistics at BAR/BRI Bar Review,
that is coaching 7,000 fledgling lawyers to pass the state
licensing test next week. Anxious law graduates are pelting the
company with questions about everything from how to take the exam
with a broken finger to the rule against perpetuities, said Erica
Fine, an associate director of BAR/BRI.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fine and her team of legal experts are answering the
questions, she said, but not from the office. ``We're at my
mother's house on Long Island,'' she said. Students call the bar
review's Boston office, and their queries are faxed to the house in
Plainview, where a dozen lawyers page through reference books and
call the students back.
</P>
<P>
   The tutoring concern was also able to have some of its own
research material and lecture notes retrieved from the office by
the handful of building workers the city allowed to stay in the
tower. The owner of 1500 Broadway, Intertech Development Corp. of
Washington, kept these six people in the property's management
office answering phones and collecting things from offices for
tenants of the building, said Orna Shulman, executive vice
president of the company.
</P>
<P>
   That service probably saved the day for the magazine Essence,
which was closing its October issue Friday so that it could be in
subscribers' hands Sept. 10, said Barbara Britton, the magazine's
vice president for advertising. The magazine, which has a
circulation of 1 million, was able to get the material it needed
out of the office, and it will be printed on time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of Essence's 100 employees moved into the Manhattan offices
of its printers, Brown Printing, at 46th and Broadway, she said,
while the rest ``are telecommuting, electronically and
psychically.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's owners say it will reopen as soon as the police
open the streets, which could be as early as this weekend, though
it remains unclear whether the offices facing 43rd Street can be
used.
</P>
<P>
   For some tenants, however, the latest shutdown has been the last
straw. In January the building was hit by the boom of a
construction crane from the Conde Nast site. No one was injured,
but the building was slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lazarus, who works with her father at a small public
relations company at 1500 Broadway, said the construction, along
with rising rents and congested streets, has prompted her to look
elsewhere for office space. In the meantime, she said, she had come
to the same conclusion as a number of other tenants: ``We've all
decided we're not walking on 43rd Street anymore.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barbara Majewska was standing by the souvenir shop,
having just finished a tour of the Capitol with her husband and two
kids when she heard the shots. The echo stayed with her, mingling
with the screams of her 4-year-old daughter, Danika.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone scattered, running, shouting, crying, except for
Majewska, who thought it wiser to hide. Maternal instinct kicked
in, overrunning her own terror and inclination to bolt as she
directed her 15-year-old son to lie down flat behind a statue.
Majewska piled Danika between, and she lay on top, forming a human
shield.
</P>
<P>
   Her long, thin arms, she recalls thinking, couldn't be much of a
shield for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it,'' Majewska exclaimed, after reuniting
with her husband, Lee, who was swept up and lost in the commotion.
``I never thought this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Majewska, who lives in Poland, didn't yet know that four people
were hit by those bullets _ the assailant, two fatally wounded
officers, and a tourist like herself. All she knew is that she and
her husband, after searching frantically for one another outside
the Capitol amid a crowd thick with cameras, Popsicles, American
flags and a half-dozen accents from far away places, had found each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many millions of parents, toddlers, tourists, and
foreigners, Majewska and her husband were here to visit the US
Capitol, seat of the largest democracy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is, even with security guards posted at every entrance and a
swirl of plainclothes officers partrolling the Capitol grounds, one
of the most open and public viewings of government at work
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the Capitol building itself, visitors congregate. They
come as part of their social studies class, to learn the difference
between a bill and an amendment. They come to buy T-shirts, flags
and cups boasting logos of the Capitol dome. They come to curry
favor with their representatives. They come in the hope of rubbing
elbows with important people they see on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands pass every day under the Capitol dome, through
Statuary Hall, where history is embodied in the marbled forms of
suffragettes and military heroes, and into the crypt, where the
shooting happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting in line and this bang went off, and one lady
said, `Oh, it must be construction,' and the other said, `No way,
that is gunfire,' '' said 14-year-old Derek Zalewski, of
Stevenspoint, Wis. ``This guard came running up to us in
plainclothes with a badge and a gun out and put us up against the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   What Zalewski witnessed next _ a woman running out of the
capitol in blood-soaked clothes as panicked people poured down the
capitol steps _ was made that much more shocking by the way it
confliced with the ``pretty'' mental picture he had formed of the
Capitol. Visitors repeatedly pointed out that they considered the
Capitol extremely safe and well-policed when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to map out a route for my high school students,''
said Jillian Simon, a 23-year-old English teacher from Wilmington,
N.C. ``It's ironic. I went through the detectors and thought, only
minutes before I heard the shots, how safe it is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm a little shaken,'' she cried, her hands
trembling. ``I just saw my whole life in front of me. There's
something extremely wrong in this country. The security doesn't
work. The gun laws don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people milled about after the shooting on the shaded
lawn in front of the Capitol, which had been transformed into a
parking lot filled with police cars, ambulances and a large fleet
of black sedans. Among the cars roamed Secret Service agents,
public safety officers and plainclothes police.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the scene as less extraordinary than as a sad reminder
of the pervasiveness of violence in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical,'' said Donna Peterson, a 26-year-old
stationed with her husband at Fort Campbell, Ky. ``It's nothing
abnormal. If you have kids shooting their teachers, this is bound
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an observation voiced by more than one visitor and
contrasted with a prayer offered by a group of clergy, who voiced
hope that what had passed would not be repeated again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray that there could be healing words that go forth, that
sanity be restored, that violence be negated,'' intoned the Rev.
Jim Pitt from Pittsburg, who knelt in prayer with other clergymen
under the shade of an oak tree near the Capitol after the shooting.
``We unite in great sorrow.''

CLINTON UNWILLING TO TESTIFY BEFORE LEWINSKY JURY, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs first 4 grafs for more information on Starr's subpoena plans
and Clinton's response; eliminates 12th graf on rumors) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr threatening
to subpoena him, President Clinton has told an adviser that he does
not want to testify voluntarily before the federal grand jury
investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter and become the first
sitting president in history to appear before a grand jury, the
adviser said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came earlier this week after prosecutors
working for Starr informed David Kendall, Clinton's personal
lawyer, that they were preparing to serve the president with a
subpoena, senior administration officials and lawyers close to the
case said Friday. One lawyer said Friday night that the subpoena
``is drawn up and ready for delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall immediately reopened negotiations that would allow
Clinton to cooperate with Starr's grand jury without having to
force him to appear at the federal courthouse on Pennsylvania
Avenue, just a few blocks from the White House, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kendall has been trying to work out with Mr. Starr
something that would help insure that the information is provided
that is needed, consistent with the president's view that we should
cooperate,'' said White House press secretary Mike McCurry on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prefers to answer questions at the White House, where he
has given sworn testimony several times to Starr and his
predecessor, Robert Fiske, on a variety of Whitewater-related
matters. Portions of his testimony were later read to grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers close to Clinton said the president would much
prefer cooperating with Starr's prosecutors by providing them with
a videotaped deposition in a White House session or sworn answers
to a list of written questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history,'' one lawyer said. ``We have found ways in
the past to comply with legitimate requests.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Clinton has refused as many as six invitations
by Starr's prosecutors to voluntarily appear before the federal
grand jury that is investigating whether he had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 25-year-old former White House
intern, and then sought to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   According to an adviser of Clinton who insisted on anonymity,
Clinton expressed ``strong'' feelings in a recent conversation that
he did not want to appear in person before Starr's grand jury,
which is impaneled at the federal courthouse near Capitol Hill. The
adviser said Clinton views Starr's inquiry as unfair, politically
motivated and even illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   When told about those remarks, a member of Clinton's legal team
said the president is prone to fits of anger and frustration with
the six-month-old Starr investigation. The lawyer said Clinton's
strategy is to attempt to negotiate a compromise with Starr's
office, rather than risk provoking a constitutional confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars are sharply divided on whether a sitting
president can be forced to take the stand in a criminal
investigation, or whether a grand jury can return an indictment
against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors and White House lawyers also have very
different views over whether a criminal subpoena of the president
is constitutionally permissible. Starr's office believes that such
a subpoena will pass constitutional muster, but Clinton's lawyers
believe only the House of Representatives has such authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, declined to comment
Friday about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said very little about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. In January, shortly after the Lewinsky accusations
surfaced, he and his staff pledged to cooperate in the inquiry. He
said he would like to clear up questions raised by the Lewinsky
matter ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starr chose to subpoena the president, rather than negotiate
the terms of his testimony, the move could prompt Clinton to claim
that constitutional protections shield him from such inquiries. A
member of his legal team, W. Neil Eggleston, is researching the
legal and constitutional questions arising from such a challenge,
but he declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr subpoenaed the president and Clinton chose to fight it,
the court battle surrounding such a move could delay Starr's
inquiry for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous amount of speculation that there
has been a subpoena or the threat of one,'' McCurry said. ``At
least until now, Kendall and Ruff prefer to be in a cooperative,
rather than a confrontational, mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr and Fiske have also questioned Hillary Rodham Clinton at
the White House about the Clintons' business affairs in Arkansas.
In early 1996, Starr ordered Mrs. Clinton to appear before a grand
jury in Washington. Her appearance was demanded after a copy of
some of the billing records from her old law firm mysteriously
surfaced in the residence of the White House nearly two years after
they were first subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday, McCurry said that he did not know the
status of discussions with Starr's office, which began in March.
``I can't tell you what the status of discussions are that the
lawyers are having,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Cooperstown, here they come!
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Skip Caray has brought some extra scorecards. The
substitutes are coming in a day early for orientation. The cars and
planes are all arranged. The Braves radio crew is ready for a day
of hooky.
</P>
<P>
   The car leaves the William Penn Hotel 9 a.m. Sunday to take Skip
Caray, Pete Van Wieren, Joe Simpson and WSB engineer Dave Baker to
a TBS corporate jet, where they will fly to Utica, N.Y., and then
on to Cooperstown, where as invited guests, they will witness
broadcast partner Don Sutton's induction into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Pete if we all had a rope with knots in it that we all
had to hold on to,'' said Simpson. ``He said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In their absense, WSB has brought in University of Georgia radio
voice Larry Munson and Hawks play-by-play man Steve Holman to
handle Sunday's Braves-Pirates game. Munson was an original member
of the Braves radio crew after the club moved from Milwaukee.
Holman's baseball experience stems primarily from watching the
Boston Red Sox in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   The TV schedule was arranged that Fox Sports South (with Bob
Rathbun and Ernie Johnson) will handle Sunday, freeing up the
entire crew. They will return by company jet and catch up with the
club in Cincinnati Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I sometimes get in trouble when I say things about
management,'' Caray said, ``but they have been great about this.
They didn't have to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez still absent
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez did not rejoin the club Friday as anticipated,
remaining in Atlanta another day while his wife, Marisol, is
treated for a gall bladder condition. The reserve catcher called
the club earlier in the day to inform manager Bobby Cox he was
waiting for his mother to arrive from Venezuela to help take care
of the couple's two children.
</P>
<P>
   While Perez is expected back for tonight's game, second baseman
Tony Graffanino has found a new hobby. He caught a Greg Maddux
bullpen session Thursday in his first work ever as a catcher and
found himself better for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had on the mask and shinnies and everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off
</P>
<P>
   Facing Pittsburgh left-hander Chris Peters, Cox used Gerald
Williams as his lead-off man for the fourth time this season. While
he has been modestly successful when used in the role _ 2-for-12,
two walks, two runs, two stolen bases _ Williams has seen enough in
his nearly four months as a Brave to know leading off in Atlanta
can be a more significant job than in some other ports-of-call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you understand what the identity of the team is, it's
important to get on and get into position to score,'' said
Williams, who came into the game hitting .300 (6-for-20) since the
All-Star break. ``With the pitching staff we have, it's very
important that we score first. That gives the guys a chance to get
into the rhythm and flow of the game easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves came into the game at 51-11 when they score first.
</P>
<P>
   Medical update
</P>
<P>
   Cox's bench remains thin due to injury. Shortstop Walt Weiss
(strained left quadricep) reports he is much better but has not
attempted to run in five days and may not play this entire road
trip. Michael Tucker (jammed left ankle) was available for
pinch-hitting again Friday but has been able to stay off his foot
while the Braves have faced the left-handed Peters. If the Pirates
had started a righty Friday night? ``I started and gone deep
twice,'' said Tucker, who was lying.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lone gunman shot his way into the Capitol Friday,
killing two policemen and scattering terrified tourists who hid
behind statues and fled down historic corridors in the world's
best-known symbol of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old female bystander was seriously injured with
gunshot wounds in the face and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Identified by Washington police as Russell E. Weston, 42, a
native of Valmeyer, Ill., the gunman was recovering at a Washington
hospital from gunshot wounds in his chest and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said he was known to the U.S. Secret
Service because of reported threats to President Clinton two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The slain policemen were Jacob Chestnut, a uniformed member of
the Capitol police force assigned to the door through which Weston
allegedly entered, and John Gibson, a security specialist assigned
to House Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The woman bystander was identified by officials at George
Washington University Medical Center as Angela Dickerson,
apparently a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who had been briefed on the incident by
police said Weston, who the Associated Press said now lives in
Missoula, Mont., had parked his car several blocks from the
Capitol, walked to a front entrance and walked around a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   When Officer Chestnut attempted to stop him, Weston turned and
shot him, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then went a few feet further into the Capitol where
he was confronted by Gibson. Seconds later, members of DeLay's
staff said they could hear the exchange of shots between Gibson and
Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William H. Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon, rushed to the
Capitol after seeing a television report on the shootings and began
giving victims first aid.
</P>
<P>
   He then accompanied the ambulance that transported Weston to a
Washington, D.C. General Hospital, helping paramedics resuscitate
the gunman, who had been shot three times.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman said Weston was in recovery following
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the shooting, Frist had presided over the Senate
and recessed it for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The House had finished its business for the day and was in a
period traditionally reserved for members to make one-minute
speeches on topics of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the staff of Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the
explosion of gunfire outside Boehner's Capitol hideaway office
echoed through the marble corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holt, a Boehner staffer, described hearing, ``Bang! Bang!
Bang! Scream!''
</P>
<P>
   Members of DeLay's staff said after the first gunfire, Gibson
pushed them into the office and closed the door before turning to
confront the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists who had been making their way through the statue- and
portrait-lined corridor, screamed and scrambled for exits.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he crouched behind a pillar and called to members
of his family, trying to determine if they were all right.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders deplored the tragedy in the Capitol,
traditionally known as ``the People's House'' and Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., canceled a weekend trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and representatives of the Capitol police
force emphasized that the Capitol security system was sound and
noted that the gunman was unable to advance more than a few feet
beyond the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the People's House and I deplore the action of the
person who brought violence within these sacred halls,'' Gingrich
said in a statement. He noted that without the two officers'
actions many more persons in the Capitol could have been shot.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed sadness at the incident and called
Gingrich from Camp David, where he had gone for the weekend, to
express condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the word came down that two of their comrades had
died, two uniformed policemen walked out on the roof of the Capitol
and lowered the flapping American flag to half mast.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said he was talking to a Capitol
policeman across Independence Avenue from the Capitol when he heard
the call for help on the officer's radio and the report that two
guards were down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sad. I know most of these officers. We see them
every day that we're in session,'' said Lewis. Asked what questions
were running through his mind, Lewis said, ``How did this happen,
and why? Was the person acting alone? How did this happen to a
building as secure as the United States Capitol?''
</P>
<P>
   There will have to be a review about what happened, Lewis said,
but he added that the Capitol can't be sealed off from the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best symbol of democracy in the world,'' he said.
``You can't lock it down. It has to be accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Capitol is ``very, very secure. It's probably one
of the most secure buildings not only in the country but in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting occurred, the Davis family from Hamilton,
Texas, were inside the Capitol being given a tour by a staffer of
Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tense,'' said Brad Davis, describing how his
wife, Karen, 11-year-old daughter, Laura, and 13-year-old son,
Barry, were ``rounded up'' and shuffled from room to room for about
an hour as the investigation was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for all of us, not only here in Washington but
across the country,'' said Assistant District Police Chief Charles
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a native of England, stood on the Senate side of
the Capitol's front steps, his gray slacks spattered with blood and
described one of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just big bangs _ just like fireworks, really,'' Beamish
said, describing the fatal shots. ``Loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamish did not know which of the two slain officers he saw
being shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the officer fall to the ground. He was shot in the head.
I wanted to help him but many officers went to him. His lips moved
and he was trying to say something,'' Beamish said, his voice
softening.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Simon, 23, of Wilmington, N.C., said she hid by a window
and was afraid to move after she heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Still trembling an hour after the incident, she said that she
had been in the immediate area of the shooting ``10 seconds''
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just had some angels around me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As emergency room personnel at George Washington University
Medical Center attempted to save the life of Officer Gibson, police
squad cars periodically arrived, bringing family members who were
escorted into the hospital by the officers.

ACCORD WOULD INCREASE IMMIGRATION OF SKILLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mich., Pa., S.D., Texas)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate Republican leaders reached
agreement Friday on a bill to increase the number of foreign
computer programmers, engineers and other skilled workers who can
be admitted to the United States to fill job openings at
high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the annual limit on the number of visas for
such workers, now 65,000, would rise to 115,000 over three years,
an increase of 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies and their chief executives, including Bill
Gates of Microsoft Corp., have lobbied heavily for an increase in
the quota, saying that their industry suffers from shortages of
qualified employees and that they desperately need skilled foreign
workers to help develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for those who care about the critical
high-tech sector of our economy,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, the
Michigan Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration. ``There is probably no more important
legislation that Congress will pass this year to create jobs and
continue the enormous growth of the high-tech and computer
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Senate passed a similar bill in May by a vote
of 78- 20, with support from many Democrats, including their floor
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. But the legislation bogged
down in the House, prompting Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
Republican leaders, from both chambers, to meet this week and help
work out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said the situation was urgent. The 1998 cap on the visas
for the skilled workers was reached on May 7, he said, and since
then ``no company, university or nonprofit organization in America
has been able to hire these highly skilled professionals'' from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said he expected the Senate and the House to approve the
compromise before lawmakers leave town for their summer recess
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, had expressed skepticism
that there were labor shortages in the computer industry. But on
Friday he said, ``This agreement is good for business, good for
workers, good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had threatened to veto the bill if it did not
do enough to protect U.S. workers. But administration officials
said they welcomed changes reflected in the compromise bill, which
was written in part to address the president's concerns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There has clearly been some progress in our direction,'' said
Gene Sperling, assistant to the president for economic policy,
``but it's unclear at this point whether things have improved
enough for us to support it. We need to see the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise legislation would require a company to certify,
before hiring a foreign worker, that it had tried to recruit a U.S.
worker for the opening and that it had not laid off an American to
hire the foreigner. Congressional aides said this requirement would
not apply to big companies like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems Inc.,
where foreign workers perform important jobs but account for a
small proportion of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Abraham said the agreement also included his proposal
to provide training for unemployed U.S. workers and college
scholarships for low-income students, so that they could pursue
careers in high-tech industries. The training and scholarships
would be financed with fees to be collected from employers who use
the foreign-worker program, but the amount has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is in fact a shortage of high-tech workers is a
hotly debated question. An industry group, the Information
Technology Association of America, says there are 346,000 openings,
amounting to 10 percent of all U.S. jobs for computer programmers,
engineers and systems analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Labor Department, the AFL-CIO and several groups
representing U.S. engineers say the high-tech industry, trying to
hold down its labor costs by hiring from abroad, has overstated the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   India provides by far the largest number of skilled foreign
workers under the special-visa program. Its citizens received 44
percent of the visas, known as H-1B visas, issued in the first half
of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The next largest share went to China, with 9 percent, Britain (5
percent) and the Philippines and Canada (3 percent each). Japan,
Germany, Pakistan and France each received 2 percent of the visas,
with other countries getting 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One person who may be affected by the legislation is Valenita
Videva, 26, from Macedonia. She came to the United States in 1995
on a student visa and studied mechanical engineering at Norwich
University in Vermont. She graduated at the top of her class and
was hired by Texas Instruments Inc. after gaining a one-year work
authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorization expired on June 1, leaving Ms. Videva
unable to work and unsure whether she could stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applied for an H-1B visa two months before my work permit
was to expire,'' Ms. Videva said in a telephone interview from the
Texas Instruments office in Attleboro, Mass. ``I was told that the
quota was reached for this year. Until today it was so deadlocked,
I started losing hope. It meant that I would have packed my things
and told my landlord I was going home, and that's not something I
wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would provide 20,000 additional visas this year,
for a 1998 total of 85,000. It would raise the annual limit to
95,000 next year, 105,000 in 2000 and 115,000 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Klink, a Democrat from a Pennsylvania district that has
lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years,
criticized the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shame,'' Klink said. ``This is a loophole for big
companies to hire cheap indentured labor. It's a huge loss to
American workers, especially young people who have made their
educational decisions based on an expectation of jobs when they get
out of school. Instead, these companies will be hiring cheaper
foreigners.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Smoltz gets 3-hitter as Braves roll
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The question may no longer be: When will John
Smoltz get well?
</P>
<P>
   At least Friday night, it became: When was John Smoltz better?
</P>
<P>
   With Andres Galarraga's 33rd homer serving to sway the night,
the Braves dropped Pittsburgh 3-0 in the first game of a weekend
series at Three Rivers Stadium, Atlanta winning its first three of
the current nine-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But another strong start by Smoltz (9-2) in what is becoming a
midseason crescendo left the Pirates helpless. Since returning from
the DL June 20, Smoltz is now 5-2 and has won four consecutive
starts since the All-Star break. In 1997, Smoltz did not win his
ninth game until his 23rd start. He did so Friday in his 15th
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was Smoltz's first complete game and shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tonight send out Denny Neagle (10-8) against Pirates
right-hander Francisco Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga gave Atlanta a 3-0 lead in the fifth with his homer,
coming with Chipper Jones on base. The homer, which carried into a
table-and-chairs area in the Bullpen Lounge above the left-field
wall, was Galarraga's third in his last 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   It also left him the leader among active players for most homers
hit in Three Rivers. With three this season, Galarraga has hit 21
career homers in Pittsburgh, just four fewer than Hall of Famer
Mike Schmidt, whose 25 is the most all-time by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz received outstanding defensive help. Gerald Williams
crashed the wall in right field to take away a double from Kevin
Young in the fourth inning. Play was delayed for stadium workers to
replace a section of padding Williams knocked loose in the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga later saved a run in the fifth when, with Al Martin on
second, Lou Collier sent a ball into the hole to Galarraga's right.
The first baseman made a rolling stop and flipped to Smoltz
covering the base to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves put men on base in each of the first four innings but
could only cash in during the first, when Tony Graffanino sent an
opposite-field double into the right-field corner. Chipper Jones
singled him to third and Galarraga brought him in on a fielder's
choice for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four innings, Pirates starter Chris Peters allowed
five hits while his infield made two errors behind him and still
the Braves could score just once, stranding five men, three of them
in scoring position.

   STOCK PRICES ARE MIXED, CAPPING LOSS-RIDDEN WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Stocks seesawed Friday to finish mixed, closing out the worst
week for the market since January on investor concern that
corporate profit growth is faltering. Gateway led a decline in
computer stocks after reporting unexpectedly weak earnings, while
Pepsico gained after saying it might spin off some bottling
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.38 points, to 8,937.36,
after swinging up as much as 69 points and down 65 points. For the
week, the Dow average lost 400.6 points, or 4.3 percent, from last
Friday's record, though it is still up 13 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds declined, leaving the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue

   WASHINGTON _ He wore khaki pants and a green fedora with a
feather, witnesses said Friday, as any tourist might. But he was
armed with a six-shot Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver, and almost as soon
as he traded the July heat for the cool of the Capitol, the
authorities said, he opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and the authorities described a sudden and shocking
burst of shots after Officer Jacob Chestnut asked Russell Eugene
Weston Jr. to pass through a metal detector, like every other
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists screamed and stampeded, Weston left Chestnut
mortally wounded on the floor, the authorities said. His path into
the Capitol was blocked by other officers, they said, so he turned
left toward a door marked private that opens onto the ``rabbit
warren,'' as insiders call the maze of offices belonging to Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the door, Special Agent John Gibson of the Capitol police
force was shouting at staff members to hit the floor. Witnesses and
the authorities offered conflicting versions of what came next. The
authorities said Gibson and Weston traded shots that cut each other
down, but not before Weston reached the first office of DeLay's
extensive suite.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later some 10 officers surrounded Weston, their guns
trained at his head, said two of DeLay's aides. The office carpet
was soaked in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the echoing marble hallways of the Capitol's first
floor, the visitors' blend of boredom, curiosity and awe had turned
to bedlam as shell casings scattered across the stone floor and
officers shouted at them to get out. In the fusillade, one
bystander, Angela Dickerson, had been wounded in the face and
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Some people took refuge behind pillars; others simply crouched
where they stood.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from England, said that he
bent over a wounded police officer _ it must have been Chestnut _
feeling for a pulse as the officer muttered words he could not make
out. ``I yelled, get a stretcher,'' said Beamish, whose khaki pants
were stained with blood. ``There was blood coming from his head,
and one eye looked as if it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone had had the presence of mind to summon Sen. Bill Frist
of Tennessee off the floor of the Senate. The senator, a heart
surgeon, checked the pulse of one of the wounded, then helped
resuscitate Weston and rode with him to the hospital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a typical lazy July afternoon, and Capitol Hill like the
rest of Washington was easing into the weekend. The last vote had
been taken in the House chamber, and though Congress was still in
session many representatives had already streamed down the broad,
steep steps into the sunshine to their waiting cars.
</P>
<P>
   In DeLay's office, some 50 members had gathered to celebrate the
passage of health care legislation with champagne brought by Rep.
Mark Foley of Florida. Across the hallway, Rep. John Boehner,
another member of the House leadership, was in his hideaway office
performing a ritual that marks the approaching weekend in official
Washington the way margaritas might in the rest of the country:
They were discussing what was likely to be debated on the Sunday
television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 3:40 p.m., the gunfire and the screaming started.
Boehner's staff called the Capitol Police immediately and were told
to lock their door and stay put. In DeLay's suite, some dove under
their desks or ran to the backs of their offices. Staff members
gathered with the congressmen and said a prayer. Many of the aides
would later credit Gibson with saving their lives. Tearful
congressmen would pay the same tribute to both slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the main entrance hallway, Tyvon Crawford, 20, was
working at the small gift shop _ a kiosk, really _ run by the
Capitol Historical Society. ``Someone was making a purchase, and I
heard shots to my right,'' he said. With a co-worker, his manager,
and a passing tourist, he crowded into the booth for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Brown, another worker in the souvenir shop, said that the
first thing he thought to do was duck. ``There was a guy running,
just shooting at anybody he could hit,'' he said. ``When I looked
up, I saw the officer with a hole in his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists and staff heard just three or four shots; others
heard 20 reverberating through the halls. Officers, their weapons
drawn, pushed tourists to the ground to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Ottotta, a radio technician from Rockford, Ill., was
touring the Capitol with his wife, three sons, and mother-in-law
when he heard a sound that he thought was an exhibit crashing to
the floor. He lost track of all his family members in the chaos,
glimpsing one son as he darted off, leaping down stairs into the
crowd. He found all of them safe later.
</P>
<P>
   Judson Threlkeld with his wife, Rachel, was touring the crypt, a
vaulted space on the first floor beneath the House chamber. Four
years ago, he was at the southwest gate of the White House when he
heard what sounded like fireworks; he later learned that a man had
opened fire on the building. This time, upon hearing a bang, his
wife dropped to the floor, and he lay on top of her. ``There was a
pause, and we were afraid he was going to come into the open space
and start firing,'' Threlkeld said. They got up and dashed to hide
behind a pillar. Then, when the Capitol Police ordered them out,
they ran for an exit.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Cleary, the chief legislative aide to Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., was giving a tour of the Capitol to a group of
children including an 11-year-old girl from Belfast, Northern
Ireland, who was visiting the United States as part of a program to
take Irish children away from violence. ``We were trying to isolate
her from this kind of thing, not letting her watch the news,'' Ms.
Cleary said, ``and then this happened.''

BOOKSTORE FOR SERIOUS CATHOLIC READERS CONFRONTS ITS WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.) (jw) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A month ago, when the financial storm clouds hanging
over the Paraclete Book Center in Manhattan grew particularly
menacing, Mary Butler called a meeting. Although Ms. Butler owns
the bookstore, on 74th Street just east of Lexington Avenue, she
believes that it belongs to a larger, amorphous community of
people, some in New York, some spread around the world.
</P>
<P>
   They are the people who have been turning to the Paraclete for
years as a source of serious books on Christian, especially Roman
Catholic, theology and history. And they ought to have a voice, Ms.
Butler thought, in whether the bookstore lived or died.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit surprising that in a city that has a population
roughly 40 percent Catholic and that is a center of intellectual
life, the Paraclete should stand out so sharply. In the five
boroughs, there are dozens of religious bookstores, and, New York
being New York, they include ones specializing in Judaism, Islam,
Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, Yoga, New Age, astrology and
diverse species of witchcraft. They include quite serviceable
Christian bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   But where else but the Paraclete would there be the pile of
books that stood among the outgoing orders last Tuesday? A volume
about the German social theorist Max Horkheimer rested on a book by
Hans Urs von Balthasar, a giant of 20th-century Catholic theology,
on top of a volume by Plotinus, the third-century Neoplatonist, on
top of a work by Edith Stein, the philosopher, Catholic convert
from Judaism, Nazi victim and candidate for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and spirituality constitute a growing sector of the
book market. But that does not necessarily help a store that gains
customers by stocking Thomas Aquinas rather than ``Chicken Soup for
the Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Flourishing Christian bookstores are likely to feature
inspirational CDs, greeting cards, church supplies _ and what Bob
Anderson, president of the evangelical Christian Booksellers
Association, described as state-of-the-art ``ambience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anchor Room, for example, is an evangelical bookstore in
Fort Wayne, Ind. Books occupy only a fraction of its 20,000 square
feet, with other sections devoted to music, video rentals, choir
robes and other apparel, Sunday school teaching aids, wedding
items, children's books and toys, and the Higher Grounds Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the 750-square-foot Paraclete has bad fluorescent
lighting, worn red tile, a patchwork of mismatched shelves and a
system of categories relying heavily on Ms. Butler's impressive
knowledge of virtually every book in the store. It also has a
selection of books that the Anchor Room would not touch, and the
opportunity for hands-on browsing that Internet-based booksellers
still cannot provide. At least that is how one recent visitor
explained why he was carrying home $129 worth of purchases in
religious history.
</P>
<P>
   The Paraclete opened almost a half-century ago. Elizabeth
Sullivan, its founding owner, made the Paraclete an outpost of the
new Catholic thinking that culminated in the Second Vatican
Council. In the 1960s, during and after the council, the business
``grew and grew and grew and grew,'' Ms. Butler recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The serious ups and downs started in 1984,'' said Ms. Butler,
who began working at the store in 1961. She became the owner after
Ms. Sullivan died in 1978. She borrowed money and repaid the loans
as the cash flow fluctuated. But this spring the store found itself
in arrears with publishers and with the landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Independent religious bookstores face the same challenges as all
independent booksellers, said Lynn Garrett, the religion editor for
Publishers Weekly. ``There's just a proliferation of competition,
from chains, from the Web, from other non-bookstore outlets, like
Wal-Mart or Kmart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the best-run stores that do everything right'' have
difficulties, Ms. Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Butler does not pretend that the Paraclete has been doing
everything right. It has not advertised sufficiently. It has a Web
site but has not developed extensive links from other religious
sites. And ``maybe we have not addressed adequately the people in
the parishes for whom our stock of books might be forbidding,'' Ms.
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's meeting with old friends of the Paraclete, a
plan was drafted to confront the store's weaknesses. Now the
question is whether there is enough time. Ms. Butler, who is
nearing 59, would love to put in a couple more years and turn the
Paraclete over in good financial shape to younger owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the difficulties, there is a real sense that we are
doing something that needs to be done and that no one else is
doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently others think so as well. July sales have been strong,
and recently, Ms. Butler received a gift of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel optimistic,'' she said, ``possibly more than I
should.'' &QL;

GREEKS BEAR GIFTS FOR A U.N. SEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ How much is a two-year seat on the Security
Council worth?
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, a couple of Aegean cruises is not too high a
price.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, competing against the Netherlands and Canada for a
``Western Europe and other'' seat, has been entertaining New
York-based diplomats from several dozen countries _ along with
their families _ with trips to Greece and a sea cruise. According
to the diplomatic grapevine, more than 200 people have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have been told that the ``get to know Greece'' tour is
a private venture connected to a coming commemoration of the
Olympic Games, not a campaign pitch. Greek diplomats were not
available to discuss the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say countries curry favor with the 185 members of the
United Nations every year before rotating seats are filled.
Dinners, entertainment and gifts are not unusual, and go largely
unremarked. But an audible buzz surrounds the Greek offering.

NAVY BOOTS MALE, FEMALE SAILORS FOR GROUP SEXUAL INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three female and seven male sailors from the aircraft
carrier USS Abraham Lincoln are being kicked out of the Navy after
a group sexual incident in a Hong Kong hotel room two weeks ago,
Navy officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An eleventh sailor is facing more serious charges that could
result in a military court-martial for sexual assault, said Navy
Lt. Dave Oates, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet Naval Air Forces
headquarters in San Diego. The assault investigation is continuing
and the sailor has not been formally charged, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes as Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his
aides are grappling with how to deal with sexual activity in the
military. Cohen has proposed decriminalizing adultery by revising
the military legal code. That change came in response to the highly
publicized Air Force case of Lt. Kelly Flynn, who faced a
court-martial for adultery and accusations of disobeying orders.
The proposal to lessen the penalties for adultery has sparked some
resistance in the military leadership, particularly the Marine
Corps, out of fears that it may inadvertently weaken military
discipline and order.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on the night of July 6 occurred as the aircraft
carrier was on a six-day port visit to Hong Kong. The ship, which
left Everett, Wash., on June 11 for a six-month deployment to the
western Pacific and Middle East, entered the Persian Gulf on
Thursday, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 remain on board the carrier for now.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 sailors were involved in what another Navy official
described as an off-duty party in the Hong Kong hotel that
degenerated into ``multiple sex acts.'' There were three female and
eight male crew from the carrier in the room. No civilians were
involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, one of the female sailors reported to the
Lincoln's security office that she had been sexually assaulted. The
carrier's commander, Capt. J.J. Quinn, ordered an immediate
investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the three female and 10 of the 11 male sailors were
brought to a ``Captain's Mast'' hearing for nonjudicial punishment
where they were found guilty on charges of adultery, sodomy and
fraternization, Oates said. The 11th sailor is still being
investigated on a more serious charge of alleged sexual assault
which could result in a military court-martial, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The female sailor who disclosed the incident by accusing the
shipmate of sexual assault is one of the three females being kicked
out of the Navy ``based on illicit sexual acts prior to the alleged
sexual assault'' the same night, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was determined the sailor who reported the sexual assault
had also engaged in inappropriate behavior prior to the alleged
assault,'' said Lincoln public affairs officer Lt. Cmdr. Scott
Harris, in an e-mail message to the Puget Sound Navy News, which
published an account of the incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 sailors at the Captain's Mast were reduced in rank one
grade, restricted to the ship for 60 days, and fined 50 percent of
their salary for two months, Oates said. In addition, all 10
sailors are being processed for administrative separation from the
service which, if approved on appeal, could result in them being
discharged with general or other-than-honorable discharges.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sailors involved are described as junior enlisted
personnel with the ranks of seaman or petty officer 3rd class.
</P>
<P>
   The names and ranks of the sailors have been withheld under
terms of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice and federal Privacy
Act which protect the identities of military personnel in
administrative disciplinary hearings. The name of the 11th sailor,
who has not yet been formally charged, likewise is being withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Navy believes it has recovered from the 1991
Tailhook Association scandal where several dozen females were
groped and harassed during the naval aviation convention in Las
Vegas, the latest incident put Navy officials on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   (The Tailhook scandal rocked the Navy and resulted in the
disciplining of 40 officers, including three admirals. The Navy and
Marine Corps pursued 140 harassment cases, but none led to a
court-martial.)
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials yesterday described the Hong Kong incident as an
isolated occurrence in the service, which has had women serving on
combat warships since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other 4,607 sailors who weren't involved in this incident
represented our country with pride and dignity during our port
visit in Hong Kong,'' said Quinn, the Lincoln's commander. ``They
are an awesome group of young men and women dedicated to serving
their country and I am proud to be their commanding officer.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Navy's personnel command in Washington,
D.C., declined to enumerate any other similar incidents involving
male and female sailors. ``We don't have those (records),'' said
Cmdr. Terry McCreary. ``Nobody collects NJPs (nonjudicial
punishment records). It's a local matter, kept administrative at a
local level.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Navy officer, who discussed the incident on grounds his
name not be used, said, ``It's a shame that the actions of 10
sailors are highlighted over the more than 4,500 sailors who are
performing an outstanding and professional job while on
deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 400 female officers and enlisted personnel
assigned to the Lincoln, about 9 percent of the total roster of
4,600 in the ship's crew and embarked carrier air wing.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finger paint, macaroni jewelry and circle time are among the
fundamental building blocks that fill the days of preschoolers at
child care centers.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, a different set of fundamentals make the
fragmented $30 billion child care industry an attractive growth
sector, some analysts and institutional investors say. Those basics
include favorable demographic, economic and political trends and a
quickening pace of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for high-quality child care is booming among dual-income
and single-parent families _ a fact that has not escaped the
deep-pocketed investors who have recently bought three of the
largest for-profit national child-care chains.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal, in March, was the $82 million buyout of
Children's Discovery Center by Knowledge Universe, the privately
held education investment empire being assembled by Michael R.
Milken, the fallen junk-bond king; his brother Lowell, and Lawrence
J. Ellison, chairman of the Oracle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. bought Kindercare
Learning Centers for $576 million, and Chase Manhattan acquired La
Petite Academy, which had been privately held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it this active before,'' said Richard L.
Richards, a Chesterfield, Mo.-based broker of child care centers.
``All the major chains are looking for acquisitions. The most
efficient way to expand is to make a quality acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there may be opportunities for investors,
particularly with almost the entire second tier of publicly traded
child-care companies, trading below their 52-week highs, including
New Horizons Kids Quest of Plymouth, Minn.; Childtime Learning
Centers of Farmington Hills, Mich., and Bright Horizons of Boston
and Corporate Family Solutions of Nashville, which have proposed
merging to form the nation's fifth-largest provider, with 250
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Childcare Network of Columbus, Ga., No. 14 among the
for-profit providers, indicated in an SEC filing that it intended
to make an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The child care companies have much room to grow, said Leslie A.
Nelken, a managing director of ING Baring Furman Selz who tracks
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are companies in their infancy,'' Nelken said. National
for-profit chains operate only 6 percent of all centers, a share
that has not increased since 1975, according to the Child Care
Information Exchange, a monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-third of children under school age are now
enrolled in organized centers, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But trends in politics and commerce are working in the
industry's favor, Nelken said. State and local political leaders
are increasingly calling for more government spending on child
care, especially as efforts to trim welfare rolls are pushing more
single mothers into the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the competition among employers for skilled
workers is resulting in an expansion of child care benefits in the
workplace. More employers will overcome their traditional
reluctance to offer on-site child care once they read statistics
showing that it reduces employee turnover, said Stephanie R.
Leighton, a portfolio manager with Franklin Research in Boston, an
asset manager that specializes in stocks of companies it sees as
socially responsible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Leighton likes Bright Horizons, whose niche is
operating on-site child care centers for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But corporations without on-site centers are also asking the
industry to help reduce worker absences by providing emergency
child care _ a practice that is growing faster than on-site care,
according to surveys by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest players in this niche is Children First, a
privately held Boston concern whose success is already drawing
acquisition offers, said Rosemary Jordano, its president and
founder.
</P>
<P>
   A lackluster stock that has nevertheless attracted some
institutional buying is Nobel Education Dynamics, a Media,
Pa.-based company, which has staked out a niche that does not end
with kindergarten; its programs continue through eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is tremendous value that will start showing in
the next year,'' said Edward F. Carroll, portfolio manager of
Gintel Asset Management, a mutual fund manager in Greenwich, Conn.,
which owns 7 percent of Nobel's shares. That makes Gintel the
second-largest holder, after Milken's Knowledge Universe, at 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel's stock, which now trades at $8.50, has moved in a narrow
range in the last year as the company has spent heavily to hire
managers and curriculum advisers for its ambitious expansion and
acquisition plans, Carroll said. He expects Nobel's expansion to
gear up this year and predicts that the market will reward his
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives speculate that Nobel will be acquired
by Knowledge Universe, based in Burlingame, Calif., at the end of a
six-month stand-still agreement that began on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Nelken of Furman Selz is bullish on Nobel, as he is on
Childtime, which now trades at $20.125. Both are good values
because their share prices don't fully reflect earnings from recent
acquisitions, Nelkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, the broker, said each niche in the child-care industry
presented its own risks. Operators of conventional neighborhood
centers, for example, avoid the insecurity of dealing with
corporate clients that can terminate a contract more or less at
will, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be difficult and expensive to obtain suitable sites
for new centers that can handle up to 150 children, pushing
expansion into distant suburbs or unconventional properties. (The
privately held Mulberry Child Care Center chain recently converted
a former water pumping station in Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The more difficult it is to build, the more likely it will
take deep pockets to risk expansion,'' Richards said.

NEW JAPANESE PREMIER IS CHOSEN OVER STRONG OPPOSITION

 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was elected
president of the governing party Friday and will become prime
minister, despite an extraordinary open revolt against his
candidacy within his own party and overwhelming public sentiment
against him.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has reigned
over postwar Japan virtually unchallenged except for a brief fall
from power in 1993, Obuchi will be Japan's 23rd prime minister
since World War II. He could assume the post as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   He will take the job as Japan faces its worst financial crisis
in decades, with banks staggering under bad loans, a pension system
on the verge of bankruptcy, and rising unemployment. Japan's allies
will be pressing Obuchi to take quick, decisive measures to revive
Japan's economy, or risk dragging the rest of the world into a
prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi will also have to restore the confidence of Japanese
voters, many of whom are wracked with concerns about their future
as unemployment rises and the public pension fund is running dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to eliminate people's anxiety,'' Obuchi said at a
press conference following his election.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi has no record of bold leadership, and his economic
pledges have already been criticized for failing to go far enough.
He has promised to cut taxes and spend additional money to
stimulate the economy, but many economists believe that he must
move almost immediately to insure passage of sweeping banking
reforms that have not received legislative approval and then
continue pursuing the widespread efforts to deregulate the economy
that were a hallmark of his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, believe that Obuchi can capitalize on
the very consensus-building strengths that enabled him to win the
election despite opposition. ``His election reflects the sense of
the LDP, although it is not the sense of the people,'' said Yukio
Okamoto, a political consultant. ``Mr. Obuchi has an advantage in
that expectations are so low at the beginning that whatever he
does, he can turn it to an advantage if he steps forward in a
decisive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became party president after a spectacle all but unheard
of in Japanese politics: an open effort to defeat a candidate
anointed by most of the ruling party elders, and a public race to
compete for the post of party leader. In the past, a party
president emerged from a smoke-filled room after hours of wheeling
and dealing among faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, supporters of Obuchi's rivals, Seiroku Kajiyama
and Junichiro Koizumi, actively lobbied party elders, even passing
out copies of newspapers containing public opinion polls showing
Obuchi's lack of popularity. Obuchi's challengers spoke their minds
in endless rounds of television shows and actually tried to
campaign on policy, although they were hampered somewhat by the
fact that they shared many of the same ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether these stirrings of rebellion
foreshadow changes within the Liberal Democratic Party. Many of the
rebels ended up voting for Obuchi, and most pledged their support
for him Friday. But voter disenchantment has been growing as
Japan's economy falters, and public opinion polls suggest that the
party might lose control of the powerful lower house of the
Legislature if elections are held soon.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders are already calling for a dissolution of the
lower house. They hope to capitalize on public anger and win a
majority there. Japanese voters sent a warning message of their
displeasure in upper house elections July 12, when the LDP
unexpectedly lost control of the chamber. The party's defeat led
the current prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the LDP president who was greeted with the biggest
amount of disappointment ever,'' said Kazuo Shii, chief secretary
of the Japan Communist Party, which has been gaining popularity
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi recognizes his lack of voter appeal. ``I am inferior to
the other candidates in general popularity,'' he said. ``I know
well that popularity among the people and popularity in the party
should match each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would try to travel around the country and the
world to expose people to his way of thinking and his personality.
``It is now difficult to achieve anything with only support in
Nagatocho and Kasumigaseki,'' Obuchi said, referring to the areas
in Tokyo where the party and the government, respectively, are
located.
</P>
<P>
   The markets, which favored Kajiyama because he promised to
restructure the banking system, reacted with barely a quiver.
Obuchi has been regarded as the front runner for some time, and the
yen actually gained against the dollar after news of his election
broke. The stock market closed before the vote was completed.
</P>
<P>
   But the despair among those who supported Kajiyama and Koizumi
was palpable. Kajiyama received 102 of the 411 votes cast, while
Koizumi captured only 84, indicating that members of his own
faction voted for his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was betrayed,'' said Makiko Tanaka, a non-aligned party
member who voted for Koizumi, currently the health and welfare
minister, in spite of a recent, widely quoted comment in which she
characterized him as eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   She said she voted for him because her constituents favored him.
``Among the public, opinion of Koizumi-san is very high,'' she
said. ``And I think it is the job of a Diet member not only to act
on one's own thoughts but also to listen to constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   That's rare thinking in the party, although there are
undoubtedly more than a few junior members who voted for Obuchi who
are worrying about how their constituents will react. Many voted
for the foreign minister under pressure from factional leaders,
although people back in their districts had encouraged them to
select one of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Obuchi's victory strongly suggest traditional ways of
handling party business are alive and well. While many were
predicting that he would fail to secure a majority on the first
vote, 225 members wrote his name on their ballot sheets, giving him
a comfortable margin of support.
</P>
<P>
   That vote underscored Obuchi's one proven strength: his ability
to coax a fractious party membership to coalesce. He used his
advantage as the leader of the largest faction to attract other
faction leaders, who then pressured their members to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of votes was just what we expected,'' said Yoshimi
Watanabe, an Obuchi supporter. ``From now on, LDP will not be
split. We will unite under the new party chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity, if achieved, will help Obuchi push through the tough
measures that will be needed to fix the banking system, revise the
tax system and bolster the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised a 6 trillion yen tax cut and a 10 trillion yen
supplementary budget, although at his press conference Friday he
said they were not ``completely a concrete figure.''
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed his commitment to overhauling the tax system,
saying he would like to lower both the highest individual income
tax bracket and the corporate tax rate, both of which are high by
international standards. ``Otherwise, we should worry about a large
amount of capital flight in this globalized economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is talk of defections from the party or withholding
votes when the lower house officially votes to elect Obuchi as
prime minister, even his biggest critics say they will cast their
vote for him. ``At least he should be given a chance,'' said Taro
Kono, a young legislator who worked tirelessly on behalf of
Kajiyama's campaign. ``He is now our president. I will vote for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kono and others are keenly awaiting Obuchi's cabinet picks.
If his choices are regarded as ``the appropriate people for the
appropriate posts,'' a phrase now of the lips of everyone in the
party, he will gain the confidence of the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Should he fill his cabinet and the party's ranks based on
factional seniority, however, their worst fears will be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, factional considerations governed this vote, in spite
of junior members' demands that factions be disregarded in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, given the open campaign for party president,
they were. And, in the end, a few party members did brave their
leaderships' wrath and crossed faction lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the power of the party's hierarchy
prevailed. Up-and-comers in the senior ranks like Koichi Kato, the
party's secretary-general, and Taku Yamasaki, chairman of its
Policy Research Council, feared that their own chances of becoming
prime minister in a few years would dim if the factional system
were thrown to the wind, and they worked hard to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is clear that generational politics will
continue to threaten that system. The challenge will come from
younger members who are educated abroad and have less ability to
distribute pork to their constituents than more established
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation went about this in a really
straightforward manner,'' said Kono. ``The others, they all thought
about their futures. I don't think they thought about the people or
the party or the country.''

COMMENTARY: LIFE WITH A SECOND ACT AND A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind that Jack Ryan was dead. Everyone agreed
he looked sharp. ``This is the best dressed Jack's been in a long
time,'' said Keith Haskins, who helps run a center for the elderly
on Delancey Street where John D. Ryan used to pass his days. ``He
wouldn't spend a penny on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That got a small, knowing laugh from some of the 40 other
mourners who were at the Guidetti Funeral Home, on Spring Street,
the other morning. They knew Ryan better in an old shirt and even
older pants, forever wearing a red baseball cap that now hung near
his coffin. But he looked grand, they said, in the unfamiliar black
suit and tie, clasping a rosary to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   There is no particular reason why you should have heard of Jack
Ryan, who was 83 when he breathed his last on July 11. ``There
isn't really anything outstanding about me,'' he once told Cal
Hedigan, who was in charge of the house where he lived on East
Fourth Street, a residence for poor elderly people run by a
nonprofit group called the Bowery Residents' Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never committed any terrible crime,'' he told her. ``Never
did anything great. I just sort of survived, more or less.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to those who thought they knew him, much of Ryan's past was
lost in a haze. He was born in Manhattan and grew up here. He
worked here and there. He had a wife, but no children. He drank too
much after his wife died in 1961. And he found himself on the
Bowery. These days, people would say he was homeless. The word back
then was more direct, if less kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you might have thought of him as a traditional _ what
should I say? _ bum,'' said Bill Kavanagh, a friend and a
down-and-outer himself once, not from the drink but from a ruinous
inability to stay away from slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few of Ryan's mourners were white-haired men who
also had landed on the Bowery when it was a synonym for skid row.
Now the homeless are everywhere, and the Bowery is on the
gentrifiers' map.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there is much point in getting sloppy-sentimental about
the old days of hard-drinking men who filled countless flophouses.
Still, there was a wispy, end-of-an-era feel to this funeral as the
old-timers shuffled into Guidetti's, down the block from benches
where young people were sitting outside Balthazar and having
breakfasts of coffee and brioches.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for the service to begin, some of the mourners
talked quietly. ``I saw Jack one day, and we were talking about
drinking,'' one elderly man said to a friend. ``I asked him, `When
was the last time you had a good time drinking?' And then I thought
to myself, `Jeez, when was the last time I had a good time
drinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not really about the drinking life. It is about how
Jack Ryan touched his last drop of booze in 1974, about how he read
a lot and studied French. He picked up money changing beds at a
hotel on the Lower East Side, but he never seemed to spend any of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1985, he got interested in art; he was lured, someone
recalled, by an art therapist with a soft voice and a pretty face.
In time, this interest blossomed into a passion, and he would paint
away most days at the center on Delancey. He worked in pastels and
favored seascapes, some of which Susan Pustilnik, an artist friend,
placed next to his coffin.
</P>
<P>
   He was not a man of many words. ``He wouldn't let you get too
close,'' Haskins said. All the same, he connected with people in
interesting ways. One man stood up at the funeral to say that Ryan
had taught him about painting. Bill Kavanagh said that painting
alongside Ryan at the center ``gave me back my self-respect.'' Yet
another man said of Ryan, ``I managed to stay sober on the Bowery
for many years, and he helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he died, officials at the Bowery Residents' Committee
discovered to their amazement that he was not broke. He had managed
to save about $70,000, presumably money earned at the hotel, and he
left word that it should all go to the committee. ``He just socked
everything away,'' said Joan Malin, the group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   You may read any lesson you want in this tale, or none at all.
But the amazing ability of people to reinvent themselves, and
surprise you, is not a bad thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that if you have a little faith in people ...''
Kavanagh said, and his voice trailed off.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lone gunman shot his way into the Capitol Friday,
killing two policemen and scattering terrified tourists who hid
behind statues and fled down historic corridors in the world's
best-known symbol of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old female bystander was seriously injured with
gunshot wounds in the face and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Identified by Washington police as Russell E. Weston, 42, a
native of Valmeyer, Ill., the gunman was recovering at a Washington
hospital from gunshot wounds in his chest and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said he was known to the U.S. Secret
Service because of reported threats to President Clinton two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The slain policemen were Jacob Chestnut, a uniformed member of
the Capitol police force assigned to the door through which Weston
allegedly entered, and John Gibson, a security specialist assigned
to House Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The woman bystander was identified by officials at George
Washington University Medical Center as Angela Dickerson,
apparently a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress who had been briefed on the incident by
police said Weston, who the Associated Press said now lives in
Missoula, Mont., had parked his car several blocks from the
Capitol, walked to a front entrance and walked around a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   When Officer Chestnut attempted to stop him, Weston turned and
shot him, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then went a few feet further into the Capitol where
he was confronted by Gibson. Seconds later, members of DeLay's
staff said they could hear the exchange of shots between Gibson and
Weston.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William H. Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon, rushed to the
Capitol after seeing a television report on the shootings and began
giving victims first aid.
</P>
<P>
   He then accompanied the ambulance that transported Weston to a
Washington, D.C. General Hospital, helping paramedics resuscitate
the gunman, who had been shot three times.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman later said Weston was in recovery
following surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the shooting, Frist had presided over the Senate
and recessed it for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The House had finished its business for the day and was in a
period traditionally reserved for members to make one-minute
speeches on topics of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the staff of Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the
explosion of gunfire outside Boehner's Capitol hideaway office
echoed through the marble corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Holt, a Boehner staffer, described hearing, ``Bang! Bang!
Bang! Scream!''
</P>
<P>
   Members of DeLay's staff said after the first gunfire, Gibson
pushed them into the office and closed the door before turning to
confront the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists who had been making their way through the statue- and
portrait-lined corridor, screamed and scrambled for exits.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he crouched behind a pillar and called to members
of his family, trying to determine if they were all right.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders deplored the tragedy in the Capitol,
traditionally known as ``the People's House'' and Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., canceled a weekend trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and representatives of the Capitol police
force emphasized that the Capitol security system was sound and
noted that the gunman was unable to advance more than a few feet
beyond the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the People's House and I deplore the action of the
person who brought violence within these sacred halls,'' Gingrich
said in a statement. He noted that without the two officers'
actions many more persons in the Capitol could have been shot.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed sadness at the incident and called
Gingrich from Camp David, where he had gone for the weekend, to
express condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the word came down that two of their comrades had
died, two uniformed policemen walked out on the roof of the Capitol
and lowered the flapping American flag to half mast.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said he was talking to a Capitol
policeman across Independence Avenue from the Capitol when he heard
the call for help on the officer's radio and the report that two
guards were down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sad. I know most of these officers. We see them
every day that we're in session,'' said Lewis. Asked what questions
were running through his mind, Lewis said, ``How did this happen,
and why? Was the person acting alone? How did this happen to a
building as secure as the United States Capitol?''
</P>
<P>
   There will have to be a review about what happened, Lewis said,
but he added that the Capitol can't be sealed off from the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best symbol of democracy in the world,'' he said.
``You can't lock it down. It has to be accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the Capitol is ``very, very secure. It's probably one
of the most secure buildings not only in the country but in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting occurred, the Davis family from Hamilton,
Texas, were inside the Capitol being given a tour by a staffer of
Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty tense,'' said Brad Davis, describing how his
wife, Karen, 11-year-old daughter, Laura, and 13-year-old son,
Barry, were ``rounded up'' and shuffled from room to room for about
an hour as the investigation was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for all of us, not only here in Washington but
across the country,'' said Assistant District Police Chief Charles
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a native of England, stood on the Senate side of
the Capitol's front steps, his gray slacks spattered with blood and
described one of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just big bangs _ just like fireworks, really,'' Beamish
said, describing the fatal shots. ``Loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamish did not know which of the two slain officers he saw
being shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the officer fall to the ground. He was shot in the head.
I wanted to help him but many officers went to him. His lips moved
and he was trying to say something,'' Beamish said, his voice
softening.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Simon, 23, of Wilmington, N.C., said she hid by a window
and was afraid to move after she heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Still trembling an hour after the incident, she said that she
had been in the immediate area of the shooting ``10 seconds''
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just had some angels around me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As emergency room personnel at George Washington University
Medical Center attempted to save the life of Officer Gibson, police
squad cars periodically arrived, bringing family members who were
escorted into the hospital by the officers.

   WASHINGTON _ The first burst of noise was loud, ``as if you had
a platter of silverware that was 500 pounds, and it all spilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Then somebody opened the door, and the noise was inside _ inside
an office suite in a building where things like this don't happen,
where bullets don't smash into walls above your head and where you
don't wonder if you're going to die while you hide under your desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dove under my desk during the second round of shots, and I
was there like five seconds, and I decided if this guy is coming
through picking people off, I'm going to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Rudy, policy advisor to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, jumped up in time to see his boss headed toward the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled at him to get back,'' Rudy said. ``At that point, you
don't know if there was a hit on him or if there was another person
or what.''
</P>
<P>
   There was just one person: a man who brought a gun into the U.S.
Capitol on a summery Friday afternoon and shot the first Capitol
Police officer who challenged him. Steps away, inside the secret
door to DeLay's office suite, officer John Gibson was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the guy opened the door, or our officer opened the
door,'' Rudy said. Gunfire erupted as staffers dove for cover. The
last exchange of bullets downed the gunman and cost Gibson his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved our lives,'' Rudy said of the officer. ``He saved our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people work in DeLay's office on the first floor of the
Capitol, handling the business of the No. 3 Republican in the House
and rounding up the votes to pass legislation. Friday's big vote _
on health-care reform _ had been a squeaker, passing by a mere six
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The last vote was cast at 3:13 p.m. Friday, Washington time,
early enough for most House members to hustle past the tourists
crowding the Capitol hallways and beat it to the airport for a
quick weekend visit to their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:40 p.m., 27 minutes after the House vote, at a door mere
feet from DeLay's office, a man pushed past the blaring metal
detector and shot Officer Jacob Chestnut, who later died of his
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, a former press officer for DeLay, was on the phone with a
reporter when the first shots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was gunfire, but you don't know,'' he said. ``I
was on the phone, and I said, 'Oh, my God, gunfire,' then, 'holy
----, it's in here.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Officer Gibson, a member of DeLay's personal
security detail, met the man with the gun.
</P>
<P>
   From his carpeted office on the opposite side of the suite,
DeLay ran toward the noise, pausing to push two or three staffers
to safety in his own office. Rudy shouted him back, and he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, twenty seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how long Rudy counted from the first noise inside the
office until Officer Gibson was mortally wounded, and the gunman
was down on the carpet next to the office systems manager. Other
officers rushed to Gibson's aid, while one straddled the
unconscious gunman, pointing a sidearm at his head and screaming at
him to drop his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, if it wasn't for Officer Gibson, numerous
members of the staff would have been killed,'' Rudy said. ``The guy
wouldn't have stopped until he ran out of bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson died after a helicopter carried him to a Washington
trauma center.
</P>
<P>
   To DeLay's staff, he was still alive early Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has been with us since the beginning,'' Rudy said, unable
to shake the present tense. ``He's part of the family . . . . He
comes up asking for the Boston papers, because he's a big U. Mass.
fan and a Red Sox fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox played in Boston last night. At least they got to be
at home.

SPARKS TRAVEL TO DETROIT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Sparks begin a three-game road trip today at 11
when they play the Detroit Shock for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' 6-foot-5 center Lisa Leslie, who did not play in the
Sparks' 70-68 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on Thursday, remains
listed as day-to-day. She injured her right wrist, ankle and groin
in a 92-77 loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Van Emrbricqs, who replaced Leslie, clinched the victory
over the Mercury with two free throws with 1:06 remaining. Tamecka
Dixon, the Sparks' second-leading scorer (15.9) behind Leslie
(19.1), scored a season-high 23 points and Penny Toler added 21,
one below her career-high. The Sparks are 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, coached by Nancy Lieberman-Cline who played for Phoenix
last season, is 10-9 after defeating the Washington Mystics, 76-61,
Wednesday. Carla Porter had a season-high 19 points. The Mystics
are led by Korie Hlede (14.3 points, 5.2 rebounds), Sandy Brondello
(13.2, 4.0), and former Long Beach State All-American Cindy Brown
(11.5, 9.6).
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks continue their road trip at Cleveland on Monday and
Washington on Wednesday before returning home for a final meeting
against Phoenix on July 31.

INVESTIGATORS IN COLLAPSE FOCUS ON SUPPORT BEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI and JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators looking into the causes of the buckling
of a giant construction scaffold in Times Square on Tuesday are
focusing on whether critical support beams at the 21st floor were
disconnected by workers just days before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scaffolding is so unstable, investigators have been
able to look at it only from a distance, so they have yet to
determine the status of the beams. But they say their absence,
coupled with the stress from a rising construction elevator, could
have caused the buckling of the section of the 48-story scaffold at
the Conde Nast building.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of that section sent part of a steel elevator tower
across West 43rd Street and through the roof of a nearby hotel,
killing an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not unusual for such beams to be disconnected to
allow access to a building's facade, they must be replaced before
the elevator can be used at their level.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse, which city officials have called the worst
construction accident in more than a decade, has forced officials
to close several streets and numerous buildings around Times
Square, forcing out hundreds of businesses, residents and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, emergency workers were trying to install a
heavy nylon curtain around the 700-foot-high scaffolding on 43rd
Street and binding the broken elevator tower to the building.
</P>
<P>
   New York's buildings commissioner, Gaston Silva, said the city
planned to reopen Broadway and Seventh Avenue by midday Saturday
and 43rd Street by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Silva said that by early Saturday morning, workers expected to
have stabilized the broken scaffold, removing the danger that all
of it would fall. Construction workers inside the building drove
tremendous steel beams through the open sides of the structure and
into the scaffolding. Silva said the beams are expected to support
the latticework.
</P>
<P>
   But with the damaged scaffolding hanging 300 feet above the
pavement, any mistake could end in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like pickup sticks,'' said Michael Mazzucca, vice
president of Regional Scaffolding and Hoisting Co. ``Move the wrong
stick and maybe the whole thing comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzucca was part of a team of experts that the city assembled
to recommend how to remove the scaffolding safely. His company
operates the concrete hoist inside the skyscraper that is being
used to ferry workers and materials to the top. In an interview
Friday, he said the metal scaffolding was tilting above 43rd Street
with little support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a complete separation between the bottom
and the top,'' he said. ``That's why it is not a molehill. It is a
real mountain. It's thousands of pounds of aluminum that can
literally fall down to the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the scaffolding is stabilized, city officials said,
forensic engineers will use bucket hoists to examine the damage in
hopes of pinpointing a cause for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Construction executives and city engineers and inspectors have
already discarded one theory, saying they no longer believe that a
heavy crane atop the 48-story building had struck the scaffolding
and knocked loose the elevator tower.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are concentrating on the possibility that workers
had disconnected support beams on the 21st floor that tied the
scaffolding to the building, to install a window panel, a senior
investigator said. Without the beams in place, the construction
elevator could have jarred the scaffolding when it rose above the
21st floor, causing the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A construction executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that the contractor for the scaffolding, United Builders
Supply, and the facade contractors had been working on the 21st
floor the weekend before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common procedure during the construction of a high-rise
building to disconnect the support beams temporarily to gain access
to the face of the structure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, senior vice president with Tishman Realty and
Construction Co., whose unit is the building's construction
manager, said that for the last several months workers from
Universal Builders Supply had been removing connecting beams so
that another contractor could install facade panels. He said the
work was done only on weekends and at night, when the construction
elevator was not in use.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are supposed to reconnect the beams when the work is
done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzucca said that removing a support beam usually would not
cause a problem. But he said, ``You shouldn't use a hoist beyond
where a tie has been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal, a highly regarded company that erected the
scaffolding for the renovation of the Statue of Liberty and Grand
Central Terminal, did not return calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   As workers continued to shore up the scaffolding, the American
Red Cross said it had helped about 450 people evacuated from their
homes in the neighborhood in obtaining temporary housing. The
developer of the building, Douglas Durst, and his construction
manager, Tishman Construction Corp., established a center at 1120
Ave. of the Americas to aid people with insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   All four theaters closed by the accident remained dark Friday,
but theater officials were hopeful that three would open as early
as Saturday night. But there is no indication when the fourth, the
Kit Kat Klub that is home of the revival ``Cabaret,'' would be able
to reopen. The club is on 43rd Street, in the shadow of the damaged
scaffolding.

THE FIRST CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS EVER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 18 years in the Capitol Police force, Jacob
Chestnut was looking forward to his retirement. But the 58-year-old
officer remained so ebullient and outgoing with tourists that one
senator said he seemed like the Capitol's official greeter.
</P>
<P>
   John Gibson, an eight-year veteran of the force, worked in the
plainclothes division, assigned to guard Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
the third-ranking member of the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, both men gave their lives to stop a gunman who barged
into the Capitol and opened fire. The Senate historian said it was
the first time on record that Capitol Police officers had been shot
to death in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed, and those who apprehended the
gunman, are true heroes of democracy and every American owes them a
deep debt of gratitude,'' said Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that both men were married and that Gibson had
three children. Chestnut had two children, members of his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were members of the Capitol's own police force,
formed shortly after an 1828 incident in which a journalist slapped
President John Quincy Adams' son, who was on official business for
his father at the Capitol. Now the force comprises about 1,200
officers who guard the doors and entrances on Capitol Hill,
investigate threats against members of Congress and provide them
with personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew the two men, Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said,
``We passed them multiple times during a day. And you exchange, you
know, `How are you?' You don't expect an answer. And they're there
every day. And no one expects this to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, members of Congress said, was shot in the chest when
he stopped the gunman and told him to go through the metal detector
at the entrance that he guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was at his post at the unmarked back entrance to the
suite of offices used by DeLay and the whip staff. He ordered staff
members, who were celebrating the House's passage of health care
legislation, to get farther back in the room and to get down on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed as he exchanged gunfire with the intruder.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and members of my staff,''
DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted quickly
and with great bravery as he did, others would have been killed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chestnut's neighbors in the Maryland suburb of Fort Washington
and lawmakers who knew him described him as a cheerful man who was
looking forward to his retirement in another year or so. ``He was a
very outgoing guy,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. ``He acted
almost like an official greeter; he was so good with tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome R. Goldring, a neighbor, said Chestnut was ``wonderful
and cheerful, and I wish I had more neighbors like him. I remember,
a few years ago, there was a kind of sickly neighbor, and he would
go up there and cut her lawn. He was a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn E. Gravely-Moss, another neighbor, described how the
officer loved to jog around the neighborhood. ``He and my husband
would talk about retirement. What they would do,'' she said. In
fact, Conrad said that another Capitol police officer told him that
Chestnut had been talking just a day earlier about how much he
looked forward to retiring, perhaps as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gingrich stopped at the Chestnut home to see the
officers' wife, Wenling, and family.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who lived in the Virginia suburbs, had worked as one of
the plainclothes officers in the Senate before being transferred to
protect DeLay. ``He loved the protection detail,'' said Virgil
VanFleet, a 28-year veteran of the Capitol Police who had once
worked in a scout car as Gibson's partner.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, the two men had joked about the days when
they used to ticket cab drivers on Capitol grounds. ``That was the
last conversation I had with him,'' he said. ``John was a very good
man, very conscientious. It's obvious that when he died, he died a
hero.'' &QL;

`THERE WAS CHAOS AND PANDEMONIUM,' SAYS TOURIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tourists were snaking through the Byzantine
hallways and milling about the massive marble Rotunda of the
Capitol as they normally do during the busy summer season.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians were finishing up business for the week, still
giving speeches while they and their staffs prepared to head home
for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And then suddenly, nothing was routine. Gunfire erupted near a
first-floor entrance close to the area known as the Crypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was chaos and pandemonium,'' said Laurie Curcio, a
tourist from Long Island, who was on a tour on the floor above when
the shooting started at about 3:40 p.m., EDT., Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Those near the gunfire ducked and reached for their kids, while
tourists in other parts of the building who heard the rapid
succession of shots rushed for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Curcio said that at first no one in her group moved, behaving as
if they couldn't believe what they were hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, the tour guide yelled, ``Oh my God, that was a
gunshot,'' and people began heading for the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Justin Brown was working in the gift shop when he
saw a man with a gun ``running through and shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just ran right through the metal detectors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown said he did not get a good look at the gunman, he
did notice that a police officer was down, as did tourist Ronald
Beamish from England, who went over to try to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the officer hit the floor. I went over to him, felt his
palm. I yelled, `Get a stretcher,''' said Beamish.
</P>
<P>
   Beamish said the police officer appeared to be hit in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``His left eye seemed to be gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Addotta of Rockford, Ill., was looking at the displays in
the Crypt with his family when he said he suddenly saw a flash of
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled, `Get down and out of the building,''' he said to his
wife, three sons and mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The family became separated in the chaotic aftermath but was
later reunited outside.
</P>
<P>
   Addotta, who was in Washington for a cookie convention, said
this was his family's first visit to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would come again, he replied, ``Probably. But I
don't know if my kids will.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the tourist assumed the Capitol was a safe place
considering the impressive show of security to anyone entering the
building. Police officers are stationed at each entrance where
everyone must pass through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed well guarded. We felt safe going in,'' said Brad
Davis, who was visiting with his wife and two children from
Hamilton, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis family was being taken on a tour of the Capitol by an
aide to their Texas congressman, Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Although they did not hear the shots, they were about to go into
the Sam Rayburn room when they saw two guards coming toward them,
who ordered them to go the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scarey,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, heard
the noise as she was conducting a tour of the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if you were at a construction site and heard blocks
falling,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mamo said she didn't realize what had happened until ``tourists
came flying down the steps. Some were shouting, `He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Amber Simas said she and a friend were walking on the second
floor near the Rotunda when she heard three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone started picking up their kids and running,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simas said that her first reaction was to get away. ``My second
reaction was to see what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Simas said that right before the incident, she had asked her
friend when the last time someone was shot in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, two police officers, one tourist and the
gunman lay wounded. The two officers later died.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the tourists and staff made it out of the
building, others were sequestered there for several hours as police
blocked off major hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers had just left the building because the House had
completed its major business of the day: voting on a bill to
regulated managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of members, including Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas,
had remained behind to make short speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson said he was giving his speech on missing and exploited
children when he saw guards rush in and lock the doors of the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lampson said that the lawmakers who remained in the
chamber either wandered into the cloakroom to watch events
unfolding on Cable News Network, or continued making speeches on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor business continued as usual,'' he said. ``With
people giving presentations.''

   BC-VATICAN-BISHOPS-NYT (moved on Thursday, July 23)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, July 23,
about an apostolic letter by Pope John Paul II tightening Rome's
control over bishops' conferences misstated the kind of document
that must be sent to Rome for approval even if it is passed by an

CLINTON UNWILLING TO TESTIFY BEFORE LEWINSKY JURY, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Rewords first sentence, changing `threatening to subpoena' to
`drawing up a subpoena'; subs 2nd graf to remove lawyer quote about
subpoena and say that subpoena's status is unclear; subs 3rd graf
to change `immediately' to `earlier this week'; subs 17th graf to

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr drawing up a
subpoena to force him to testify, President Clinton has told an
adviser that he does not want to testify voluntarily before the
federal grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter and
become the first sitting president in history to appear before a
grand jury, the adviser said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came earlier this week after prosecutors
working for Starr informed David Kendall, Clinton's personal
lawyer, that they were preparing to serve the president with a
subpoena, senior administration officials and lawyers close to the
case said Friday. It was unclear Friday night whether the subpoena
had been served or whether prosecutors intended to serve it soon.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Kendall reopened negotiations that would
allow Clinton to cooperate with Starr's grand jury without having
to force him to appear at the federal courthouse on Pennsylvania
Avenue, just a few blocks from the White House, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kendall has been trying to work out with Mr. Starr
something that would help insure that the information is provided
that is needed, consistent with the president's view that we should
cooperate,'' said White House press secretary Mike McCurry on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prefers to answer questions at the White House, where he
has given sworn testimony several times to Starr and his
predecessor, Robert Fiske, on a variety of Whitewater-related
matters. Portions of his testimony were later read to grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers close to Clinton said the president would much
prefer cooperating with Starr's prosecutors by providing them with
a videotaped deposition in a White House session or sworn answers
to a list of written questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history,'' one lawyer said. ``We have found ways in
the past to comply with legitimate requests.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Clinton has refused as many as six invitations
by Starr's prosecutors to voluntarily appear before the federal
grand jury that is investigating whether he had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 25-year-old former White House
intern, and then sought to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   According to an adviser of Clinton who insisted on anonymity,
Clinton expressed ``strong'' feelings in a recent conversation that
he did not want to appear in person before Starr's grand jury,
which is impaneled at the federal courthouse near Capitol Hill. The
adviser said Clinton views Starr's inquiry as unfair, politically
motivated and even illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   When told about those remarks, a member of Clinton's legal team
said the president is prone to fits of anger and frustration with
the six-month-old Starr investigation. The lawyer said Clinton's
strategy is to attempt to negotiate a compromise with Starr's
office, rather than risk provoking a constitutional confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars are sharply divided on whether a sitting
president can be forced to take the stand in a criminal
investigation, or whether a grand jury can return an indictment
against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors and White House lawyers also have very
different views over whether a criminal subpoena of the president
is constitutionally permissible. Starr's office believes that such
a subpoena will pass constitutional muster, but Clinton's lawyers
believe only the House of Representatives has such authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, declined to comment
Friday about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said very little about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. In January, shortly after the Lewinsky accusations
surfaced, he and his staff pledged to cooperate in the inquiry. He
said he would like to clear up questions raised by the Lewinsky
matter ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starr chose to subpoena the president, rather than negotiate
the terms of his testimony, the move could prompt Clinton to claim
that constitutional protections shield him from such inquiries. A
member of his legal team, W. Neil Eggleston, is researching the
legal and constitutional questions arising from such a challenge,
but he declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr subpoenaed the president and Clinton chose to fight it,
the court battle surrounding such a move could delay Starr's
inquiry for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous amount of speculation that there
has been a subpoena or the threat of one,'' McCurry said. ``At
least until now, Kendall and Ruff prefer to be in a cooperative,
rather than a confrontational, mode.'' McCurry was referring to
White House counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and Fiske have also questioned Hillary Rodham Clinton at
the White House about the Clintons' business affairs in Arkansas.
In early 1996, Starr ordered Mrs. Clinton to appear before a grand
jury in Washington. Her appearance was demanded after a copy of
some of the billing records from her old law firm mysteriously
surfaced in the residence of the White House nearly two years after
they were first subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Friday, McCurry said that he did not know the
status of discussions with Starr's office, which began in March.
``I can't tell you what the status of discussions are that the
lawyers are having,'' he said. &QL;

 Slip.Net's Hack-Attack Suit Has Turned Into a Federal Case   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
It may have started out as a beef between a software engineer and
his boss, but now it has become a federal case.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nicholas Middleton stood in District Judge Charles Legge's
San Francisco courtroom yesterday to defend himself against felony
charges that he hacked into a computer at Slip.Net, a San
Francisco-based Internet service provider, and wrought electronic
mischief that cost $40,000 to correct.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged hack was discovered on a Sunday morning in March, a
few weeks after Middleton, who had been Slip.Net's system
administrator, sent a take-this-job-and-shove-it e-mail to company
President Ted Glenwright.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bert Glenn is now prepared to argue that
a miffed Middleton was the cyberintruder who used a program called
PC Anywhere to access Slip.Net's main computer via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the system, the hacker _ whoever he or she might be
_ allegedly changed all the passwords of Slip.Net's employees,
locking them out of their own Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder also uninstalled the SQL Server database that
Slip.Net used in its business.
</P>
<P>
   The government will seek to prove not only that Middleton caused
this mischief, but that it cost Slip.Net $40,000 in labor to set
its systems right.
</P>
<P>
   If the government can prove both assertions _ that Middleton did
the hack and, in the process, caused at least $5,000 in damages _
then the 34-year-old San Francisco man will face a maximum sentence
of five years in jail and $250,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton's attorney, David Cohen, said his client, who has
never before been in trouble with the law, has pleaded not guilty
to the hacking charges and would vigorously dispute the supposed
costs of repairing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Middleton and the FBI, which investigated the
charges, discussed a plea bargain but that the talks came to naught
because the feds wanted the him to reimburse Slip.Net for the
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now a federal jury will have to decide whether this was a stupid
prank or a costly crime _ and whether Middleton was involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Big spenders? &LR;  Silicon Valley millionaires have a reputation
for being cheap with charities, but venture capitalist Gib Myers
plans to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a 28-year venture veteran, recently started a nonprofit
group called the Entrepreneur's Foundation. Its mission is to get
entrepreneurs in the habit of donating time _ and stock _ long
before they normally would get old and generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you have to teach a child values, we're trying to
get companies to think about philanthropy from the outset,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation director Patty Burness said that altruism aside,
young firms benefit from supporting employees in volunteering at
food banks or doing blood drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great way to build team spirit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing volunteerism into their corporate DNA,
startups that join the Foundation will be required to donate some
stock. These donations will create a fund to support existing
nonprofits that specialize in education or youth development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the stock isn't worth much now, but if we get one
or two Yahoos ...,'' Myers said, letting the thought dangle.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation won't just give money to nonprofits. It also will
place high-tech execs on their boards. The idea is to pollinate
charities with capitalistic management skills.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this cross-breeding will work remains to be seen, but
the new practice comes with a buzzword: venture philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten startups, including Know Med Systems of Berkeley and Aptia
Inc. of San Jose, have already joined. Myers hopes to get 25 this
year and 500 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out to change the culture of the Valley with respect to
philanthropy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tall order, and to get peer pressure working on his
side, Myers has recruited an all-star board including venture
capitalist Brook Byers, banker John Dean and lawyer Larry Sonsini &LR; 
(see http://the-ef.org) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Charitable trend? &LR;  Bud Colligan, the software guy turned
venture capitalist, has raised $3 million toward his goal of
creating a $10 million nonprofit fund to invest in companies that
create entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Colligan said he was motivated by concern that there might not
be enough entry-level jobs for the 500,000 people expected to lose
public assistance as a result of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be administered by the newly formed Silicon
Valley Community Ventures  &LR; (www.svcv.org) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Colligan has lined up a board of directors that includes noted
entrepreneurs, such as attorney Gordie Davidson, and experts in the
nonprofit world, such as Eric Weaver, executive director of Lenders
for Community Development in San Jose, and Anita Stephens, who runs
a Fremont-based job-training program, Opportunity Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Colligan expects SVCV to have raised its $10 million
so that it can start investing in businesses _ be they factories or
service firms _ that employ mainly unskilled or semi-skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate in being able to grow a company and make
money myself,'' said Colligan, best known as co-founder of
Macromedia, the San Francisco-based multimedia firm. ``This is an
opportunity to give back.''
</P>

 Advertisers Take a Swing at Golf   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It's enough to tee a golfer off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, golf courses and driving ranges have been
sanctuaries of greenery and sand, disrupted only by the occasional
plaid trouser. But like bus shelters and taxi trunks before them,
golf venues are seeing the slow encroachment of advertising
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Posters hawking PCS phones and credit cards are popping up on
tee dividers at driving ranges, and billboard-style ads soon might
appear on range targets.
</P>
<P>
   At some golf courses, navigation computers on golf carts display
digital ads along with driving distances, and marketers are
plotting to wrap the carts in vinyl ads like those on city buses.
</P>
<P>
   Logos and signs also are appearing on golf balls, driving range
mats, score cards and golf-ball vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Like most trends in advertising, demographics explain the drive
toward putting ads on golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sport is shedding its image as a pastime of the
country club set, the average annual household income of a golfer,
at $57,000, is significantly higher than the US average.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Golfers' expenditures on goods such as fine jewelry, stock,
travel, cigars and wireless telephones are well above those of
nongolfers, according to MRI Doublebase.
</P>
<P>
   Golf also is a growing sport, in part due to the appeal of
rising young stars such as Tiger Woods and Se Ri Pak.
</P>
<P>
   About 26.5 million Americans played at least one round of golf
in 1997, up from 25 million in 1996, according to the National Golf
Foundation. The number of core players, who play 25 or more rounds
per year, increased 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those people represent a captive audience every time they step
onto a golf course or driving range. And golf venues contain
relatively unexploited spaces in a world where virtually every bus
shelter, Web site, newspaper and dirigible is already backed by
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   While the profit potential is obvious, marketers should be wary
about overdoing advertising on golf courses, which serve as ``a
physical and mental retreat'' for golfers, said Keith Bruce,
director of sports marketing at the advertising agency Foote, Cone
&AMP; Belding/San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely the chance that you will offend some
people with an advertising message in an area where there used to
not be advertising,'' Bruce said. ``When they're entertaining and
nonintrusive, they will be viewed in a positive light. The question
is what is intrusive and what is not.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ads located discreetly inside the cart, such as on a score
card or a navigation computer screen, are acceptable, Bruce said.
``Once advertising starts to intrude on the visual sight lines of
players, they're going to have problems with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At driving ranges, where golfers stand in rows and practice
hitting buckets of balls, golfers will be more forgiving of
advertising messages than on the course because serenity isn't as
important at ranges, Bruce said .
</P>
<P>
   That is why Pinpoint Golf Marketing, a San Francisco company
that is at the forefront of golf venue marketing, is focusing on
selling ad space at practice ranges _ though it is starting to move
onto courses, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pinpoint has put together a network of 175 driving ranges across
the country that have agreed to display signs on tee dividers _ the
vertical grids separating each tee area to protect golfers from
wayward balls.
</P>
<P>
   The company is looking for funding to expand to 1,000 ranges
during the next two years, said Ben Tresser, Pinpoint's vice
president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers such as Visa, which markets a Jack Nicklaus credit
card, are paying $1,500 to $6,000 to post signs on half of the tee
dividers at a given range for three months. The price level depends
on the amount of tees and the number of customers who visit the
range.
</P>
<P>
   Many advertisers are pairing the signs with other promotions.
Titanium Sports Technologies, for example, posted signs at five
Chicago-area driving ranges telling visitors that they could &LR; 
 &LR; test-drive a club with a titanium shaft at the pro shop.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being annoyed by the ads, customers were pleased to
have a chance to try the expensive clubs, which are not widely
available, said Sandra Gladstone, vice president, marketing, with
Titanium.
</P>
<P>
   Titanium, based in Kennewick, Wash., also used the promotion to
collect names and addresses of golfers for its marketing database,
Gladstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The signs ``can't help but have an impact,'' she said. ``A lot
of the facilities have 50 or 60 tee dividers, and people are out
there for a half-hour to an hour. We think it's an excellent value,
and we're feeling quite confident that this will be beneficial for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many range managers who have been approached by Pinpoint
have opted not to post the signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call this Puritanism, but we don't like to overcommercialize
what we're doing,'' said Mike Santin, Western regional manager for
Family Golf Centers, which runs 100 driving ranges in 20 states.
``People come out here to hit balls, not to look at ads all over
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even driving ranges that display Pinpoint's tee-divider ads seem
leery of another, more in-your-face project in development _ ads on
range targets, the billboard-type signs on a driving range that
mark how far a ball has been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Pinpoint has spoken to advertisers such as Absolut, for example,
about making a 250-yard target in the shape of a vodka bottle,
Tresser said. So far, no advertisers have signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons of the driving range at Mission Bay Golf Center in San
Francisco don't seem to mind the tee-divider signs, said Dennis
Duden, general manager of the range. But Duden doesn't think that
his customers will stomach ads on targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe at our range in Sacramento we could get away with that,
but San Francisco has an image of itself as quite urbane, so we try
and stay away from gimmicky types of things,'' Duden said.
</P>
<P>
   To reach golfers on the green, Pinpoint is behind the move to
run digital ads on navigation computers in golf carts. The idea is
to run an ad between each of 18 holes while the cart is being
driven around the green.
</P>
<P>
   Along with tips such as ``There is a bunker 150 yards to the
left,'' the computers, which use satellite tracking technology,
would flash ads for the local BMW dealer or for a power drink being
served at the club house.
</P>
<P>
   ProShot Golf Inc. of Newport Beach (Orange County) charges about
$200 per month for each of the 18 ad slots, said John Seymour, vice
president of sales and marketing for the company, which develops
and markets the computers.
</P>
<P>
   Testing at the first three courses has gone well, and the
program soon will be expanded to 12 more, including the Presidio
Golf Course, Seymour said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinpoint's next plan for golf-cart marketing is far less subtle
than digital ads. Tresser said he is talking with a company that
makes vinyl signs for wrapping buses about creating similar
dressings for golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to wrap it with Budweiser ads or whatever,'' Tresser
said. ``That's the natural next step as we head into courses.''
</P>
<P>
   But cart wraps raise a red flag for Bruce, the proponent of
``nonintrusive'' advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want their golf course to look like a Nascar,''
he said. ``People won't be horrified by commercial messages, but
they have to be done in a tasteful, understated, almost covert
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it could be so much worse. ``We've had much more
atrocious ideas,'' Tresser said. ``We've talked with some
advertisers about burning a corporate logo in the middle of the
field, like a Rosebowl Game,'' but decided that idea wouldn't fly.

FAMILIES OF PAN AM VICTIMS SPLIT OVER POLICY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Md., N.J., Va.)  (js) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly a decade Susan Cohen has sought justice for her
daughter, Theodora, a 20-year-old college student killed in the
terrorist attack on Pan Am Flight 103. But instead of being buoyed
by news that the United States and Britain may allow the suspects
to be tried in the Netherlands, she is crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen, of Cape May Court House, N.J., says she feels
betrayed by the Clinton administration. She wishes the government
would stay the course: continue sanctions against Libya and demand
that the trial of two Libyans suspected of planting the bomb be
held in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
Eager to get the sanctions lifted, Col. Moammar Gadhafi had
proposed that the two be tried under Scottish law by Scottish
judges, but not in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fancy, frilly talk, this is a collapse in
policy,'' Ms. Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadhafi is not being brought to his knees. We're saying, `You
can outlast us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among families of victims of Flight 103, emotions ran the gamut
_ from joy to sadness to anger _ when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser, held a conference call on Tuesday with some of them to
explain the administration's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the United States and Britain would seriously
consider the formation of a special court in the Netherlands to try
the Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   This is a change for the administration, which has long
maintained that the Libyans would have to be tried in the United
States or Britain for the bombing, which killed 259 people aboard
the Pan American World Airways jet, and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The families of victims are not only split over the
administration's new position, but also are still grieving a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said she does not listen to music anymore because
Theodora, her only child, used to sing all the time. ``My life is
in ashes,'' she said. ``Normality and happiness are never coming
back. People say you can come out of this a better person. I think
I'm a worse person, because I'm an angry person. So I proved myself
to be strong. So what? I'd rather be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Wolfe, who lost her stepdaughter, Miriam, 20, said the
change might be moot. ``I don't think Gadhafi will turn them
over,'' said Ms. Wolfe, of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can trust him. I don't think we should
reward him. This is a version of what Gadhafi asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Bernstein, who lost her husband, Michael, 36, said,
``It's distressing on a day like today when you feel like people
who are in charge don't know what they're doing. I think the
administration is feeling some pressure because we're coming up on
the 10th anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bernstein, who lives in Bethesda, Md., said she would
prefer the administration continue its sanctions against Libya. Her
husband left her with two young children, Sara, now 17, and Joseph,
now 13. Though Ms. Bernstein is remarried, she said, she and her
children still miss Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still without him,'' she said. ``You're without him
forever. It wasn't illness. His death was a murder and people have
not been made to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Schultz, a retail consultant from Ridgefield, Conn., lost
his 20-year-old son, Thomas. He applauds the possibility of a
trial. ``I think it's time to move on and try a different venue,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I wholeheartedly support the efforts of the State Department
to move on so the evidence can be seen in the world press. We want
a trial. If Gadhafi doesn't go along, it puts the challenge back in
his court. Then the court of world opinion might be against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's loss was especially painful since he had lost another
son in an accident several years earlier. ``We had two young boys
and now we have none,'' Schultz said. ``Thomas was successful in
college, successful in his jobs. We've seen his peers and
classmates and friends marry and have children. All of that was
taken away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., lost his brother Thomas, 36,
who was on the last leg of a business trip when he died. He agrees
with the administration's new stance, and says he proposed the same
thing three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People grieve differently,'' he said, ``but for myself and
other people closure will come when the people indicted are brought
to trial. My activism in trying to bring these two individuals to
trial is my way of honoring my brother.'' &QL;

NAVY BOOTS MALE, FEMALE SAILORS FOR GROUP SEXUAL INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Fixes in eighth graph, As a result ...)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three female and seven male sailors from the aircraft
carrier USS Abraham Lincoln are being kicked out of the Navy after
a group sexual incident in a Hong Kong hotel room two weeks ago,
Navy officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An eleventh sailor is facing more serious charges that could
result in a military court-martial for sexual assault, said Navy
Lt. Dave Oates, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet Naval Air Forces
headquarters in San Diego. The assault investigation is continuing
and the sailor has not been formally charged, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes as Secretary of Defense William Cohen and his
aides are grappling with how to deal with sexual activity in the
military. Cohen has proposed decriminalizing adultery by revising
the military legal code. That change came in response to the highly
publicized Air Force case of Lt. Kelly Flynn, who faced a
court-martial for adultery and accusations of disobeying orders.
The proposal to lessen the penalties for adultery has sparked some
resistance in the military leadership, particularly the Marine
Corps, out of fears that it may inadvertently weaken military
discipline and order.
</P>
<P>
   The incident on the night of July 6 occurred as the aircraft
carrier was on a six-day port visit to Hong Kong. The ship, which
left Everett, Wash., on June 11 for a six-month deployment to the
western Pacific and Middle East, entered the Persian Gulf on
Thursday, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 remain on board the carrier for now.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 sailors were involved in what another Navy official
described as an off-duty party in the Hong Kong hotel that
degenerated into ``multiple sex acts.'' There were three female and
eight male crew from the carrier in the room. No civilians were
involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, one of the female sailors reported to the
Lincoln's security office that she had been sexually assaulted. The
carrier's commander, Capt. J.J. Quinn, ordered an immediate
investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the three female and seven of the eight male
sailors were brought to a ``Captain's Mast'' hearing for
nonjudicial punishment where they were found guilty on charges of
adultery, sodomy and fraternization, Oates said. The 11th sailor is
still being investigated on a more serious charge of alleged sexual
assault which could result in a military court-martial, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The female sailor who disclosed the incident by accusing the
shipmate of sexual assault is one of the three females being kicked
out of the Navy ``based on illicit sexual acts prior to the alleged
sexual assault'' the same night, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was determined the sailor who reported the sexual assault
had also engaged in inappropriate behavior prior to the alleged
assault,'' said Lincoln public affairs officer Lt. Cmdr. Scott
Harris, in an e-mail message to the Puget Sound Navy News, which
published an account of the incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 sailors at the Captain's Mast were reduced in rank one
grade, restricted to the ship for 60 days, and fined 50 percent of
their salary for two months, Oates said. In addition, all 10
sailors are being processed for administrative separation from the
service which, if approved on appeal, could result in them being
discharged with general or other-than-honorable discharges.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sailors involved are described as junior enlisted
personnel with the ranks of seaman or petty officer 3rd class.
</P>
<P>
   The names and ranks of the sailors have been withheld under
terms of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice and federal Privacy
Act which protect the identities of military personnel in
administrative disciplinary hearings. The name of the 11th sailor,
who has not yet been formally charged, likewise is being withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Navy believes it has recovered from the 1991
Tailhook Association scandal where several dozen females were
groped and harassed during the naval aviation convention in Las
Vegas, the latest incident put Navy officials on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   (The Tailhook scandal rocked the Navy and resulted in the
disciplining of 40 officers, including three admirals. The Navy and
Marine Corps pursued 140 harassment cases, but none led to a
court-martial.)
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials yesterday described the Hong Kong incident as an
isolated occurrence in the service, which has had women serving on
combat warships since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other 4,607 sailors who weren't involved in this incident
represented our country with pride and dignity during our port
visit in Hong Kong,'' said Quinn, the Lincoln's commander. ``They
are an awesome group of young men and women dedicated to serving
their country and I am proud to be their commanding officer.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Navy's personnel command in Washington,
D.C., declined to enumerate any other similar incidents involving
male and female sailors. ``We don't have those (records),'' said
Cmdr. Terry McCreary. ``Nobody collects NJPs (nonjudicial
punishment records). It's a local matter, kept administrative at a
local level.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Navy officer, who discussed the incident on grounds his
name not be used, said, ``It's a shame that the actions of 10
sailors are highlighted over the more than 4,500 sailors who are
performing an outstanding and professional job while on
deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 400 female officers and enlisted personnel
assigned to the Lincoln, about 9 percent of the total roster of
4,600 in the ship's crew and embarked carrier air wing.

   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POLITICIANS-ARTS (Washington) _ Today as yesterday and the day
before, with Republicans as well as Democrats in control of the
White House, with Democratic as well as Republican majorities on
Capitol Hill, the arts and intellectual activity in general are
often bashed and seldom boosted by political Washington, left or
right. By R.W. Apple Jr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   REAL-WAR-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ If we post World War II children
had been cleared-eyed, we would have noticed that the close-lipped
veterans who oversaw our lives really didn't resemble those
full-of-moxie, hell-for-leather fighting Joes on the screen. The
men we boys knew, the ones working 9 to 5, mowing lawns and
coaching Little League, had little of John Wayne's swagger. They
were just regular guys. But small boys aren't built to notice such
disparities, let alone reconcile them. Small boys, as a rule,
aren't realists. Distinguishing reality from fantasy is a
grown-up's task, and Steven Spielberg, another son of the postwar
generation, has fairly risen to it. There is, of course, some irony
in saying this of a filmmaker who has imagined 20th-century
dinosaurs and cuddly extraterrestrials. But in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' he is, as he was in ``Schindler's List,'' a realist. By
William McDonald. &UR; ( &LR; Moved).
 &UR;  &LR; 
 &UR; FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  POIRIER-FILMS &UR;  &LR; (Paris) _ Manuel Poirier's movie career got off
to a slow start. He was 40 by the time his first film was released,
and even then, forced to act as his own producer, he could afford
only one print. Yet, somehow, the right people saw it and liked it
and the doors that Poirier had been knocking on for years suddenly
opened. Within two years he had made three more movies, and the
last of these, ``Western,'' won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997
Cannes International Film Festival. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;

<P>
   GRAY-NEGOTIATOR-FILM (Los Angeles) _ An interview with the film
director, F. Gary Gray, 28, and his new movie ``The Negotiator.''
Gray, who grew up in tough South-Central Los Angeles came to
feature films through his directing of music videos for rap
artists. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PARENT-TRAP-FILM (Undated) _ At a recent advance screening of
Disney's remake of its classic 1961 film ``The Parent Trap,'' a
girl about 7 or 8 years old was overheard to say: ``You know what I
like about this movie? This is a family movie kids will like.''
This pint-size critic had put her thumb squarely on something that
has been tormenting Hollywood of late: how to create films that
will appeal to young moviegoers without alienating their parents.

<P>
   JERRY-HERMAN-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Jerry Herman is returning
to Broadway this week on a deeply personal note. The 66-year-old
composer-lyricist for such huge successes as ``Hello, Dolly!,''
``Mame'' and ``La Cage Aux Folles'' _ a Broadway figure who is both
a symbol of a golden era and an undervalued songwriter _ was
diagnosed with HIV 13 years ago and watched his health decline.
Since then with the help of protease inhibitors, which he takes
after every meal, the outgoing and perennially smiling composer
said his restored health _ he also had a triple heart bypass last
year _ energized him for the first time in a decade and has led to
``An Evening With Jerry Herman,'' starring Lee Roy Reams, Florence
Lacey and Herman himself at the Booth Theater for a two-month run
that opens on Tuesday. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JENKINS-SEATTLE-OPERA (Seattle) _ No one else runs an opera
company, or talks about opera, with the fervor of Speight Jenkins.
``You see, in `Tristan und Isolde,' Wagner wanted everyone in the
audience to experience his frustration in not being able to
consummate his love for Mathilde Wesendonck,'' Jenkins, the general
director of the Seattle Opera, said recently, warming to his
favorite topic. The Seattle Opera's new production of ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' which opens on Saturday evening, brings together the
hottest Wagner singers of the moment, the Canadian tenor Ben
Heppner and the English soprano Jane Eaglen, for the first time in
the title roles. By David Schiff. (Moved).

<P>
   OPERA-VOICES (subslug) (Undated) _ A Favorite stump-the-panel
segment on the Texaco Opera Quiz during the Saturday afternoon
radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera is the ``singer ID.''
Recordings of, say, five unidentified tenors singing the same
phrase of a particular aria are played in a row, and the panelists
are asked to name them. It's amazing how difficult it can be to
recognize the voices of even famous tenors like Carlo Bergonzi or
Alfredo Kraus. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EAGLEN/SCHAFER-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Singers are forever trying to
create inventive programs, balancing art songs with arias, serious
material with lighter fare, the familiar with the novel. On
records, the challenge is perhaps even greater than in the concert
hall, for the choices must stand the tests of time and repeated
listening. How gratifying, then, to encounter two new cleverly
assembled vocal disks. Ostensibly these albums are similar, each
featuring a rising soprano singing music by Mozart and Richard
Strauss. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.

   PALMER-ROCK-FAME (Undated) _ When the Hall of Fame announces its
14th annual class of inductees this fall _ the selection process
began earlier this month _ it's a sure bet that Earl Palmer won't
be among them. Who? Though few people have heard of Palmer, this
73-year-old has had a greater impact on rock than many a Hall of
Fame shoo-in. By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PULITZER-PRIZE-JAZZ (Undated) _ Trivia question: who was the
first jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for music? Hint: it
wasn't Wynton Marsalis. The honor belongs to Mel Powell, who won in
1990 for a two-piano concerto called ``Duplicates.'' By Terry
Teachout. (Moved).

<P>
   BUMPER-CARS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ A look at Peter Foster, a
collector of bumper cars. Bumper cars were designed to operate
using electric power supplied from a metal-mesh ceiling, but
Foster's cars have been converted to 12-volt battery power, which
enables them to run on any hard, flat surface. By Seth Gussow.
(Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PA-LANCASTER-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ The Lancaster sanctuary is
getting smaller, thanks in part to the car that conveys you into a
part of the world that retained its serenity until the postwar
years. In the last three years, more than 1,000 acres of farmland
in Lancaster County have vanished. The car culture has gulped down
big chunks of a landscape long associated with the horse-drawn
carriage. Open land has been turned into sites for suburban

18-MONTH RENOVATION FOR SUBWAY SHUTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long considered one of the most run-down and
neglected parts of New York City's sprawling transit network, the
five-station Franklin Avenue shuttle, which cuts 1.4 miles across
central Brooklyn, began the final stages of a badly needed overhaul
Friday that will leave it out of service for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting off attempts to close the elevated line _ which
has not seen a healthy ridership since 1957, when the Dodgers last
played nearby, in Ebbets Field _ community leaders were finally
able to secure money for the $74 million rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Franklin Avenue Shuttle is a great project, and we worked
hard to get this for 10 years,'' said Lewis Watkins, an official
with Community Board 3 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ``The transit
authority wanted to close the line or use the money for something
else, but we are finally getting a much-needed renovation.''
</P>
<P>
   While the line is legendary among subway buffs for its decrepit
condition, for some riders it plays an important role, serving as a
link between the A and C lines, which go to eastern Brooklyn, and
the D and Q lines, which go to southern Brooklyn. The shuttle draws
an average of 10,000 riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   To serve riders affected by the shutdown, transit officials will
operate free shuttle-bus service between Lincoln Road and Fulton
Street. City officials say the rehabilitation project will also
cause sporadic rerouting of traffic on busy Fulton Street over the
next 18 months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The project is not universally supported, even in Brooklyn. Some
residents complain that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
decision to use buses to transport riders will create a safety
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is good that the new line is being constructed,''
said Bernice Moses, a frequent shuttle user. ``But the street that
they are temporarily putting the buses on is not equipped to handle
that type of traffic _ it's residential.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit agency officials brushed off the criticism. ``We have
been coordinating it with the community for two years,'' said
Melissa Farley, a spokeswoman for New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor condition of the shuttle line, with its old
trains and deteriorating stations topped by rusty roofs, community
leaders have worked vigorously to keep it running, saying that it
was held hostage to political squabbling while much newer lines
were receiving repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the project repeatedly ended up on the MTA's list
of needed restorations. In 1996, the Brooklyn borough president,
Howard Golden, and Assemblyman Albert Vann successfully lobbied the
state Legislature to budget money for the repairs. Construction
workers have been on the job since May, and demolition work has
already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's shutdown of the line represents the beginning of the
second phase of the project. New tracks, signals, lights, signs,
platforms and a public address system, closed-circuit television
and even artwork are to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, the
subway riders advocacy group that lobbied for the renovations,
called the start of the project ``a great moment for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials said the project would have cost more and taken
months longer if they had chosen to shut down the line
sector-by-sector, as some community leaders had suggested, instead
of doing it all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an old line, and it does need to be rehabilitated,''
said Ms. Farley, the MTA spokeswoman. ``And to do that, it needs to
be totally reconstructed. It's a pretty big job.'' &QL;

65 PERCENT OF ALARMS TO POLICE IN PHOENIX ARE FALSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By HANNAH MILLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Thousands of Phoe nix-area homeowners and business
people have installed alarm systems to ward off burglars.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems they have more to fear from Christmas decorations,
billow ing drapes and feisty pets.
</P>
<P>
   That's because 65 percent of alarm calls to police in Phoenix
alone are false, caused by an endless variety of human errors and
costing police $4.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, alarms are one of the top three calls police
receive, along with domestic violence and suspi cious persons.
</P>
<P>
   It's the price of fear _ escalating in the past five years as
the number of alarm systems in homes has doubled, as prices drop
and developers install systems as standard features.
</P>
<P>
   And some people must pay the ultimate price: False Alarm School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Micky set my alarm off,'' admitted Bob Stott, sprawled in a
school-style desk last week in a small room at the Mesa Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my ferret.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools, usually held twice a month in several Phoenix-area
cities, are two-hour sessions where the electronically challenged
can learn the secrets of their security systems. Most students are
voluntary, though Tempe requires its top 10 violators every month
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 students have gone through Mesa's class, and
Phoenix boasts a 90 percent success rate _ no more false alarms _
for its students. Now Glendale and Chan dler are considering
starting schools of their own.
</P>
<P>
   New homeowner Donna Foster said she enrolled just to prevent
having to pay Mesa's fine, which is $50 per false alarm after the
first four free ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I set my motion detector off the first
day I had it,'' Foster said. ``I think it was the paper drapes . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the cause, police are left to deal with the result
_ 282 false alarms a day last year in Phoenix alone. An estimated
70 per cent are due to human error _ which is combatable, although
alarm operating instructions are often as well understood as those
for a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so bad that most cities have hired
administrators just to deal with the devices, which now monitor 1
in 6 American homes. Cities also have introduced increas ingly
stiffer fines for false alarms to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perimeter monitors, fixed-glass alarms, passive infrared, panic
but tons _ homeowners feel safer, and business owners swear by
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who doesn't have one in this area,'' said Claire
Schere, a Scottsdale retiree who lives alone _ and well-guarded _
``is just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statistics from Phoenix don't conclusively show that the
alarms actually have a deterrent effect. And experts say that the
largest propor tion of burglary happens to those who can't afford
alarms anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Phoenix-area police take alarms seriously, recommending
them to homeowners and giving calls the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do prevent burglary,'' said Detective Mike McCullough of
the Phoenix Police Department, ``but in an intangible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Police Sgt. Bryan Soller said, ``We always treat alarms as
the real thing. It's not aggravating, but it is a burden.
Especially if we're getting hammered in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every city is as lucky. In many, the false-alarm rate is as
high as 98 percent. Las Vegas doesn't even dispatch an officer
anymore, unless on-scene security guards or owners call it in
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area homeowners can relax: police will respond, no
matter what. One unlucky Mesa police officer drove out to a house
four times one night before he realized a balloon was setting off
the home's motion detector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely worth having an alarm in your home,'' said
Susan Brenton, of the Arizona Burglary and Fire Alarm Association,
``just make sure that you are familiar with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Brenton herself knows, no one is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house was broken into two weeks ago,'' Brenton said.
``Because my alarm went off, all they got was an old VCR. And
that's when I was at the National Alarm Association conference.''

GUNMAN KILLS TWO IN CAPITOL SHOOTING SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two police officers were killed and a woman
seriously wounded Friday when a lone gunman opened fire in the US
Capitol, as scores of terrified tourists scrambled for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as Russell E. Weston, 42, of Missoula,
Mont., was shot three times and arrested after ``he tried to blast
his way into the Capitol,'' as one congressman described the event,
in a seemingly senseless midafternoon attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service had listed Weston as a ``low-level'' threat
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the slain officers likely saved lives with their
swift response after the suspect, brandishing a .38 caliber
handgun, broke past guards at an entrance to the Capitol to the
horror of onlookers, including many children.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities searched for a motive for the assault, the
tragedy struck many in Washington like a death in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capitol is the people's house, a place where visitors and
workers should not have to fear violence,'' Clinton said. ``Every
American appreciates the bravery of the Capitol police that
prevented further injury through their courageous actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident marked the worst violence in the Capitol since five
lawmakers were shot in the House chamber by Puerto Rican
nationalists in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut of Fort Washington,
Md., an 18-year veteran of the US Capitol Police, and Special Agent
John Gibson, a Waltham, Mass. native who had served eight years on
the force. Both men leave three children, who were at their sides
in separate Washington hospitals when they were declared dead soon
after the gun battle erupted at about 3:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist, Angela Dickerson, 24, was shot in the head and
shoulder and was listed in serious condition at a Washington
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Weston is expected to survive his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was seen Thursday at his family's home in Valymeyer,
Ill., the Miami Herald reported on its Web site Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Weston, who believed the government
had planted mines on his property in Montana, argued with his
father, Russell E. Weston Sr., after he used his father's shotgun
to kill more than a dozen cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot a bunch of cats and I made him get out. I got mad,
told him, `You gonna have to leave,''' said the man who identified
himself as Weston's father, according to the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Weston drifted between his family home and a
half-acre plot in Montana that he used to mine gold.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, authorities said Weston began the shooting spree
after walking several blocks to the Capitol from a vehicle that was
stocked with a large amount of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the gunman burst into the Capitol through the
``document door,'' an entrance on the building's east side that is
not far from the rotunda where leaders such as President John F.
Kennedy have lain in state.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 3:40 p.m., as many House and Senate members were
heading home for the weekend and hundreds of tourists were viewing
the halls where laws are made.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology of the violence is sketchy. But authorities said
the assailant shot Chestnut in the head after darting around a
metal detector at an entrace near a crowded souvenir stand. They
said the suspect fired immediately after Chestnut asked him to go
through the metal detector before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all ducked,'' said Justin Brown, who works at the souvenir
stand. ``When I looked up, I saw the officer was down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gunman charged onward, Ronald Beamish, 69, a visitor from
Gloucester, England, tended to the stricken Chestnut, cradling him
on the cold floor. ``He was trying to talk,'' Beamish said. ``His
lips moved. ... He was barely alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, ``You'll be all right, you'll be all right,'' said
Beamish, whose khaki pants were stained with blood as he recounted
the incident on the Capitol lawn. ``But there was nothing I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect charged into the Crypt, a circular room with stately
pillars and walls adorned with historical displays. There, he
turned left toward the House side of the Capitol and down a hallway
where the office of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
majority whip, is located.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a member of DeLay's personal security detail, was
outside DeLay's office. Although it was not clear how or where
Dickerson was wounded, witnesses said Gibson and the suspect were
struck in a hail of bullets outside DeLay's office. Gibson was shot
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said the suspect was mostly expressionless and
said nothing they could hear throughout the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just boom, boom, boom, and people yelling, `Take cover,
take cover!''' said Diane Markley, who was in the Crypt while
touring the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trapped, with nowhere to run,'' said Catherine
Whinery, of Gorham, Maine, who was with Markley and 10 other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As the drama unfolded, many tourists were directed into
restrooms by security officers, who locked them in until the threat
had passed. Others were rushed out of the building. Lawmakers and
their staffs were cautioned to lock themselves in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from walking through this historic place, feeling
patriotic, to feeling just stunned,'' Markley said. ``Why would
some nut do this?''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence surfaced that the suspect had targeted DeLay or his
staff. But the proximity of the bloody encounter and Gibson's final
stand deeply affected DeLay and his aides, as it did many other
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed _ and those who apprehended the
gunman _ are true heroes of democracy and every American owes them
a deep debt of gratitude,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before the tragedy, the House had been roiled
in a rancorous, partisan debate over health care. But in the hours
afterward, many returned tearfully to the Capitol to mourn the
slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and the members of my
staff,'' DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted
quickly and with great bravery as he did, others would have been
killed. I cannot express the depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's wife, Lynn, is the daughter of Robert Moakley, the
brother of Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and heart surgeon,
performed CPR on Gibson and rode with him to Washington's D.C.
General Hospital. He also treated Chestnut and helped carry him to
an anbulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really just focused on keeping their hearts and lungs
moving,'' said Frist, a graduate of Harvard Medical School. He
called the shootings ``a very serious catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, ``Whoever kills or attempts to kill an
officer or employee of the United States while such officer is
engaged in ... his official duties'' faces the punishment of
``death or imprisonment for life.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the official word of the officers' death was made
public, flags throughout the nation's capital were lowered to half
staff.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the alleged gunman was listed in the Secret Service
computer database as a potential threat to the president because of
an incident that occured more than two years ago. He declined to
elaborate on that incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service has had contact with him,'' the official
said. ``If anyone is in the system, it is because of a threat or a
comment or an unusual statement. But there hasn't been any contact
with him in more than two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said they expected the House and Senate to
investigate security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises serious concerns,'' said Representative Elijah
Cummings, a Maryland Democrat. ``It's a reminder of what kind of
world we're living in today.''

It's no Roman holiday as bus men prepare for tuneup game with Italy
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ROME _ Traversing foreign countries with an entourage of 12
players, numerous coaches, support personnel and dignitaries from
various American basketball organizations, an international
incident is never more than an unintentional bump or impolite
gesture away.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as they found out Friday, it doesn't even have to
involve one of the Americans preparing for the FIBA World
Championship of Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team members were aboard a bus heading to their first
practice at the Palaeur on the outskirts of Rome when their driver
came to a sudden stop. In Rome, this is not news. Drivers, whether
they are operating a taxi, bus or moped, treat the roads as an
Indy-car driver would treat the racetrack. The lane is wherever the
driver wants it to be.
</P>
<P>
   New York cabbies are Rome cabbie wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after the bus driver for the Americans was cut off by a
man on a scooter, prompting the quick brake, there was a long
exchange between the two vehicularly charged gentlemen, complete
with many arm-waving gestures and, supposedly, the Italian
equivalent of four-letter words.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the bus lurched forward and bumped the back end
of the scooter. It was sort of like Shaquille O'Neal delivering a
message to Spud Webb: The bus driver only did it because he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy rammed him and then he stopped the bus and wanted to
go out and get a piece of the guy on the scooter,'' coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``It was a crazy scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Not something Ralph Kramden would have put on his rsum, but
standard stuff for the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that in LA or New York,'' said forward David
Wood. ``Someone will pull out a gun and pop a cap in you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little mopeds are the way to get where you want to go
really quick,'' Wood said. ``But one time out of 100, you're not
going to get there. It's great 99 times out of 100. But that other
time, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as these things can, it could have escalated in Rome, too.
Were it not for the police escort that was with the U.S. bus,
things might have gotten nasty. But authorities calmed the driver
and things proceeded normally as the Americans made it to the arena
and had a lively practice.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know when something might happen to put people
representing America in a compromising position.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the team has escaped relatively unharmed after 10 days
overseas. Hopefully, the players can say the same thing after
tonight's final exhibition tuneup before the World Championship of
Basketball opens Wednesday in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will take on the Italian national team at the
Palaeur, one of the biggest and best arenas in Europe with seating
for about 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy will be the best team we've played so far and it will be
our last game before the tournament, and we feel that with each
game, we've played a tougher team,'' Tomjanovich said. ``So that
helps in our development.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Americans has a good working knowledge of the Italian
team. Forward Bill Edwards played for Calze Pompea Roma last
season; the Palaeur is that team's home court.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he believes the Italians will give the United
States a fitting final tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know just about all of them,'' he said of the Italian
players. ``I've actually played on the same teams with about seven
or eight of them the past few years. They're young and athletic.
(Guard) Carlton Myers is tough and (Andrea) Meneghin is the other
guy who can really play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gianmarco) Pozzecco is playing the point for them and you
love him as a player, but you hate him as a coach. He's a flashy
player who tries to get the crowd involved. And he'll have about
six or seven turnovers at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians lost to the same French team the United States beat
by 30 points in an exhibition last weekend. But Edwards says that's
not a sign of Italy's true team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they lost to the French team,'' he said. ``But
generally, the Italian teams play better at home. They can play
terrible on the road and great at home. And we're on their home
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, Edwards says, if the Americans became involved
in a tight game. Their first two exhibitions were blowout wins and
before the tournament begins, it would be good for the U.S. team to
be pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two teams didn't really push us,'' Edwards said.
``I'd like to see us really get tested down to the wire so we can
get used to it and see how it's really going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards isn't the only American familiar with the Palaeur. Wood
had one of his fondest basketball memories on the same court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the best game of my whole European career in this
building,'' Wood said. ``I had 27 points, 17 in the first half. We
had a $1,000 bonus on the game because it gave us home-court
advantage in the playoffs. So it was a big game for us and we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, just winning will be enough for the Americans.

   GREENWICH, Conn. _ The usual Friday beach backup on Interstate
95 turned into a Powerball jam Friday as New Yorkers sat in traffic
for hours so they could buy a dream of $195 million, a dollar at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic into Connecticut is routinely slow on a Friday night in
the summer, state police officials said. But the lottery jackpot
made things worse: traffic was backed up from New Haven, through
New York and even across the George Washington Bridge. A state
police dispatcher estimated that a 20-mile trip on Interstate 95
took two and a half hours during Friday night's rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and hopeful, the out-of-staters lined up for blocks around
Connecticut gas stations, cigar stores and newsstands to buy
tickets for the Powerball lottery, which is sold in 20 states and
the District of Columbia but not in New York or New Jersey. The
jackpot for Saturday night's drawing is estimated at $195 million,
tying a Powerball record set in May.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Fernando, 36, a courier from Flatbush, Brooklyn, had made
the trip during a previous outbreak of Powerball fever. This time
he drove his motorcycle, so he could weave in and out of traffic on
his way to buy 60 tickets for himself and eight friends.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, fueled by the run from the New York border, is
expected to have more sales for this drawing than any other
Powerball state, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association,
which runs the game. About 122 million tickets will be sold for the
drawing, which will be held at 10:59 p.m. The odds of hitting the
jackpot are 80 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   At the Putnam Shell gas station in Greenwich, a few dozen
customers slept in their cars after the lottery machine shut down
at 11 Thursday night so that they wouldn't have to wait so long
Friday morning. During the day, station employees ushered three or
four people at a time into the tiny shop, and at 7:30 p.m. there
was still a four-hour wait to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Christine McElduff, 35, a licensed practical nurse from Rye,
N.Y, was sunburned after waiting four hours to buy about 40 tickets
for herself and family members. ``My legs are about to give out,
but you never know if it's your lucky day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lines in Greenwich were so long that police added five
officers to the evening shift's usual complement of 15. State
troopers were helping out in some traffic-clogged towns near the
state line.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Fernandez, 18, of Queens, skipped his biology class at the
end of summer school Friday so he could head for Cove Variety in
Stamford. Fernandez had more than two hours in traffic to think
about his lucky numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around and all I saw were New York and New Jersey
license plates,'' he said. &QL;

DeLAY PRAISES OFFICER WHO GAVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT OTHERS 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Friday's fatal Capitol shootout ended in a hail of
bullets just inside a private entrance to House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay's office.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the confrontation was John Gibson, a plainclothes
police officer assigned to provide security for DeLay, the Sugar
Land Republican who is No. 3 man on the leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was fatally wounded, Gibson disabled the gunman who
had shot past security, killing another Capitol police officer and
wounding a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who was in the office at the time, was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and the members of my
staff,'' DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted
quickly and with great bravery as he did, others would have been
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   To DeLay and his staff, the first shots were faint. The lawmaker
emerged from his office, aides recalled. Then, the next shots were
louder and closer. DeLay ordered nearby staff members and interns
into his office where they shut, bolted the large oak door and
began praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we heard a loud popping noise. You assume being in
the Capitol this isn't gunfire,'' said Tony Rudy, who is policy
director for DeLay. ``Four seconds later, we heard them again and
they were more pronounced, and I was absolutely sure they were
gunshots. Everyone took a nosedive under their desks.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said he grabbed two women in the outside office ``and we
went back into the bathroom off my office.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he used a cell phone to call the Capitol police and
stayed in the bathroom for about 10 minutes until they were told it
was safe to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a gruesome scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the congressman and his aides took cover, Gibson was
confronting the gunman in a small room at the head of a hallway
leading into the warren of offices that make up the majority whip's
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman had come through an unmarked door about 20 feet from
the metal detector, turned a corner and came face-to-face with
Gibson. He ``was trying to run away from the other officers
outside,'' said Mike Scanlon, DeLay's press secretary. ``The guy
picked the wrong door.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston and Gibson began firing at almost point-blank range, some
bullets finding their mark, others nicking walls and desks that
lined the hallway. At one of the desks was Joe Connelly, a computer
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullets must have been flying past his head,'' Rudy said.
``He was right there, three or four feet from the firefight.''
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting stopped, Rudy and other staff members eased
down the hallway and heard Connelly, 21, shouting that Gibson had
been shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this guy, laying there bleeding on our rug. A police
officer was standing over him with a gun pointed at his head
telling him to drop his gun and yelling `you shot one of my
officers,''' Rudy said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, wounded in the stomach and legs, was wearing khaki
pants and a T-shirt. His broad-brimmed hat, with a feather in the
band, had been knocked from his head during the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Gibson lay mortally wounded. The 42-year-old officer,
who grew up in Waltham, Mass., near Boston had been assigned to
DeLay's security detail a little more than three years ago.
Wherever DeLay went _ except for the House floor _ Gibson was at
his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Gibson is a hero. We all believe he saved our lives,''
Rudy said. He was ``more than a security guard. He was like a
member of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gibson was being flown by helicopter to the hospital, DeLay
gathered staff members and led a prayer for the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Capitol police urged DeLay to leave the building
and, once they learned he had planned to fly home for the weekend,
suggested he not change his plans.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Houston, DeLay said: ``It was one of the
longest plane rides of my life. I guess these things happen when
you've got so many crazies out there.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said he did not know whether he was a target of the
gunman. ``It was one of the closest doors. But he had to go through
two doors to get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Gibson was one of the finest men I knew,'' DeLay said,
his eyes tearing. ``And he was a damned good Democrat. He was one
tough law officer because he took some bullets and still brought
the shooter down. It's very humbling when somebody gives their life
protecting yours.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman and his wife, Christine, returned to Washington
via chartered aircraft late Friday and were planning to meet with
Gibson's family Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most professional men in the world. Just
yesterday we were laughing about the fact that he had a CD in my
car, `Macho Man,''' said DeLay. ``John was the most macho man I've
ever known. ''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26)

 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The conveyor belt deposits a tray holding a
half-built computer and a stack of parts in front of Sheila Roby.
Wielding an electric screwdriver, Ms. Roby installs the arrayed
circuit boards, memory chips and disk drives. Within five minutes,
she is ready to snap on the beige cover, emblazoned with a gleaming
red Compaq logo.
</P>
<P>
   As that machine glides away, it is replaced by another chassis
and another package of parts for Ms. Roby to assemble. But this
time, the logo on the cover is blue, and it says IBM.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six months since Ingram Micro Inc., the world's
largest wholesale distributor of computers, snaked a conveyor belt
three-quarters of a mile long through this converted warehouse. And
already, it is producing computers for Compaq Computer, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer and Acer.
</P>
<P>
   As if doing assembly work for archrivals that together control
more than one-third of the nation's computer market weren't enough,
Ingram has also grabbed a piece of the action traditionally
reserved for retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Thick yellow wires dangling from ceiling racks are hooked up to
the finished PCs to install both software programs and codes that
will enable the users to tap into their employers' networks.
Finally, Ingram packs up the computer and ships it directly to the
customer with a label that makes the box look as though it came
from a local dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ingram wants to do almost everything computer dealers
do. It will set up World Wide Web sites for them, answer phones in
their name and turn bill collectors loose on their deadbeat
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to handle more and more of their back room,'' said
Jerre L. Stead, the chairman and chief executive of Ingram, which
is based in Santa Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in this warehouse big enough to house a fleet of jets, is
a glimpse of the future of American industry, where manufacturers
don't make anything and retailers don't touch the goods they sell.
Ruthless competition _ whether from cheap foreign labor, new
superstores or the Internet _ is forcing every player in the
production process to question old ways of doing things and to look
for new ways to make money. And if that means invading somebody
else's turf, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming truly unclear who is doing what on what day,''
said Fadi Chehade, a former Ingram executive who is now the
chairman of Rosettanet, a trade group creating standards to aid
computer sales. ``The consumer doesn't care if all the computers
were made on the same production line. The only thing that matters
is who will stand behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   The blurring of lines among manufacturers, distributors and
retailers is occurring in industry after industry, from energy to
medicine. But the computer industry is in many ways in the vanguard
of these shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers now merely design products and advertise their
brands, assigning the actual assembly to others. The dominant
theory of production is moving beyond ``just in time,'' the
inventory-reduction method pioneered by the Japanese in the 1970s,
to ``on someone else's time,'' where inventory is foisted on
another player in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers face whole new classes of competitors, from Internet
sites that never touch products to the manufacturers who are
bypassing retailers to sell to their customers directly.
</P>
<P>
   And the middlemen _ those wholesalers and distributors who were
supposed to be squeezed out by the new efficiencies _ are in fact
thriving. When they're not building products, they're often taking
over from manufacturers and retailers all the logistics of storing
and moving goods.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the on-line music business: Valley Record Distributors
in Woodland, Calif., a wholesale music distributor, holds all the
inventory and mails all the compact disks to customers on behalf of
three of the biggest Internet ``stores'' _ N2K's Music Boulevard,
CD Now and Total E of Columbia House.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while travel agents continue to be squeezed, central
reservations systems like the Sabre Group thrive as they provide
the computerized back office for a new generation of Internet
travel services.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving the computer industry to reorganize itself
faster than nearly any other is the relentless pace of
technological change, which causes today's hot model to become next
month's doorstop. The value of a PC falls by 1 percent a week.
Getting somebody else to hold an inventory of computers or parts _
or simply making inventory vanish by producing PCs only to order _
can give a huge bounce to any company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer inventory is like fresh fish on the table,'' said
Henry Bertolon, chief executive of NECX, one of the largest on-line
computer stores. ``It tastes great the first day, but the longer it
sits the smellier it gets.'' Using distributors like Ingram, NECX
can undercut local stores and simply has no inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry was forced into its cost-cutting mania by
the rapid growth in the early 1990s of Dell Computer and other
manufacturers that sell directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's build-to-order system just about eliminated the need for
inventory and enabled it to undercut the big guys' prices by 10
percent to 15 percent. As the computer market shifted from
individuals to corporations buying networks of hundreds or
thousands of machines, more customers wanted the sort of
customization that was Dell's specialty.

OFFICER WHO GAVE HIS LIFE CREDITED WITH SAVING OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY   AND ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the gunshots echoed down the Capitol
hallway Friday afternoon and the door to his office burst open,
Capitol Police Officer John Gibson stared into the face of danger
and refused to flinch.
</P>
<P>
   The face he saw was that of Russell E. Weston. Wielding a gun,
Weston stormed into the outer office of Republican Rep. Tom DeLay
of Texas, a senior member of the House leadership. Gibson, a Boston
native, nephew by marriage to Rep. Joseph Moakley, and a personal
bodyguard to DeLay, bolted up and hollered for Weston to freeze,
according to eyewitness accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop the gun,'' Gibson yelled. Weston instead began firing.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, the witnesses said, was a frantic, seconds-long
shootout between Gibson and Weston while they stood no more than
several feet apart. It was a shootout that left Gibson dead and
Weston wounded. Others in the office, including DeLay, said Gibson
saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was shot first, but fired repeatedly at the suspect until
he wounded him to the point where he could no longer move,
according to Tony Rudy, a senior aide to DeLay who was hiding in a
nearby office at the time. Within 30 seconds, other Capitol Police
raced into the office. One held a gun to Weston's face as several
others pleaded in a loud voice for Gibson to hold on and stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Gibson ordered him to put his gun down,'' said Rudy.
``The guy didn't. He fired at Officer Gibson, and they had an
exchange of gunfire, and luckily the officer was able to knock the
gunman down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy added: ``John Gibson is a hero. If it wasn't for John
Gibson, this would have been a tragedy of multiple proportions. If
it wasn't for him, the gunman would have walked through this office
and picked us off one by one. He saved our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   They were an unlikely pair, DeLay and Gibson, the former a
conservative Republican from a place called Sugar Land, Texas, the
latter a plaintalking 42-year-old Bostonian with a thick accent, a
love of sports, and a driving desire to work as a cop.
</P>
<P>
   From the crack of dawn until the last vote was cast and the last
event attended at night, Gibson, an eight-year veteran of the
Capitol Police, shadowed DeLay wherever he went. The two were so
close that some DeLay aides likened their relationship to that of
father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a very nice guy, friendly and outgoing,'' Moakley
said. ``The guy was into the job, loved the job. He had the job he
always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said he had not yet been able to reach Lynn, his niece
and Gibson's wife. She is the daughter of his brother Robert. He
said he called the hospital, and was told that she was too
distraught to speak to anyone, even a close relative. Gibson left
behind three children: Kristen, 17, John, 14, and Daniel, 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the office, Gibson was best known for his soaring spirits and
his sense of playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the guy out of Boston, but you can't take Boston
out of the guy,'' said Rudy. ``He frequently asked for the local
papers. He always liked to talk about UMass basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had tried to join the Boston Police department, could not
secure a position, and came to Washington to work on Capitol Hill.
He started as an officer, rising through the ranks to that of the
Diplomatic Protection Service, which is part of the US Capitol
Police. For the last three and a half years, he has been assigned
to DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he followed DeLay across the Hill and the city. When
DeLay worked in his suite of offices in the Capitol, Gibson sat at
a desk just a few feet from the door. At the time of Friday's
shootout, DeLay was in a back office about 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been with me for several years and I consider him a
member of my staff, my family,'' DeLay said in a statement. ``John
gave his life to protect me and the members of my staff. There is
no doubt that if John had not acted quickly and with great bravery
as he did, others would have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say enough about John or the work he did,'' DeLay
said. ``I cannot express the depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, shaken, said Gibson had died the way he would have
wanted to, sacrificing himself for the sake of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fellow came in shooting and encountered John and they had
a little battle,'' Moakley said. ``From what we've been told, if it
hadn't been for John, a lot more people would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, whose office is about 20 feet from DeLay's in the
Capitol, said he left the building shortly before the shootings,
rushing to make a flight home to Boston. He learned of Gibson's
death when he touched down in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In DeLay's office, just moments after EMTs raced out the door
with Gibson and Weston on stretchers, the staff bowed their heads
in prayer for the man they believed had saved them.

 MEMPHIS, Tenn.: Dell's specialty.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Dell lacked an on-the-ground army for sales and
technical support, many companies found it cheaper to buy its
products and create their own support staffs or hire contractors to
do the repair and consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer makers, meanwhile, were bleeding red ink because
they were making mountains of machines that stayed in their
warehouses and on their dealers' shelves until long after they were
obsolete. And because of a convention known as price protection,
the manufacturers had to reimburse the retailers for all the
markdowns on aging goods.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to change.
</P>
<P>
   The computer makers decided it was better to be quick than
clever, and thus to design simple computers with standard designs
rather than trying to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the realization that we were just distributors and
integrators of Microsoft and Intel technology,'' said Robert
Moffat, general manager of PC manufacturing and distribution for
the International Business Machines Corp. That was a hard pill to
swallow for all the PC companies, especially for IBM, which
pioneered the personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the manufacturers have tried to slash
inventory by making computers only after customers order them, as
Dell does. But this has required reorganizing an entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   The first step was to cut way back on the number of components,
like processor chips and hard disk drives, they kept on hand.
Instead, suppliers were forced to keep the inventory, typically
adjacent to or even in the same building as the computer factory,
and sell it to the manufacturers at spot prices throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the suppliers balked at being forced to hold all the
inventory, with its ever-deteriorating value, but their complaints
were largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Compaq tried to do this five years ago, there would have
been a rebellion,'' said Charlie Winder, Compaq's vice president
for North American operations. ``But as the direct model began to
grow and challenge the indirect model, our partners began to see
there may be an advantage in building a hybrid model,'' a system
that still sells computers through local retailers but that also
has some of the efficiencies of a build-to-order company like Dell,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This puts the entire industry on a high wire, with no inventory
as a safety net to cover unexpected demand. Computer makers have
started signing contracts to deliver machines that not only have
yet to be built but for which the components have not yet been
procured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling on promise, not on inventory,'' Moffat of IBM
said. ``Everybody has to trust everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, realizing that spending on parts dwarfs
labor costs, have shut down their factories for days at a time to
wait for the price of Intel chips to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Once the manufacturers got a handle on inventory coming into the
factory, they faced the more daunting task of finding shortcuts for
the meandering paths computers traveled after they left the
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on a truck with a computer because I couldn't believe
what my guys were telling me,'' Moffat recalled. ``I found there
was more time spent waiting than driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious of their plans was to have wholesalers like
Ingram, and even some big dealers that served the corporate market,
like the Vanstar Corp. of Pleasanton, Calif., handle some of the
actual assembly. Right now, manufacturers are shipping to these
companies half-built PCs with the motherboard, floppy disk drive,
processor chip and some memory already installed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the assembly partners will be building the computers from
parts. That way, the processor chips, for example, can be shipped
directly from Intel to the distributor, cutting more expensive days
off the supply chain. (This arrangement also cuts out several of
the quality checks, meaning that a computer's first test is often
its last.)
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for the computer companies to give up so much
control over the manufacturing process, but they realized they had
no alternative, according to Jim McDonnell, vice president for
commercial sales at Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own all of the intellectual property; we farm out all of
the direct labor,'' he said. ``We don't need to screw the
motherboard into the metal box and attach the ribbon cable.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the computer industry's response to Dell has not
been an unvarnished success. In theory, the vast ecosystem of
manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers is supposed to act
symbiotically to build computers the moment a customer orders them,
eliminating stockpiles of excess inventory.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the ecosystem suffers from alternating floods and
droughts. None of the computer makers' bold initiatives kept them
from choking on excess inventory earlier this year.

 MEMPHIS, Tenn.: this year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The behavior of Compaq and our channel partners had not
changed as much as we needed to,'' Winder of Compaq said. (In the
computer industry, the network of distributors and dealers serving
corporate users is collectively known as ``the channel.'')
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Aaron Goldberg, an analyst with the research firm
ZD Market Intelligence in La Jolla, Calif., computer distributors
and dealers have had a hard time getting their assembly lines
working. ``These are not manufacturing companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer makers say that they are working the kinks out of
their systems and that the depressed profits of their PC businesses
should begin to rebound in the second half of the year. Compaq, for
example, says it has 3.5 weeks of inventory throughout the channel,
half the level of a year ago and close to its goal of two to three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the distributors, the alliance with manufacturers presents
mostly opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   While the smaller companies are largely being bought because
they cannot cope with the increasingly complex system, a handful of
major players _ Ingram, Tech Data, Merisel and Pinacor _ are
enjoying much faster growth than other segments of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's sales, for example, nearly tripled to $16.6 billion in
1997 from $5.8 billion in 1994, through a combination of
acquisitions and market-share growth. Since the company went public
in November 1996 at $18 a share, its stock has soared by 149
percent, closing at $44.875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram is vastly expanding its traditional computer wholesale
business by building huge, automated warehouses to distribute
components like printers and software and setting up factories like
the one in Memphis to assemble PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has just struck a deal with the Solectron Corp., a
company that manufactures components for nearly all the big
computer makers. The companies say that through a joint network of
11 factories worldwide, they will be able to make 10 million PCs a
year, doing everything from forging the case to soldering the chips
to installing software in each location.
</P>
<P>
   Because PCs are so much alike these days, Ingram is also betting
that some people will not care if they do not have a brand name on
them. So it is creating separate production lines in its assembly
plants to build ``white box'' PCs. These generic machines, in the
past typically built by dealers, have long accounted for a large
share of the computer business. Now Ingram will do the building,
stamping the dealer's name on the PC cover.

<P>
   In the new, topsy-turvy computer world, Ingram itself is coming
to look more and more like Dell. After all, it is building
computers to order and shipping them directly to customers. So why
bother with all the complexity of doing business in the names of
all those manufacturers and retailers? Wouldn't it be better to
start selling the computers directly to the public, as Dell does?
</P>
<P>
   No way, says Stead, Ingram's chief, because his dealers
collectively are a vastly more powerful sales army than Dell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 120,000 resellers with more than one million feet on
the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that infantry of computer dealers is now besieged by almost
everyone but Ingram. All the big manufacturers have started selling
directly to end users.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limited success in the past with direct sales, Compaq
recently revived and expanded an effort to sell computers by
telephone and over the Internet. And it is using the big sales
force it inherited in its acquisitions of Tandem Computers and the
Digital Equipment Corp. to deal directly with big customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large accounts want a relationship with Compaq,'' Winder said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, IBM has started selling its Netfinity line of servers
_ big personal computers that store files for a group of users _
directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous direct-sales attempts, IBM is not protecting its
dealers by charging a high list price rather than the actual street
price for its products. And price protection for distributors and
retailers has, for the most part, disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, you had to have a price umbrella so everyone
could live in the market,'' said William McCracken, general manager
of PC sales at IBM ``Today, everyone has to compete on their own
price efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most efficient players these days are a bunch of
companies that try to do for computer sales on the Internet what
Amazon.com has done for books.
</P>
<P>
   They do little more than operate Web sites that display
repackaged listings from the distributors' catalogues with prices
that are barely higher than wholesale costs, and use the
distributors to ship the goods to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Buycomp, founded by Scott A. Blum, the co-founder of Pinnacle
Micro, is a vivid example. Located in an industrial park just a few
miles from Ingram's headquarters in Santa Ana, Buycomp employs
fewer than 50 people to run its site and take calls from customers.

 MEMPHIS, Tenn.: from customers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blum's strategy is to win the business of those customers who
use electronic price-comparison shopping services. So he has
programmed his service to check out his competitors and to offer
the lowest prices on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Buycomp's shipping and handling charges, which are disclosed
only after a customer enters his credit card number, are higher
than some others. Even so, just seven months after the service
started, Blum says the privately held firm has sales of $10 million
a month.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is intent on surpassing the record for the highest
first-year revenue of an American business _ a title now held by
Compaq, which took in $111 million in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon at Buycomp and other on-line stores is the ability
for Internet users to say exactly how they want a new PC configured
and to have that order transmitted directly to a distributor like
Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   A few manufacturers are actually encouraging these Internet
retailers by referring customers from their own Web sites. IBM and
Hewlett-Packard, for example, are running their own Internet
shopping services that let prospective buyers compare prices for
their goods.
</P>
<P>
   For the local dealer who has grown up selling computers to
businesses and helping set them up, the competition is getting much
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Thibault, owner of a small computer dealer in Pleasant
Hill, Calif., started losing business in the last two years to
direct sellers. ``When I started in 1986, I would have made a $500
profit on a $2,500 PC,'' Thibault said. ``Today, you would be lucky
with a margin of $80.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibault's recipe for success, like that of most of his
competitors, is to sell services, including help in setting up a
network or installing a complex software package. If he can sell
$250 to $500 of service with every $2,500 PC, he will be doing
well, Thibault said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all the supposed streamlining in the way computers are
manufactured has done little for him except to make it harder than
ever to get the computers he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very significant gaps,'' Thibault said. ``The
biggest worry I have is the instability of the market right now.
We're spending 60 percent of our time procuring product and 40
percent out selling.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those Internet sites selling computer equipment at
pennies above cost, Thibault said his ability to provide advice and
service allowed him to compete, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers would pay us 2 or 3 percent more because
of our value added,'' he said. ``We know the products better.''
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, companies like Buycomp and NECX are using the
new ways of doing business to create storefronts that appear to
have all the capabilities of a traditional dealer. Customers will
be able to comparison-shop for computers equipped to their liking,
and then arrange the financing and service they need to get the
systems up and running, all selected from third-party providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a virtually integrated model,'' said Bertolon
of NECX. ``You'll be able to access the network to get a quote on
an IBM or a Dell or a white box, then plug in the leasing,
outsourcing and desktop service you want. The Internet creates an
opportunity to further level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this technology and new thinking have created such a flat
playing field, and if PCs bearing the logos of a half-dozen
corporate giants are all made on the same production line,
customers could be forgiven for wondering what, if anything,
differentiates one brand from the next.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' almost reflexive response is that their machines
really are better than their rivals', either because of their
technical designs, their extra features or the quality controls
they have gone through.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims, though, don't cut much ice with Ms. Roby, the
assembly-line worker at the Ingram plant here. She says the only
difference she sees is where the screws and wires go inside the
chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get used to it,'' Ms. Roby said, ``they're all the
same to me.'' &QL;

RESTAURANT SIGN FAILS STATION'S TASTE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle line between old Grand Central and new
Grand Central was drawn shortly after dawn Friday. It was 12 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   About 5:30 a.m., a contractor for the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which runs Grand Central Terminal,
unbolted a 12-foot-long, 1970s-style, multicolored, illuminated
sign for the Oyster Bar, covered it in bubble wrap and returned it
to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, a gleaming metal beaux-arts light fixture was
in its place.
</P>
<P>
   The Oyster Bar installed the sign two weeks ago, hanging it from
the tiled ceiling of the vaulted public space outside its entrance
on the lower level of the terminal. A similar sign had hung in the
same spot from 1974 until June 1997, when the restaurant and
surrounding areas were damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's removal of the sign is a signal to other commercial
tenants that the authority intends to enforce aesthetic standards.
Under a $196 million renovation that is nearing completion, the
architectural features of the beaux-arts landmark terminal are
re-emerging after being eclipsed for decades by visual clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment we bend the rules for one tenant, we've got 90
other tenants right behind,'' said Forrest Taylor, deputy executive
director for operations and chief of staff of the MTA. ``Once that
floodgate opens, you're on your way back to a hodgepodge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Brody, the owner of the Oyster Bar, said the sign was
necessary because of the restaurant's deeply recessed entrance.
Both new and old signs were the work of Rudolph de Harak, a
well-known designer, and they featured the word ``Oyster'' in
angular letters of bright primary colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how people are going to find us, except our old
customers,'' Brody said. ``Since something was hanging there for 24
years, it didn't occur to us that it was hanging without permission
for that whole period and would need new permission now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential,'' Brody said. ``We'd like to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign was in place when the interior of the terminal was
given landmark status in 1980 and could theoretically have remained
forever _ had it been untouched. But once the sign was destroyed,
permission to recreate it was required from the Landmarks
Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign was installed without a permit,'' said Jennifer Raab,
the chairwoman of the commission. ``In our opinion, it was
inappropriate. And we are happy that the MTA had it removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially nameless, the vaulted space outside the restaurant is
known as a ``whispering gallery.'' Unusual acoustics permit two
people standing at opposite corners and facing the wall to hear
each another speaking softly across a distance of 40 feet. &QL;

A LIMPING STRAWBERRY USES HOMER TROT, TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre does not often ask Darryl Strawberry how
his left knee feels, and Strawberry probably would never tell his
manager if what he's feeling in his joint is pain or weakness or
both. Don't ask, don't tell. Ignore the worsening limp, watch the
ball fly off his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry smashed his 14th and 15th home runs Friday night,
propelling the Yankees' to a 5-4 victory over the Chicago White
Sox. The Yankees have won four consecutive games, running their
record to 72-25, which matches the second-best 97-game record in
the 20th century. The 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates won 73 of their first
97 games.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte pitched seven innings, allowing eight hits, four
runs (two earned), two walks, and struck out six, to improve his
record to 13-6. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth inning for his
26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry probably wouldn't have batted in the bottom of the
sixth inning had Tim Raines not strained a groin earlier in the
game. With Chad Curtis at first base and two out in the sixth,
Strawberry was due to bat with the Yankees trailing, 4-3, having
already hit a home run off John Snyder earlier in the game. Jerry
Manuel, the Chicago manager, charged out of the dugout and called
for reliever Bryan Ward, a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry almost never faces left-handers in late-inning
situations, and under normal circumstances, Curtis would have been
available to pinch-hit for Strawberry. But Curtis had replaced
Raines in the fifth inning, leaving Torre with few viable options
on his bench. So Strawberry hit against Ward, whose elaborate
sideburns make him seem more suited to the 1860s than 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry got ahead in the count two balls and no strikes,
before the count ran to 3-2. Ward, throwing with a three-quarter
motion, fired a fastball to the outside corner. Strawberry's
contact was perfect; through the lens of the center field camera,
it appeared he had hit a line drive single over second base, the
ball's trajectory low. But this line drive kept going and going,
beyond the leap and reach of the Mike Cameron, Chicago's center
fielder, beyond the center field wall, 422 feet away. Members of
the crowd rose to their feet, as Strawberry shuffled around the
bases, with the Yankees swiftly and suddenly in the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis waited for Strawberry at the plate, pointing a finger at
his 6-foot-6 teammate, and Strawberry paused for a moment before
wading into a dugout of happy teammates. Even before his head
disappeared from sight, a rolling cry began in the crowd: They
wanted to honor Strawberry one more time, and he obliged them,
stepping out and waving his left hand. He is 36 now, and after
being left for dead last year, in the baseball sense, he has far
exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, it is his home run trot that provides
evidence that Strawberry is ailing, that his surgically repaired
left knee is bothering him. Hitting against Snyder in the fourth
inning, Strawberry reached out to hit a changeup, driving the pitch
with most of his weight shifted onto his right leg, the ball
landing in the lower deck of the right field stands.
</P>
<P>
   As Strawberry moved toward first base, he stepped mechanically,
awkwardly, limping heavily. He steadied as he rounded first, the
limp hidden, but it was there again as he crossed home plate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strawberry has been playing like this for more than two weeks
now, the spring training gracefulness gone. On July 14, Torre
summoned Strawberry and asked him about his knee, and Strawberry
admitted it felt weakened at times, and Torre considered placing
Strawberry on the disabled list. But the team trainers assured
Torre that playing cannot worsen Strawberry's knee; time seems to
be doing that on its own. There doesn't seem to be much chance of
the knee improving, either.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said earlier this week that there is no way he could play
Strawberry in left field, given his current condition. Rather, the
manager inserts him in the lineup as a designated hitter and will
continue to do this, hoping Strawberry's knee will hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in August, the Yankees believe Chili Davis will be back
and ready to serve as the designated hitter, and Torre is committed
to playing Davis on a regular basis. If Strawberry cannot play left
field, the Yankees' leading home run hitter will be left out.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Torre don't worry about that now. Torre doesn't ask,
Strawberry doesn't tell. Ignore the limp. Watch the ball fly, so
long as Strawberry lasts.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Drew Henson is going to play football at the University of
Michigan, and there is the chance, as a top rated quarterback, that
he could move on to the National Football League. Despite all that,
the Yankees signed the infielder Friday to a $2 million signing
bonus, the most money ever given to a third-round draft pick.
Henson's obligation to the Yankees is only to play in the summer,
between spring and fall training camps with the Wolverines. He can
walk away from baseball after finishing college and keep the
Yankees' money, no strings attached, making him a significant risk
for the Yankees. Henson, a 6-foot-2 inch, 220-pound third baseman,
worked out with the Yankees' major-league team in Tampa July 9 and
met with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, the
next day. According to a person involved in the negotiations, the
Yankees offered Henson $1 million, and when he rejected that, they
doubled their offer, at Steinbrenner's prodding. Henson, who
reported to the Gulf Coast League Friday and played in his first
game, will receive the bonus over a five-year period. ... David
Wells was supposed to start Saturday, but after suffering a
recurrence of gout in inside part of his right foot, Wells is
scheduled to start Sunday, instead, and Hideki Irabu will start
Saturday.

LATEST BREACH RAISES NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT CAPITOL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Security at the US Capitol has been violated in
some high-publicity incidents over the years, including Friday's
shooting rampage, despite a 15-year effort that has markedly
tightened access to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, US Capitol Police have imposed a variety of measures
to improve security, including the installation of metal detectors
and closing the road directly in front of the Capitol. Overall,
officials stressed, the symbol of the nation's democratic system
must be secure but open to all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Capitol is more open than most federal buildings.
There are numerous entrances, including tunnels that connect to the
nearby House and Senate office buildings. At any moment during the
day, the maze of hallways and ornate public rooms are filled with
senators, representatives, lobbyists, journalists, and thousands of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The 181-acre grounds of the Capitol and the surrounding
buildings are patrolled by 1,000 uniformed members of the US
Capitol Police. The roads around the Capitol are lined with 758
concrete barriers and have 33 barriers that rise from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone can walk up to the Capitol building before going
through security, which is different from the White House, where a
gated security system rings the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's shooting, there were conflicting reports about
whether the gunman went through the metal detector and set it off
or whether he avoided it. Representative William Thomas, a
California Republican, said gunman ``went around the
Magnetometer,'' referring to the metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by an exchange of gunfire and the death of two
officers.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas's description of the assailant's entry is correct and
the gunman went around the metal detector, it raises serious
questions about whether the visitors' entrances are secure.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes at a time when the federal government
continues to evaluate the effectiveness of metal detectors and
other security devices. A 1996 government study of metal detectors
at airports found a 40 percent failure rate in detecting bombs,
grenades, guns and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a federal study found a broad range of deficiencies
in the government's ability to track terrorists who might attack
federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Arenberg, spokesman for the National Association of
Police Chiefs, said if a person is determined to get a gun past a
metal detector, he or she could probably do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who really wanted to get a device through could do so
in pieces and then put it back together again,'' Arenberg said. He
said the effectiveness of metal detectors depends entirely on the
person operating them. Such devices can be set to varying degrees
of sensitivity and must be watched closely to determine whether a
gun is present.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Capitol Police often search bags by hand, a
method that is not foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the congressional representative from
Washington, said on CNN after the shooting that she is satisfied
with the security at the Capitol and urged that there not be an
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a breach of security. This was a maniac barging
in,'' she said. ``You can't design security around a maniac. I
don't think there is a lot more they can do. We must not overact so
the people's house is no longer that.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of incidents in recent years have underscored that
security at federal buildings can be violated. Even the White House
has not been immune, with an airplane crash-landing on the South
Lawn and a shooting occurring at the gate. Then came the bombing of
the federal building in Oklahoma City, prompting a new wave of
security concerns at federal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the
White House has been closed to vehicular traffic since May 1995.
Most recently, a series of shooting at schools and elsewhere by
children have led to a debate over the easy availability of guns
and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol has been the scene of sporadic violence, but
Friday's incident was one of the worst ever. Most famously during
this century, Puerto Rican extremists in March 1954 went to the
House visitor's gallery and shot and wounded five congressmen on
the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   A new round of security measures began after a 1983 incident in
which a group opposed to US involvement in Lebanon and Grenada
planted a bomb outside the Senate chamber. That prompted the
Capitol Police to install metal detectors and X-ray machines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1985, after a suicide bomber killed 241 Marines in
Beirut, Capitol Police closed off public access to the street
directly in front of the Capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been incidents since then demonstrating that
security is vulnerable. In 1989, columnist Jack Anderson sneaked a
plastic handgun into the Capitol and displayed it during an
interview with then-Senator Bob Dole. At the time, Capitol security
officials criticized Anderson for staging a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a man brought a .357 Magnum into a Senate committee
hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who work on Capitol Hill said security is notably
tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known a guard here five or six years, and she makes me
show the ID every day,'' said Jim Jones, press secretary for
Senator John F. Kerry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Barbara Majewska was standing by the souvenir shop,
having just finished a tour of the Capitol with her husband and two
kids when she heard the shots. The echo stayed with her, mingling
with the screams of her 4-year-old daughter, Danika.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone scattered, running, shouting, crying, except for
Majewska, who thought it wiser to hide. Maternal instinct kicked
in, overrunning her own terror and inclination to bolt as she
directed her 15-year-old son to lie down flat behind a statue.
Majewska piled Danika between, and she lay on top, forming a human
shield.
</P>
<P>
   Her long, thin arms, she recalls thinking, couldn't be much of a
shield for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it,'' Majewska exclaimed, after reuniting
with her husband, Lee, who was swept up and lost in the commotion.
``I never thought this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Majewska, who lives in Poland, didn't yet know that four people
were hit by those bullets _ the assailant, two fatally wounded
officers, and a tourist like herself. All she knew is that she and
her husband, after searching frantically for one another outside
the Capitol amid a crowd thick with cameras, Popsicles, American
flags and a half-dozen accents from far away places, had found each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many millions of parents, toddlers, tourists, and
foreigners, Majewska and her husband were here to visit the US
Capitol, seat of the largest democracy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is, even with security guards posted at every entrance and a
swirl of plainclothes officers partrolling the Capitol grounds, one
of the most open and public viewings of government at work
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the Capitol building itself, visitors congregate. They
come as part of their social studies class, to learn the difference
between a bill and an amendment. They come to buy T-shirts, flags
and cups boasting logos of the Capitol dome. They come to curry
favor with their representatives. They come in the hope of rubbing
elbows with important people they see on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands pass every day under the Capitol dome, through
Statuary Hall, where history is embodied in the marbled forms of
suffragettes and military heroes, and into the crypt, where the
shooting happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting in line and this bang went off, and one lady
said, `Oh, it must be construction,' and the other said, `No way,
that is gunfire,' '' said 14-year-old Derek Zalewski, of
Stevenspoint, Wis. ``This guard came running up to us in
plainclothes with a badge and a gun out and put us up against the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   What Zalewski witnessed next _ a woman running out of the
capitol in blood-soaked clothes as panicked people poured down the
capitol steps _ was made that much more shocking by the way it
confliced with the ``pretty'' mental picture he had formed of the
Capitol. Visitors repeatedly pointed out that they considered the
Capitol extremely safe and well-policed when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to map out a route for my high school students,''
said Jillian Simon, a 23-year-old English teacher from Wilmington,
N.C. ``It's ironic. I went through the detectors and thought, only
minutes before I heard the shots, how safe it is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm a little shaken,'' she cried, her hands
trembling. ``I just saw my whole life in front of me. There's
something extremely wrong in this country. The security doesn't
work. The gun laws don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people milled about after the shooting on the shaded
lawn in front of the Capitol, which had been transformed into a
parking lot filled with police cars, ambulances and a large fleet
of black sedans. Among the cars roamed Secret Service agents,
public safety officers and plainclothes police.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the scene as less extraordinary than as a sad reminder
of the pervasiveness of violence in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical,'' said Donna Peterson, a 26-year-old
stationed with her husband at Fort Campbell, Ky. ``It's nothing
abnormal. If you have kids shooting their teachers, this is bound
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an observation voiced by more than one visitor and
contrasted with a prayer offered by a group of clergy, who voiced
hope that what had passed would not be repeated again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray that there could be healing words that go forth, that
sanity be restored, that violence be negated,'' intoned the Rev.
Jim Pitt from Pittsburg, who knelt in prayer with other clergymen
under the shade of an oak tree near the Capitol after the shooting.
``We unite in great sorrow.''

GALAXY'S SANCHEZ SOLD TO MEXICAN CLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. -- Wellington Sanchez, who joined the Los
Angeles Galaxy to great fanfare back in April, saw his stint with
Major League Soccer brought to an end Friday, sold to Mexico's
Morelia in a deal that didn't particularly bother anyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadoran midfielder, acquired from New York/New Jersey in
exchange for Eduardo Hurtado, had seen limited success in L.A., and
his departure does little to weaken what might be MLS's best
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   It was an economic move made by the league, which won't discuss
economics, one geared to recoup the investment made to sign the
overpriced Sanchez in the spring. He departs for Morelia
immediately and will miss the Galaxy's showdown tonight at the Rose
Bowl with Eastern Conference leader D.C. United (17-5, 41 points).
</P>
<P>
   The move leaves the Galaxy (16-4, 46) with an open foreigner
slot, one that General Manager Danny Villanueva acknowledged could
be used should Juergen Klinsmann decide to play in MLS. Villanueva
said his desire for the German striker ``has not wavered one bit,''
that he ``wants him in L.A.'' and that the Galaxy has made that
clear to the league.
</P>
<P>
   More likely is defensive aid; the Galaxy has asked MLS to
inquire about two defenders, both from the Americas, Villanueva
said; MLS Deputy Commissioner Sunil Gulati said it was possible the
Galaxy would not receive an additional player this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Klinsmann is a realistic option because we have
so many players up front,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ``Before
Carlos (Hermosillo's acquisition), he was a great option, but with
Carlos here, I don't think there's something there. ... The
position we've got to be looking for is in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinsmann hasn't determined what path he'll next follow, and
Gulati said the earliest he'd join an MLS team was next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez played in 11 of 18 games after joining the Galaxy,
starting in nine and scoring a goal and four assists, but he
struggled with the speed and physical play of the American game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just beginning to show what he could do,'' said
Zambrano. ``For a kid 23 years old, who had never been out of
Ecuador, he had a tough time (but) was just starting to feel at
ease, starting to show his true value.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said the Galaxy wasn't disappointed in Sanchez's
production, that he ``did as much as he could do in the time he was
here. ... It's an interesting situation, really. He's usually the
playmaker on whatever squad he plays for, but we already had a
mainstay in Mauricio Cienfuegos. Since day one we asked him to play
a position supporting Mauricio, and it was foreign to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was a luxury in the Galaxy's deep midfield, and his
departure should provide additional playing time for rookie Clint
Mathis. The most likely foursome is Cienfuegos, Cobi Jones, Martin
Machon and Danny Pena, with Mathis, Daniel Hernandez and
wing-defender Ezra Hendrickson providing Zambrano more options.

<P>
   Celeste M. Johnson had a dream of making gardening and
landscaping products out of mixed recycled plastics. Raising the
capital, however, has been a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   There was that meeting three years ago with consultants hired by
Connecticut to advise start-up businesses. ``They actually said to
me that what I needed was a man in a white shirt sitting behind
that desk because it's a factory and they needed a man to run a
factory,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her company, Obex Inc., based in Stamford, Conn., has scraped by
since 1990, making garden trellises, compost bins and a golf game
for children. And despite her ability to get contracts with the
Burpee Seed catalogue and 14 Home Depot stores in the New York
area, Ms. Johnson, 44 _ formerly a business manager for Pitney
Bowes Inc. and a securities analyst for Salomon Brothers _ has had
little luck raising the $500,000 to $1 million that she needs to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the life of a woman entrepreneur. Despite the fact
that women started businesses at twice the rate of men last year,
they received just 2 percent of the institutional venture capital
money, according to Women's Growth Capital Fund, a small venture
capital firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And while women own more than 36 percent of the businesses in
the country, they received just 22 percent of small-business loans.
These numbers persist even though it has been illegal since the
mid-1970s for lenders to discriminate on the basis of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But what had been a glacial shift to parity may be picking up
speed _ in part because, however gimmicky some might find it, a
growing number of lenders and investors see women entrepreneurs as
a market hitting its stride.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Small Business Administration added six centers
across the country to its Women's Business Center Program. And last
month, a new venture capital firm in San Francisco and a new lender
in Tennessee, both owned by women, started making loans and equity
capital to other women-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the BankBoston Corp., joining other major
lenders, began a loan program for women entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Government programs have long been a haven for women-owned
businesses. But private investors and lenders say their growing
interest means just one thing: there's money to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women-owned business is the largest emerging segment of the
small-business market,'' said Teresa L. Cavanagh, director of the
Woman Entrepreneurs' Connection at BankBoston. ``Women-owned
businesses are an economic force that no bank can afford to
overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   As women have entered high-growth industries in the last five
years, the financial picture has started to change markedly. The
percentage of women who financed their businesses with their credit
cards fell to 23 percent in 1996 from 52 percent in 1992, the most
recent years for which data are available, according to the
National Federation of Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the percentage of women who use business
earnings to finance their growth rose to 72 percent from 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans, however, were a declining source of capital, the
study showed. Two years ago, 20 percent of women business owners
relied on commercial or business loans, compared with 26 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   More of today's women entrepreneurs have already climbed the
corporate ladder and have solid management or technical experience.
These women are not content to run boutiques as tax write-offs for
their husbands; they are starting companies in the Internet,
computer software and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Garnett, 36, wanted to make integration software, which
helps programs from different manufacturers run together. So, in
1996, she cashed out a total of $500,000 in stock options from
Sybase, where she was a vice president and general manager, and
from Oracle, where she had been a manager, and founded Crossworlds
Software Inc. in Burlingame, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garnett and her husband, Terence, a venture capitalist, put
in another $5 million. Then, using her connections in the computer
industry, she raised $45 million from corporations like Intel and
Compaq, in exchange for equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Garnett made waves by running a company ad in
business and consumer magazines in which she posed in a low-cut,
black cocktail dress. Lost in the debate about the ad was Ms.
Garnett's achievements as a businesswoman. Today, Crossworlds has
200 employees and is expected to go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that's invested already knew me personally,'' Ms.
Garnett said. ``I couldn't have raised this without prior
relationships and track records with these people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why more women don't tap that,'' she said.
``You're not dealing with venture capitalists, who are 98 percent
men and who don't have a good track record investing with women.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to Patty Abramson, managing partner of the Women's
Growth Capital Fund, which has $30 million under management,
``venture capitalists are a classic old-boy network.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't have the contacts,'' she said. ``They're not
playing golf with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all women agree with that stereotype. In 1995 Laila J.
Rubenstein, a former consultant in emerging technologies, started
Greeting-Cards.com Inc. with her husband, Eugene. The New York
company sells customized e-mail cards with music and animation over
the Internet. Its sales have grown tenfold each of the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Rubenstein, 32, was turned down by 10 venture
capital firms as she tried to raise $5 million in exchange for a 20
percent equity stake. But with the current fever over Internet
stocks, she is ready to start knocking on doors again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think being a woman stops me at the door,'' said Ms.
Rubenstein, who is the company's chief executive. ``No matter how
you look, if you show them you can make money, and take the next
step, I don't think they care that you're a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the SBA is doing more to make venture capital accessible
to women. Last month, the agency designated Ms. Abramson's firm as
a small-business investment corporation, which means that for every
$1 she raises, the agency will give the firm $2 for investing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also granted the special capital-raising status to
two new firms: Aurora, a $25 million venture capital firm in San
Francisco, will focus on women-owned businesses in technology,
communications and health care. Capital Across America, a lender in
Tennessee, has $24 million in loans for women entrepreneurs in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Aida Alvarez, administrator for the SBA, has set an ambitious
18-month target to close the gap between the 22 percent of loans to
women entrepreneurs and the 36 percent ownership of all businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alvarez dismisses the suggestion that women do not need
special assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a harder time, and we still view them as a group
that we have to make an extra effort to reach out to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Big banks are also making a stronger push to reach women
entrepreneurs. In forming its women's banking division, BankBoston
was following recent moves by Chase Manhattan, Nationsbank and
First Union. BankBoston allocated $100 million for loans to
women-owned businesses and said it would also provide counseling,
access to information and advocacy for those businesses on the
local and national levels.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the money begins to hunt for the women-owned businesses
with the biggest possible returns, many small companies still face
a grind in qualifying for loans.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Abizaid, who started the Abizaid Arts dance studio in
Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood last year, got a $50,000 revolving
line of credit from Chase Manhattan Bank only after an investor
agreed to be a co-signer. The Brooklyn Economic Development Corp.,
a government agency that lends to New York City businesses, lent
Ms. Abizaid another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abizaid scraped together $25,000 of her own money and then
charged about $60,000 on her credit cards, which she paid off by
selling her apartment. Angel investors chipped in a total of
$353,000.
</P>
<P>
   Open almost a year, Abizaid Arts still needs $28,000 to cover
the operating deficit, and Ms. Abizaid is running out of places to
look. She doesn't want any more debt, and as for venture capital
firms, she said, ``I don't think it would be worth their while.''
</P>
<P>
   While there may be early signs that more money is flowing to
women entrepreneurs, it may be 5 to 10 years before the trend is
clear, Ms. Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When some of these companies do well, and you see a bunch of
women CEOs of publicly owned companies,'' she said, ``venture
capitalists and lenders are going to take a look at them.''

GUNMAN KILLS TWO IN CAPITOL SHOOTING SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER   AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two police officers were killed and a woman
seriously wounded Friday when a lone gunman opened fire in the US
Capitol, as scores of terrified tourists scrambled for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, identified as Russell E. Weston, 42, of Missoula,
Mont., was shot three times and arrested after ``he tried to blast
his way into the Capitol,'' as one congressman described the event,
in a seemingly senseless midafternoon attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service had listed Weston as a ``low-level'' threat
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the slain officers likely saved lives with their
swift response after the suspect, brandishing a .38 caliber
handgun, broke past guards at an entrance to the Capitol to the
horror of onlookers, including many children.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities searched for a motive for the assault, the
tragedy struck many in Washington like a death in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capitol is the people's house, a place where visitors and
workers should not have to fear violence,'' Clinton said. ``Every
American appreciates the bravery of the Capitol police that
prevented further injury through their courageous actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident marked the worst violence in the Capitol since five
lawmakers were shot in the House chamber by Puerto Rican
nationalists in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut of Fort Washington,
Md., an 18-year veteran of the US Capitol Police, and Special Agent
John Gibson, a Waltham, Mass. native who had served eight years on
the force. Both men leave three children, who were at their sides
in separate Washington hospitals when they were declared dead soon
after the gun battle erupted at about 3:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist, Angela Dickerson, 24, was shot in the head and
shoulder and was listed in serious condition at a Washington
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Weston is expected to survive his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Weston was seen Thursday at his family's home in Valymeyer,
Ill., the Miami Herald reported on its Web site Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Weston, who believed the government
had planted mines on his property in Montana, argued with his
father, Russell E. Weston Sr., after he used his father's shotgun
to kill more than a dozen cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot a bunch of cats and I made him get out. I got mad,
told him, `You gonna have to leave,''' said the man who identified
himself as Weston's father, according to the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Weston drifted between his family home and a
half-acre plot in Montana that he used to mine gold.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, authorities said Weston began the shooting spree
after walking several blocks to the Capitol from a vehicle that was
stocked with a large amount of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the gunman burst into the Capitol through the
``document door,'' an entrance on the building's east side that is
not far from the rotunda where leaders such as President John F.
Kennedy have lain in state.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 3:40 p.m., as many House and Senate members were
heading home for the weekend and hundreds of tourists were viewing
the halls where laws are made.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology of the violence is sketchy. But authorities said
the assailant shot Chestnut in the head after darting around a
metal detector at an entrace near a crowded souvenir stand. They
said the suspect fired immediately after Chestnut asked him to go
through the metal detector before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all ducked,'' said Justin Brown, who works at the souvenir
stand. ``When I looked up, I saw the officer was down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gunman charged onward, Ronald Beamish, 69, a visitor from
Gloucester, England, tended to the stricken Chestnut, cradling him
on the cold floor. ``He was trying to talk,'' Beamish said. ``His
lips moved. ... He was barely alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, ``You'll be all right, you'll be all right,'' said
Beamish, whose khaki pants were stained with blood as he recounted
the incident on the Capitol lawn. ``But there was nothing I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect charged into the Crypt, a circular room with stately
pillars and walls adorned with historical displays. There, he
turned left toward the House side of the Capitol and down a hallway
where the office of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
majority whip, is located.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a member of DeLay's personal security detail, was
outside DeLay's office. Although it was not clear how or where
Dickerson was wounded, witnesses said Gibson and the suspect were
struck in a hail of bullets outside DeLay's office. Gibson was shot
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said the suspect was mostly expressionless and
said nothing they could hear throughout the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just boom, boom, boom, and people yelling, `Take cover,
take cover!''' said Diane Markley, who was in the Crypt while
touring the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trapped, with nowhere to run,'' said Catherine
Whinery, of Gorham, Maine, who was with Markley and 10 other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As the drama unfolded, many tourists were directed into
restrooms by security officers, who locked them in until the threat
had passed. Others were rushed out of the building. Lawmakers and
their staffs were cautioned to lock themselves in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from walking through this historic place, feeling
patriotic, to feeling just stunned,'' Markley said. ``Why would
some nut do this?''
</P>
<P>
   No evidence surfaced that the suspect had targeted DeLay or his
staff. But the proximity of the bloody encounter and Gibson's final
stand deeply affected DeLay and his aides, as it did many other
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed _ and those who apprehended the
gunman _ are true heroes of democracy and every American owes them
a deep debt of gratitude,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before the tragedy, the House had been roiled
in a rancorous, partisan debate over health care. But in the hours
afterward, many returned tearfully to the Capitol to mourn the
slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``John gave his life to protect me and the members of my
staff,'' DeLay said. ``There is no doubt that if John had not acted
quickly and with great bravery as he did, others would have been
killed. I cannot express the depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's wife, Lynn, is the daughter of Robert Moakley, the
brother of Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and heart surgeon,
performed CPR on Gibson and rode with him to Washington's D.C.
General Hospital. He also treated Chestnut and helped carry him to
an anbulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really just focused on keeping their hearts and lungs
moving,'' said Frist, a graduate of Harvard Medical School. He
called the shootings ``a very serious catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, ``Whoever kills or attempts to kill an
officer or employee of the United States while such officer is
engaged in ... his official duties'' faces the punishment of
``death or imprisonment for life.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the official word of the officers' death was made
public, flags throughout the nation's capital were lowered to half
staff.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the alleged gunman was listed in the Secret Service
computer database as a potential threat to the president because of
an incident that occured more than two years ago. He declined to
elaborate on that incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service has had contact with him,'' the official
said. ``If anyone is in the system, it is because of a threat or a
comment or an unusual statement. But there hasn't been any contact
with him in more than two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said they expected the House and Senate to
investigate security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises serious concerns,'' said Representative Elijah
Cummings, a Maryland Democrat. ``It's a reminder of what kind of
world we're living in today.''

   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre does not often ask Darryl Strawberry how
his left knee feels, and Strawberry probably would never tell his
manager if what he's feeling in his joint is pain or weakness or
both. Don't ask, don't tell. Ignore the worsening limp, watch the
ball fly off his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry smashed his 14th and 15th home runs Friday night,
propelling the Yankees' to a 5-4 victory over the Chicago White
Sox. The Yankees have won four consecutive games, running their
record to 72-25, which matches the second-best 97-game record in
the 20th century. The 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates won 73 of their first
97 games.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte pitched seven innings, allowing eight hits, four
runs (two earned), two walks, and struck out six, to improve his
record to 13-6. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth inning for his
26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry probably wouldn't have batted in the bottom of the
sixth inning had Tim Raines not strained a groin earlier in the
game. With Chad Curtis at first base and two out in the sixth,
Strawberry was due to bat with the Yankees trailing, 4-3, having
already hit a home run off John Snyder earlier in the game. Jerry
Manuel, the Chicago manager, charged out of the dugout and called
for reliever Bryan Ward, a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry almost never faces left-handers in late-inning
situations, and under normal circumstances, Curtis would have been
available to pinch-hit for Strawberry. But Curtis had replaced
Raines in the fifth inning, leaving Torre with few viable options
on his bench. So Strawberry hit against Ward, whose elaborate
sideburns make him seem more suited to the 1860s than 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry got ahead in the count two balls and no strikes,
before the count ran to 3-2. Ward, throwing with a three-quarter
motion, fired a fastball to the outside corner. Strawberry's
contact was perfect; through the lens of the center field camera,
it appeared he had hit a line drive single over second base, the
ball's trajectory low. But this line drive kept going and going,
beyond the leap and reach of the Mike Cameron, Chicago's center
fielder, beyond the center field wall, 422 feet away. Members of
the crowd rose to their feet, as Strawberry shuffled around the
bases, with the Yankees swiftly and suddenly in the lead again.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis waited for Strawberry at the plate, pointing a finger at
his 6-foot-6 teammate, and Strawberry paused for a moment before
wading into a dugout of happy teammates. Even before his head
disappeared from sight, a rolling cry began in the crowd: They
wanted to honor Strawberry one more time, and he obliged them,
stepping out and waving his left hand. He is 36 now, and after
being left for dead last year, in the baseball sense, he has far
exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, it is his home run trot that provides
evidence that Strawberry is ailing, that his surgically repaired
left knee is bothering him. Hitting against Snyder in the fourth
inning, Strawberry reached out to hit a changeup, driving the pitch
with most of his weight shifted onto his right leg, the ball
landing in the lower deck of the right field stands.
</P>
<P>
   As Strawberry moved toward first base, he stepped mechanically,
awkwardly, limping heavily. He steadied as he rounded first, the
limp hidden, but it was there again as he crossed home plate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strawberry has been playing like this for more than two weeks
now, the spring training gracefulness gone. On July 14, Torre
summoned Strawberry and asked him about his knee, and Strawberry
admitted it felt weakened at times, and Torre considered placing
Strawberry on the disabled list. But the team trainers assured
Torre that playing cannot worsen Strawberry's knee; time seems to
be doing that on its own. There doesn't seem to be much chance of
the knee improving, either.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said earlier this week that there is no way he could play
Strawberry in left field, given his current condition. Rather, the
manager inserts him in the lineup as a designated hitter and will
continue to do this, hoping Strawberry's knee will hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in August, the Yankees believe Chili Davis will be back
and ready to serve as the designated hitter, and Torre is committed
to playing Davis on a regular basis. If Strawberry cannot play left
field, the Yankees' leading home run hitter will be left out.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Torre don't worry about that now. Torre doesn't ask,
Strawberry doesn't tell. Ignore the limp. Watch the ball fly, so
long as Strawberry lasts.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drew Henson is going to play football at the University of
Michigan, and there is the chance, as a top rated quarterback, that
he could move on to the National Football League. Despite all that,
the Yankees signed the infielder Friday to a $2 million signing
bonus, the most money ever given to a third-round draft pick.
Henson's obligation to the Yankees is only to play in the summer,
between spring and fall training camps with the Wolverines. He can
walk away from baseball after finishing college and keep the
Yankees' money, no strings attached, making him a significant risk
for the Yankees. Henson, a 6-foot-2 inch, 220-pound third baseman,
worked out with the Yankees' major-league team in Tampa July 9 and
met with George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, the
next day. According to a person involved in the negotiations, the
Yankees offered Henson $1 million, and when he rejected that, they
doubled their offer, at Steinbrenner's prodding. Henson, who
reported to the Gulf Coast League on Friday and played in his first
game, will receive the bonus over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Wells was supposed to start Saturday, but after
suffering a recurrence of gout on the inside part of his right
foot, Wells is scheduled to start Sunday, instead, and Hideki Irabu
will start Saturday. &QL;

SLUGGER FEELS HE'S FINISHED WITH RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three months before he will have the right to walk away
of his own volition as a free agent, Mo Vaughn all but declared
that his career with the Red Sox is over.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Steve Burton of WBZ-TV (Channel 4) whether he has seen
his last days in Boston, Vaughn said Friday:
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I think I have. And it's a shame to say, but I think
I have. I think I have for the wrong reasons, but sometimes, you
know, things don't go the way you want to go, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, general manager Dan Duquette said Friday
night, the team is prepared to move on. But Duquette added it was
``doubtful'' the club would attempt to deal Vaughn before next
Friday's trading deadline. But if Vaughn leaves as a free agent,
Duquette said, the money the club would have spent to re-sign him
will be used to sign other productive hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Roger) Clemens left, and it took a while to replace him, but
we did with Pedro Martinez,'' said Duquette, who took the unusual
step of appearing in the middle of the team's TV broadcast Friday
night to answer questions about Vaughn's situation. ``If (Vaughn)
doesn't want to stay here, the Red Sox organization is prepared to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acknowledged, as he has in the past, that the team
asked Vaughn to submit to an alcohol evaluation after he was
charged with drunken driving last January in connection with an
accident on Interstate 95, charges of which Vaughn was later
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette denied claims made by Vaughn Friday that the team
has had him followed by private investigators, or that they ever
raised the issue of drug use with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not personal,'' Duquette said. ``We made several
efforts to re-sign him. He's looking for more money. There isn't
anything personal about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accuse the organization of (using) a private investigator?
No one in the organization has ever considered that. And an
insinuation of drugs? We've never done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regrettable he has seen a need, that he feels compelled
to discuss his contract at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, asked Friday about published comments that he would
prefer to play for the Toronto Blue Jays over returning to the Red
Sox next season, had said, ``What would you do if you played for an
organization that tried to get you to take an alcoholic evaluation?
What would you do if they had a private investigator following you
around? What would you do if they brought up the issue of
narcotics? That's not my style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got these kids to deal with,'' added Vaughn, referring to
his status as a community role model. ``It's not about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, there's many, many things that go along with this
contract situation besides just the dollar amount. There's a lot of
bad blood, and that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that bad blood spilled into the stands, where a sellout
crowd in Fenway Park greeted Vaughn with the loudest booing he has
heard in his six years with the team. The atmosphere was not
improved by the 10-6 beating inflicted on the Red Sox by the Blue
Jays, Vaughn's self-identified team of choice for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn expanded on his comments in a pregame interview with
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you play if there had been people talking about
narcotics use and, you know, affiliations with crack houses and all
different types of things?'' he said. ``Would you play under those
circumstances? If it were for $25 million a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Vaughn said he was on the verge of signing a
three-year deal with the team worth close to $30 million, but talks
broke off when the Red Sox signed newcomer Martinez to a six-year,
$75 million deal. Negotiations took an ugly turn after the drunken
driving charges.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox asked him to submit to an alcohol evaluation as
a condition of renewing negotiations, he angrily rejected the
proposal. The club reacted by offering him just a two-year deal in
spring training, which was immediately turned down.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star Game in Denver, Duquette made another offer,
this one for four years and $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's agents had no comment Friday night, but sources
familiar with the year-long negotiations said that at no time did
the Red Sox raise the issue of drugs with Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who talked to reporters before the TV interview, shook
his head when asked if he would trade Vaughn before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams responded tersely to questions about
Vaughn's status. ``Mo's a professional,'' Williams said. ``He'll go
play and he'll try to win a game tonight. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Vaughn's teammates declined comment on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he didn't say anything,'' said veteran reliever Jim
Corsi. ``Don't even talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's just throwing the bait up there,'' said reliever
Dennis Eckersley. ``But it doesn't matter one way or the other to
me. He's here to win, like all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who Friday morning gave a $150,000 grant to the Mo
Vaughn Youth Development in Boston, said at that time it was only
speculation whether he would leave Boston after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn will have 15 days after the season to file for free
agency. The Sox then would have about another month to negotiate
with him before losing that right. The Clemens negotiations went
down to the December deadline before the righthander announced he
had signed with the Blue Jays.

OFFICER WHO GAVE HIS LIFE CREDITED WITH SAVING OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY   AND ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the gunshots echoed down the Capitol
hallway Friday afternoon and the door to his office burst open,
Capitol Police Officer John Gibson stared into the face of danger
and refused to flinch.
</P>
<P>
   The face he saw was that of Russell E. Weston. Wielding a gun,
Weston stormed into the outer office of Republican Rep. Tom DeLay
of Texas, a senior member of the House leadership. Gibson, a Boston
native, nephew by marriage to Rep. Joseph Moakley, and a personal
bodyguard to DeLay, bolted up and hollered for Weston to freeze,
according to eyewitness accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop the gun,'' Gibson yelled. Weston instead began firing.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, the witnesses said, was a frantic, seconds-long
shootout between Gibson and Weston while they stood no more than
several feet apart. It was a shootout that left Gibson dead and
Weston wounded. Others in the office, including DeLay, said Gibson
saved their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was shot first, but fired repeatedly at the suspect until
he wounded him to the point where he could no longer move,
according to Tony Rudy, a senior aide to DeLay who was hiding in a
nearby office at the time. Within 30 seconds, other Capitol Police
raced into the office. One held a gun to Weston's face as several
others pleaded in a loud voice for Gibson to hold on and stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Gibson ordered him to put his gun down,'' said Rudy.
``The guy didn't. He fired at Officer Gibson, and they had an
exchange of gunfire, and luckily the officer was able to knock the
gunman down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy added: ``John Gibson is a hero. If it wasn't for John
Gibson, this would have been a tragedy of multiple proportions. If
it wasn't for him, the gunman would have walked through this office
and picked us off one by one. He saved our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   They were an unlikely pair, DeLay and Gibson, the former a
conservative Republican from a place called Sugar Land, Texas, the
latter a plaintalking 42-year-old Bostonian with a thick accent, a
love of sports, and a driving desire to work as a cop.
</P>
<P>
   From the crack of dawn until the last vote was cast and the last
event attended at night, Gibson, an eight-year veteran of the
Capitol Police, shadowed DeLay wherever he went. The two were so
close that some DeLay aides likened their relationship to that of
father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was a very nice guy, friendly and outgoing,'' Moakley
said. ``The guy was into the job, loved the job. He had the job he
always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said he had not yet been able to reach Lynn, his niece
and Gibson's wife. She is the daughter of his brother Robert. He
said he called the hospital, and was told that she was too
distraught to speak to anyone, even a close relative. Gibson left
behind three children: Kristen, 17, John, 14, and Daniel, 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the office, Gibson was best known for his soaring spirits and
his sense of playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the guy out of Boston, but you can't take Boston
out of the guy,'' said Rudy. ``He frequently asked for the local
papers. He always liked to talk about UMass basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had tried to join the Boston Police department, could not
secure a position, and came to Washington to work on Capitol Hill.
He started as an officer, rising through the ranks to that of the
Diplomatic Protection Service, which is part of the US Capitol
Police. For the last three and a half years, he has been assigned
to DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he followed DeLay across the Hill and the city. When
DeLay worked in his suite of offices in the Capitol, Gibson sat at
a desk just a few feet from the door. At the time of Friday's
shootout, DeLay was in a back office about 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been with me for several years and I consider him a
member of my staff, my family,'' DeLay said in a statement. ``John
gave his life to protect me and the members of my staff. There is
no doubt that if John had not acted quickly and with great bravery
as he did, others would have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say enough about John or the work he did,'' DeLay
said. ``I cannot express the depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, shaken, said Gibson had died the way he would have
wanted to, sacrificing himself for the sake of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fellow came in shooting and encountered John and they had
a little battle,'' Moakley said. ``From what we've been told, if it
hadn't been for John, a lot more people would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, whose office is about 20 feet from DeLay's in the
Capitol, said he left the building shortly before the shootings,
rushing to make a flight home to Boston. He learned of Gibson's
death when he touched down in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In DeLay's office, just moments after EMTs raced out the door
with Gibson and Weston on stretchers, the staff bowed their heads
in prayer for the man they believed had saved them.

PATAKI AND GIULIANI START SPREADING THE NEWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.H.)  (jw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In back-to-back presentations brimming with unspoken
rivalry and national ambition, New York Gov. George Pataki and New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani went before an audience of
national Republican leaders Friday and sought to claim credit for
the recent rise in New York's fortunes, which each man would like
to ride to higher office.
</P>
<P>
   The paths of the two never crossed at Manhattan's Plaza Hotel
and, as is fitting at such events, neither directly discussed his
own ambitions _ or, for that matter, each other.
</P>
<P>
   But their influential audience _ members of the Republican
National Committee, in town for a summer meeting _ clearly
appreciated the preliminary face-off between two politicians who
are less than friends and whose national ambitions seem to be in
conflict as they seek to lay claim to the same governmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee members clapped and chuckled as Pataki, sounding
as if he were speaking at the Iowa State Fair, described the
decline in crime in New York and boasted, ``Our approach works for
the people of this city, this state, and will work for the people
of America as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And they murmured in interest as Giuliani advised the party to
embrace a Republican version of Bill Clinton's strategy of 1992 by
agreeing that the main interest in 2000 is electing a Republican to
the White House, even if it means sacrificing certain ideological
beliefs to produce a candidate who can win.
</P>
<P>
   That strategic framework would be of particular benefit to
Giuliani, considered part of his party's moderate wing, much like
Clinton in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, great skepticism remains among Republicans that either
New Yorker, Giuliani in particular, could win significant support
among conservative primary voters. Realistically, several
Republicans said, their best hope is that they would be considered
in 2000 as vice-presidential prospects to run with a more
conservative presidential nominee from another part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken competition provided an entertaining backdrop for
the annual session. ``This was so clearly an
each-guy-trying-to-outdo-the-other-guy thing,'' said Thomas Rath, a
national committee member from New Hampshire. ``It was just great
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Giuliani and Pataki crossed political paths was at
the New York Republican Convention in June. That day was devoted to
nominating Pataki to a second term, but Giuliani, with a dramatic
speech intended to restore his uneasy relations with the party,
nearly overshadowed the governor, to the annoyance of Pataki's
allies.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, before a more significant audience of national
leaders, it was Pataki who came out ahead, several committee
members said. The governor, who is not known for his speaking
abilities, gave a spirited speech peppered with statistics, as he
held up his own record in New York _ reducing crime, welfare rolls
and taxes _ as a validation of Republican policies. He earned a
loud, prolonged standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a Republican Party are very different than the
Democratic Party,'' he said. ``We believe in people; they believe
in government. We believe in responsibility; they believe in
dependence. We believe in opportunity; they believe in
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani used his speech to hail the condition of the city and
present his record as a tribute to the success of Republican
policies, a familiar refrain during his national travels. But he
went on to offer political advice to Republicans that he said was
intended to assure the party's return to power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani noted approvingly how Clinton, in 1992, maneuvered the
Democratic Party to the center on several issues, a
primary-election strategy that produced a strong challenge to Bush.
The Democrats, Giuliani said, decided that ``it would be better to
have a Democrat in the White House than to have George Bush
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And they stuck together as a party and they
accomplished that and allowed Bill Clinton to make a move to the
middle, which he later rejected after he became president, in order
to get elected president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who supports abortion rights and gay rights, declined
to give examples of issues that Republicans might need to shelve to
avoid damaging primary fights. He refused even to comment on the
observation by many Republicans that the party would not nominate a
candidate who supports abortion rights for national office. ``I
don't think that should be the question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates said they found a measure of self-protection
in Giuliani's remarks. Tim Lambert, a committee member from Texas,
suggested that the mayor was looking for a way to ensure that
Republicans overlook that Giuliani's views are ``far outside the
Republican mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparring between the mayor and governor continued into the
evening. At Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence, Giuliani treated
the Republicans to an extravagant three-course supper served by
waiters in white gloves under an air-conditioned tent overlooking
the East River. Pataki's aides said he was not invited to the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment included a videotape selling New York as a
place for the Republican National Convention in 2000. Giuliani was
a constant presence on the tape. It included one scene in which he
was reading to schoolchildren, a snippet recognizable to anyone who
had seen his television ads in his re-election campaign last year.

LAWYERS SPAR OVER DETAILS OF LAW CURBING SEX SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It came down to a battle over T-shirts and bikinis,
how to measure 500 feet, and the difference between ``Lady
Chatterley's Lover'' and a magazine like Hustler.
</P>
<P>
   These unusual issues were at the center of the latest skirmish
between lawyers for sex shops and the administration of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani over just how city officials intend to enforce the
new zoning law against X-rated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, lawyers for both sides told Judge Miriam Goldman
Cedarbaum at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that
they had resolved one dispute, over whether the law was too vague.
</P>
<P>
   The city told the judge that in recent days it had issued a
series of new guidelines for building inspectors on such matters as
how to measure the distance between a strip club and a church and
what proportion of videos on a store shelf could be sexually
explicit.
</P>
<P>
   But they continued to fight behind the scenes, in letters and
phone calls, about whether the city should give sex shops notice
before they are shut down. That dispute is still simmering.
</P>
<P>
   All this occurred as the U. S. Supreme Court failed to announce
Friday whether it would grant the sex shops a stay they have sought
against enforcement of the law. Lawyers said they now expect a
ruling on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Giuliani seems to be getting what he wants. With
uncertainty about how the Supreme Court will act and when the city
will move aggressively to enforce the law, a lawyer for the shops,
Herald Price Fahringer, said he was advising his clients to bring
their shops into compliance immediately, to avoid shutdowns as well
as criminal misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the city may seek to padlock shops and
prosecute their owners under a provision that includes a jail term
of up to 90 days and a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor mentioned the criminal provision briefly last week,
but city officials have refused to provide any details of their
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said the situation was particularly urgent for his
clients, who are owners of 107 sexually oriented businesses
affected by the law, in light of Giuliani's suggestion last Sunday
that merely covering up nude dancers with bikinis would not be not
enough to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said that the mayor's comments only reinforced his
view that the law was too ambiguous to be enforced fairly, leading
him to ask Cedarbaum for another stay on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted in court papers filed on Wednesday that the law
violates the First Amendment because it is too vague, and does not
provide enough guidance to owners on how they can come into
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the city told Cedarbaum in papers filed on Thursday that the
shops would be ``easily able to tell'' whether their conduct is
illegal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To give further guidance, the city told the judge that the
Department of Buildings had issued new guidelines this week on how
to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   One notice issued this week, for example, says the shops must
reduce their sexually oriented books or videos to less than 40
percent of their stock and floor area. Although a 40-60 ratio has
been discussed before, Fahringer said Friday that this was the
first time city lawyers had said explicitly that it was to be
considered part of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Another notice offers different factors that a building
inspector must consider in determining whether a topless theater or
club is showing sexually oriented entertainment on a ``regular''
basis, a legal standard contained in the law.
</P>
<P>
   A third notice offers instructions about how to measure the
500-foot distance the law requires to separate sex shops from each
other, as well as from places of worship or schools. The
measurement should be taken from the center line of the door
considered the ``principal entrance'' of the business, the notice
says.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer told Cedarbaum Friday that he was satisfied with the
city's guidelines, and withdrew his request for the stay.
</P>
<P>
   In the one matter over which both sides clashed out of court,
Fahringer said that he wrote to city lawyers earlier this week,
asking that they inform him before they went to court to enforce
the law against any of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Taussig, a senior lawyer in the Corporation Counsel's
office, said Friday by phone that he told Fahringer that he did not
have to inform him of such action, and would not. Under the law,
Taussig said, the city may go to a judge unilaterally if it
believes it has enough evidence to seek an order forcing a store to
close.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said he sent a copy of his letter to judges in all
five boroughs in hopes that if the city appears before them, they
will be sympathetic to his concerns about notice. &QL;

IMMINENT PARTING POOR REFLECTION ON FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Next year is already impossible. He'll be far from
Boston by then. The only No. 42 we'll see in Fenway Park on July
25, 1999, is the one that now hovers above right field, a
blue-and-white tribute to Jackie Robinson. No, Mo Vaughn will not
call this park home next year. He may not even make it to next
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The only glimmer in the bizarre tale of Red Sox vs. Mo is that
we will never have to read about another contract squabble between
Vaughn and Dan Duquette-John Harrington. There will be no more
squabbles because there will be no more offers. This relationship
is finished. That alone makes Friday night one of the most somber
in Sox history. Unfortunately, there are others.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the first-inning boos during the 10-6 loss to the
Blue Jays. You knew they were going to cling to Vaughn as soon as
he approached the batter's box. And forget about Vaughn waving at a
Juan Guzman sinker, simultaneously striking out and raising the
anger of 33,159 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox should be concerned that their best player stood in a
hallway, teary-eyed, and told Steve Burton, of WBZ-TV (Channel 4)
that the club has accused him of associating with crack dealers;
that he feels he is being followed by private investigators hired
by the team; that he is still angered by management's request that
he take alcohol evaluation tests; and, yes, that he told a reporter
from Toronto that he wants to play there next season.
</P>
<P>
   And you. You should be terrified that Duquette, in the middle of
a playoff run, said the Sox are prepared to go on without their
best power hitter. He said the team can make good use of the draft
picks that will come if Vaughn walks away. He said the team has
done its research on possible trades (the deadline is next Friday).
He also remarked, sarcastically, that $10 million can get you a
pretty good hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Dan. You're right. Ten million dollars can get you a good
hitter. But since when is build-and-destroy the sanest route to
general managing? The Sox like to tell you they got Pedro Martinez
when they lost Roger Clemens. I say: Why did it have to be
either/or? Wouldn't both of them be nice? Championship teams don't
``replace'' players to get better; they add to the players they
already have. But that's the least of the problems on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   I have always maintained that Duquette would be haunted by his
quote _ ``The Red Sox are back in business'' _ after Martinez's
signing. What kind of business is this? Three years ago, Vaughn was
the model of what a professional athlete is supposed to be. After
he won the American League's Most Valuable Player Award, the team
held a press conference at Vaughn's youth center. How many pro
athletes spend time on Blue Hill Avenue, in Boston's predominantly
black Roxbury neighborhood, talking with children? But now he
suddenly has problems with alcohol and is obsessed with money?
That's odd.
</P>
<P>
   It will not surprise me if Vaughn announces at his Toronto press
conference that he has signed a four-year contract worth $37
million, the same numbers the Sox offered him earlier this month.
In Boston, he wanted respect before he wanted market value. The Sox
have given him neither. Because of this, they have put themselves
in a dangerous position: They will forever be known as the
organization that has a problem with black players.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn came to town in 1991 and said he was willing to face a
city with a tough racial reputation and an organization plagued by
racial warts. There was the rejection of Robinson in 1945. There
were no black players here until 1959 as the Sox became the last
team in the majors to integrate. There were negative comments from
Reggie Smith and Tommy Harper. Only one black player early in '91
(Ellis Burks). And now a man who was willing to say he loved Boston
is run out of town, feeling his employers think he associates with
crack dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Now ask yourself: If you were a black major
leaguer, would you come to Boston after seeing what happened to
Vaughn? Not only wouldn't I do it, I would tell other players to
stay away, too. Thirty-seven million or one hundred thirty-seven
million; it wouldn't matter. Not many respectable people will sell
their souls for the right to be disrespected?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you this,'' Vaughn said early Friday, ``what would
you do if they brought up the issue of narcotics? That's not my
style. I've got these kids to deal with (as far as his reputation).
It's not about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, it's not about the money. And it's not completely
about race. Take all sentiment aside and ask yourself: How do you
feel about losing a hitter capable of batting .300-plus
(lefthanded) with 35 home runs and 125 RBIs?
</P>
<P>
   It's sad. Mo Vaughn will be gone soon, leaving two No. 42s as
Fenway memories. The Sox are back in business. And it's a sad day
in Boston.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A gunman who had been investigated by the Secret
Service burst into the Capitol on Friday afternoon and killed two
police officers in a corridor shootout that left a tourist and the
gunman lying wounded as terrified bystanders darted for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Without uttering a word, the intruder stormed past a weapons
detector at an East Front entrance and immediately opened fire,
mortally wounding a Capitol Police officer on guard duty and
setting off a gun battle by the office suite of Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   As the first officer, Jacob Chestnut, lay dying, DeLay's
plainclothes Capitol Police guard, Special Agent John Gibson, drew
his weapon and intercepted the intruder a short distance into the
building. As screams and gunfire reverberated through the halls of
power, Gibson suffered mortal wounds before the gunman was brought
down in a burst of a score or more bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect someone to come in with guns blazing,'' John
Feehery, DeLay's spokesman, declared after the gunman was felled in
a matter of minutes in a bloody exchange near the legislator's
office and a gift shop busy with summer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was identified as Russell Eugene Weston Jr., 42, and
described by the authorities as a man with a criminal record and a
history of mental disturbance who had been on the Secret Service's
watch list of hundreds of possibly troublesome individuals
following reports that he had made threatening remarks about
President Clinton. Among the many people the Secret Service
investigates, Weston was not considered a major danger, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's driver's license listed his address in Valmeyer, Ill.,
according to the police, who said he also had recent roots in
Helena, Mont. Authorities said he had used a six-shot .38-caliber
Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver in his attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carpet in our office is covered in blood,'' Tim Berry, 30,
a policy adviser to DeLay, declared in describing the scene as the
gunman, in khaki pants and a green fedora with a feather, was
finally shot down. ``Ten police officers surrounded the suspect
with guns trained at his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was drinking champagne and celebrating the passage of
health care legislation with members of DeLay's staff in the
congressman's suite of offices when the gunman burst into the
Capitol, about 30 yards from DeLay's inner office. Some of the
aides dove under desks, others darted for the back of the suite.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman's siege began at 3:40 p.m., shortly after both the
Senate and House had ended their debating business for the week.
Alerted in minutes about the casualties, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,
a cardiac surgeon, rushed from the Senate offices in the northern
end of the Capitol, administering to one of the dying police
officers as well as to the gunman. The police later reported that
the gunman had been shot twice in the chest but was not in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was focused on keeping their heart and lungs going,'' Frist
said later, after riding with emergency workers to the hospital.
``This is a very serious catastrophe,'' he added, speaking shortly
before the extent of the incident was confirmed by the lowering of
the Capitol flag to half-staff in honor of the two police officers
slain as they denied the gunman deeper entrance to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist wounded in the crossfire, identified as 24-year-old
Angela Dickerson, was listed in serious condition with wounds in
the face and the shoulder.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was potential for far greater mayhem, for the gunman had
rushed past the weapons detector at one of the Capitol's main
public entrances, the Document Door passage that opens past the
gift shop, with the historic Crypt area beyond, below the Great
Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of tourists at nearby turnings were suddenly propelled
into panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was making a purchase, and I heard shots to my
right,'' said Tyvon Crawford, a 20-year-old student and employee at
the gift-shop kiosk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked and jumped down into the booth, and then a tourist
jumped in with us. I was able to see downed bodies. The gunman came
in and fired one shot and security guards fired back at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from Gloucester, England,
stood recalling the scene later, his pants stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the shots go off,'' he said. ``Everybody scattered. I
saw an officer hit the floor. I went over to him and felt his
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to say something to me,'' Beamish continued. ``I
yelled, `Get a stretcher!' There was blood coming from his head,
and one eye looked as if it were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just beyond, at the museum display cases on the Crypt floor,
Judson Threlkeld and his wife, Rachel, were studying a bit of
Capitol history when gunfire and screams startled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a bang,'' he said later. ``She dropped to the floor,
and I got on top of her. There was a pause and we were afraid he
was going to come into the open space and start firing.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple ducked behind a pillar as the Capitol police came
through. ``They yelled, `Get out! Get out!' and about 20 of us ran
out of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was about to depart for a weekend at his Camp
David retreat in Maryland when the Capitol attack occurred about a
mile to the East. He was kept apprised, keeping to his schedule,
just as legislative officials emphasized that the Capitol would be
open on Saturday, with no curtailing of its routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not shut down the Capitol,'' Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of tourists stood on the Capitol steps as the gunfire
burst into the building. In minutes, they saw emergency vehicles
and the police pour into the East Front parking area. They stood
transfixed as helicopters dropped down to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol grounds were secured, and nobody was allowed to
leave until cleared by teams of investigators from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the Capitol Police and the Washington Metropolitan
Police, with the latter eventually assuming the lead role in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators were among the tourists as word spread about
the fatal shootout. ``You have to be out of your mind to do
something like that,'' Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., declared as the
Capital was cordoned and vetted as a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dan Nichols of the Capitol police delivered the news that
two officers had died. ``This is a tough day for the United
States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun battle was the most serious in the Capitol since 1954,
before the era of weapons detectors, when three Puerto Rican
nationalists burst into the House and injured five lawmakers.
Historically, the Capitol has been the scene of bombings, shootings
and other forms of mayhem since the early days of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion by Weston occurred more than two years after he
had been interviewed by Secret Service investigators _ one of
hundreds such reported incidents _ and rated as a minor problem.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Capitol on Friday night, from behind a barrier of
yellow police, police technicians could be seen poring over the
first-floor entrance where the gunfire had erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of small pieces of white tape were pasted to the floor as
investigators tried to reconstruct the gunman's lethal intrusion
into the heart of the nation's lawmaking citadel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, he shot his way into the Capitol,'' said Thomas.

TAZIO SECCHIAROLI, 73, MODEL FOR `PAPARAZZO' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH BOXER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tazio Secchiaroli, the celebrity-hounding photographer who was
the inspiration for Paparazzo, a central character in Federico
Fellini's 1960 movie ``La Dolce Vita,'' died in his sleep on Friday
at his home in Rome at age 73. His son, David, said the cause was a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Secchiaroli was a paparazzo in all but name when Fellini spotted
him in the late 1950s. He and his fellow photographers, Sergio
Spinelli, Velio Cioni and Elio Sorci, would chase celebrities on
their Vespas and try to photograph them unawares. Secchiaroli found
that magazine editors, bored with staged portraits, would pay
dearly for what he called surprise pictures of stars, especially if
they were caught in compromising positions.
</P>
<P>
   Secchiaroli was one of the most aggressive. Carol Squiers, the
senior editor of American Photo magazine, said his reputation as an
``assault photographer'' was made on a single night, Aug. 14, 1958,
during the Ferragosto, or Feast of the Assumption, holidays in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Secchiaroli snapped a picture of King Farouk of
Egypt, who had been deposed a few years earlier, sitting in a cafe
with two women, neither of them his wife. The former king tried to
break his camera, and another photographer, Umberto Guidotti,
caught the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Then Secchiaroli took a photograph of Ava Gardner and Tony
Franciosa kissing in the Bricktop Cafe. ``It was a scandal,'' Ms.
Squiers said, ``because Franciosa was still married to Shelley
Winters.''
</P>
<P>
   Secchiaroli took a third picture, of Anita Ekberg and her
husband, Anthony Steel, a British actor, looking inebriated. When
Steel saw the photographer, he lunged at him drunkenly.
</P>
<P>
   Secchiaroli became the model for Paparazzo partly by accident,
Ms. Squiers said. Fellini wanted to make a film about cafe society
and saw some street photographers' pictures; he ended up talking to
Secchiaroli.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of theories about the name Paparazzo. Some
say it is a contraction of the Italian words papagallo (parrot) and
ragazzo (guy). Fellini was quoted as saying he chose it because it
was the name of a childhood friend of his ``who liked to imitate
the buzzing sounds of pesky insects.'' In any case, from that name
an infamous word was born.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie came out, Secchiaroli's reputation soared.
Various filmmakers and stars, including Marcello Mastroianni and
Sophia Loren, used him as their personal photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Marcello Mastroianni wanted to be alone with Catherine
Deneuve, so he called me,'' Secchiaroli told The New York Times
last year. ``I made five or six spreads. In that way the newspapers
had their fill, and no photographer bothered them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the public's perception of paparazzi got worse and
worse, reaching a low last August when Diana, princess of Wales,
and her friend Dodi Fayed died in a car accident while being
pursued by paparazzi. An exhibition of paparazzi photographs at the
Robert Miller Gallery in New York the next month showing the less
sordid side of the profession did not fully clean up their
reputation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Secchiaroli had just finished putting together a collection of
his photographs, to be published by the Italian publishing house
Motta.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include two children, Lucilla and David, and a
grandson. He will be buried Saturday from a church in the
working-class neighborhood in Rome where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Secchiaroli remained unrepentant about his style of
photography. Although he indicated that he thought paparazzi might
sometimes go too far, he suggested that in the case of the princess
of Wales and Fayed, it might have been their fault for fleeing from
the photographers.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude was summed up in an interview last year with The
Glasgow Herald: ``We photographers were all poor starving devils
and they had it all _ money, fame, posh hotels. The doormen and
porters in the grand hotels gave us information tips _ you could
call it the fellowship of the proletariat.''

CHILDREN'S ADVOCATE MAY SETTLE SUIT WITH CITY AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Child-welfare officials and advocates for foster
children announced Thursday that they had begun talks to resolve a
class-action lawsuit that seeks to replace the leadership of New
York City's troubled child-welfare agency with a court-appointed
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just two days before the scheduled trial
date, and both sides agreed to delay the start of the trial by one
week, until Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed by a child-advocacy group in
December 1995, said that the child-welfare system is so ridden with
illegal practices, chronic mismanagement and indifference to
children that it cannot be fixed internally. Lawyers for children
say little has changed at the child-welfare agency during the past
two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   Child-welfare officials have countered that the system has
dramatically improved since the creation of the Administration for
Children's Services in 1996. City officials have often expressed
hope that the lawsuit could be resolved so they could focus more
resources on improving the agency and less on litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, described the talks as ``productive
discussions that may lead to the settlement of this action against
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Robinson Lowry, the executive director of Children's
Rights, the group that filed the lawsuit, said the trial will
proceed if settlement talks fail. But Ms. Lowry, who has filed
several lawsuits against other troubled child-welfare agencies
around the country, said most cases have been resolved before
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry said such settlements usually consist of a court order
stating what the agency is obligated to do and a process for court
enforcement. &QL;

<P>
   Just because August is around the corner and you still haven't
planned your summer vacation, don't despair. The Internet can help
book a quick _ even bargain-priced _ getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com has generated a big buzz since its start-up in
April, when it kicked off a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign, promoting a ``name your own price'' service for buying
discounted plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's online auction, though, is only one of the most
recent additions to the Internet's fare deals. Depending on how
nimble a traveler you are _ and how much inconvenience you can
endure _ various travel opportunities are only a click away. Each
week, the World Wide Web sites of individual airlines post deeply
discounted fares for travel that weekend. Other sites gather and
update information on inexpensive fares from several sources.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Priceline has made a sizable impression in a relatively
short time. Jay Walker, chairman of the company, based in Stamford,
Conn., said it had already sold 40,000 tickets, generating revenues
of more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Priceline has satisfied some customers, its lengthy list
of requirements has frustrated others. And most major domestic
airlines do not participate in the service, as they promote their
own specials online to fill their empty seats; this limits
Priceline's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   To use the service, customers complete a ticket request on its
Web site, saying where and when they want to travel and how much
they are willing to pay. (Travelers without Internet access can bid
by phone.)
</P>
<P>
   If a bid is much lower than published fares, it will be
rejected. To determine a reasonable price, customers should
research the standard range of fares on the route.
</P>
<P>
   Once a bid is submitted, Priceline sorts through the airline
seats at its disposal. It says it can notify customers within an
hour whether a bid for a domestic flight has been accepted or
rejected _ 24 hours for international flights.
</P>
<P>
   In submitting bids, customers also provide their credit-card
information. If a bid is accepted, a ticket is automatically issued
and the credit card is billed; if the bid is rejected, travelers
can submit other bids using different airports or different dates,
but cannot rebid with higher amounts using the same itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   There are other restrictions: Tickets are not refundable or
exchangeable and are not eligible for frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's services are free for travelers using electronic
tickets, which are generally available only on domestic flights; if
travelers require a paper ticket, they pay a $12.50 overnight
delivery fee.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the rules for getting tickets. The flights
themselves may challenge an individual's notion of ease and
comfort. Travelers must be willing to leave any time between 6 a.m.
and 10 p.m. on their selected date if flying domestically, or any
time if flying overseas. Flights may also require a stop or a
connection en route.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially bigger obstacle is that the auction site seems to
have the cooperation of only a few domestic airlines. Eight of the
10 major U.S. airlines _ Alaska, American, Continental, Delta,
Northwest, Southwest, United and US Airways _ say they have chosen
not to work with Priceline. The other two _ America West and Trans
World Airlines _ declined to comment, though industry executives
say they do work with the service.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say you can't get tickets on the major carriers
through Priceline's auctions. As a licensed travel agency, the
company offers discounted seats on major airlines through the
Worldspan computerized reservations system and its inventory;
Priceline also sometimes resells the wholesale seats offered by
consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, though, said that less than 5 percent of the tickets
Priceline sells are through Worldspan or consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to identify which major U.S. carriers worked
with his company, saying only that a total of 15 U.S. and
international carriers are giving Priceline seats to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on inventory can stymie bidders, as Michael Spohn, a
21-year-old student at the University of Missouri, has discovered.
Since late May, Spohn, an intern in the retail advertising
department of The Des Moines Register, has placed bids with
Priceline nine times to fly from Omaha, Neb., or Des Moines, Iowa,
or Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to his hometown, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, he said, he has bid three or four days before he
wanted to travel and set a price $10 to $15 above the lowest
available published advanced-purchase fare; in his research, he
also found that seats were still available on these routes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each bid was rejected. He said he suspects that Priceline
simply had no seats to sell on those routes. ``I don't understand
why they can't do it,'' he said, ``especially if you offer bids
above the airlines' lowest fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Priceline could not offer seats in all markets,
acknowledging that it had ``no lift in small cities that have no
lift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be willing to drive to a bigger city,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   Priceline has its fans, including George Miller, 54, the
artistic director of the Theater Outlet in Allentown, Pa. Several
weeks ago, Miller bought two round-trip tickets, at $550 each, to
fly on Aer Lingus from Newark, N.J., to Dublin, Ireland, for his
honeymoon, which begins Sunday. The lowest published fare offered
by the airline for the same date was $598. Miller said he found
Priceine to be ``very prompt and very courteous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashita Patel, 34, a pharmacist from Edison, N.J., is also happy:
Earlier this month, she bought four round-trip tickets, at $300
each, for her family to fly on United from Newark to London for a
September wedding. United's lowest published fare on that route for
that time was $788. (Prices do not include tax.) She said she was
``shocked that they could do it so fast. It only took 2 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites also offer deeply discounted tickets; in some
cases, they can arrange for cheap hotel rooms and car rentals, too.
</P>
<P>
   Most major U.S. airlines offer special weekly Internet fares,
usually for travel that weekend; prices are much lower than their
cheapest advance-purchase fares. The drawback, of course, is that
destinations are limited: You have to go where they want to take
you.
</P>
<P>
   Online travel agencies including Previewtravel.com,
Expedia.msn.com and Travelocity.com have special features that help
track low fares. Preview offers low fares and announcements of
airlines' latest specials. Expedia, owned by Microsoft, and
Travelocity, controlled by AMR, the parent of American Airlines,
send regular e-mail to travelers listing the lowest published fares
on the routes of their choice. Travelocity also posts a list of
each day's lowest fares.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaptickets.com, a consolidator based in Honolulu, sells
published and unpublished discount fares for flights on domestic
and foreign airlines; Michael Hartley, its president, said it
obtains the unpublished discounts from carriers far in advance.
Travelers must provide credit-card information before they can
conduct a fare search; requests result in a choice of 25 fares,
which the customer can accept or decline.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Bestfares.com, based in Dallas, has sections with
general access to rate information and others only for subscribers,
who pay $60 a year to get more detailed travel data and more deals.
</P>
<P>
   A site operated by 1travel.com, a Zionsville, Pa., travel
agency, provides another path to discounts. It publishes all
airlines' weekly Web specials and will send e-mail lists of them,
customized to the traveler's requirements. It also provides data on
deeply discounted international tickets sold by several large
ticket consolidators.

THE SHOOTING SUSPECT: A LONER WITH A DEADLY GRUDGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1993, the Mississippi River surged past its
levees and drowned Valmeyer, Ill., population 900, under 20 feet of
water. One of the people made homeless in the flood was Russell
Eugene Weston Jr., the 41-year-old suspect in Friday's killings in
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The town was lost. For three years, its people lived in an
emergency settlement, packed into trailers. Some of them derisively
called their temporary town Femaville, for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the government service that promised to help
them.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, a blue-eyed, blond-haired man who never settled down,
began drifting away, neighbors in Valmeyer said on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy relocated to Montana,'' said one, Denise Fisher, who
lived about a quarter-mile from where Weston and his parents had
their home. He left town in a 13-year-old Chevrolet pickup,
although he returned from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty was a loner; he didn't have many, if any, friends,''
said a neighbor from Valmeyer, who identified herself as Mrs. Henry
Rahe and said that she attended church with Weston's parents and
that the community was devastated by the shootings at the Capitol
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, months before the government finished building a new
Valmeyer, Weston was questioned by law-enforcement authorities in
Illinois and in Montana, where he owned a small plot of land where
he panned for gold, about having made threatening statements about
government officials, including President Clinton, federal
officials said on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements included a variety of paranoid ramblings about
the power of the government, fantasies about the CIA and an
accusation that federal officials had planted land mines on his
Montana property, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were strong enough to attract the attention of
the Secret Service, they said. Weston was questioned by the Secret
Service in April 1996, they said, and the agency's Presidential
Protective Detail has maintained a file on him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That May, the Secret Service classified him as a probably
harmless but potentially dangerous man, law-enforcement officials
said on Friday night. The Secret Service made that assessment after
reviewing interviews with Weston conducted by local mental-health
authorities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   So Weston was filed away as one among thousands of Americans who
have delusions about the government, its power and its nature, they
said. If he ever showed up in Washington in any way that registered
officially, the Secret Service would take notice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Weston left Valmeyer, heading east and carrying his
father's old .38-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson, government officials said
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he drove to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He parked off to one side, and he came through the Capitol,''
said Rep. Bill Thomas, a California Republican who heads the House
Oversight Committee, which oversees House security and works with
the Capitol Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Weston went around the magnetometer,'' the metal detector,
Thomas said. ``There was an exchange of gunfire'' in which Officer
Jacob Chestnut was fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   He approached ``a door that says, `Private. Do Not Enter,' a
door that goes to the back hallway of Majority Whip Tom DeLay's
office,'' Thomas said. Then he shot Officer John Gibson, also
fatally, and was shot in return, apparently four times. Sen. Bill
Frist of Tennessee, a heart surgeon, massaged his heart and pumped
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Not three hours later, as the sun was setting over the
Mississippi, a police car drove up to the Weston family home in
Valmeyer, near a set of railroad tracks with grain and coal cars
rumbling by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monroe County sheriff was talking with the father on the
front porch to break the news to him,'' Mrs. Fisher said. The
father, Russell Sr., is 66, and looked ``elderly,'' she said. ``He
had his head drooped, and walking toward the police he looked kind
of sad.'' &QL;

   Testifying against Microsoft Corp. can be costly. For Real
Networks Inc., the price seems to have been about $240 million, or
25 percent of its stock-market value, in two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the day before the chairman of Real Networks
appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, shares of the
company closed at $44.25. On Friday, they closed at $33.25, down
about 25 percent in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Glaser, the chairman of Real Networks, based in Seattle,
testified that a new Microsoft program crippled his company's
recent products. Real Networks is a leader in software used for
transmitting audio and video programming over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the Senate hearing on Thursday, Glaser demonstrated how
Microsoft's new multimedia viewing software disabled his company's
technology. By the end of the day, Microsoft declared that the
problem was a bug in Real Networks' software instead of a nefarious
Microsoft ploy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Glaser stood by his testimony and his software
demonstration at the Senate hearing. In a late-afternoon conference
call, he was joined by representatives of two smaller multimedia
companies, Xing and Digital Bitstreaming, who said they had similar
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was sticking to its guns as well. In its camp was a
specialist from PC magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised a broader industry issue,'' Glaser said. ``We've
been out front on this issue, and we've taken some arrows in the
last day or two. But hey, that's life in the big city.'' &QL;

 SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S TIME FOR YOGI TO GET OVER IT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The town of Montclair, N.J., will have its second
Hall of Fame baseball player Sunday when Larry Doby is inducted in
Cooperstown, N.Y. Not coincidentally, his neighbor in Montclair
happens to be on the Veterans Committee that voted him in more than
a half-century after he integrated the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Doby, in fact, ran into Yogi Berra recently and asked him if he
was nervous back in 1972 when Berra made his own induction speech.
Not really, Berra said. It is doubtful Doby will be, either, given
the odds and insensitivity he has stared down for much of his 73
years.
</P>
<P>
   As the folksy master of the faux pas, Berra has himself become a
national symbol of sporting valor for his refusal to step foot in
Yankee Stadium for as long as George Steinbrenner remains the
Yankees' owner. Recently, Sports Illustrated even asked Berra to
pose for a cover story on the most principled people in sports.
Berra, to his credit, said no.
</P>
<P>
   He has never made his personal stand a public crusade, the way
others have for him, usually around Old-Timers' Day, which is at
Yankee Stadium on Saturday. When Steinbrenner fired Berra as
manager after a handful of games in 1985, Berra said that's it, he
was going home to Montclair and wouldn't be back. That is his
choice, which he is certainly entitled to, but the reality is that
he is not hurting Steinbrenner, only depriving nostalgic fans of
the privilege of seeing No. 8 once more inside the grand ball park.
He is unwittingly sending the wrong subliminal message that
Steinbrenner, above all, is the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Berra should get over the firing, and next year walk back into a
stadium that is owned in part by tax-paying Yankee fans, not the
man who holds its sweetheart lease. Go home again. Stand alongside
Joe DiMaggio and Whitey Ford and Willie Randolph and, yes, Jim
Bouton, all of whom were the Yankees, the way Paul O'Neill, Derek
Jeter and David Cone are now.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium was Berra's house long before Steinbrenner knew
his way out of Ohio. Berra should at least once in his remaining
years experience the cheers, the looking up at the owner's box to
let Steinbrenner know that banishing the manager from the dugout
does not chase true greatness from the field.
</P>
<P>
   They are not close friends, but Doby, for one, could tell Berra
about the emotional rewards of holding his ground, of standing
tall. When he was a young boy in Camden, S.C., rich white
northerners would stable their horses there during the winter. Once
or twice a year, they would ride in or out of town, tossing pennies
into the street for poor black children to chase. Doby has said
that while he often watched this procession, he never once moved a
muscle to pick up a coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who meet Doby always detected his dignity and didn't
intrude upon it,'' said Dr. Joseph Thomas Moore, a professor of
history at Montclair State University who was Doby's biographer in
1988. ``From working with Larry, I know this goes back to when he
was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned early not to jump at the bait, and when he joined the
Cleveland Indians in July, 1947, he ignored the foul taunts, just
as Jackie Robinson did in Brooklyn, beginning three months earlier.
Doby played 13 years in the major leagues, won two home-run titles,
was a seven-time All-Star, yet for 50 years, couldn't shake
Robinson's shadow. The racist, ignorant and indifferent never
defeated him, though. Never made him acquiesce, or run.
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, Doby managed briefly, worked for major league
baseball, for the Baseball Assistance Team and with inner city
kids. He campaigned for others, never himself. Whatever came his
way, he was happy for that. If the Hall of Fame ever called, he
would be honored to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was to live in a society where things are not as
easy as they should be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, on Larry Doby Day in Paterson, N.J., where he
went to high school, Mayor Martin Barnes dedicated a ball field in
Doby's honor. Doby took a look at the field's run-down condition,
turned to the grandstanding mayor and said, ``If you don't do
something about the field, take my name off it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is power in his presence, Doby apparently understands. He
goes to Cooperstown knowing that he never sold himself out for
pennies and always waited patiently to make a real score. You can't
change history, can't undo the bad that's already been done, but
there is no significant achievement in just going away.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gained, Yogi, by giving up the time and place that is
rightfully yours.

MAN WITH FAKE DYNAMITE SPREADS PANIC IN NEWARK BEFORE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A man dressed partly in military fatigues carried
what appeared to be seven sticks of dynamite attached to a timer
into a downtown office building Friday morning, causing widespread
panic and confusion. Although the device turned out to be fake, it
was so realistic that it fooled police dogs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people were evacuated from the building at 18
Rector St., which houses several local and federal government
agencies, and from about 15 nearby buildings. There were no
injuries, but traffic in downtown Newark was tangled for several
hours as tense bomb squad technicians used a water cannon to break
the device apart and defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the seven red tubes marked ``dynamite'' turned out
to be filled with some other substance, possibly clay, Newark's
police director, Joseph Santiago, said. The man who carried it,
identified by the police as Gregory James, 43, of Irvington, N.J.,
was arrested and charged with possessing an explosive device,
making terroristic threats and other related crimes, Santiago said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's events began to unfold shortly before 11 a.m. when
James rode into downtown Newark on a public bus. He wore camouflage
pants and a matching cap, and carried two black shoulder bags,
witnesses told the police. He got off the bus at Market and Broad
Streets, Newark's busiest intersection, witnesses and the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A man who had been riding on the bus with James and who, the
police said, might have known him learned of the bomb and,
believing it to be real, began to follow James, signaling for help
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, as James walked toward 18 Rector St., a police bomb
truck drove by. The man following James hailed the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a one-in-a-million chance,'' said Detective
William Tartis, a bomb squad expert who was in the truck. Moments
later, Tartis and other officers arrested James in the lobby of 18
Rector St.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After James was detained, the police evacuated the building,
diverted traffic and brought in police dogs. After sniffing the
device that James had been carrying, both dogs signaled to
investigators that they had detected explosives. The bomb squad
then used a water cannon to break the device apart.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago and other investigators said tests were being conducted
to determine the contents of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they knew little about James other than that he had
served in the U. S.Marines and had been discharged in the 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You could still hear the groans and wails through
the eucalyptus and sycamores of Riviera Country Club during
Friday's second round of the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't because of wind whipping through the historic Pacific
Palisades course, but the result of another day of players trying
to cope with how the U.S. Golf Association set up this week's age
50-over national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Long rough, no-roll fairways, and hard, quickening greens
combined to produce a second straight day of dreadful scoring, with
just seven of 155 players shooting as low as par.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan, a winner of two senior majors this year, called it a
``goofy'' setup that left players ``between a rock and a hard
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't land the ball short of the green and let it run up
because the fairways are so soft,'' Morgan said. ``And if you carry
it on to the green, the ball runs clear to the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibby Gilbert declared the setup ``unfair,'' saying he had never
seen rough so difficult and expressing surprise it hadn't resulted
in a run of injuries from trying to hit out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played 16 L.A. Opens at Riviera and one PGA
Championship,'' Gilbert said, ``but I've (begin ital)never(end
ital) played this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that prevailing attitude, midway leader Raymond Floyd
stood firm and in the distinct minority _ not just because he was
the only player under par, but because he (begin ital)approved(end
ital) of the difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if you put it in perspective, more golf tournaments
should have a little more of that philosophy,'' Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to this game than standing there and drilling a
driver and hitting the next shot and making a putt and going to the
next hole. There is a whole lot more to this game than that. I
think that has been lost through the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd especially likes that major tournaments demand the best of
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to separate those that are better,'' he said.
``It's not just the physical part of the game _ there is a lot of
the mental part that plays. And the U.S. Open tests that side to
the max.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd also likes the fact that he's in the lead on a tough
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tremendous edge for me,'' he said. ``If I can keep
playing solidly and keep the ball in the fairway and on the green,
I know nobody's going to go out there and light it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said he has thrived at Riviera because, in addition to
hitting good shots, he has played patiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't hit good shots, I don't care what kind of a game
plan you have, you can't play to it. But fortunately I've played
pretty close to my game plan, and that's why I've had success
through two rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, he said, shooting par equals success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must remember that par is a fantastic score on each and
every hole in a U.S. Open. If you leave with a par you've done
well. You might be a little discouraged that you didn't make a
birdie, but par is a good score.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a stonemason chipping away on a block of granite, Floyd
found results starting to show near the end of his work both days.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied three of the last four holes Thursday, then two of
the last three Friday _ always with the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just patience and hitting a good shot and finally
making a putt somewhere,'' he said. ``I don't see that I played
those holes any differently... I could have made a lot of birdies
today that I didn't, but I didn't give in _ I just kept trying and
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently loving the conditions every step of the way.!end! &QL;

UNCOVERED SHORT POSITIONS ARE 3.7 PERCENT HIGHER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq market
rose 3.7 percent in the most recent month, the National Association
of Securities Dealers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the month ended July 15, uncovered short positions totaled
2.17 billion shares, compared with 2.09 billion in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage
firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and
make a profit. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces
a loss. Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are
those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered
by repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   For the third month, Worldcom had the largest short position on
the Nasdaq and the largest increase in short positions. Short
positions in Worldcom totaled 137.2 million shares, up 20.2 million
shares. Worldcom is awaiting final government approval to acquire
MCI Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In acquisitions in which the buyer will exchange its stock for
the shares of the seller, as in the Worldcom-MCI deal, speculators
often buy shares in the target and sell short the stock of the
buyer. This guarantees them a profit if the deal is completed but
subjects them to a possible loss if it is not. &QL;

GUNMAN TERRORIZES CAPITOL, KILLS 2 OFFICERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lone gunman with a history of threats against the
government stormed the Capitol on Friday in a hail of gunfire that
killed two police officers and came to a bloody end inside the
offices of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Texas lawmaker escaped unharmed after herding his
staff into his office and bolting an oak door against the fiery
onslaught that shattered a routine afternoon at the nation's
capital and sent hundreds of tourists fleeing the building.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's bodyguard, John Gibson, who rushed to stop the gunman as
he burst into the Sugar Land Republican's suite, was killed. Police
Officer Jacob Chestnut, who first attempted to stop the assailant
when he bypassed metal detectors at an east-side door of the
Capitol, also was slain.
</P>
<P>
   A woman tourist, Angela Dickerson, 24, was shot before police
critically wounded the gunman. He was identified as Russell E.
Weston, 41, a Montana resident known to the Secret Service for
making threats against President Clinton and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, indeed, a sad day for the United States Capitol
Police, the United States Congress and the nation as a whole,''
said a somber Sgt. Dan Nichols, the Capitol Police spokesman who
announced the officers' deaths to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol flags were placed at half-staff and parts of the
building will be closed Saturday while police investigate.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who was hustled out of the Capitol and onto an airplane
bound for Houston, said in a statement, ``I cannot express the
depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   A teary-eyed DeLay, on arriving in Houston, expressed affection
for Gibson and called him a ``macho man'' and a Boston native ``who
talked funny.'' DeLay said he hoped the Boston Red Sox would win
the World Series for Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, No. 3 in the Republican leadership, did not appear to be
a target of the assault, but the suite of first-floor offices he
occupies are closest to the entryway where the shootout began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he (Weston) chose a route that he thought was open
to him because other routes were closed,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., chairman of the House committee that oversees the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Gibson and Chestnut were the first in the Capitol
building, which has been a terrorist target in the past but remains
an open symbol of the nation's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed, and those who apprehended the
gunman, are true heroes of democracy, and every American owes them
a deep debt of gratitude. They gave their lives to protect the
lives of hundreds of tourists, staff and members of Congress,''
said House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, taking a brief respite at Camp David, called Gingrich
to offer assistance. The president received briefings throughout
the afternoon. Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said there had
been a slight upgrade in security around the White House after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I were deeply disturbed to hear of the shootings
this afternoon at the United States Capitol,'' Clinton said in a
statement. ``The Capitol is the people's house, a place where
visitors and workers should not have to fear violence.'' Clinton
will make another statement on the shootings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's motive remained unclear but the shootout was being
investigated by Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported that Weston's father said in an
interview that his son believed the government had planted
landmines on his Montana property.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives had just completed its work for the
day, passing a Republican version of a bill to give patients more
rights in managed health care operations. Most members were heading
home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of members, including Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas,
remained on the floor to participate in special orders, the time of
day in which any member can speak for one hour on any subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols reported that at 3:40 p.m. a lone gunman entered the
Document Door, the first floor public entrance in the middle of the
Capitol on the east side that faces the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported hearing a series of sharp reports as Weston
forced his way past metal detectors and opened fire on guards who
attempted to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists caught in the gunbattle fled for safety and fell atop
children to protect them. The woman tourist was shot in the
shoulder and face. Chestnut, an 18-year veteran and father of two
children, was the first officer to be shot, suffering wounds to the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, also wounded, stumbled into a hallway 10 feet away and
opened a private door, an unmarked side entrance to the dozen or so
tiny offices that comprise DeLay's Whip operation, according to
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, an eight-year veteran and the father of three, usually
sat at a desk just inside the door. Gibson and Weston engaged in a
furious gunbattle as they stood less than 10 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gibson and Weston fell wounded in the hallway inside
DeLay's offices. Gibson died after a lifeflight-helicopter ride to
the hospital. Weston underwent four hours of surgery and was
expected to recover, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and a heart surgeon,
rushed from his office to the shooting scene where he administered
aid and helped with resuscitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist Linda Addotta was seated on a bench just inside the
Capitol with her youngest son, Jacob, leaning against her napping.
Her husband and two other children were standing nearby when the
gunfire started. She threw Jacob under a table and lay atop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look up. You could hear the guns going off. It was
like a nightmare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy just running, just shooting at anybody he
could hit,'' said Justin Brown, an employee in a Capitol gift shop.
``The first thing I thought was, `Duck!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists fled down the massive steps that adorn the west and
east front as word of the shooting spread. Police huddled tourists
into hallways and offices in an attempt to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Officers locked all the doors leading into the House floor and
the House gallery, with members and tourists trapped inside, for
more than an hour after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a fault of security. It was an individual who was
determined to blast his way into the Capitol,'' Thomas said.

SWEEP FOR METS COMES AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the first game, a 32-year-old right-hander who had
not pitched in the major leagues in over a year tossed eight
shutout innings. In the second one, the Mets rallied for seven runs
in the final four innings to erase a pair of one-run deficits.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the Mets had swept a doubleheader from the Chicago
Cubs at Wrigley Field, 5-0 and 7-3. And they had done so behind
Armando Reynoso's pitching and Brian McRae's hitting in the opener
and with an entire team effort in the second game, all of which
pulled the Mets to within one and one-half games of the Cubs in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It far exceeded anything I could have possibly dreamed of,''
Bob Apodaca, the pitching coach, said after Reynoso's first-game
performance helped halt a five-game Chicago winning streak. ``Eight
shutout innings? Five hits? I couldn't fathom anything like that
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not long ago the same could have been said of the chances
that the Mets would be back in the thick of a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, is the best day of the season for the Mets
(54-46), who have won six games in a row, including two
doubleheader sweeps on the road in the last three days. Two weeks
ago, the Mets seemed in danger of falling out of the postseason
chase. But after winning eight of their last 10 games, four of them
by shutout, the Mets are not only very much alive, they have a
chance to return to New York ahead in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are two more months to go. And no, this was not 1969,
when the Mets overtook the Cubs in September on their way to their
first playoff appearance. But Friday afternoon had all the feel _
and emotion _ of a pennant race, something many of the Mets players
later said they felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to that point,'' said Dennis Cook, who won a
World Series ring with the Florida Marlins last fall and who Friday
convinced Manager Bobby Valentine that he could pitch in both
games, before picking up the Game 2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Before 40,684 fans, the biggest crowd of the season at Wrigley,
there was Reynoso, in his first major-league start in 373 days,
nearly pitching a complete-game shutout in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   That the stakes were higher than usual was evident in the
reactions of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley, who narrowly missed three homers on the day,
kicking the dirt after just missing first-game home run. Brian
McRae, who had four hits in all, running full-speed toward the ivy
in left center field to make a sensational catch against his old
team. Carlos Baerga clapping his hands and pumping his fist in the
second game after driving in two key runs apiece with two
right-handed swings. Chicago's Glenallen Hill styling and posturing
after hitting a game-tying homer onto Waveland Avenue in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Lenny Harris pumping his fist up the first-base
line after giving the Mets the lead for good with his run-scoring
single in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   If anything demonstrated the difference between going good and
going bad, it was Hundley losing a ball in left in the first game
and then dropping one in left in the second _ and neither mistake
hurting the Mets. Even Mel Rojas, who had been buried in the
bullpen for nearly a month, contributed a scoreless eighth inning
in the second game with the Mets clinging to a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard it from me before,'' Valentine said. ``The worst
is yet to come. Tomorrow's our biggest game. However, this is a
very tough stretch. And I'm very, very proud that everyone came to
the ballpark ready to play. We played well. The guys played like it
was a big game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starting first and foremost with Reynoso. The Mets were hoping
for 100 pitches from their first-game starter. He gave them 108 _
and so much more.
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone have possibly expected such a performance from
someone whose last major-league start was last July 16? Reynoso had
been 6-1 with a 2.80 earned run average over his first 13 starts
with the Mets a year ago. But his arm troubles began when he took
the mound after a rain delay here on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso eventually underwent arthroscopic procedures on both his
elbow and shoulder. And then he came up with tightness in the elbow
in a spring training start in March.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Mets took their time easing Reynoso back to the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a long time,'' Reynoso said with a little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's rested,'' Valentine had joked before Friday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   And how. The Mets now have six viable candidates for five
starting slots. Afterward, Reynoso credited his breaking ball for
keeping the Cubs off balance. His biggest test came in the third,
when Sammy Sosa came to the plate with the bases loaded and two men
out. Sosa, who has 37 homers this season, has never hit a grand
slam. And after Reynoso retired him on a fielder's choice grounder
to short, the Mets' 4-0 lead was still intact.
</P>
<P>
   From there on, no Chicago runner made it past first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better than that,'' Valentine said. ``He
made sure he was right before he came back. And he was definitely
right. He made adjustments, changed speeds. He as everything and
more that we could have hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Bobby Jones picked up right where Reynoso
left off. But after Lance Johnson singled home Kevin Orie off Cook
with two out in the seventh, four batters after Hill's game-tying
home run, the Mets were down 3-2 one inning after they had rallied
for a 2-1 lead on Baerga's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied right back in the top of the eighth on a
one-out double by Butch Huskey and Mike Piazza's game-tying single.
Three batters later, Harris drove Piazza home with what proved to
be the winning run. And then Baerga capped a three-run ninth with a
two-run single for his third and fourth runs batted in of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially on the road, when you get a lead and then give it
right back up, it's a tough thing to strike up the band again,''
Valentine said. ``But they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets are right back in the race.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips phoned John Franco's agent, Dan
Horwits, earlier this week, and the two are thought to have
discussed for the first time the parameters of a contract extension
for Franco, who is in the final season of a two-year deal that will
pay him a base salary of $2.6 million this year. Franco, 37, has 20
saves in 23 opportunities this season.

JUREVICIUS IS A NO-SHOW AND FASSEL IS TROUBLED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Acquiring a tall, physical wide receiver to boost
an anemic offense was a priority of the Giants during the off
season. It is the reason they used their second-round draft pick to
take 6-foot-5-inch, 230-pound Joe Jurevicius, a wide receiver from
Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Now they just need to get Jurevicius to come to practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants open training camp Saturday on the campus of the
State University of New York at Albany, but Jurevicius, who has not
agreed to a contract with the Giants, is not expected to work out
with the team. On Friday afternoon, Jurevicius failed to report for
the first meeting of players.
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius' absence irritated Giants Coach Jim Fassel, who did
not have a contract holdout during his first camp as head coach
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed based on the circumstances,'' Fassel
said. ``We have put a proposal on the table and we have called his
agent and we've gotten no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurevicius needs to be here. He has a lot of things to learn.
He has good football instincts but he made mistakes in our
minicamps, too. This is the time when we can work on that and
incorporate him into our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius' agent, Neil Cornrich, said that he would not address
any of the issues of his client's contract, including whether he
has returned the Giants' calls or whether he plans to talk to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe would like to be in camp,'' Cornrich said. ``We'll wait
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have offered Jurevicius a four-year contract valued
at about $1.98 million. Tight end Rod Rutledge, drafted by the New
England Patriots just before Jurevicius, signed a four-year deal
worth $1.996 million. Jets defensive end Dorian Boose, taken right
after Jurevicius, received a four-year, $1.928 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Teams generally use the contract values of players selected
around a draft pick to slot their contract offers. Occasionally, as
in Jurevicius' case, players and agents resist such slotting.
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius may not be the only player missing Saturday. Tackle
Toby Myles, the team's fifth-round pick, also has yet to come to
contract terms. That deal is reportedly close to being made final,
although Myles did not attend the players meeting Friday. There
were no other no-shows.
</P>
<P>
   Jurevicius' unresolved contract status _ and Fassel's annoyance
with it _ was the lone moment of acrimony during a day when
Albany-area officials gave the Giants a lavish welcome. This is the
third season the team has brought its training camp practices to
Albany and the first year of a new agreement that will have the
team training here until the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who arrived in Albany last year a virtual unknown,
seemed to particularly enjoy returning to camp as the 1997 coach of
the year and as the coach of the defending National Football
Conference East champions. At the team's reception luncheon, he was
surrounded by well-wishers, autograph-seekers and the local news
media.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Fassel said the theme of his first speech to the team
would be about putting last season in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is over and nobody is picking us to repeat as
champions,'' he said. ``We have to prove ourselves to people all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel added that he expected an improvement on last season's
10-5-1 record, despite a more difficult schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule is a great challenge,'' he said. ``But I won't be
satisfied if we don't have a better record.'' &QL;

IRWIN SIZZLES ON, OFF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A nine-stroke turnaround vaulted Hale Irwin from
oblivion to contention in the U.S. Senior Open on Friday. But even
though his performance placed Irwin's familiar name back on the
leaderboard, it did little to improve his demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   After refusing to speak to anyone following his unexpected 77 on
Thursday at Riviera Country Club, Irwin was only slightly more
talkative Friday and tried to restrict the topics he would address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to talk about today, not tomorrow or yesterday,''
Irwin said after shooting a 68 in the second round, the best
18-hole score posted during the Senior Open's first two days.
</P>
<P>
   Several questions later, Irwin was eventually asked about why he
disappeared so quietly after his opening-round 77 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I say? I didn't want to talk about... yesterday,''
Irwin said sternfully. ``The reason being that it is a round I am
trying to forget. And I am going to speak to this only one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin then proceeded to break his rule by referring to
``yesterday'' nine different times while answering ensuing
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin moved into a tie for fifth place, about the position he
was expected to occupy as one of the pre-tournament favorites along
with Gil Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to pay attention to that,'' Irwin said. ``If we, the
players, get hung up in all the hype, then you might start
believing your clippings.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was U.S. Senior Open defending champion Graham
Marsh who labeled Irwin and Morgan as the pre-tournament favorites,
but who's keeping track?
</P>
<P>
   This is about as surly as it gets on the player-friendly seniors
tour. Irwin's cranky behavior made no difference on the course,
however, and that's where he has been looking like a genius lately.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has been the hottest player on the senior tour, winning
four tournaments and finishing no worse than fifth in any of the 13
events he has participated in this year.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated exactly why he was considered a pre-tournament
favorite during Friday's round, when he recorded three birdies and,
more impressively, avoided a single bogey. His 68 left him
three-over par through 36 holes, just five shots behind leader
Raymond Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great round and I needed it badly,'' Irwin said. ``I
didn't do anything last night. I left here and tried to forget
about my problems. Yesterday was just a bad day. My irons were not
real crisp and my putting was atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really just a fairly solid round (Friday). And it was
not mistake-free. I did have some errors out there that fortunately
I was able to salvage the pars.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

BUCK MICKEL, 72, EXECUTIVE WHO AIDED EXPANSION OF FLUOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Ga., N.C.)   (bl)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buck Mickel, who helped bring about the corporate marriage that
created the modern Fluor Corp. in 1977, died on July 23 at his home
in Greenville, S.C. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   A Fluor spokesman said that Mickel, who had seemed in good
health, had apparently died in his sleep. No cause of death has
been determined, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mickel was chairman of Daniel International Corp., a large
construction company based in Greenville, when Fluor became
interested in the company in 1977. At the time, Fluor was
principally a maker of industrial equipment for the petroleum
industry.
</P>
<P>
   When Fluor sought to acquire Daniel, Mickel held out through
polite negotiations until Fluor increased the price it was willing
to pay. He neither urged nor discouraged the deal, telling
reporters that shareholders should decide on their own but that a
majority of the Daniel board had decided to accept Fluor's offer.
</P>
<P>
   From that deal grew Fluor Daniel, the principal subsidiary of
today's Fluor Corp., an international engineering, construction and
diversified services company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mickel was appointed chairman of Fluor's engineering and
construction group in 1982 and was named vice chairman and
president of the parent company in 1984. He retired from his
executive positions in March 1987 but remained a director of the
company until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Elberton, Ga., Mickel graduated from the Georgia
Institute of Technology in 1947 after serving in the military
during World War II. He also served for three years during the
Korean War as a first lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   He began his professional career in 1948 at Daniel Construction
Co., advancing through several management positions. In 1965, he
was named president of the company after the death of its founder,
Charles E. Daniel. He was elected chairman of the board in 1974,
just three years before the Fluor deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Mickel was chairman and chief
executive of RSI Corp., a small company he operated from offices in
Greenville, and was a director of several corporations, including
Duke Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   He was a life trustee of Clemson University and Converse College
and chairman of the Daniel/Mickel Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mickel is survived by his wife of 52 years, Minor Herndon
Mickel; two sons, Buck Alston Mickel and Charles Clark Mickel, and
a daughter, Minor Mickel Shaw, all of Greenville; and six
grandchildren.

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 26, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-MURDER-REVIEW _ There are sharp regional differences in
homicide, with the South having by far the highest murder rate,
almost double that of the Northeast, a divergence that has
persisted for as long as records have been kept, starting in the
19th century. By Fox Butterfield. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISTS-REVIEW _ Businesses, feeling the pressure of
stepped-up financial reporting over the last decade, are becoming
bolder about attacking journalists, both publicly and with
lawsuits. And reporters and editors, thrust into the spotlight, are
forced to articulate ethical distinctions that may not be easy to
defend. By Felicity Barringer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-COUPS-REVIEW _ In the 12 months since the Thai baht fell
against the United States dollar and touched off currency
devaluations and a slump in every major East Asian country, at
least one of the region's stubborn old ghosts has been exorcised.
There have been no military coups. By Joseph Kahn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM-REVIEW _ A quarter-century of shrinking market share and
periodic financial crises at GM have fed a popular image of the
auto maker as being a shadow of its former self. Yet GM remains the
world's largest company in sales and share of global economic
output, and is immense by any standard. By Keith Bradsher. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-CULTURE-REVIEW _ More and more these days, there is
talk about the cultural chasm between the military and the rest of
society, what most people consider the ``real world.'' Some people
want to narrow that divide, as though it is something new, and bad.
By David Stout. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ADVOCACY-GROUPS-REVIEW _ From both the left and right of the
political spectrum come dark assessments and dire warnings from
advocacy groups about the current racial, moral, financial or
social climate even as the country enjoys peace and prosperity and
is arguably less sexist, less racist, less dangerous, less polluted
and less regulated by government than it has been in decades _ and
perhaps, ever. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SECURITY-REVIEW _ For many years, Social Security cards
carried an admonition that they were to be used ``for Social
Security and tax purposes _ not for identification.'' That
assurance rings hollow today. Congress has authorized so many uses
of the nine-digit number, and Americans use it for so many
unauthorized purposes, that it has become the closest thing to a
national identifier. By Robert Pear. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-PRIVACY-REVIEW _ The Clinton administration, following a
1996 congressional mandate, is considering assigning every American
a health-care identification number that could be used to create a
giant electronic data base capable of tracking everyone's medical
records from cradle to grave. Suddenly, the public is up in arms
about medical privacy. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-DRUGS-TREATMENT-REVIEW _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
pronouncement last week that New York City should abolish methadone
treatment for heroin addicts by the year 2000 drew fire from many
drug abuse experts. They insisted that methadone is the best tool
they have to help addicts reduce heroin use, stay out of jail and
get back to work. By Denise Grady. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARTS-ENDOW-REVIEW _ For an agency that spends less than .01
percent of the federal budget, the National Endowment for the Arts
gets a lot of attention from Congress, particularly negative
attacks from conservatives. But last week the House of
Representatives overwhelmingly approved the agency's money for next
year. By Irvin Molotsky. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;

   EDITORS: Following is a list of stories related to the shooting
in the Capitol Building that are planned tonight for the New York
Times News Service report. Stories will move in ``w'' news file.
For more information, please call (212) 556-1927.

<P>
   CAPITOL-SHOOTING-RDP (Washington) _ A gunman who had been
investigated by the Secret Service burst into the Capitol on Friday
afternoon and killed two police officers in a corridor shootout
that left a tourist and the gunman lying wounded as terrified
bystanders darted for cover. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   (PHOTO AND GRAPHIC ADVISOR: a map and a diagram of the shooting
scene are being sent to NYT graphics clients. In addition, we call
your attention to a New York Times photo of a wounded victim
minutes after the shooting at the Capitol on Friday. Paul Hosfros
of the New York Times staff was the first photographer on the scene
and his image of the bleeding tourist, Angela Dickerson, will
appear on the front page of Saturday's New York Times. The photo is
available to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-GUNMAN (Washington) _ A profile of Russell Eugene
Weston, the man who went on a shooting spree at the Capitol
Building. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SCENE (Washington) _ He wore khaki pants and a green
fedora with a feather, witnesses said Friday, as any tourist might.
But he was armed with a six-shot Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver, and
almost as soon as he traded the July heat for the cool of the
Capitol, the authorities said, he opened fire. Witnesses and the
authorities described a sudden and shocking burst of shots after
Officer Jacob Chestnut asked Russell Eugene Weston Jr. to pass
through a metal detector, like every other visitor. By James
Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-OFFICERS (Washington) _ After 18 years in the Capitol
Police force, Jacob Chestnut was looking forward to his retirement.
But the 58-year-old officer remained so ebullient and outgoing with
tourists that one senator said he seemed like the Capitol's
official greeter. John Gibson, an eight-year veteran of the force,
worked in the plainclothes division, assigned to guard Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, the third-ranking member of the House Republican
leadership. Friday, both men gave their lives to stop a gunman. By
Alison Mitchell. (Replaces CAPITOL-VICTIMS slug.)
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-SECURITY (Washington) _ History of the security measures
and violence at the Capitol building, with perhaps the most
notorious being the incident involving Puerto Rican nationals.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITOL-VIOLENCE-CHRONO _ A chronology of violence in the
Capitol and security measures taken in the aftermath.

CASPER, RICHIE RICH AIM FOR VIDEO HITS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Harvey Entertainment Co., best known as home to
Casper the Friendly Ghost, has announced aggressive expansion plans
into the direct-to-video market.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey unveiled plans Friday to release a dozen live-action
titles starting next year through 2001 based on its characters such
as Casper, Richie Rich, Baby Huey, Wendy, Little Audrey and Hot
Stuff. It also plans to develop one new television show per year.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the projects, it plans to seek funds through
distribution deals, banks and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement underscores the growing appeal of producing
direct-to-video versions of easy-to-recognize properties for
families, a trend spurred by Walt Disney Co.'s successful sequels
to ``Aladdin'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.'' Direct-to-video
production and promotion costs usually don't top $15 million, while
the average movie's tab went past $75 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's first direct-to-video title, ``Casper, A Spirited
Beginning,'' sold more than 5 million copies through 20th Century
Fox. Two more Harvey titles will hit shelves this fall with Warner
handling ``Richie Rich's Christmas Wish'' and Fox distributing
``Casper Meets Wendy.''

SENTIMENT PLAYS THROUGH AT RIVIERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In your ultimate sports fantasy, you're standing
in the outfield bleachers at Yankee Stadium bellowing, ``Hey, Babe,
you're the best!'' and Babe Ruth is acknowledging your adoration by
tipping his cap. Then, after boldly pointing a finger in your
direction, he airmails a home-run ball to you.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, any way you dream it, you'd risk never waking up to be
able to insert yourself, Forrest Gump-like, into the grainy footage
that defines the Classic Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   So where were you Friday, when a transcendent interactive sports
experience was yours for the price of admission to the U.S. Senior
Open at Riviera Country Club?
</P>
<P>
   The too few many who converged on the course early enough to
beat the sunshine saw one of this century's most unforgettable
sports figures pull a few more highlight-reel shots out of his golf
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Just as many as he needed to survive the 36-hole cut, mind you,
which is why lagging may be fine for long putts, but it's risky
when tracking legends. Lucky for L.A. there are two more days to
get out and inspire and be inspired by Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The morning sky grew misty just watching Palmer try to pull off
another one of his patented charges. Palmer, 68, charmed five
birdies out of Riviera. Yet the course continued to stubbornly
rebuff his affections, slapping him with double-bogey sixes on Nos.
9 and 18 that turned a majestic round into a middling 5-over-par
76.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Palmer's wooing of the one Grand Dame that has given
him plenty of second looks over the years but never that first
sweet victory will continue through the weekend. He made his
seventh consecutive U.S. Senior Open cut with no strokes to spare
at 12-over par.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that gave Palmer's week new life began when he
drained birdie putts of 12 and 14 feet on the fifth and seventh
holes, respectively. He triple-pumped his fist after the putt at
No.7 and the crowd following him crackled with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes you back a little bit,'' Palmer later would say of
such precious moments. ``It gives you a chance to re-live a little
of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing adrenaline/nostalgia rush, he short-circuited,
blocking his drive on the par-4 ninth into the rough, inches from
the lip of a fairway bunker. Palmer's stance was so awkward, he
nearly lost his balance while trying to address the ball for his
second shot. He required a chip and two putts after that to get out
of the fine mess he had made.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's putter was one of three he auditioned for the role of
savior on the practice green 10 minutes before his round. You
probably won't see it again this weekend after Palmer two-putted
from two feet on the ninth green and three-putted from 18 feet on
No.18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't putt as well as I'd have liked to,'' Palmer said,
``which tells me that wasn't the putter for me.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Mr. Flatstick, Palmer's fairway woods and irons
also ganged up on him. More than his 30 putts Friday, the stat that
told the story was this: Palmer has hit only 13 of 36 greens in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He has produced too many shots like his second one at the first
hole where he topped the ball out of short rough and into the
ridiculously thick grass nestled between the cart path and the
green. That took par completely out of the picture. Indeed, Palmer
was lucky to escape with a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday, Palmer won fans over with his graciousness but
also with his guts. He attempted shots of derring-do on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-foot birdie putt on No.17 gave Palmer some breathing room
on the 18th tee. A few quick calculations suggested a par would
enable him to survive and advance.
</P>
<P>
   A safe and easy drive was the prudent play, but that's not
Palmer's style.
</P>
<P>
   He swung from his shoes and the ball screamed into a tree to the
right of the fairway and settled into a patch of rough stuff. A few
of the fans who gathered around the ball begged the USGA rules
official standing nearby to give Palmer a free drop _ ``C'mon,''
one said, ``it's Arnie'' _ but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who never has asked for any favors, hitched up his
trousers, hit the ball onto the fairway, chipped onto the green
and, well, you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably remember that hole,'' Palmer said dryly, ``but
it may be over a martini.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the olive, Palmer probably chewed on the fact he
didn't bother to ask where he stood in terms of the cut until after
he reached the green on 18, thereby creating a needlessly anxious
afternoon for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have asked earlier,'' Palmer said. ``If I had, I
probably would have been a little more cautious with the tee
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no. Palmer didn't win 60 PGA events and the
admiration of millions by playing it safe. Why change now? He is
loved the world over just the way he is.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Four days is a long time to close down the heart of New York
City. Since a high-rise construction accident Tuesday morning at
the Conde Nast building, Manhattan has been rerouted around its
center.
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers merely suffered a loss of time, the irritations
of jammed traffic or clogged crosswalks. For those under the site,
however, the deprivations are more tangible. Steve Chang, for
example, made the fateful choice two weeks ago of opening a new
restaurant in the shadow of the Conde Nast tower. Another victim,
who left his apartment for a jog Tuesday morning, has spent the
rest of the week borrowing clothes, money and living space.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the pets, left behind in the sealed buildings and
surely suffering the limits of survival time without food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long since lost the sense of adventure about this
construction Godzilla, but New Yorkers _ not a patient lot anyway _
need to be patient in this case. The dangers from unstable
scaffolding will remain until containment netting is fully
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, despite a few unfortunate comments about
how some people are enjoying the new midtown mall, has done well so
far in insuring the safety of the area. He has also prodded the
construction companies involved to pay more than the measly $50,000
they first offered for emergency assistance to the area. His staff
wisely consulted experts without financial interest in the building
to figure out how to work as safely and quickly as possible to
restore the area.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing was the gentle treatment needed for those
ousted from the Woodstock Hotel across the street, where one
resident was killed by the falling debris. In the confusion after
the accident and because of a slow response by both the Red Cross
and the construction companies building the tower, elderly and
mentally ill residents were left for 12 or more hours without
medicine and late into the night without housing.
</P>
<P>
   The city, the insurers for the construction companies and
various city charities have opened offices to help those affected
by the accident. Veterinary teams are standing by to take care of
pets once buildings are deemed safe enough for humans.
</P>
<P>
   The event that city Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva has
called, perhaps somewhat hyperbolically, ``the most serious and
dramatic construction failure of this decade'' is settling into
city lore. By Monday, if all goes well, most areas in Times Square
will return to the glitter and noise that pass there for normal.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Here is a proposition. Departing White House press secretaries
get praised according to how well they organized reporters' travel
needs rather than how well they served the information needs of the
people who paid their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, who is resigning in a leisurely way, kept the
White House press corps happy. He protected President Clinton's
political interests. He has managed the not-inconsiderable trick of
leaving this White House without having been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   But as a public-information officer paid by the taxpayers, he
did not rate very high. He responded to the investigations of
Clinton by announcing that he would not acquire any knowledge that
might be useful to the public or the press. His advice that Clinton
explain his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to the American
people was ignored. He sometimes dispensed misleading information
about James Riady's payments to the Clinton campaign and other
matters under investigation. Other White House handlers used him as
a blunt instrument to attack the valuable independent-counsel
process.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, McCurry he evaded inquiries about whether Clinton
had been subpoenaed by saying the president's lawyers were keeping
him in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters have made fawning remarks about McCurry's tenure.
We say that a man who defined his job as ``telling the truth
slowly'' and helped maintain a stone wall against legitimate
questions is not a model for other government employees.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 25:
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City,
N.J., stands a handsome three-story home owned by a widow named
Vera Coking. She wants to keep it, rather than have it torn down to
provide a parking lot for limousines.
</P>
<P>
   This week she won her case, as a judge in New Jersey blocked a
state authority's effort to condemn the property and turn it over
to the Trump organization. The judge noted that the casino would be
under no obligation to use the land for trees and parking, as
promised, but could use it to expand the casino. An appeal is
possible, but for now, Mrs. Coking has prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Donald Trump tell it, his effort to take over the
property is pure civic duty: ``Everybody coming into Atlantic City
sees that property and it's not fair to Atlantic City and the
people,'' he told an ABC interviewer. ``They're staring at this
terrible house instead of staring at beautiful fountains and
beautiful other things that would be good.'' Such as, we presume,
parked limos.

WELLS REPELS ROOKIE'S BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Dean Wells remembers Draft Day '98 with the
emotion most people reserve for birthdays and anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   April 18 was the day the Seahawks used their first-round draft
choice to select middle linebacker Anthony Simmons, a player who is
supposed to take the position Wells has worked so hard to earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously when you're the starting middle linebacker and your
team uses the 15th pick overall to draft a middle linebacker,
you're kind of like, `Wow,' '' Wells said Friday. ``It makes you
realize the NFL is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells vs. Simmons was supposed to be the hottest battle of what
has been a very hot training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has displayed the talents that first attracted the
Seahawks _ startling speed; an explosive burst; a knack for making
plays all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, it is Wells who has been taking care of business
during the team's first week at Eastern Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, to be very honest, Dean Wells is having an
excellent camp,'' said Jim Johnson, the Seahawks' new linebackers
coach and a 12-year NFL assistant whose last stint was as defensive
coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the way Dean is playing and, right now, he's
still the No. 1 guy,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has been the starter since 1995. He led the club in
tackles with 107 the following season and finished third with 92
last year despite the fact that Wells is replaced by an extra
cornerback in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Simmons was a challenge, and the coaches were
eager to see how Wells would react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean Wells has gotten a lot better, a lot better,'' coach
Dennis Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Johnson what he likes best about Wells and the answer is
immediate: ``He's a smart linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart enough to realize why Simmons was the team's top draft
pick and outside linebacker DeShone Myles was added in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the last year of my contract. We need depth at
linebacker. We need guys who can run and play on special teams,''
Wells said. ``So while you might be a little ticked off about it at
first, you realize it's probably a smart decision on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Simmons doesn't say a lot. He is the epitome of
that old Chuck Knox platitude: Your actions speak so loud, there's
no need to hear what you say.
</P>
<P>
   A bit undersized for a middle linebacker at 6-foot-1, 230
pounds, Simmons has grown weary of questions about whether outside
linebacker might be his natural position.
</P>
<P>
   ``My natural position is just on the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no pressure on Simmons to be something he's not ready
to be. He can make an immediate impact on special teams, help out
in the nickel defense and be spotted in the new three-man line that
Johnson brought with him from Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a plus for me because I can take my time, relax
and just learn the system,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, will change. Simmons was expected to become the
starter since the day the Seahawks drafted him, and Wells is
expected to assist by helping Simmons learn how to play the
position at this level and also by playing the position until the
rookie is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Lay this scenario in front of Wells and he laughs before
offering, ``Sure, whenever Anthony has a question I'm going to do
whatever I can to help him out. My primary goal is, I want to go to
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells laughs again before adding, ``I want to be the starter on
that team, but the bottom line is, I really want to go to the
playoffs.''

BYRD PAYS A VISIT TO CHINESE GYMNAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Dennis Byrd, walking with a slight limp _ the
result of his near-tragic spinal-cord injury almost six years ago _
visited his old Jets team on Friday. And then he went over to the
nearby Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow and spent an
hour and a half talking to the paralyzed Chinese gymnast, Sang Lan.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered her injury Tuesday night while warming up for her
specialty, the vault, in the Goodwill Games. Byrd spoke to her at
bedside through an interpreter. Her condition remains ``critical,
but stable,'' according to a hospital spokeswoman, and she will
undergo extensive vertebrae surgery on Saturday, hours before her
parents are scheduled to arrive from China.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an uncommon moment for Byrd, whose ability to walk
again after being completely paralyzed from a hit in a game has
attracted the attention of many people similarly injured. He said
he writes hundreds of letters a year to those who have neck and
spinal-cord injuries. But he asked the Jets to arrange a personal
visit with Sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves Beanie Babies,'' Byrd said after seeing the
17-year-old. ``When you go to visit her, she's a doll and she'll
break your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In a late-season game against the Chiefs in 1992, Byrd, the
club's best pass rusher, was trying to get to the quarterback. With
his head down, he inadvertently dug his helmet into the chest of a
teammate, Scott Mersereau. Byrd immediately knew he had been
paralyzed, but the Jets' medical staff quickly began a series of
procedures on the field, including huge doses of steroids to stem
the swelling around the spinal cord. Two and a half months later he
was able to walk into a news conference and talk about the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional time any time you visit people who have
undergone something so traumatic,'' Byrd said about his talk with
Sang.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd had not been around the Jets for more than a year. But he
wanted to visit the team and its coach, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would have done under Parcells, Byrd said: ``I
thought about that quite a bit. I would have loved it. I always
enjoyed playing for someone who is very goal-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd now works with a foundation he created for children with
life-threatening diseases, at P.O. Box 90, Owasso, Okla. 74055.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrath of Parcells  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells jumped on Kyle Brady, the tight end, who dropped
two passes Friday. Earlier this week, Parcells said that Brady was
no longer the automatic incumbent, but in a competition with Fred
Baxter. Brady has maintained that in past years, the quarterbacks
didn't throw to him enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep reading about all your opportunities,'' Parcells
shouted across the field. ``That's two you missed right there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
But How About Interest?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In case you were wondering about that $3.75 million salary
advance that Neil O'Donnell has not returned, be assured the check
is in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what Bill Parcells said Friday. ``We expect to
receive the check by Federal Express on Saturday,'' he said.
Parcells even offered to let O'Donnell's accountant use the Jets'
Federal Express number.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, cut last month, was supposed to return the money.
Overall, he earned more than $60,000 in money-market income since
the first of two advances was made in February. He earned $15,000
alone since the Jets cut him 30 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are getting a bit of that back by fining Marvin Jones
$97 a pound for each day he is overweight. He came in 10 pounds
overweight and lost four before Friday's workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Visit Jets, See the World  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With players running just a few feet behind him, Petty Officer
1st Class Sean Carroll, a Jets fan since he watched Joe Namath,
held up his right hand and re-enlisted in the Navy on the club's
practice field. Wearing his uniform, the 32-year-old was sworn in
by Cmdr. Moira Flanders Wurzel, who said that the Navy tries to
accommodate ``re-up'' requests at unusual sites. Carroll even
brought along his family. Wurzel, who said she has had sailors
re-enlist at the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty, said
this was the first time it has happened on the athletic field.
</P>
<P>
   Double Duty  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While center Kevin Mawae contends he hates to long-snap for the
punters, Bill Parcells may not be so solicitous of his feelings.
``His snapping could save us a roster spot,'' the coach said. Right
now, the Jets use John Hudson exclusively as a snapper.

EDITH APPLETON STANDEN, 93, TAPESTRY EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edith Appleton Standen, one of the world's leading
authorities on tapestries and a longtime curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, died the weekend of July 18-19 at her
home in Manhattan. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Standen's writings, which include an award-winning,
two-volume catalog of the Met's European post-medieval tapestries,
helped broaden the interest in her speciality, which was one she
never set out to have. When the Met's director offered her a
curatorial position in charge of its Textile Study Room in 1949,
she said yes, but added that he should know three things: she
didn't know much about textiles; she cared less than most women
about fashion, and she never used a needle and thread unless she
had to. The subject took: until a month ago, she was at the
Metropolitan every day at 9 a.m., said Thomas Campbell, an
associate curator.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of a British
army officer, and spent her childhood in Ireland and England. She
received an honors degree in English from Somerville College,
Oxford University, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States two
years later. In Boston, she went to work for the Society for the
Preservation of New England Antiquities, founded by William Sumner
Appleton, her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister-in-law, Lisl Standen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Standen also did volunteer work for the photo collection of
Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. She was invited to take the
legendary museum course taught by Paul Sachs, the Fogg's associate
director. In 1929 she was hired by Joseph Widener as secretary to
his art collections. This position lasted until he gave the works
to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. With World War II under
way, Ms. Standen became a U.S. citizen and joined the Women's Army
Corps, ending up in Ohio working for the Air Force. In 1945, she
was sent to Europe as a member of the U.S. military government's
Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, the group that
preserved, restored and returned art plundered during the war to
its rightful owners. In early 1946, she took over management of the
Weisbaden Collecting Point.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Standen, who remained single all her life, worked at the Met
until 1970, organizing exhibitions and writing and lecturing on
textiles and paintings. Besides her 1985 catalog, ``European
Post-Medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art,'' she published more than 50 articles.
</P>
<P>
   After her retirement, she remained a consultant to the Met until
1988. In 1986, she began to compile a biennial newsletter about
tapestries, which she distributed in the academic world. She had
just completed her final article, about Beauvais tapestries, which
Campbell said was to be published posthumously in the Metropolitan
Museum Journal. Her archives and books are expected to be left to
the Metropolitan.

DRUG CZAR CRITICIZES GIULIANI'S METHADONE PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER W. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an exchange of blunt language, the nation's drug policy chief
said Friday that New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's call to end
methadone programs conflicted with the best medical and scientific
knowledge. City Hall then responded by accusing him of waging an
ineffective war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the retired four-star Army general who directs
national drug policy for the Clinton administration, said the
mayor's recent criticism of methadone programs runs counter to a
common belief among researchers and doctors: that methadone is the
most effective treatment for heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office responded to McCaffrey's statement with
contempt. ``Maybe the reason why our nation's war against drugs has
stalled is because our vaunted drug czar favors massive increases
in chemical dependency,'' Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said on Monday that he wanted to do away with
methadone programs in the city within four years and make heroin
addicts embrace the ``moral'' alternative of abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, experts say, the mayor can do little about the
city's methadone programs because they are mostly financed with
federal and state dollars. But methadone proponents fear that his
criticism could prejudice people against the medication.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his White House office, McCaffrey did
credit Giuliani with making New York City a safer, cleaner and more
orderly community and with supporting the national strategy to
control illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his recent statements about methadone therapy are at odds
with the conclusions of the nation's scientific and medical
community,'' the general's statement said. ``The problem isn't that
there are too many methadone programs; it is that there are too
few.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 810,000 opiate addicts, McCaffrey
said, but only 115,000 of them are participating in methadone
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, many more persons could be freed from the slavery of
addiction if only this proven effective therapy were more widely
available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota and Giuliani's press secretary, Colleen Roche, said that
Giuliani had gotten his information about methadone from the city's
Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Department of Health and the
heads of various drug treatment programs. But the mayor's office
would not name the people who had briefed Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 recovering addicts in New York State take
methadone, and 34,000 of them live in New York City, said Michael
McAllister, chairman of the New York Committee of Methadone Program
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The city is thought to have 250,000 heroin addicts, some of whom
complain of long waits for treatment slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methadone therapy helps keep over 100,000 addicts off welfare
and on the tax rolls as law-abiding, productive citizens,''
McCaffrey said in his statement. ``Close down methadone programs
and these individuals will be back on the streets, back on drugs,
and back on welfare, at enormous cost to society and to the safety
of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone, a synthetic drug developed as a painkiller in World
War II, was subsequently discovered to block opiate cravings. It
has been used for 34 years to treat heroin addicts, who have a high
relapse rate.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone can also be addictive, but users say it does not make
them feel high. And they say it helps them to resume normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Alan
Leshner, called methadone ``the most effective medication we now
have in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who described methadone therapy as ``a valuable and
proven approach'' to treating heroin addiction, cited a succession
of scientific studies proving its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   In one such study by the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Adam
Yarmolinsky and Dr. Richard Rettig concluded, ``Methadone treatment
helps heroin addicts free themselves from drug dependency, a life
of crime in support of their habit and the risk of adding to the
AIDS population by sharing dirty needles.''

   WASHINGTON _ He wore khaki pants and a green fedora with a
feather, witnesses said, as any tourist might. But he was armed
with a six-shot Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver, and almost as soon as he
traded the July heat for the cool of the Capitol, the authorities
said, he opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and the authorities described a sudden and shocking
burst of shots, after Officer Jacob Chestnut of the Capitol Police
force asked Russell Euguene Weston Jr. to pass through a metal
detector, like every other visitor.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists stampeded, Weston left Chestnut mortally wounded on
the floor, the authorities said. His path into the Capitol blocked
by other officers, they said, Weston turned left toward a door
marked private that opens onto the ``rabbit warren,'' as insiders
call the maze of offices belonging to Representative Tom DeLay of
Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the door, Special Agent John Gibson was shouting at staff
members to hit the floor. Witnesses and the authorities offered
conflicting versions of what came next. What is clear, according to
both, is that Gibson and Weston traded shots that cut each other
down, but not before Weston reached an office in DeLay's extensive
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later some 10 officers surrounded Weston, their guns
trained at his head, said two of DeLay's aides. The office carpet
was soaked in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the echoing marble hallways of the Capitol's first
floor, the visitors' blend of boredom, curiosity and awe had turned
to bedlam as shell casings scattered across the stone floor and
officers shouted to get out, get out. In the fusillade, one
bystander, Angela Dickerson, had been wounded in the face and
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Some people took refuge behind columns; others crouched where
they stood; still others ran through the elegant hallways, scooping
children into their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Beamish, a 69-year-old tourist from England, said that he
bent over a wounded police officer, feeling for a pulse as the
officer muttered words he could not make out.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had had the presence of mind to summon Sen. Bill Frist
of Tennessee off the floor of the Senate. The senator, a heart
surgeon, checked the pulse of one of the wounded, then helped
resuscitate Weston and rode with him to the hospital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a lazy July afternoon, and Capitol Hill, like the rest of
Washington, was easing into the weekend. The last vote had been
taken in the House chamber. Although Congress was still in session,
with some members addressing cameras in the emptying galleries,
many representatives had already streamed down the broad, steep
steps into the sunshine and their waiting cars.
</P>
<P>
   In DeLay's office, some 50 members had gathered to celebrate the
passage of health care legislation with champagne brought by Rep.
Mark Foley of Florida. Across the hallway, Rep. John Boehner,
another member of the House leadership, was in his hideaway office
with about eight staff members performing a ritual that marks the
approaching weekend in official Washington the way margaritas might
in the rest of the country: They were discussing what was likely to
be debated on the Sunday television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 3:40, the gunfire and the screaming started.
Members of Boehner's staff called the Capitol police immediately
and were told to lock their door and stay put. In DeLay's suite,
some people dived under their desks or ran to the back of their
offices. Staff members gathered with the congressman and said a
prayer. Many of the aides would later credit Gibson with saving
their lives. Tearful congressmen paid the same tribute to both
slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed them multiple times during a day,'' Rep. Bill Thomas
said later, his voice breaking. ``And you exchange _ you know, `How
are you?' You don't expect an answer. And they're there every day.
And no one expects this to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tourists and staff members heard just three or four shots;
others heard 20 reverberating through the halls. Some heard two
bursts of gunfire, others a long shot followed by two bursts.
Officers, their weapons drawn, pushed tourists to the ground to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Brown, who was working in the small gift shop run by the
Capitol Historical Society, said that the first thing he thought to
do was to duck. ``There was a guy running, just shooting at anybody
he could hit,'' Brown said. ``When I looked up, I saw the officer
with a hole in his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Ottotta, a radio technician from Rockford, Ill., was
touring the Capitol with his wife, three sons and mother-in-law
when he heard a sound that he thought was an exhibit crashing to
the floor. He lost track of his family in the chaos, glimpsing one
son as he darted off, leaping down stairs into the crowd. He found
all of them safe later.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Emmerick, of Evergreen, Colo., was already at an exit when
he heard the shots. He looked up to see the crowd racing toward
him. ``They were running toward me, screaming,'' he said. ``Women
and kids. Two adults were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, unaware of the pandemonium, April Adams of Atlanta, was
entering the Capitol for a tour when she looked ahead and saw a
flock of children, age 5 or 6 come flying out the building. The
children were screaming, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judson Threlkeld, with his wife, Rachel, was touring the crypt,
a vaulted space on the first floor beneath the Great Rotunda. Four
years ago, he was at the southwest gate of the White House when he
heard what sounded like fireworks; he learned only later that a man
had opened fire on the building. This time, on hearing a bang, his
wife dropped to the floor, and he lay on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Cleary, the chief legislative aide to Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., was giving a tour of the Capitol to a group of
children. Among them was an 11-year-old girl from Belfast, Northern
Ireland, who was visiting the United States as part of a program to
take Irish children away from violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to isolate her from this kind of thing, not
letting her watch the news,'' Ms. Cleary said, ``and then this
happened.''

DEED CEDING WIDOW'S HOUSE TO SUSPECTS IS FOUND, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Utah, Calif., Fla., Nev.) (jw) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police investigating the disappearance of Irene
Silverman discovered a notarized deed Friday transferring ownership
of Mrs. Silverman's East Side town house for a fraction of its
value to a corporation registered in the names of the prime
suspects in the case, according to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   The deed, police said, was found in a large gym bag belonging to
Sante Kimes and her son, Kenneth. The bag also contained a
.22-caliber handgun, a set of plastic handcuffs and an array of
passports and driver's licenses, as well as other financial
documents, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
findings supported their suspicion that the Kimeses were planning
to defraud Mrs. Silverman of her East 65th Street town house. They
said the papers could help them establish a motive if they decide
to charge them with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators say they have no forensic evidence
linking the Kimeses to Mrs. Silverman's disappearance and have not
found her body, they believe she is dead and have considered the
Kimeses suspects since she was reported missing on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that the two suspects checked the bag
with a bellhop at the Plaza Hotel before their arrest on July 5 on
a warrant relating to a bad check in Utah. The police obtained a
subpoena for the bag after it was picked up at the Plaza by
Lawrence Frost, a private detective working for the Kimeses'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Two law enforcement officials who examined the contents of the
bag, and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it contained a trove
of documents and personal items that could help detectives paint a
more complete portrait of the Kimeses' activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to documents related to the sale of Mrs. Silverman's
home, the bag contained a rental agreement for a storage room in
California, two Florida driver's license in Kenneth Kimes' name,
Sante Kimes' birth certificate and numerous pieces of
identification in several names.
</P>
<P>
   According to three people who reviewed the contents of the bag,
the deed transfers Mrs. Silverman's home to the Trans Atlantic
Corp. for $390,000, less than 10 percent of its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they had found other documents in the last
few weeks indicating that the Kimeses had set up Trans Atlantic and
used it in several financial deals.
</P>
<P>
   But they also said that the bag did not contain any items that
appeared to be evidence of Mrs. Silverman's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to lead them to the body,'' one person familiar
with its contents said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives in New York and California are intrigued, however, by
the .22-caliber handgun and plan to conduct ballistics tests on
whether it was involved in the slaying of David Kazdin, a former
business partner of the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   Kazdin's body was found on March 14 in a garbage bin in Venice,
Calif., with a single .22-caliber gunshot wound in the head. The
Los Angeles police have called the Kimeses suspects in the killing,
saying that they used Kazdin's name and property in Las Vegas to
obtain a fraudulent $280,000 loan.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Muniz, Ms. Kimes' lawyer, said the Kimeses told him they
had stored a bag at the Plaza Hotel and asked him to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz said the private investigator working for him picked up
the bag on Thursday and held it overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz added that the Kimeses had steadfastly said that they knew
nothing about Mrs. Silverman's disappearance, Kazdin's death or the
1996 disappearance of a bank auditor in the Bahamas while he was
reviewing some of their offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also want to question the Kimeses in those other
disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They categorically deny any wrongdoing, and there's nothing in
the bags that will change any of that,'' Muniz said.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sachs, Kenneth Kimes' lawyer, said prosecutors were informed
of the bag's existence early Friday. Sachs said no items were
removed from the bag. Officials at the Manhattan District
Attorney's office said they had no objection to the defense
lawyers' holding the bag overnight.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with prosecutors and State Supreme Court Justice
Herbert Adlerberg, the two lawyers delivered the bag at 7:15 p.m.
Friday to the Manhattan District Attorney's office, where it was
inventoried.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said he expected to challenge the admissibility of some of
the items in court next week.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the bag came as the Manhattan District Attorney's
office called in a dozen witnesses to determine whether they could
identify Kimes and his mother in a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they hoped to charge the Kimeses with a crime
before Aug. 6, when they might otherwise be extradited to Utah to
face possible charges for passing a bad check.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hammer, a real estate agent on the Upper East Side, said
that prosecutors asked him to choose Kenneth Kimes out of a lineup.
Hammer said that Kimes, 23, came into his office in late June and
identified himself as a businessman from West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes told him he was interested in renting a corporate
apartment at 3 E. 65th St., which the real estate agent said is
across the street from Mrs. Silverman's town house.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said his company performed a credit check and discovered
that Kimes was using the name of a West Palm Beach businessman
without the man's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman called up and said, `Hey, my husband's in the
hospital, he's not renting any apartment in New York,' '' Hammer
said. ``We knew it was phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said he correctly picked Kimes out of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   A notary public whom Kimes reportedly asked to notarize
documents regarding the sale of Mrs. Silverman's house was also
seen leaving the District Attorney's office Friday afternoon but
declined to speak with reporters.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 24 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFE1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday passed, 72-28, a measure to require gun
dealers to offer child-proof safety devices to gun purchasers.
Supporters said the amendment was more flexible than a Democratic
proposal that would have required each gun sold to include
child-proof safety devices. Opponents argued that the amendment
lacked substance because it did not include an enforcement
provision. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFE2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday rejected, 61-39, an amendment that would
have required handguns to be sold with child-proof safety devices.
Supporters said the amendment would protect children from handgun
accidents. Opponents said the amendment was an unnecessary federal
regulation and would not accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 69-31, a measure that would
have allowed federal prosecution of gun owners whose weapons were
used by children in a crime if the guns were stored insecurely.
Supporters said the measure would have kept guns out of children's
hands by requiring people to keep their guns out of reach.
Opponents argued that innocent people could have been held
responsible if children found a way to access the guns, even though
they were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GAMBLE1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 82-18, an amendment that would
have exempted Indian tribes from a measure that bans gambling on
the Internet. Supporters said the ban interferes with the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act, which already regulates Indian gambling.
Opponents said there is no way to confine Internet gambling to
Indian reservations. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: GAMBLE2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday passed, 90-10, a measure that would
outlaw gambling on the Internet. The amendment to the
Commerce-State-Justice bill institutes a fine on people who gamble
by telephone or wire to online casinos. Supporters said the ban
prevents children from gaining access to gambling sites while on
the Internet. Opponents said it is already illegal to gamble by
wire and that this bill would only provide exceptions to the
existing law. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 17, the House approved, 230-181, a measure that
would reform public housing laws and increase the income level at
which families are elegible for public housing. Supporters said the
bill would allow more people with different income levels to live
in public housing and would benefit inner-city communities.
Opponents said the bill would eliminate preferential housing for
the very poor and give it to people who are less needy. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: UNIONS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday rejected, 248-150, an amendment that would
have required unions to disclose spending of each activity in which
they are involved, including political activities. Supporters said
that the public has a right to know how much unions spend.
Opponents argued that the amendment unfairly singled out unions,
while protecting corporations. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: NEA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 253-173, an amendment to restore
$98 million in funding to the National Endowment for the Arts.
Supporters said NEA funding benefits state and local programs in
underserved communiites and that last year's reforms addressed many
of the criticisms NEA opponents have voiced in recent years.
Opponents argued that only artists who know how to work the system
get grants and that the arts already receive sufficient funding
from other government sources. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday voted, 264-166, to defeat a measure that
would have revoked China's ``most favored nation'' status, a label
which allows normal trade relations with a country. Supporters
argued that maintaining trade with China was the best way to
influence Chinese domestic policy. Opponents argued that the nation
should hold China accountable for human rights violations by
withholding normal trade status. A ``yes'' vote favors revoking
China's status.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 296-132, an override to
President Clinton's veto of legislation banning certain late-term
abortions. The vote exceeded the two-thirds majority needed to
override a veto. The measure will go before the Senate, where
Republicans have been unable to get the two-thirds support.
Supporters said the procedure is gruesome and should be illegal.
Opponents said the ban criminalizes a medical procedure that is
needed to save women's lives. A ``yes'' vote favors the ban.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: KYOTO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 226-198, a measure that would
protect education programs from a bill that would limit funding for
environmental agencies trying to implement the Kyoto Protocol, an
international environmental agreement. Supporters said educational
programs facilitate an open debate on environmental issues.
Opponents said funding should not be allocated for the Kyoto
Protocol until it has been ratified by the Senate. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

GUNMAN TERRORIZES CAPITOL, KILLS 2 OFFICERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (updates throughout) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lone gunman with a history of threats against the
government stormed into the U.S. Capitol Friday, igniting a gun
battle that killed two police officers and came to a bloody end
inside the offices of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Texas lawmaker escaped unharmed after herding his
staff into his office and bolting an oak door against the fierce
gunfire that shattered a routine afternoon at the nation's capital
and sent hundreds of tourists fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's bodyguard, Capitol police officer John Gibson, who
rushed to stop the gunman as he burst into the Sugar Land
Republican's suite, was killed. Police officer Jacob Chestnut, who
first attempted to stop the assailant when he walked past metal
detectors at an east-side door of the Capitol, also was slain.
</P>
<P>
   A tourist, Angela Dickerson, 24, was shot in the face and
shoulder before the gunman was critically wounded by police.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was identified as Russell E. Weston, 41, a native of
Valmeyer, Ill., living in Montana who was known to the Secret
Service for making threats against the president and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   He had parked his pickup a few blocks from the Capitol and armed
himself with a .38-caliber handgun, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, hit in the stomach and legs, underwent surgery and was
in stable condition late Friday at D.C. General Hospital. Dickerson
was in stable condition at George Washington University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, indeed, a sad day for the United States Capitol
Police, the United States Congress and the nation as a whole,''
said a somber Sgt. Dan Nichols, the Capitol Police spokesman who
announced the officers' deaths to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol flags were placed at half-staff and parts of the
building will be closed Saturday while police investigate.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who was hustled out of the Capitol and onto an airplane
bound for Houston, said in a statement, ``I cannot express the
depth of my sorrow for this loss.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, No. 3 in the Republican leadership, did not appear to be
a target of the assault, but the suite of first-floor offices he
occupies are closest to the entryway where the shootout began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he (Weston) chose a route that he thought was open
to him because other routes were closed,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., chairman of the House committee that oversees the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Gibson and Chestnut were the first in the Capitol
building, which has been a terrorist target in the past but remains
an open symbol of the nation's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers who were killed, and those who apprehended the
gunman, are true heroes of democracy, and every American owes them
a deep debt of gratitude. They gave their lives to protect the
lives of hundreds of tourists, staff and members of Congress,''
said House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, taking a brief respite at Camp David, called Gingrich
to offer assistance. The president received briefings throughout
the afternoon. Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said there had
been a slight upgrade in security around the White House after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I were deeply disturbed to hear of the shootings
this afternoon at the United States Capitol,'' Clinton said in a
statement. ``The Capitol is the people's house, a place where
visitors and workers should not have to fear violence.'' Clinton
will make another statement today.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's motive remained unclear but the shootout was being
investigated by Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, the FBI,
the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Charges against him were pending.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported that Weston's father said in an
interview that his son believed the government had planted
landmines on his Montana property.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives had just completed its work for the
day, passing a Republican version of a bill to give patients more
rights in managed health care operations. Most members were heading
home.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of members, including Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas,
remained on the floor to participate in special orders, the time of
day in which any member can speak on any subject.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols reported that at 3:40 p.m., EDT, a gunman entered the
Document Door, the first floor public entrance in the middle of the
Capitol on the east side that faces the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported hearing a series of sharp reports as Weston
forced his way past metal detectors and opened fire on guards who
attempted to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists caught in the gunbattle fled for safety and fell atop
children to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, an 18-year veteran and father of three children, was
the first officer to be shot, suffering head wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, also wounded, stumbled into a hallway 10 feet away and
opened a private door, an unmarked side entrance to the dozen or so
tiny offices that comprise DeLay's Whip operation, said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, an eight-year veteran and the father of three, usually
sat at a desk just inside the door. Gibson and Weston engaged in a
furious gunbattle less than 10 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gibson and Weston fell wounded in the hallway inside
DeLay's offices. Gibson died after a helicopter ride to the
hospital. Weston underwent four hours of surgery and was expected
to recover, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and a heart surgeon,
rushed from his office to the shooting scene where he helped with
resuscitation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunfight started, tourist Linda Addotta was seated on a
bench just inside the Capitol with her youngest son, Jacob, leaning
against her napping. Her husband and two other children were
standing nearby. She threw Jacob under a table and lay atop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look up. You could hear the guns going off. It was
like a nightmare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy just running, just shooting at anybody he
could hit,'' said Justin Brown, an employee in a Capitol gift shop.
``The first thing I thought was, `Duck!'''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists fled down the massive steps that adorn the west and
east front as word of the shooting spread. Police huddled tourists
into hallways and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Officers locked all the doors leading into the House floor and
the House gallery, with members and tourists trapped inside, for
more than an hour after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a fault of security. It was an individual who was
determined to blast his way into the Capitol,'' Thomas said.

GRUDEN'S FIRST LESSON: IT'S A TEAM GAME 
BY C.W. NEVIUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner had Jon Gruden become head coach of the Raiders than
he laid down the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called us together,'' said offensive lineman Lincoln
Kennedy, ``and he said there was a golf outing _ and it was
mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `How are you going to make golf mandatory?''' Kennedy
said. ``I mean, I had never picked up a golf club in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   No knock on Kennedy, who may be the team's most easy-going and
approachable player, but doesn't that summarize the mind-set of
last year's Raiders perfectly? They couldn't even agree to play a
free round of golf together.
</P>
<P>
   Which was exactly Gruden's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to play together,'' Gruden said this week in Napa
as camp opened. ``That's the most important thing this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruden is working the theme hard. After playing in Kennedy's
foursome and offering up a huge ration of abuse to the big tackle,
he scheduled a second mandatory outing in a sport Kennedy knew he
could do _ bowling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen some of these guys,'' Gruden said. ``They
didn't exactly have bowling shoes to fit all of us. And Lincoln
looked like Twinkletoes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' said Kennedy happily. ``I don't know what I scored,
but I know I doubled his score. I'm not saying I'm ready for the
PBA, but I can play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems there's always a new tone at Raider camp, but you have
to admit that this is one we haven't seen before _ family fun.
Gruden, sometimes with his cap turned backwards, is all over the
field, barking out orders, getting into the drills himself and
working the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, our coaches have been sort of like father
figures,'' Kennedy said. ``He's almost like a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe not an older brother, either. At some point, everyone
wants to do the math. How many players are older than Gruden, who
is 34?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (reserve quarterback) Wade Wilson is (he's 39) because
I remind him of it every night. '' said Gruden, who also is younger
than defensive back Albert Lewis (37). ``People say you look so
young. What do you expect, for my hair to turn gray and fall out?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it has happened, you know, Jon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you'd have to say right now _ although a ball has yet to
be kicked in anger _ that Gruden provides just the dose of
enthusiasm and go-gettum that the Raiders needed. There's lots of
talk about whether the veterans will listen to a young buck like
Gruden, but although he may look like the quarterback of his
fraternity's flag football team, he's already shaking things up.
</P>
<P>
   The move of Lewis from cornerback to free safety, for example,
is overdue. Lewis, who can still pulverize receivers, was willing
to make the switch last year, but he wanted to do it right from the
start of camp, not after the season began. Gruden came in and
announced the change before Lewis officially reported. Is that
early enough for you, Albert?
</P>
<P>
   Gruden also has just the right mix of smarts and sass to deal
not only with the media but with the looming shadow of Al Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I interviewed,'' Gruden said, ``Al Davis told me that if
things get tough, `you can always blame me.' I remembered that
because I take pretty careful notes.''
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure Davis appreciated Gruden's savvy, as well as his
attitude. And, although the feeling is mutual, Gruden isn't just
listening to Davis because he's kissing up to the team owner.
Gruden has bounced around the league, but no one will ever say he
wasn't paying attention at every stop. He's a sponge for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick tells the story of
finding Gruden sitting in the hall outside his line meetings,
taking notes like crazy. Even now, Gruden calls McKittrick ``the
best coach in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruden said he also has observed Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren,
49ers coach George Seifert and Philadelphia's Ray Rhodes, who had
so much faith in the kid that he made him offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The experience with the Eagles was invaluable, but it doesn't
take an offensive guru to figure out that he has much more talent
here. In Philadelphia, for example, Gruden was crafting a passing
game out of Bobby Hoying at quarterback and an aging Irving Fryar
at wide receiver. He must have run his finger down the Raiders'
roster and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pure pocket passer in Jeff George,'' he said. ``We
have blinding speed at the split ends, our tight end is a helluva
talent, and we know what Tim Brown can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of those players were here last year, and the
team was 4-12. By the end, this was a fractured group with everyone
looking out for himself. As cynics said, there is no ``I'' in team,
but there is one in Tim Brown. So what is the difference going to
be?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play in concert with each other,'' Gruden said.
``We might tell someone you are going to have to clear out for Tim
Brown on this play, and you are going to have to bust it because
later it is going to be your play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea in theory, everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business,'' said Kennedy, ``there is no place for
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, it seemed like there was last year _ the Raiders' locker
room.
