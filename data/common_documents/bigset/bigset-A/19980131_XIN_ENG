SEOUL -- South Korea on Friday announced the closure of 10 of
14 ailing merchant banks whose business operations were suspended
after the financial crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the results of a committee's appraisal over the
management of the 10 banks, the South Korean government decided to
revoke the business licenses of the banks because their debts
exceeded their assets, said a spokesman of the Ministry of Finance
and Economy.
</P>
<P>
The 10 banks are Hanwha, Ssangyong, Gyongnam, Coryo, Samsam,
Hangdo, Chungsol, Shinsegae, Shinhan and Kyungil.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq will not use weapons of mass destruction for
the simple reason that it does not possess any of such weapons,
said the Iraqi Culture and Information Minister Hummam
Abdul-Khaliq on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister was responding to remarks made by U.S.
President Bill Clinton that the U.S. will not allow Iraq to use
its weapons of mass destruction, the Iraqi news agency INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We are determined to deny him (Saddam) the
capacity to use weapons of mass destruction again" when meeting
with top U.S. military commanders from around the world gathering
at Fort McNair near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Khaliq said that Iraq did not use those weapons when it was
possessing some, specially the chemical ones, during the
"U.S.-sponsored military aggression on Iraq" in 1991 despite all
the unprecedented means of destruction and killing ferociously
used by the allied forces against the country. (Iraq-US-Response)

TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Friday
named former trade minister Hikaru Matsunaga as finance minister,
top government spokesman Kanezo Muraoka announced.
</P>

of taking bribes from banks.

<P>
Muraoka, chief cabinet secretary, quoted Hashimoto as saying
that he hopes Matsunaga will undertake a drastic reform of the
corruption-tainted finance ministry as he was once a prosecutor.

LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- About 3000 people gathered in
downtown Belfast on Friday to protest against the random killings
in Northern Ireland in the past month which claimed 10 lives.

that ordinary people want an end to the killings," local reports
quoted trade unionist Tom Gillen as speaking to the crowd outside
Belfast City Hall.

NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. tea sales have more than
doubled over the last six years, according to a latest survey of the
New York City-based Tea Council.
</P>
<P>
The tea sales totaled 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, up from
1.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Tea is gaining in popularity for many reasons. One is Americans'
increasing attention to gourment cooking. Another is consumer interest
in the latest thing, especially when it costs less than 5 U.S.
dollars, the council said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the growing interest in tea stems from studies that show
potential health benefits of the beverage and its antioxidants.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Accession Cooperation With Baltic States Gears up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Pre-accession cooperation
between the European Union and the Baltic states is to be geared
up when the new Europe Agreements enter into force on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Hans van den Broek, in charge of external
relations, said Friday: "The European Agreements are one of the
key elements of the pre-accession strategy and will significantly
broaden and deepen the already close cooperation between the
European Union and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
</P>
<P>
The agreements, signed on June 12, 1995, just went through the
ratification procedure and will provide an important institutional
framework to support the process of the Baltic states' integration
into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Europe Agreements will replace the Agreement on Trade,
Commercial and Economic Cooperation between the EC and each one of
the three Baltic republics.
</P>
<P>
The old accord went into force in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
As far as trade is concerned, the new agreements fully
incorporate the EU-Baltic Agreement on Free Trade and
Trade-Related Matters that have been applied since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will start accession talks with Estonia in
May. Other countries chosen for the first wave of EU enlargement
are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU has granted over 516 million ECU to the Baltic states
since 1990, under the EU Phare program of assistance. Estonia has
received EU grants amounting to 136 million ECU in the 1990-1997
period while Latvia and Lithuania got 161.6 million ECU and 219
million ECU respectively.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic states combined to have also received an
additional EU fund of more than 47 million ECU in the 1994-1997
period under the EU program of Phare Baltic Sea Region
Cross-Border Cooperation.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) will construct a collective defense space for member
states, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came following a meeting of the CIS Defense
Ministers Council, in which the defense ministers from CIS member
countries approved a draft plan for military cooperation in the
Commonwealth through the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said forming "a single defense space in the framework
of the Russian-Belarussian Union" will be discussed further.
</P>
<P>
Ties with Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and other CIS
countries "in the military sphere have produced a favorable
impact," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone, Sergeyev said the
mandate for the Russian peacekeepers expires January 31, but its
extension is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that he would visit Georgia at the end of
February.
</P>
<P>
The meeting approved draft 1998 budgets for development of a
joint system for air defense and other joint programs; ministers

<HEADLINE> EU Grants 20 Million ECU for 1998 Twinning Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union announced
on Friday a grant of 10 million ECU for this year's twinning
program that involves more than 4,000 towns and cities in 29
countries.
</P>
<P>
The funding program, started in 1989, handed out 7.5 million
ECU last year to help set up 260 new twinning schemes and to
another 150 twinning schemes still at preparatory stages.
</P>
<P>
Some 86 percent of the allocated money were used on
transnational exchanges between citizens who have been held at the
heart of twinning activities.
</P>
<P>
Such activities included Europe Days, young people's symposia
on environmental issues, discussions on social exclusion,
unemployment, crime prevention and the introduction of the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The twinning program has been expected to play a part in
shaping a shared Europe and deepening understanding between its
citizens. So far an estimated 1.5 million Europeans have taken
part in the exchange activities.
</P>
<P>
Priority is given to twinning program involving more than two
towns and special support will be lent to twinning activities in
regions where twinning is not yet common and to towns on the
periphery of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, is
expected to place more emphasis in 1998 on innovative and themed
activities that can help make Europe more tangible, EU officials
said on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cook: UK Not to Rule out Military Action on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here Friday that Britain would not rule out military
action against Iraq, although it would still want a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the United Nations and Iraq over weapons
inspection continued worsening as American Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright indicated early Friday that she "remained
sceptical that diplomacy will resolve the problem."
</P>
<P>
Giving British support to the American position, Foreign
Secretary Cook said in a statement issued here Friday afternoon
that the international community's options on Iraq were running
out.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Britain's labor government would want "a
diplomatic solution. But the options are narrowing."
</P>
<P>
"We have not ruled out the military option if the Iraqi
dictatorship continues to defy international will," Cook added.
</P>
<P>
Cook is expected to meet with Albright in London on Saturday to
exchange views on the latest development of the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cook made it clear that he was "looking forward to meeting Mrs
Albright here tomorrow. The situation in Iraq is pre-occupying us
both."

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Iraq-UNSCOM Crisis Exaggerated by Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Friday that the so-called crisis between Iraq and
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarmament in
Iraq has been exaggerated by chief arms inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC, Aziz said the UNSCOM work in Iraq
is going on easily and softly, with the round-the-clock system of
monitoring and verification continuing as well.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the Evaluation Committee will hold a meeting on
Sunday with the participation of international experts for the
first time in the UNSCOM history to discuss and evaluate Iraqi
data on warheads and the biological file.
</P>
<P>
He described as "false" the U.S. allegations that Iraq is
concealing quantities of weapons of mass destruction, saying that
those allegations could be checked "neutrally and scientifically."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deputy prime minister maintained that the UNSCOM is
not of international nature any more, rather, it has become an
"Anglo-Saxon" committee controlled by the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Iraq was and would be completely ready to
cooperate with the UNSCOM, the United Nations and the Security
Council. The history and future will prove that Iraq's prohibited
weapons were destroyed a long time ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has nothing to conceal in its presidential sites which
are open before the visitors, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has taken foreign diplomats on a tour of one of President
Saddam Hussein's palaces in a bid to prove that Iraq has nothing
to hide, Iraqi News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the world people are demanding the lifting of the
embargo on Iraq and non-persecution of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The embargo, which barred Iraq from exporting oil,
its economic mainstay, can not be lifted unless the U.N. arms
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of
mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Capital Flows to Emerging Markets Drop Sharply in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The amount of private sector
capital flows to the world's emerging markets fell sharply in 1997
and is forecast to drop further this year due to the Asian
financial crisis, the Financial Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the Washington-based Institute of
International Finance, the newspaper said that private sector
capital flowing to emerging markets totalled 199.6 billion U.S.
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
This was almost a third down from the record 295.2 billion
dollars recorded in 1996 and the lowest figure since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The institute predicted that private sector capital flows this
year will amount to 171.5 billion dollars, a further 15 percent
decline, and the decline could be still sharper if Asian economies
did not stabilize.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the reason for the sharp decline was mainly
because of the performance of the five Asian countries hit hardest
by the recent financial crisis, namely Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the five countries suffered a net capital outflow of
12 billion dollars after an inflow of 93 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the institute said that excluding the five Asian
countries, capital flows to all the other major emerging markets
actually increased last year, rising from 202 billion dollars in
1996 to 212 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government army
Thursday night recaptured Chicuma region on the central coast
which had been occupied by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
UNITA's remaining militiamen attacked and occupied the Chicuma
local government and police headquarters Monday along with the
nearby Ebanga government location, forcing government officials
and local people to flee, the Angola News Agency Friday quoted
local government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan army then joined local police in a counter-attack
and finally defeated the UNITA forces on Thursday and seized back
the government location and police headquarters, said the report.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, peace has been restored in the two regions and
fleeing residents are returning home.
</P>
<P>
Chicuma region had been occupied by the former rebel UNITA
movement for 16 years, during which it served as the logistic
base with a large number of UNITA forces stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka Peace Accord, Chicuma region restored its
local government in August last year, with a UNITA-nominated
candidate being its top leader.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chicuma, Benguela province had been quite
unstable since armed UNITA militiamen were active there.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Committee of Angolan Peace Process expressed worries
over the situation in the region at a meeting on Thursday and
decided to send an investigation team composed of representatives
of the Angolan government, UNITA and the U.N observers to the
area.

OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada raised its
bank rate Friday by a half of a percentage point to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's operating band for the overnight rate was similarly
adjusted to a range of four to five percent.
</P>
<P>
"Downward pressure on the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar
has intensified in recent days, leaving the dollar at levels
inconsistent with the underlying trends of the Canadian economy,"
the central bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to rebalance
monetary conditions and provide support for the Canadian dollar,"
the bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates for
fears that rate hikes would slow down the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The last time the bank raised the trend-setting rate was on
December 12, 1997, also by a half of a percentage point.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Defines Macro-economic Objectives for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
defined its macro-economic objectives for 1998 with an economic
growth rate of 5.5 percent and nine percent inflation rate by the
year end.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1998 budget which is collected at the Ministry of
Finance and approved by the parliament this afternoon, the
Zambian government will achieve an economic growth rate of 5.5
percent on the basis of 3.5 percent last year and reduce
inflation from 18.6 percent in 1997 to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
It will also strengthen its balance of payments and
international reserves position.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will adopt a "prudent" monetary policy stance by
keeping a check on growth in broad money to achieve the defined
one figure inflation rate and stabilise its own currency.
</P>
<P>
The budget stressed that for 1998 "we are pursuing the three
objectives of macro-economic stabilization, growth and
development."
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been trying hard to achieve the first two
objectives but never dares to mention "development" in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
In the Budget for 1998, the government proposed to spend a
total of 1,818.34 billion Kwacha (about 1.36 billion U.S.
Dollars), of which 65 percent represents internally-financed
expenditure and the rest comes from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget also reviewed the 1997 budget performance,
saying there is an expenditure surplus of 64 billion Kwacha
(about 48 million U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Soldier Executed for Murdering Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan government army
soldier, one private Emmanuel Rutayisire, was publicly executed
in northwestern Gisenyi, Rwanda on Thursday in front of over
5,000 people, state-run Radio Rwanda reported, quoting a
statement from the office of Gisenyi Governor.
</P>
<P>
Private Rutayisire was subjected to a firing squad at the
regional soccer stadium after he was convicted of murdering Radio
Rwanda correspondent in Gisenyi, Wilson Ndayambaje, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is said that following a dispute between the radio reporter
and two army soldiers (one of them Rutayisire), Rutayisire shot
the reporter dead. He was then arrested and put on trial.
</P>
<P>
"Killing an innocent person in the war zone is against the
army law and is punishable by death," Colonel Eric Muhire, one of
the Gisenyi commanders, addressed the crowd before the private
was executed.
</P>
<P>
This is the second case of public execution of undisciplined
soldiers who are found guilty of committing murder in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On January 28, 1998, an army sergeant was publicly executed in
the northern town of Ruhengeri after he was found guilty of
murder of a local veterinary surgeon in a bid to steal from him
his motor-bike.
</P>
<P>
Responding to comments that these executions are
extra-judicial, Rwandan army officials said they have been
compelled to take tough measures against such acts to ensure that
discipline prevails in the army.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that all this is extra-judicial," said army
spokesman Major Emmanuel Ndahiro.
</P>
<P>
"But someone, for whatever reasons makes the choice to take
someone's life away in cold blood, this is absolutely
unacceptable," he underscored.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: US Military Action Against Iraq May Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said here Friday that a new U.S. military operation
against Iraq may cause grave outcome in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said in a written statement that "it is not possible to
expect Turkish contribution to a military action Turkey does not
approve of."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. administration seemed determined for a
new military strike against Iraq by accusing the Iraqi government
of creating obstacles to the U.N. arms inspection teams and
continuing production of biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the United States feels uneasy over the
initiatives taken by some permanent members of the Security
Council like Russia and France on this issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the eight-year-old U.N.economic sanctions on
Iraq also caused damages to Turkey, saying "the minimum
estimation of the losses of Turkey due to the Gulf War reached
to 35 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also noted that the Iraqi government
should give up its provocative attitudes and extreme ambition on
armament issue and adopt an attitude which will facilitate coming
of tranquility to the region.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Turkey's Anatolia News Agency from
Nicosia, all the personnel of the British air bases on the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus are on alert due to the crisis
between the United States and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Officer Gets Life Sentence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Rwandan army officer, Major
Sam Bigabiro, has been sentenced to life imprisonment after the
Military High Tribunal found him guilty of murder of 30 civilians
in July 1994 in Runda commune, 12 km southwest of the capital
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Sam Bigabiro was then deputy-commander of the 101 battalion
which was battling soldiers of late President Juvenal Habyarimana
and the Interahamwe militia who were committing genocide.
</P>
<P>
He allegedly ordered the murder of 30 villagers at Gihara
village, prior to any examination whether they represented a
threat or not.
</P>
<P>
During the court's hearings which started on January 9,
Bigabiro had denied all charges that he ordered the execution of
the civilians because he thought they were the "enemy".
</P>
<P>
According to Friday's verdict, Major Bigabiro has been
sentenced to life imprisonment while his escort, one caporal
Denys Gato who carried out the execution orders, has been
sentenced to 45 months in prison.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Records 3.8 pct Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. gross domestic
product growth accelerated in 1997 to 3.8 percent, the fastest
pace in nine years, boosted by a burst of production in the fourth
quarter, the Commerce Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth, the sum of all goods and services
produced within U.S. borders, represents the fastest pace since an
identical rate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The economy concluded 1997 by growing at a brisk 4.3 percent
pace in the October-December quarter, much higher than the 3.6
percent average of private economists' predictions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, inflation was totally under control. A price measure
linked to the GDP rose 2 percent, the smallest increase since
1965. In the final quarter of the year, it increased at a scant
1.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Last year's growth was led by a technology-driven business
investment boom and supported by healthy consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Business investment in equipment from computers to turbines
soared 12.2 percent last year, the largest increase in 13 years,
despite a decline in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending
advanced 3.3 percent, the best in three years. Spending on durable
goods from autos to household appliances jumped 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. exports jumped by 12.5 percent, the biggest gain in
nine years. At the same time, imports climbed 13.9 percent, the
highest growth in 13 years. So, overall, the country's trade
balance was a slight detraction from growth.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction grew 2.8 percent last year while
commercial building increased 3.6 percent. Government spending
inched 1 percent higher, with a drop at the federal level more
than offset by an increase in state and local spending.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Peaceful Solution of Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qin said China called upon parties concerned to exercise
restraints and resolve their differences through dialogue and
other peaceful means, so as to avoid further escalation of the
conflict that may undermine regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China has always stood for the peaceful resolution
of international disputes on the basis of UN Charter and norms
governing international relations. China is against the use or
threat of use of force.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China was of the view that Iraq should implement,
comprehensively and in real earnest, the relevant resolutions
adopted by the Security Council. At the same time, the
legitimate concern of Iraq over its sovereignty, dignity and
security should be duly respected. And efforts by Iraq to
implement relevant UN resolutions should also be evaluated in an
objective and fair manner.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China believed that an early completion of the
destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and the
relevant inspection work, together with the settlement of issues
left over by the Gulf War at an early date, conform to the
fundamental interests of both Iraq and other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) which is in
charge of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction should always work
under its guidance. It was an obligation for the UNSCOM to try its
best to complete the mandate entrusted by the Security Council
and timely report to the Council, he said, adding that to make any
public comments on information that has not been first briefed to
the Council was inappropriate.

ATHENS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament President

accession regarding human rights, respect democratic principles

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's major banks raised
Friday their prime lending rates to 6.50 percent from 6.00
percent, effective Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Bank of Canada hiked its bank rate
Friday by a half of a percentage point to five percent to shore up
the sagging Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and
National Bank of Canada all raised their prime lending rates,
which the banks give to their best customers.
</P>
<P>
In currency markets Friday, the central bank's rate hike helped
push the Canadian dollar higher. It was trading at 68.59 cents US
in morning trading, up more than 30 basis points.
</P>
<P>
"Downward pressure on the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar
has intensified in recent days, leaving the dollar at levels
inconsistent with the underlying trends of the Canadian economy,"
the central bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This adjustment in the Bank Rate is designed to rebalance
monetary conditions and provide support for the Canadian dollar,"
the bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been reluctant to raise interest rates
for fears that rate hikes would slow down the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But the continuing free fall of the currency in recent days has
convinced the bank that measures must be taken to shore up the the
loonie.
</P>
<P>
The last time the bank raised the trend-setting rate was on
December 12, also by a half of a percentage point.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gulf States Decide to Wait for Recovery of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Refraining from supporting
calls for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Gulf states have decided to wait
for the recovery of oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts here said the Gulf countries hoped that some
factors that caused oil price collapse, including Iraq's return to
the markets and Asia's economic turmoil, may ease.
</P>
<P>
The two, coupled with OPEC's December decision to raise its oil
output ceiling and a mild winter in northern hemisphere, had sent
oil prices from 1997's average 19.4 U.S. dollars a barrel to
below 15 dollars a barrel last week, the lowest level in a
45-month period.
</P>
<P>
If the downturn continues in the next few months, it will make
real troubles for the Gulf states that have based their 1998's
budgets on the level of 16-17 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
However, Gulf countries have showed an unexpected silence
toward the down trend although their oil economies face an
unpleasant prospect.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, Gulf oil exporters just helplessly
spent their time on watching the trading screen instead of seeking
an emergency OPEC meeting to reverse the decision of increasing
the oil output ceiling, which had triggered the price crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and one of the
major OPEC members, has dashed hopes for such a meeting by
claiming that "it was not the time (for the meeting)."
</P>
<P>
So far, Gulf states' only action against the price slump was to
call on all OPEC members to comply with their newly-awarded output
quotas to prevent a further oversupply from hitting the
already-jittery markets.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts said the Gulf states have been staking the possible
improvement of oil prices on the escalation of a dispute between
Iraq and the U.S. on arms inspections, and the ease of Asia's
financial crisis which has greatly slackened the region's oil
demand.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.S. have been at daggers drawn after Baghdad
barred the U.N. inspectors in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction from entering the so-called "sensitive
sites" on ground of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices have gained legs up to more than 16 dollars a
barrel in recent days due to growing concern that Washington might
be preparing to take military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was buyers' fears of disruptions to Iraqi oil exports due to
the possible U.S. strike at Iraq that made the Gulf states believe
prices would continue to firm up, according to the oil experts.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said the Gulf states are waiting for the ease of
the currency crisis in Asia in the hope that the region's demand
would increase.
</P>
<P>
Asia's demand for oil has been downgraded by 340,000 barrels
per day in the past months due to the devaluation of some
countries' currencies.
</P>
<P>
The region accounts for a quarter of the world's oil
demand. Over the past five years, Asia has contributed nearly 50
percent of global growth in crude demand.

<P>
ABU DHABI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is to make a tour to the Gulf region amid
growing concern that Washington might be preparing to take
military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini News Agency monitored here said Friday that
Albright will pay a visit to Bahrain on Monday and then go to
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit is to seek ways of boosting bilateral ties,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But informed sources here said the U.S. official's tour is most
likely to focus on drumming up Gulf states' support for U.S.
possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been barring the U.N. inspectors in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction from entering the
"sensitive positions" on ground of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the move, the U.S. and Britain are preparing for a
major air strike at Iraq's suspected sites of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no international support for Washington and
London. many countries, especially Arab states, have called for a
diplomatic settlement to the dispute instead of a military
action.

CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia reaffirmed Friday its
opposition to any new military action against Iraq, while
reiterating the necessity of Iraq's commitment to the U.N.
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian position on the Iraqi-U.N. dispute was stated in an
urgent message sent Friday by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis C Becomes Major Worldwide Health Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Hepatitis C is now being
recognized as a major public health problem worldwide, an American
expert said today in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
In most developed countries, 1e to 2 percent of the population
is infected with the virus, wrote Dr Adrian Di Bisceglie of Saint
Louis University School of Medicine, in Missouri, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Infection rates are higher in some parts of eastern Europe and
in Africa, and "Egypt seems to have one of the highest prevalence
rates of all, approaching 15 percent of the general population."
he said.
</P>
<P>
Liver disease caused by hepatitis C is now the major reason for
liver transplantation in adults in most countries.
</P>
<P>
In the United States alone, hepatitis C now causes 8,000 to
10,000 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, deaths are expected to more than triple over the
next two decades, eventually becoming responsible for greater
mortality than AIDS." he added.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis C is predominantly a blood borne disease. Eighty-five
percent of people infected with the virus in most cases will
develop a chronic hepatitis and of these as many as 20 percent
eventually develop cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced
symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were
treated for six months.
</P>
<P>
In some cases the virus disappears from the blood and the
inflammation of the liver is reduced.
</P>
<P>
Some studies also indicate that longer therapy lasting a year
to 18 months may achieve a sustained response in as many as 30
percent of treated patients.

<HEADLINE> Acting Director of U.S. Census Bureau Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The head of the U.S. Census
Bureau's Atlanta office was named acting director of the agency on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
James F. Holmes will run the agency until a permanent director
is chosen, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said.
</P>
<P>
Holmes succeeds Martha Farnsworth Riche, who resigned after a
long battle with Congress over methods for conducting the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
The national head count of the United States is scheduled for
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Congress and the administration have been battling over whether
to use a system called statistical sampling, estimating the number
and characteristics of people who cannot be counted directly.
</P>
<P>
Experts say sampling will improve the accuracy of the count --
the 1990 census was off by 4 million, the bureau estimates. But
Republicans fear that the method will inflate the count in
normally Democratic urban areas, hurting them when it comes time
to redistrict seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Holmes is a graduate of Albany State College in Georgia and has
served in a number of posts at the agency, including regional
director in Philadelphia and Atlanta and assistant regional
director in Los Angeles and Kansas City, Missouri.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Lessons Should be Learned from Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Lessons can be
learned from Asia's financial distress on national and
international levels, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn, and we are learning important lessons from
this recent experience, regarding transparency and regulatory
systems," the U.N. chief told the press in the Davos Congress
Center during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
On the international efforts to alleviate the crisis, Annan
said he discussed possible ways to resolve the problem with
representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank on Saturday in a panel session.
</P>
<P>
One of the steps being considered is to strengthen the
international system and identify what the system can and should
do, and what governments should do at the national level, Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that when you run into this sort of economic distress,
actions need to be taken by everyone. The government concerned has
to take steps to ensure that stability and confidence can be
restored and bring investors back," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF has to work with governments to ensure that one
achieves that objective," Annan noted. The IMF can come up with a
good plan, but it has to work closely with governments, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Prefers New Ties With ACP Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
willing to reduce its economic aid to the African, Caribbean and
Pacific countries (ACP) and reinforce the political dimension of
the EU-ACP ties, the journal European Report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC), the executive body of the
15-nation union, has adopted a mandate proposal for the
re-negotiation of the EU-ACP 1975 Lome Convention that expires on
February 29, 2000, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The re-negotiation is scheduled for September this year.
</P>
<P>
If the EU Council of Ministers follows the proposal, the EU-ACP
convention will be replaced in 2005 by a more modern agreement
governing EU-ACP trade and aid relations.
</P>
<P>
The proposed guidelines call for maximizing the potential in
each of the 71 ACP countries, developing local markets and
promoting regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The EU hopes its new and innovative approach will encourage
more sustainable growth and greater independence for ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
EU experts however are concerned that the ACP countries will
not be able to adapt to global market conditions by the year
2005. Non-governmental organizations have already warned of the
dangers of a reciprocal free trade for fragile developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
Some feel the ACP countries need at least 10 years more for
trade reform before switching to any reciprocal free trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EC must seek a solution to the dispute on
bilateral trade preferences established in the Lome Convention,
but opposed by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention currently has a waiver for trade
preferences from WTO free trade rules until February 2000.
</P>
<P>
Michel Rocard, chairman of the European Parliament's committee
on development and cooperation, has suggested that it might be
appropriate to either reach agreement within the WTO on a longer
transition period, or for the EU to establish trade arrangements
with the ACP countries that are compatible with WTO rules.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Ukrainian Presidents Issue Joint Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Ukrainian presidents
issued a joint statement Saturday expressing satisfaction with the
positive changes in bilateral relations, but concern over the
settlement of some pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
The statement came following a informal summit between the two
presidents.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma as saying that many
positive changes have taken place in Russian-Ukrainian
relations since their previous meeting in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The presidents concluded in the statement that
"Russian-Ukrainian cooperation has embarked on a new level in many
spheres. The attitude regarding bilateral relations has improved
radically and mutual understanding has been strengthened."
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two leaders stressed economic relations
between the two countries. They confirmed their intention to sign
a program for economic cooperation through the year 2007, which is
expected to be signed during Kuchma's official visit to Russia at
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also considered a project to create a European
version of the An-70 transportation plane and praised joint
action by Russian and Ukrainian experts at talks with
representatives of other European countries.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, they agreed that it was unjustifiable to
delay the settlement of a number of important bilateral issues,
including the delimitation of the Ukrainian-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should also increase cooperation in the
defense industry and coordinate their approach to the world arms
market, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of European security, both presidents agreed that
further development of Russian-Ukrainian relations would be an
important contribution to security on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma arrived in Moscow on Friday. It was the second informal
summit between the two presidents. The first was held on November
16-17 last year outside Moscow.

<P>
AMDO, TIBET, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite what they thought
was imminent death, the family of Tibetan herdsman Azha has
managed to survive severe blizzards which have hit the Tibet
Autonomous Region since last September.
</P>
<P>
"The government has saved our lives by providing food,
clothing, bedding and fuel," said Azha as he sipped hot buttered
tea while sitting beside a warm stove in his family's tent.
</P>
<P>
Abnormally heavy blizzards which have hit northern areas of
Tibet over the past four months have created life-threatening
situations for local herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Sheep and cattle dung, which Tibetans use as fuel, have been as
precious as gold in the snow-covered grasslands where many people
have been forced to burn old shoes, clothing and furniture simply
to keep reasonably warm.
</P>
<P>
Numerous head of sheep and cattle have died and others are on
the brink of starvation.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight families in Amdo County were forced to burn the
dwellings and starving animals devoured tents providing shelter
for 73 families.
</P>
<P>
The county government has dispatched trucks to transfer more
than 60,000 head of domestic animals to open grazing areas.
</P>
<P>
Cattle and sheep are the most precious possession of local
residents, and the government will do everything possible to
reduce losses in disaster-stricken areas, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
Assistance from units of the People's Liberation Army has
enabled numerous herdsmen to relocate and enjoy warm meals and
see smoke rising from their tents .
</P>
<P>
Cering Como moved into her tent about a month ago. "The
soldiers found me stranded in the snow. I was extremely cold and
hungry," said Como as she joyously pointed to her new clothing.
</P>
<P>
"Government assistance will certainly enable us to overcome the
effects of the disaster," said Como.

family rejected the request. As a result, an armed clash broke out
and two soldiers and five members of the family were killed.
</P>
<P>
Another soldier and member of the Durak family were also
wounded in the incident, according to the news agency.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said Saturday that he had urged U.S. President Bill
Clinton not to launch any fresh attack on Iraq in order to
maintain peace in the Gulf and resolve the issue of U.N. weapons
inspection peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the United Front's election rally in Calcutta,
Gujral said no country would tolerate a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
"I wrote to the U.S. president Friday as also five heads of
State including the U.K., France and China that any further attack
on Iraq will create instability in the region where 2 to 2.5
million Indians reside," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is reportedly preparing for another attack on
Iraq for its uncooperative attitude toward a U.N. weapons
inspection team there. Yet some U.N. Security Council members
including Russia, China, and France are against such attack.

<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Spanish Basque separatist group ETA assassinated
Thursday night another municipal deputy of the ruling People's
Party, Alberto Jimenez, as well as his wife Asuncion Garcia, the
fourth such assassination since July 1997. This time ETA attacked
in Seville, a town outside the Basque area and in the heart of
Andalusia, in an operation described by Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar as "total defiance of the society."
</P>
<P>
-- The enlargement of the European Union (EU) to central and
eastern European countries is causing concern among the 15 EU
members over an influx of criminal gangs and illegal immigrants,
as the 10 European countries which are candidates for EU
membership are not capable of efficiently fighting organized
crimes and illegal immigration, said interior ministers and
ministers of justice of the EU countries at a meeting in
Birmingham, Britain, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After three months of moderate drop, the number of the
unemployed in France registered in December an unprecedented
fall. The Ministry of Employment attributed the improvement of
employment in France to an overall bettering of economic situation
in the country. The unemployment rate in France now stood at 12.2
percent by the end of December, against 12.4 percent at the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
-- The Gaullist movement of Rally for the Republic is holding a
national congress Saturday and Sunday under the presidency of
Philippe Seguin. It will ratify a new political project and new
statutes and choose another denomination for the Gaullist
movement.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Nuclear Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not use nuclear
missiles to retaliate Iraq if it launches a missile attack
against Israel in the event of a U.S. military strike on Iraq,
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted him as saying in Tel Aviv Saturday that the
foreign news reports were "nonsense" that Israel will respond an
Iraq attack with missile attacks, including using nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
"Such news reports were totally nonsense," he said, adding
that "I do not know who was the source."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the such news reports were published by
the London Times Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said the Israeli military has not made any decision
in this regard, including formulating a plan for retaliation
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Israel has full confidence with the United States, which will
properly handle its confrontation with Iraq and solve the Iraqi
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli people to remain calm concerning the
U.S.-Iraqi confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The government will inform the public how to do if necessary,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has discussed the Iraq crisis during the
last few days and mainly focused on its potential effect on Israel
in the event of U.S. military strike on Iraq, but no specific
plans concerning defense or retaliation were announced.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
arrive here Saturday evening to discuss the Iraq crisis with
Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also travel on to Ramallah in the West Bank
Sunday for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on this
issue.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Offer Mutual Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Lozham, a herdsman in Bangai
Township, Angdo County, China's Tibet Autonomous Region, has
provided shelter for 15 people from two families during the
ongoing heavy snow disaster which has severed local supply lines
for food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 periods of heavy snow which have hit Nagqu since last
September have dumped 40 cm. of snow on many villages and as much
as 80 cm. in mountainous areas. The heavy accumulations of snow
have virtually severed links to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Herdsmen living in affected areas have survived the disaster,
despite numerous problems resulting from shortages of grain,
clothing, fuel and fodder. Nonetheless, people throughout the
region have joined in a massive mutual assistance effort.
</P>
<P>
The No.3 Village in Cuoma Township, Angdo County, have opened
their grazing lands to livestock from other villages, and people in
Nase Township have provided other areas with 1,190 kg of grain,
1,554 bags of Yak dung for fuel and 4,280 head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Septuagenarian Cering Yuzhen from Cuoma Township, Angdo County,
has assisted her neighbors during the Lunar New Year
Festival. "We're members of a mutual assistance group and it's my
responsibility to take good care of elderly woman," said Gaisang
Wangdui, a neighbor of Yuzhen.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 mutual assistance groups have been established in
Angdo County. People in the area are sharing collective supplies
of fuel, grain and grazing land. Over 3,000 snow victims have
spontaneously joined mutual assistance groups and have launched
active production and disaster relief campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The central government has responded by sending large amounts
of financial and material assistance to affected areas. The
regional government has provided relief funds totalling 27.25
million yuan, as well as 350 tons of food and 500 tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
Command centers have been established in all the devastated
areas in order to ensure the smooth distribution of relief
supplies and funds to victims.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Sent Festival Greetings Via E-mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Guangzhou, one
of China's largest metropolitan areas, are using E-mail to send
Spring Festival greetings to relatives and friends around the
world in seconds.
</P>
<P>
When compared to traditional New Year's cards, E-mail is a less
costly means of conveyance and ensures that messages arrive almost
immediately. E-mail has gained great popularity with Guangzhou
residents who, proportionally speaking, have more overseas
relatives than their counterparts in other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of E-mail also centers on its graphic
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first two days of the Spring Festival, which
began on January 28, show that over 20,000 people in Guangzhou
sent festival greetings via E-mail, a system which is rapidly
replacing telephones and pagers as the most popular form of
communications.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 Guangzhou families own computers and some 100,000
people living in the Pearl River Delta, one of the most developed
areas in China, subscribe to the Internet. The latter figure
accounts for some 25 percent of the total number of Internet
subscribers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
So-called "Internet coffee houses" provide Guangzhou citizens
without computers the opportunity to use E-mail.
</P>
<P>
"Business has been brisk in recent day as people visit to
transmit New Year's greetings via E-mail," according to Wu
Shuqing, manager of the Feidi Coffee House.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Dissatisfied With Dalai Lama (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the democratic reforms of 1959, the Dalai Lama was one
of the largest serf-owners in Tibet, with 27 manors, 30 pastures,
and 6,000 serfs.
</P>
<P>
His family got 16,500 kg of grain, 12,500 kg of butter, 30,000
cattle and sheep, and many products from serfs each year.
</P>
<P>
"However, we ordinary Tibetans refuse to reverse the history
and live as serfs as our ancestors did," one old man said.
</P>
<P>
Social development and the use of science and technology have
brought remarkable changes in Tibetans views of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan peasants used to reject the use of pesticides on the
grounds that they kill living creatures, but, they began to use
both pesticides and fertilizers when they found that both are so
effective in improving yields.
</P>
<P>
More Tibetans now believe in what they see instead of what the
Dalai Lama says and regard his depiction of "Tibetans living in
hell" as total nonsense.

<HEADLINE> Tarim River Regulations to Help Protect Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Tarim River, the longest inland
river of China, will soon have regulations to manage its water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, to be promulgated by the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, will be the first on the subject. The
regulations are designed to guarantee rational exploration,
utilization, protection and management of water resources.
</P>
<P>
With a length of 2,176 kilometers, the river flowing through
southern Xinjiang means "life" and "green" to the arid Xinjiang
where deserts account for half of the land mass. Areas along the
Tarim River include a major cotton-growing region, producing about
900,000 tons of cotton in 1997, making up one-fifth of the
national cotton output .
</P>
<P>
Through land reclamation, cotton fields along the river have
increased at an annual rate of 40,000 hectares annually, bringing
the total to more than 600,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, under a state blueprint the
cotton fields along the river will be expanded to 800,000 hectares
by the end of the century, which would require reclaiming 50,000
hectares of land every year for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
This ambitious goal, however, is causing problems such as
unauthorized reclamation and illegal water diversion which damages
the ecology.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the autonomous region set up a management agency
to fight against malpractice. World Bank loans have also been used
for harnessing the river and ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
The efforts helped divert water two years ago to the lower
reaches of the river, which had dried up.
</P>
<P>
"We're now working on a proposal on the river's environmental
protection according to suggestion by the World Bank," said Tang
Jihong, a senior engineer of the management agency.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the management regulations, efforts also include
setting up special funds and raising the water price to provide
enough funds for managing the water resources," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Sets Goals for Industrial Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In the next three years
north China's Hebei Province will strive to streamline its
industrial structure and product mix, and to upgrade the
technology of local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a work report of the Hebei Provincial
Government to the annual session of the provincial people's
congress recently, Governor Ye Liansong said that the province
would form an industrial structure with the intensive-processing
industry as its mainstay.
</P>
<P>
The province will expand its five pillar industries, i.e.,
chemicals, building materials, metallurgy, machinery and food
processing. The combined added value generated by the five
industries will account for 40 percent of the province's GDP
(gross domestic product) by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the province expects to complete construction of eight
bases for production of fine chemicals, chemical fibers, vitamins,
high-grade building materials, quality steel products, large power
transmission equipment, liquid crystal displays and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to advance development of
electronics, information, bio-engineering, new materials and
marine industries, and to upgrade traditional industries such as
textiles, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
In improving the product mix, Hebei will try hard to improve
the competitiveness and availability of locally produced
commodities on domestic and overseas markets, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The province will encourage large- and medium-size enterprises
to become leading forces for scientific research and development,
and for making investments, and actively organize implementation
of technical upgrading projects and the application of major
scientific and technological achievements, with the purpose of
improving local enterprises' capability to develop new
technologies and new products.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of this century, more than 80 percent of the
province's large- and medium-size enterprises are expected to have
established their respective technological development
institutes, Ye added.

<HEADLINE> Angola, Russia Sign Military Acccord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An agreement of military
technological cooperation between the armed forces of Angola and
Russia was signed here on Friday, under which Russia will provide
training, military equipment and technical assistance to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Deputy Minister of Defense Roberto Monteiro and
visiting Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations
Vladimir Pakhomov inked the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Angola have been maintaining good relations,
especially in the military fields, said Pakhomov after the
signing ceremony, adding that the new military agreement will
further the bilateral military cooperation relations and push
their ties in other fields.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official arrived here on Thursday to start his
five-day visit to Angola. His trip was aimed at promoting
military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Monteiro also expressed Angola's willingness to
strengthen military cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that with regard to the current situation in
Angola, the government's priority in military cooperation with
Russia is to buy Russia's weapons for the modernization of its
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Traditional military relations between Angola and Russia were
established in the 1970's and boosted afterwards. However, with
the cold war coming to an end, their military cooperation were
undermined greatly and in recent years almost no cooperation
projects have been launched.

<HEADLINE> Eight State-Owned Companies Go Out Of Existence Daily In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In 1997, eight state-owned
firms in Shanghai, the leading industrial center in China, ceased
to exist, indicating improvements in the metropolis's economy as
more companies get pushed onto the market.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce says
that 28,000 new state firms were registered with the
administration while 31,000 were up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
Major reasons for the decreasing number is the reorganization
with money-losing firms going bankrupt and illegal firms being
closed, the administration says.
</P>
<P>
A number of firms were bought or merged last year and some
small ones joined large company groups.
</P>
<P>
Although their numbers are down, their economic strength is up,
and in 1997, total registered capital of state firms increased
28.64 percent to 665.8 billion yuan from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The administration warns that companies must operate in
accordance with laws and regulations, and says that 21,000, or two
thirds of the total, had their licenses revoked last year because
they were operating illegally.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Exhibit Dissatisfaction With the Dalai Lama (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Tibetans
have expressed dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's actions
designed to split the motherland and upset religious practices."
said Gasanggya, an expert from the Tibetan Academy of Social
Science.
</P>
<P>
"However," according to the expert, "the underlying reason for
the dissatisfaction of ordinary Tibetans centers on the Dalai's
disavowal of the monumental economic and social achievements in
the autonomous region."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita income of Tibetan farmers
and herdsmen has quadrupled over the past 12 years, with the per
capita living space for rural Tibetan rising to 26.3 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent of rural Tibetans have moved into new homes, and
the central government has funded the renovation of a large number
of monasteries.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels protect the normal religious
activities in accordance with related state laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, both the material and the spiritual lives
of Tibetans have improved considerably in sharp contract to when
the Dalai held power in the region," according to the expert.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain, a 65-year-old farmer, said: "We are living a much
better life than before, and I see no reason to listen to rumors
instigated by the Dalai, a person who has done nothing worthwhile
for Tibetan people."

<HEADLINE> BOU Interferes in Local Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA,January 31 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda (BOU) had
interferred in local money market last December, The Monitor
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
BOU pourred 15.85 million U.S. dollars into the market to
lighten the appreciation pressures of foreign currencies against
Uganda Shilling, the bank's report said.
</P>
<P>
The thirst for foreign currencies was caused by panic
purchasing of hard currencies by foreign speculators and decline
of coffee export in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the main export item which earns 65 percent of
foreign exchange of the country. The decline of coffee export is
attributed to El Nino which delayed collection of coffee seeds
and their drying.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average mid-exchange rate in the interbank foreign
exchange market appreciated slightly by 0.3 percent from 1,147
shillings per U.S. dollars in December last year, compared to a
0.06 percent depreciation the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign exchange purchase amount in last December
was 155.83 million U.S. dollars, a 58 percent jump from last
November of 98.17 million U.S. dollars. Forex sales, in their
turn, rose by 37 percent to 138.45 million U.S. dollars from
100.8 million U.S. dollars last November. Endtiem

</P>
<P>
Intermediate labor-service organizations that began to appear

<HEADLINE> Jiangxi Province Pledges More Funds for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi, a major agricultural
province in east China, is pledging to inject 1.88 billion yuan
(226.5 million U.S. dollars) into its growing agricultural sector
this year.
</P>
<P>
The investment, both from the central and provincial
governments, represents a year-on-year increase of 80 million
yuan, or 4.3 percent, according to Wang Mingshan, director of the
Provincial Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that apart from domestic funding, the province will
also increase the use of overseas funds in agriculture, the
officials said. Last year, direct overseas investment in
agriculture exceeded 30 million U.S. dollars, seven percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
Located on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,
the longest river in China, Jiangxi is a major rice producer. Last
year its rice output hit 17.68 million tons, a slight rise over
1996.
</P>
<P>
"While trying to stablize the grain output, efforts will be
made to improve the efficiency and increase farmers' incomes," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
According to this year's plan, the province will harvest 17.55
million tons of grain, 125,000 tons of cotton, and 2.5 million
tons of sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
The output of livestock, aquatic produce, fruit and vegetables
is expected to rise significantly by around 6.5-to-13 percent. For
example, meat output is expected to hit 2.45 million tons and
aquatic products, 1.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Improved water conservation is also a focus for 1998, with 539
million yuan of funds to be injected.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Oil Minister Defends Budget Against Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian petroleum minister Dan
Etete has dispelled speculations that the government would have
to review the 1998 budget due to the falling crude oil price in
the world market.
</P>
<P>
The government budget has based its oil income on an average
of 17 U.S. dollars per barrel but the price in the international
market has fallen to as low as 14.78 dollars last week, the
lowest figure in 45 months.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no plans by the government to effect a
downward review of budgetary expectations as the likelihood of
some decrease in crude oil prices had been put into consideration
when the budget was being planned by government technocrats, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Etete arrived here on Friday from Vienna, where he had gone to
attend a meeting of the ministerial monitoring committee of the
Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
According to him, all the ministers from OPEC member countries
are "confident that oil prices will firm up in the next couple of
weeks".
</P>
<P>
Before the minister's announcement, there was some
speculations that the fall in oil prices could derail Nigeria's
1998 budget, on which earnings of 257 billion Naira (11.7 billion
dollars based on the official rate of one dollar to 22 Naira) is
expected.
</P>
<P>
Total budgetary income is projected at 424 billion Naira for
fiscal 1998 ending December 31.
</P>
<P>
Defending the budget, the minister disclosed that the OPEC
ministers held useful deliberations on what is to be done in
order to stabilize the oil markets.
</P>
<P>
They had decided to hold consultations with non-opec producers
in order to reach some form of agreement on the volume of crude
pumped into the market.
</P>
<P>
It would help stabilize the market if member countries adhere
to their production quotas, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Chinese Ports Get Help From New Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nanning-Kunming Railway, a
southwestern trunkline in China, has helped the ports of Beibu
Gulf in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region play a more prominent
role in cargo trade.
</P>
<P>
The 898-kilometer railway runs from Nanning, capital of the
region, to Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, across
underdeveloped but resource-rich regions in Guangxi, Yunnan, and
Guizhou, and is part of China's strategy to tap the economic
potential there.
</P>
<P>
The ports of Fangchenggang, Qinzhou, Beihai, and Zhanjiang are
China's most important sea outlets to Southeast
Asia. Fangchenggang is Guangxi's largest port, with 20 berths, 10
of which handle 10,000-dwt vessels each. The port handled up to
6.5 million tons of cargo in 1997, up 28 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhanjiang is an old port that now has 31 berths with an annual
handling capacity of 18 million tons. Beihai has built four
10,000-dwt vessel wharves, and work on another four will start
within two years. The amount of cargo through Zhanjiang, Qinzhou,
and Beihai was up 50 percent from the 1996 figure, thanks to the
Nanning-Kunming Railway. To attract more overseas investors, the
four port cities have been making an effort to build industrial
zones.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Withdraws 600 More Soldiers From Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- About 600 Nigerian soldiers
arrived in Lagos on board a naval vessel Friday, as Nigeria is
carrying out a four-phased withdrawal of its troops from the west
African peace-keeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Before them, about 1,200 soldiers had returned from Monrovia
on December 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, under the control of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), has been in Liberia since 1990, when a
civil war broke out there.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional peace-keeping force has been given the
deadline of February 2 to pull out by Liberian president Charles
Taylor, although it is yet to start the restructuring of the
Liberia army, a task allocated to it by the Abuja agreement that
ended the war and made the presidential election possible.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG has now started pulling out from Liberia, though it
is not clear if a small troop will be left behind to do the
unfinished work.
</P>
<P>
The decision is believed to be on the way, as Nigerian foreign
minister Tom Ikimi is now on a consultation tour of ECOWAS member
countries over the matter.

<HEADLINE> A Quarter Of China's Solar Energy Produced In Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Remote Yunnan Province in the
southwestern part of China has become a leading solar energy
producer, accounting for a quarter of the country's solar energy
output.
</P>
<P>
The province can now produce 300,000 sq.m. of solar panels for
solar-energy heaters each year, giving an annual solar-energy
output of 400 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The products sell nationwide and in the U.S., Japan, Canada,
Singapore, and Thailand as well.
</P>
<P>
With its heavy amount of solar radiation, the province has the
equivalent of 69.5 billion tons of standard coal, or six times of
the province's total coal reserves.
</P>
<P>
The solar energy is widely used in telecommunication,
meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention. The
province has built over 30 solar-powered TV relay stations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Opposition to Military Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday reiterated its
opposition to use of force and military operations against Iraq,
calling for diplomatic efforts to end the standoff between Iraq
and the United States over the issue of arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Tehran radio, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said that Iran is against any unilateral
military operation against Iraq and any military means to end the
crisis between Iraq and U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that military actions would only escalate the tension
in the region and render the situation more complex, adding that
the Iraqi people are the real victim of the policies of military
actions.
</P>
<P>
The public opinion believes that political way is the only way
to solve the existing crisis, he said, calling on the concerned
parties of the current crisis to exercise restraint and to respect
international law in a bid to reach a solution by diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also called on the Iraqi government to respect the
international norms and laws and implement the U.N. Security
Council resolutions, giving no excuse to others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has started a
diplomatic mission to seek support from the U.S. allies in Europe
and the Middle East for its military strike on Iraq after Baghdad
refused to open presidential palaces for the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that diplomacy has practically run out, giving
prospects to a military strike. However, Russia and France
announced opposition to military actions, saying that they would
continue diplomatic efforts to solve the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bjorkman, Eltingh Win Australian Open Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and
Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands upset the Australian pair of Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde in five sets at the Australian Open
doubles final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge and Woodforde were twice winners of the Australian
championship and the winners of seven other Grand Slam doubles
titles.
</P>
<P>
After a tentative start the Australians appeared to be in
control when they snared the second and third sets. It seemed
their experience would get them through.
</P>
<P>
But some uncharacteristic and elementary mistakes handed the
title to Bjorkman and Eltingh, who triumphed in 6-2, 5-7, 2-6,
6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
As well as having won the Australian title in 1992 and 1997,
Woodforde and Woodbidge have won the past five Wimbledon doubles
crowns and two US Opens.
</P>
<P>
"This is the one we love to win," Woodforde said.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to take, but it's not the end, we'll have to win
Wimbledon again," he added.
</P>
<P>
While it was something of a shock for the top seeds to go down,
the winners are among the top doubles players in the world, even
though they have little experience as a team.
</P>
<P>
Eltingh, along with his regular partner and countryman Paul
Haarhuis, won the 1994 Australian and US Open titles as well as
the French Open in 1995.
</P>
<P>
They were also runners-up at Wimbledon last year and at the US
Open in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The same pair also won the silver medal behind the Australian
pair at the Atlanta Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> EL NINO Weakening, Say Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, Janufary 31 (Xinhua) -- Experts said the farmers
should take advantage of the weakening intensity of the EL NINO
weather phenomenon to prepare their fields for the planting
season, a local paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the Famine Early Warning System (FEWC) and
Agribusiness Development Center (ADC) noted that the medium-range
forecast is for a relatively short dry season with scattered
rains, and this will be followed by a rainy season from early
March to late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
The experts said EL NINO is normally followed by LA NINA,
which causes a period of low rainfall for much of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Current indications are that LA NINA will be in effect during
the latter half of 1998, resulting in low erratic second
rains--in essence, a poor season, the experts asserted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was seriously affected by EL NINO which started last
December. The heavy rains made great losses to the local
agricultural production. For example, during last three months
the coffee export, the leading foreign excange earner of the
country, reduced by 57 percent, compared with the same period of
the year 1996.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis No Excuse for Protectionism: Ruggiero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 31 (Xinhua) -- When the world is in
the midst of a financial crisis, it is not the right time for
protectionism, World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General
Renato Ruggiero told reporters here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Congress Center, the site of the
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Ruggiero urged the
United States and Europe to keep their markets open in order to
help stabilize the international financial situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have a financial crisis in Asia. The effects of this
financial crisis will certainly influence the international
trading system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So we have to be very careful to do our very best to find a
solution to the crisis and not make the crisis more difficult," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said, "We know by history that a financial crisis can
be complicated and worsened by protectionist and other wrong
measures. We cannot follow that historic example.
</P>
<P>
"It is the wrong time for protectionism," the WTO head
warned. "Europe and the United States should be at the forefront
of the fight against protectionist measures."
</P>
<P>
He said the more they West keeps their markets open, the sooner
and better will be the solution to the financial crisis with fewer
consequences.
</P>
<P>
It is vital for Europe and the U.S. to keep their markets open,
Ruggiero noted, but that alone is not enough. He urged Japan to
increase its domestic demand and China to keep its currency steady.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that what China has done to stabilize
its currency is a positive influence, which will help end the
crisis and achieve an early recovery of financial stability.

<HEADLINE> International Technical Experts Arrive in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A 22-man international team of
weapons experts arrived in Baghdad Saturday for talks designed to
iron out differences between Iraq and United Nations weapons
inspectors, Iraqi news agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
Husam Mohammed Ameen, director general of Iraqi National
Monitoring Directorate, the Iraqi peer of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM on disarmament in Iraq) said that missile
warhead experts would start their five-day technical evaluation
meetings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A second group of adepts at chemical VX agent is scheduled to
arrive here Sunday and start meetings with Iraqi officials
Monday. Those meetings are to be concluded on February 6, said
Ameen.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of those meetings might be subject to
adjustments, depending on the discussions to be held between Iraq
and UNSCOM teams.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has complained that Iraq bars its members from
searching some places like the presidential palaces for banned
weapons, while Baghdad claims some U.S. members of the inspection
teams are spies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and UNSCOM agreed at an earlier Baghdad round of talks to
the formula of technical evaluation meetings, fixing February 1 as
the starting date.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council in addition to Germany, as well as some UNSCOM members,
will be represented at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that it is
free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Province Making More Use of Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In 1997, east China's Shandong
Province actually used foreign funds worth 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars, up 17 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the province approved nearly 1,600
foreign-funded firms, bringing the total number to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Transnational firms still valued this coastal province with
higher economic growth rate. So far, more than 100 such firms have
invested in the province, in which 26 are listed high on the list
of the world's top 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to direct investment, the province began to issue
stocks to collect funds. Last year, five firms in the province
issued B shares on the mainland, thus bringing to seven the number
of listed firms which issue B shares, H shares in Hong Kong and N
shares in New York.
</P>
<P>
More foreign funds flew to infrastructure and industrial
projects. Shandong China Power Generation Co. Ltd, using more than
one billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds, is the largest
foreign-funded project in the province.
</P>
<P>
Economic development zones have become the hot spot for foreign
investment. In 1997, 24 percent of foreign-funded projects were
carried out in these zones.

<HEADLINE> China to Form Key Machine-building Groups in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China will push the
reorganization of its machine-building industry by setting up a
contingent of large enterprises later this year to compete in the
marketplace, according to a government report.
</P>
<P>
The report, released recently by the Ministry of
Machine-building Industry (MMI), said, "Various means, such as
mergers, acquisitions, shareholding and asset transfers, will be
used for the formation of enterprise groups combining manufacture,
research and development, trade and financial operations in one."
</P>
<P>
The automotive sector, the most profitable segment of the
industry, expects to establish three or four groups with the First
Automotive Works Group, Dongfeng Automotive Group and Shanghai
Automotive Industry Group as the core. "Only by founding such
groups, each with a production capacity of more than one million
vehicles, will domestic automakers be able to compete with their
foreign rivals," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The machine-tool sector will continue its restructuring with
two key enterprises in Shenyang and Shanghai as the backbones.
</P>
<P>
The automatic-controlled instrument and meter production bases
in Chongqing, Xi'an and Shanghai have been designated as future
centers for instrument and meter production.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprise groups on the agenda include those catering to
the production of petrochemical equipment, complete sets of
equipment for power generation, engineering machinery and various
kinds of farm machines.
</P>
<P>
Experts with MMI predicted that the output value of the
industry in 1998 may increase 8 percent to 530 billion yuan. All
of its 10 sectors are projected to grow in 1998 after the last two,
the machine-tool and basic machinery components, turned from money
losers into money makers in 1997.

HEFEI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Light industry in eastern China's
Anhui Province had 23 billion yuan in output for 1997, up 12
percent from the previous year, thanks to greater reform efforts

</P>
<P>
Technology also helped by improving quality and making them
more competitive. In 1997, the province developed 180 new
products, with an output value of 2.35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges Governments to Help Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore stressed on
Saturday that governments should aim to provide a strong economic
and structural framework for private enterprise to flourish as
globalization is rapidly changing the economic landscape of the
world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, which was distributed here on Saturday, Singapore
Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defense Teo Chee
Hean pointed out that the increased level of economic
inter-dependence is changing the context in which governments and
companies operate.
</P>
<P>
The governments should aim to provide a strong economic and
structural framework for private enterprise to flourish. This will
lay the foundation for a resilient economy that can withstand the
storms of global uncertainty, he said.
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to provide such a framework, Teo said,
governments need first to pay greater attention to sound fiscal
policies, which call for balanced, if not surplus, budgets and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"Through productive investments and sound fiscal policies,
governments can build up their reserves for a rainy day. This has
always been the guiding principle behind Singapore's fiscal
policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, governments need to ensure monetary stability by
raising the quality of management of financial institutions. This
requires a range of effective supervisory mechanisms and a more
efficient, transparent system, Teo emphasized.
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, he said, the international community needs
to develop higher standards of risk management and greater
reporting transparency to preserve and enhance the global
financial system, he added.
</P>
<P>
Teo noted that economic liberalization and technological change
will continue to bring the world's economies closer together.
Therefore, responding successfully to globalization will ensure
that all countries can benefit from growth in this new global
economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Govt Goes Through Tough Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In a letter made available to
the public Friday, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said
she could not accept Deputy Defense Minister Anurudda Ratwatte's
resignation appeal.
</P>
<P>
The rejection was the latest major development in a string of
episodes that the government has gone through this week.
</P>
<P>
The week started with an evil omen. Sunday morning, a powerful
truck bomb exploded by Tamil rebels ripped through the central
mountain city of Kandy, killing 17 people and damaging many
buildings, including the holiest Buddhist shrine, the Dalada
Maligawa (Tooth Relic Temple).
</P>
<P>
Soon after the blast, angry people took to the streets in Kandy
and attacked a Hindu cultural center and a Hindu temple in
retaliation of the blast. Police intervened and used tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
To Buddhist Sinhala people, any attempt to ruin or destroy the
Dalada Maligawa, which is regarded as the country's symbol, is a
grave crime. Though the blast only damaged the outer wall,
entrance and roof, it triggered nationwide outrage towards the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which mounted the attack
to mar the 50th independence day celebrations on February 4.
</P>
<P>
It was humiliating for the deputy defense minister to admit
there were serious shortcomings and faults in the security
network. The main opposition, the United National Party (UNP),
taking advantage of the incident, asked Ratwatte to resign and the
government to step down.
</P>
<P>
The day after the incident, the government in a sudden
statement announced it banned the LTTE with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The announcement detonated another bomb in political circles.
The UNP accused the government of having not consulted with the
opposition. Under a bipartisan agreement, the UNP and the ruling
People's Alliance should consult with each other on any major
moves involving the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Many Tamil parties also criticized the government for shutting
the door to future negotiations with the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The following day, the opposition called a general
demonstration in Colombo to protest the government's ban and
request Ratwatte to step down. The demonstrators burnt a dummy of
the deputy minister. They also censured the government of being
unable to provide efficient security to the temple.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the outlawed Tigers launched biting offensives to
three military camps in the east simultaneously early Wednesday
morning, which was believed to be the first LTTE response towards
the ban.
</P>
<P>
The political aftermath of Sunday bombing reached its climax
Wednesday. In the morning, the government announced the Golden
Jubilee celebrations, which had been scheduled to be held in
Kandy, would be shifted to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Ratwatte submitted his resignation letter to
the president, saying he felt responsible for the security lapse
which led to the attack on the Dalada Maligawa.
</P>
<P>
However, reliable military sources said the real reason for his
resignation was that the general disagrees with the president on
the celebration arrangements. He wanted the government to stick to
the original plan because it would only satisfy the LTTE if the
government canceled celebrations in Kandy.
</P>
<P>
On learning Ratwatte's resignation decision, the UNP further
requested him to quit his portfolio in the Irrigation and Power
Ministry as well.
</P>
<P>
At night, the UNP dealt another major blow to the government,
which had been trying to end the passive situation created by the
blast.
</P>
<P>
The party rejected the government's peace package and decided
to submit its own alternative proposals to the Parliamentary
Select Committee the next day. During the past two years, the
government had been waiting with patience for a support answer
from the UNP concerning its peace package.
</P>
<P>
No doubt the government felt disappointed with the UNP
decision, particularly at this difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Sympathetic crowds gathered in Colombo, Kandy and many other
cities Thursday and urged Ratwatte not to resign. In retaliation,
they burned a dummy of UNP Leader Ranil Wickremasinghe.
</P>
<P>
The same day, the first local government elections in more than
a decade in the north were held amid tight security. Security
forces cordoned off all the major positions in Jaffna to prevent
LTTE sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The successful conduct of security measures during the polls
gave great relief to the government and the military.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the tragic explosion in Kandy, security lapse
was still the focus of intense criticism here. Several journalists
complained to Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera that they were
prevented from entering the explosion scene hours after the
incident. "It seemed that our security forces were doing fine.
They were good at guarding damaged buildings," one journalist said
with satire.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the negative influence of the bombing would
only diminish after the Golden Jubilee celebrations on February 4.
</P>
<P>
To ensure there will be no recurrence of terrorist attacks, the
government has deployed additional troops and beefed up security
in Colombo.

<HEADLINE> EU to Keep Budgetary Discipline for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- As agreed on by the European
Commission, any budget increase within the European Union (EU) in
1999 will have to be limited to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commissioners with the executive arm of the 15-nation bloc
reached consensus on continued austerity during a policy debate,
the journal European Report said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To maintain budgetary discipline, said the report, the
3-percent limit will be imposed on payment appropriations while a
4.5-percent limit is expected for commitment appropriations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total expenditures next year will have to be kept
within 1.1 percent of each EU member state's gross national
product (GNP), as against 1.14 percent set for this year.
</P>
<P>
Following the line drawn in December 1992 at an EU summit in
Edinburgh, Britain, the European Commission clamored for capping
the total under 1.27 percent of GNP in case of budget receipts.
</P>
<P>
The savings expected would allow for a margin of 15 billion
European Currency Units, or ECUs, relative to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision was made at a time when EU member
states and their tax-payers are already making great tax-related
sacrifice to meet the Maastricht Treaty's macro-economic criteria.
</P>
<P>
For member states aspiring to join the EU's single currency
mechanism, their annual budgetary deficit-to-GDP ratio has to be
within 3 percent and public debt-to-GDP ratio under 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the budgetary discipline proposed by the European
Commission is deemed a must for furthering their self-discipline
practices in the run-up to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The EU is scheduled to launch the region's single currency, to
be known as euro, on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Daily: Improvement of US-Iran Ties Lies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) - An Iranian daily stated
Saturday that the solution to the estrangement between Iran
and the United States lies in Washington not in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"Although the estrangement of the two nations is deeply
regretted we believe that the solution should be found in
Washington not in Tehran," the English language daily Tehran
Times said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Restating the stance of the Iranian government towards
Iran-U.S. relations, the daily said that "unless Washington does
not change its irrational policies towards Iran, there cannot be
any rapprochement between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday expressed regret to the
estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, hoping for more exchanges
between the American and Iranian peoples and a good relationship
with Iran again in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent the message to the Iranian people on the occasion
of Eid-e Fitr, which marks the end of the Islamic fasting month of
Ramadhan, as a response to the overture of Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami who called for cultural dialog between Iranian
and American peoples instead of government-to-government talks
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's message, Clinton said that "we have real
differences with some Iranian policies but I believe these are
not insurmountable," without repeating the U.S. accusations
against Iran of sponsoring terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass
destruction, and undermining the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Clinton's message to Iran, the U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday also stated that "we hope that we have
more exchanges between our peoples and that the day will soon come
when we can enjoy good relations with Iran once again."
</P>
<P>
The remarks of Clinton and Albright were considered as
"remarkable change in the U.S. attitude towards Iran."
</P>
<P>
Responding Clinton's remarks, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Friday in Switzerland that Iran is waiting for a
concrete change in the U.S. position before relations between the
two countries can improve.
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for a change of behavior on the American
side. There have been good words but this is not enough," Kharrazi
said on the sidelines of the world economic forum in Davos.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
ruled out any dialogs or ties between Iran and the U.S. after
U.S. officials reiterated no changes in Washington's policies
towards Iran following Khatami's call for cultural dialog.

<HEADLINE> Promotive Ideas on Land Welcome: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
consider any promotive suggestions on the country's land
acquisition and development program but will not accept anything
that is meant to diminish it, the head of state has said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to offers by the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU)
this week that the farmers were ready to immediately release at
least 1.5 million hectares of land, and raise billions of Dollars
to help in the resettlement of the landless, President Robert
Mugabe said the suggestion would be considered by the ruling ZANU
(PF) party and the government.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to journalists shortly after an almost
three-hour meeting with eight chiefs from Mashonaland West in
north-west of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that only constructive and promotive
contributions will be entertained, "but negative suggestions,
definitely not."
</P>
<P>
The president said the government was examining appeals from
some farmers against their designated farms, after which it will
consider any promotive suggestions on how best the land
acquisition and redistribution exercise can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government last year designated about 1,500
farms or five million hectares for compulsory acquisition, a move
which did not go down well with commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
The CFU said should the offer be acceptable to President
Mugabe, it would immediately release about 1.5 million hectares
of land collectively owned by its 4,500 members for use under the
state's land redistribution program.

30th position the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins Australian Open Title (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Swiss teenager Martina Hingis
on Saturday became the youngest player in the Open tennis era to
sucessfully defend a Grand Slam title when she won her second
Australian Open singles crown in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 17, took just 84 minutes to defeat the 25-year-old
Spaniard Conchita Martinez 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The current world number one was younger by 65 days than Monica
Seles who retained her French Open title in 1990 at the age of 17
years six months.
</P>
<P>
Hingis' win was her third straight Grand Slam crown after
victories at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year.
</P>
<P>
She collected 572,000 Australian dollars (377,000 U.S. dollars)
while Martinez got 286,000 (188,000).
</P>
<P>
Martinez was chasing her second Grand Slam championship after
winning Wimbledon in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both players began nervously with Martinez shocking her
opponent with a service break in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
Hingis quickly put the match back on an even footing when she
broke serve in the very next game.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss star then broke the Spaniard to lead 3-1 before going
on to take out the set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The second set opened the same way, this time with Hingis
breaking in the first game and Martinez returning the favor in the
second.
</P>
<P>
But the top seed edged ahead when she broke Martinez to lead
3-2 then in the final game. Hingis brought up match point when
the Spaniard's forehand went wide across court.
</P>
<P>
Hingis collected the title as a Martinez backhand went wide
down the line.
</P>
<P>
Hingis said it had been a more difficult task this year than
last.
</P>
<P>
"To defend a title is much harder than coming here for the
first time," she said.
</P>
<P>
"There was so much pressure, but I am very happy to continue
again with both the singles and doubles."
</P>
<P>
Hingis on Friday combined with Croatian Mirjana Lucic to beat
Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and Lindsay Davenport of the United
States 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 in the women's doubles final.
</P>
<P>
Hingis remains a runaway world number one while Martinez, as
runner-up, moves to number eight in the world.

<HEADLINE> Year of Tiger Starts With 41 Road Accidents in S'pore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The lunar Chinese New Year of
Tiger started in Singapore with at least 41 road accidents
reported, killing at least three people, local newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that three people died and three others were
injured in five serious accidents on the first three days of the
Year of Tiger.
</P>
<P>
Police sources were quoted as saying that between 7 a.m.
Wednesday and 7 a.m. Friday, a total 41 accidents with injuries
were reported. But in most of the cases, the victims were slightly
hurt only.
</P>
<P>
However, also on Friday morning, a motorist who survived one
accident was killed minutes later when he was run over by a police
car which was responding to the first crash.
</P>
<P>
The man, Chionh Kok Hwa, 44, was trapped under the police car,
and Civil Defense officers used special rescue airbags to jack up
the vehicle to free him. He reportedly suffered massive head and
body injuries and was believed to have died instantly after the
second collision.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted as saying that Chionh was driving
his Mercedes-Benz along the Seletar Expressway to the north of the
downtown area at around 8 a.m. when he apparently lost control of
his car, which skidded on the wet road before slamming into the
center road divider.
</P>
<P>
Passersby called for the police and an ambulance. The ambulance
team arrived first and started treating the man, who was lying on
the extreme right lane of the expressway behind his car.
</P>
<P>
Then, a police patrol car, which was responding to the first
crash, skidded on the wed road too just before reaching the scene.
It, too, hit the center road divider and then crashed into the
injured man, pinning him under it.
</P>
<P>
A woman ambulance officer and an attendant, a full-time
national serviceman, were hurt in the second crash.
</P>
<P>
Friday's accident was the third fatal crash during the
three-day festive season. A 32-year-old karaoke lounge hostess
Wednesday died after her car hit a lamppost in the downtown area
at 4 a.m. Barely four hours later, a motorcycle pillion rider,
aged 23, died in hospital after his machine skidded along the
Upper Paya Lebar Road.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over the same festive holiday period, there were two
fatal accidents which left a 17-year-old student and a taxi driver
dead.

6-3 in 84 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"To defend the title is much harder than coming here for the
first time (when) nobody expected me to win," Hingis after the
match.
</P>
<P>
"There's so much pressure, so I'm very happy to continue to do
this," the Swiss teenager said before collecting the winner's
check of 572,000 Australian dollars (383,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hingis beat Frenchwoman Mary Pierce 6-2, 6-2 in another
one-sided women's singles final last year.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss girl controlled Martinez from all corners of the
court, hitting 27 outright winners past her opponent, whose game
was checkered with 37 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Hingis picked up the women's doubles title with
Croatian teenager Mirjana Lucic.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles final later on Saturday, Australian
doubles specialists Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde will defend
their title against the fifth seeded pair of Jonas Bjorkman and
Jacco Eltingh.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles final will take place on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Over 70,000 Zimbabweans in S. Africa Illegally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (xinhua) -- About 75,000 Zimbabweans are
believed to be staying illegally in South Africa following the
expiry of their temporary residents permits in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Media officer of the South African High Commission in Harare
Karen Koch Friday said this number excluded those Zimbabweans who
entered South Africa illegally.
</P>
<P>
She said that in 1997, 214,966 visas were granted to
Zimbabweans, a decrease from 312,280 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government deported or repatriated 14,651
and 21,673 Zimbabwean citizens during 1996 and 1997
respectively," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that according to a survey by the human science
research council, the number of people staying illegally in South
Africa was estimated to be between 2.5 and 4.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Union Threatens Another Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZUTU) Friday implored the government to tackle the issue
of price increase as soon as possible or face another mass
stayaway.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda
said the union had resolved at its general council meeting to
take a mass stayaway to be decided by its leadership when
appropriate within the shortest time possible.
</P>
<P>
He said, "following last year's mass protests, the ZCTU would
like to reiterate its earlier position of pursuing outstanding
issues on the agenda. Further the recent price increase would
have taken into consideration further mass action to be
undertaken."
</P>
<P>
"We therefore implore the government to tackle the issue of
price increases, sales tax, development levy and tax on pension
as soon as possible without fail," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the action would be "worse" than the national strike
on December 19 last year, which sparked violent clashes with riot
police.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets up Committee on Socio-economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
put in place a 30-member advisory committee comprising chief
executives of various companies, academics, businessmen and
farming leaders to advise on socio-economic issues.
</P>
<P>
This follows the inaugural meeting of the National Economic
Consultative Forum held in Harare last week to foster broad
consultation between the government, private sector, the academic
and civil society on sociao-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said on
Friday the committee, which forms the core group of the forum,
would be tasked with advising the president on specific policy
issues requiring the input of the private sector and civic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The committee held its first meeting with Shamuyarira Friday
at which the issue of escalating prices of basic commodities was
high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "we agreed that prices were escalating and
asked the group to come up with advice on how to stabilize them."
</P>
<P>
Shamuyarira, who chairs a task force of four cabinet ministers
set up last week to review the recent price hikes of basic goods,
said the committee came up with recommendations on how the
government could stabilize prices of essential commodities which
would be presented to the president.
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet regularly and whenever possible to
discuss economic issues and advise the government on possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
From Monday to Wednesday last week, thousands of residents in
Harare, Chitungwiza and other small towns started demonstrations
in protest against recent prices increase. Some of them looted
shops, stoned cars and destroyed property causing millions of
Dollars losses.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Paper Urges US to Help Asian Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's leading
newspaper, the Straits Times, Saturday urged the Americans to
realize that their interests are closely linked with developments
in Asia and that helping Asia is another way for the United States
to help itself.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times noted in its editorial that a recent poll
revealed that a majority of Americans were against giving
financial help to Asia's problem-ridden economies, while most said
that they would consider it if the crisis might hurt the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
"What is extraordinary about these findings is not that
Americans should emphasize their self-interest, but that they
should not see how it overlaps with Asia's interest," the
editorial pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are two reasons for this lack of awareness.
The first is that, unlike other international crises, the Asian
financial meltdown has not yet hit what has been called "the
crisis level in the American psyche".
</P>
<P>
Second, grassroots perceptions of the IMF (International
Monetary Fund) -- the US support for whose funding is crucial to
the resolution of Asia's problems -- have been affected by
Congressional reservations over more funding.
</P>
<P>
"Both are dangerous factors, and they are dangerous to the U.S.
as they are to Asia," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
America's export industries are creating the new and
well-paying jobs which point the way to the country's future. And
a booming Asia has been an important destination for those
exports. "It is this symbiosis ... that can come under threat if
Asia's economic downturn turns out to be a prolonged one", it
warned.
</P>
<P>
"While this continent will be hurt more than the U.S. will be,
a dramatic fall in Asian demand will take its toll of America's
sunrise industries, which are the sentinels of its future," it
added.
</P>
<P>
As for protectionist lobbies in the U.S., the editorial said
that the Americans should note that the Asian currencies, which
are cheaper now, give an added fillip to Asian exports. And the
crisis will not dampen but instead encourage the export drive with
which Asia has become synonymous.
</P>
<P>
"It is these links that further the case for Americans to help
Asia in their own interest," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Congressmen to realize that the American
domestic interests are intertwined so closely with Asian prospects
that it could be impossible and even counter-productive to try and
serve the national interest by ignoring its Asian dimension.
</P>
<P>
"Helping Asia is another way for the U.S. to help itself," it
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Considers China-America Cable Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is considering taking
part in the construction of a China-America international marine
optical fiber cable project, the Vietnam News Agency reported
Friday.,
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a source from the Vietnam Post and
Telecommunications Corp.(VNPT)
</P>
<P>
The cable, which would link China, America, Japan, and South
Korea, is regarded by international telecom experts as the main
communication network between Asia and north America in the early
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The line would help VNPT expand and improve services to meet
Vietnam's growing demand for telecommunications, including data
transmission and Internet services between Vietnam and north
America.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has taken part in another cable system which connects
with Thailand and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is also taking part in the construction of an
international optical fiber system running through China, Vietnam,
Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and it is scheduled to be
completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Between now and 2000, Vietnam aims to have 4.5 million
telephone subscribers, or five to six telephones for 100 people,
and to expand telephone service to all communes nationwide.

increase of 15 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The commission says that the slowdown will not affect economic
quality because of lower inflation rate and last year's big retail
sales volume.
</P>
<P>
China is now of "buyer's market", so a suitably lower retail
growth rate is good for business, the commission says, pointing
out that firms previously blindly cut prices to get a bigger
market share, which affected the overall market.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth rate is lower, the real sales will be 13
billion yuan more than last year, which is in line with the real
increase in residents' purchasing power.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China to Launch Full-Scale Forward Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) this
year will launch a full-scale "forward trading" in foreign
currency to enable enterprises to reduce exchange risk, according
to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The business -- first offered on a trial basis last April by
the BOC head office and its 12 branches in Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Shandong and Guangdong -- will be available at all of the
bank's subsidiaries this year.
</P>
<P>
BOC is one of China's "big four" state-owned commercial banks
and the country's largest foreign exchange bank.
</P>
<P>
Since China overhauled its foreign exchange system in 1994,
Chinese enterprises have become increasingly aware of the effects
of fluctuations in exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's deepening financial reforms, the
development of the foreign exchange market and smooth operation of
the interbank money market have combined to create the necessary
conditions for commercial banks to start forward trading in
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Currently BOC offers forward trading in the US dollar, the
Japanese yen, the German mark and the Hong Kong dollar in nine
varieties ranging from seven days to four months.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that forward trading in foreign exchange done
through BOC totaled 1 billion US dollars by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The launching of forward business in the buying and selling of
foreign exchange, approved by the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, will not only help enterprises guard against risks of
movements of exchange rates, but also play a positive role in
deepening financial reforms and developing the financial market,
experts say.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: S.E. Asia Critical to Relationship With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen said here Friday that China is an
emerging power and U.S. support for stability in Southeast Asia is
of major importance in maintaining good ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At a testimony before the House Banking and Finance panel, he
said: "China is an emerging power. There is no one that would
contest that -- that viewpoint."
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who recently toured seven Asian countries
including China, told the panel members that he had "some really
good news" to tell in terms of what he had been able to do with
China.
</P>
<P>
On December 19 in Beijing, Cohen and his his Chinese
counterpart, Chi Haotian, signed a Maritime Safety Consultative
Agreement, which was designed to establish rules of the sea.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the "first time this agreement has been
signed; a very positive development to avoid incidents at sea with
China, whose sea power is bound to expand in the future."
</P>
<P>
Cohen was also admitted to an air defense command center in
Beijing and given the opportunity to address the Academy of
Sciences of the People's Liberation Army during his stay in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"It was an extraordinary experience for me to have that
opportunity," Cohen said. "I mention all of this because I think
much of this is at stake."
</P>
<P>
Cohen then talked about the financial crises still prevailing
in some countries in Southeast Asia. These prompted himself and
other senior U.S. and International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials
to visit the region to assess the impacts and ways of containing
the problems.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the panel members of his belief that Southeast Asia
is critical to the U.S. relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"I must tell you that Southeast Asia is critical to how we
manage our relationship with China. How much we support stability
in the region will be critical to how we manage our relationship
with China, which I hope will be in a very positive way," said
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and other senior U.S. officials have tried to pursuade
congressmen to back the government in dealing with the financial
crises.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Accused of Violating International Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Ukraine prime minister,
Evgeny Marchuk, Friday accused Russian President Boris Yeltsin of
"violating international norms" by claiming support for incumbent
President Leonid Kuchma in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk, who is regarded as the main rival of President Kuchma
in the election, stressed that the general election falls in the
category of domestic politics and sovereignty. So he questioned
why President Yeltsin would support this or that politician in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin pledged his support for a second term for President
Kuchma on Friday. As the news reached Kiev, responses were varied.
</P>
<P>
Interfax Ukraine said that Chairman of Supreme Soviet of
Ukraine Alexander Moroz said it was too early for Yeltsin to
announce his support because the election was still one-and-a-half
years away.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukrainians should benefit from the support through some
kind of Russian initiative in the custom areas. As for the general
election, it was another matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the State Committee on Security and Defense
Vladimir Gorbulin said the support pledged by Yeltsin showed there
had been great improvement in relations between Russia and
Ukraine, in economic and political fields.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not regard the support as a reciprocal move for
Kuchma's initiative in an earlier CIS summit supporting Yeltsin
for a second term.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian arms sales exceeded one
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the Ukrainian newspaper Den reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said 170 arms contracts were signed in 1997, with
Ukraine becoming the world's 20th biggest arms exporter, up from
30th position the previous year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Ukraine passed Israel, Canada, Belgium and
Italy in the volume of arms exports.
</P>
<P>
Half of the exports was newly-developed equipment for arms
systems, reflecting benefits from recent years of Ukraine's active
cooperation in military technology with advanced countries in the
arms industry, such as Germany, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine owns 30 percent of the former Soviet Union's arms
industry and has a vast potential in arms exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi banks have been
urged to expedite the disbursement of agricultural loans to
further develop the agricultural sector, an official handout said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria had directed
the banks to disburse at least 10 billion taka (222.2 million US
dollars) for agricultural loan during the next five months, the
handout said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held recently to review the agri-loan disbursement
situation, the minister asked the banks to prepare specific
programs in the next 15 days to gear up the disbursement process.
</P>
<P>
So far, the banks had disbursed only 6.91 billion taka (154
million dollars) as against the targeted 23.5 billion taka (522.2
million dollars) for the disbursement during the current fiscal
year which started from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The handout attributed the slow disbursement to some
irregularities of the commercial banks, particularly corruption in
loan-disbursing.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rises Among Ukrainian Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Criminal offending by military
officers in Ukraine has more than doubled in the last five years,
accounting for 19 percent of the total crime in the armed forces,
a senior Ukrainian procurator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Procurator-general Vasili Kravchenko told a meeting
within the procuratorial system that the military style and
discipline in Ukraine's armed forces is also a worrying problem.
</P>
<P>
Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, there have been, among
officers, more than 200 cases related to the abuse of power or
neglect of duty, and 65 cases of officers stealing firearms.
</P>
<P>
The rise of criminal offending is reported to be due to
officers' lack of regular education in military academies and the
fall of officer quality.
</P>
<P>
After independence, less than 10 military institutes remained
out of the former 34, and thousands of future officers have had to
study in non-military institutes.

HAIKOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 90 percent of farmers in
Hainan, China's southernmost island province, enjoy basic health
care services, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the island's 19 cities and counties have fulfilled
central government health care targets. Most villages have at
least one clinic, according to a report released by the Hainan
Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has effectively controlled fatal infectious diseases,
including malaria, cholera, tuberculosis and leprosy. In addition,
rural residents no longer have to worry about filariasis or Dengue
fever.
</P>
<P>
The province is striving to ensure that all residents have
access to basic health care by the year 2000, according to Lu
Qing, director of the public health department.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has also introduced a
successful cooperative medical care system to provide effective
treatment for rural residents.
</P>
<P>
The system, introduced some 40 years ago, provides Guangxi
farmers with either free or low cost medical treatment. Villagers
contribute to funds for future medical expenditures, with said
funds paying the wages of rural doctors.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative medical care system will greatly help farmers
in underdeveloped regions such as Guangxi, according to Wang
Rongci, director of the region's Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will integrate all counties into the system by the year
of 2000, according to local officials.

to join six already stationed in Kuwait. And the officials said
no final order had been given to send the planes but that they
were expected to be dispatched.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a force of nearly 325 warplanes in the
Gulf, including over 100 on board two aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
The defense officials also said the Army was considering
sending as many as 2,000 troops to Kuwait to join 1,500 already
there taking part in previously-scheduled "Intrinsic Action"
military exercises with Kuwaiti troops.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 Marine troops on board ships in the Mediterranean
are one of the options under consideration to be sent to the Gulf,
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Gets More Diverse Medical Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Family doctors in Shanghai,
China's largest commercial center, has run out of patients.
</P>
<P>
Only 2,289 families of the city's 200,000 covered by community
hospitals have family doctors, and only 1.6 percent of those
responding to a recent survey said they wanted that kind of doctor.
</P>
<P>
By last November, 21 hospitals were providing medical services
for families and public health authorities plan to promote the
service in other communities.
</P>
<P>
By spending as little as 60 yuan annually for a family doctor,
a family can enjoy few checkups and medical treatment. But, most
Shanghai residents are reluctant to spend their money on family
medical services because 98.5 percent are covered by the existing
medical insurance, which doesn't cover such service, Public Health
Department officials say.
</P>
<P>
A lack of qualified doctors also limits the service, the
officials say. But, some medical schools and research institutes
have begun public health programs for urbanites, providing basic
consultation.

<P>
WARSAW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Poland received record foreign
investment amounting to 5.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the
state bureau on foreign investments said in a report released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said aggregate foreign investments Poland has
absorbed since 1989 reached 20.6 billion dollars at the end of
last December, ranking it first among east European countries.
</P>
<P>
There are now 584 foreign companies that have invested more
than one million dollars in Poland, up from 323 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sectors receiving most foreign funds are food, finance,
commerce, transportation, telecommunications and construction.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest investor in Poland. Other
major investors include Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands,
South Korea and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Polish economists attribute the rising influx of foreign
capital to political stability, steady economic growth and
favorable policies towards foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Build Large Cattle-Breeding Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading
commercial center in the country, has decided to construct a large
cattle-breeding base in a bid to increase the proportion of beef
products in local residents' meat consumption.
</P>
<P>
The cattle-breeding base will have an area of 40 hectares and
will be in Tairi Town of Shanghai's suburban Fengxian County. An
animal husbandry company has been established by relevant
departments of Shanghai and Fengxian County and will be
responsible for the construction of the base.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the breeding center will collect cattle of 18
months and will use sophisticated weight-enhancing methods to feed
the cattle for an additional three to four months. Fodder will be
self-made and the beef will be young.
</P>
<P>
The center will first grow 10,000 head of cattle a year,
according to the plan, and the number will be gradually increased
to 60,000 head a year. The annual output value would also increase
from 70 million yuan to 420 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Demand for beef has increased as the city now has 60,000 Muslim
residents. Many hotels have to import beef from abroad because
Shanghai's meat products market is deficient in quality fresh
beef. Beef prices are comparatively high.
</P>
<P>
The developers of the base also plan to grow fish, domestic
animals, vegetables and edible fungus. They also plan to produce
methane and use cattle bones and blood to produce
medicine.

<HEADLINE> Mayor's Hotline Helps Residents of Northern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A hotline that was set up in
1993 in the biggest port city in northern China has helped the
city's people solve more than 300,000 problems over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
"It was the mayor's hotline that responded quickly to our call
on new year's eve to help us repair a frozen water pipe," one
resident, Zhi Sufang, said in commenting on the convenience of the
mayor's emergency hotline.
</P>
<P>
The hotline has received hundreds of calls every day since it
started. To handle all complaints more quickly, the municipal
government has a daily deadline that has public participation.
</P>
<P>
The number of calls is down to 20 or 30 these days, and Mayor
Zhang Lichang says that the hotline has been convenient for people
and made the municipal government's work more public, making
cadres do a better job.
</P>
<P>
The hotline has even helped solve long-term problems as when
residents of Hexi District had been complaining about noise
pollution because of a morning fair nearby, for two years, but
when they called the hotline, local officials visited the district
three times, listening to people's complaints, and the fair was
relocated in a week.
</P>
<P>
The hotline received over 61,000 calls in 1997, and a quick
response was possible in 97.8 percent, and the hotline has a
government responding network now with 346 working units taking
part.
</P>
<P>
"Although some calls are really trifling matters, the goverment
should have a clear conviction that it is our responsibility to
meet people's needs no matter how petty things are," the mayor
explains.

<HEADLINE> Romania Puts Currency Into Free Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 30 (Xinhua) -- From Friday, Romanian people
are able to exchange their national currency, the "lei", for
foreign currencies after showing their IDs at banks and foreign
exchange companies.
</P>
<P>
Romanian National Bank spokesman Adrian Vaislescu said the lei
had in fact become a free exchange currency in the foreign
currency market. Previously, each Romanian could only buy 500
U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
In the first day under the new exchange system, the market is
relatively stable. Compared with Thursday, the buying and selling
rate of the U.S. dollar increased only by 100 and 150 lei
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the value of the lei has been
declining rapidly. To stabilize the lei, the National Bank first
bought a large amount of lei with U.S. dollars. Then it issued 100
billion lei national bonds. In addition, it raised interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the buying rate of the lei has become
stablized at between 8,200 and 8,350 to the U.S. dollar, and the
selling rate at between 8,350 and 8,600 lei.
</P>
<P>
Vaislescu said the reason that Romania chose this moment to
push forward the new system was to prevent the lei from being
influenced too much by other currencies.

<HEADLINE> Transport Conditions Improving in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Transport conditions in east
China's inland Jiangxi Province have improved since an
international container berth went into operation at Ganjiang port.
</P>
<P>
It can handle 30,000 TEUs and will mean that the area no longer
has to rely solely on Guangzhou and Shanghai, and another
5,000-tonnage container berth is under construction at Jiujiang
port.
</P>
<P>
Because of its poor transport conditions, Jiangxi has had
slower economic growth for the past several years. But the
Beijing-Kowloon railway has greatly helped the province with
transport services because a third of this major railway artery
passes through the province.
</P>
<P>
Five trunk lines and 11 feeder lines have helped make the
province's railway network complete and have improved investment
conditions and development of its export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province exported 1.6 billion US dollars-worth of
products, and that figure is expected to surpass 1.8 billion this
year.

FUZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of Fujian
Province's People's Congress, the local legislature, is placing
greater importance on improving the legal system in its Xiamen
Special Economic Zone, which leads the province's opening-up
campaign.
</P>
<P>
As many as 40 sets of regulations have been made in Xiamen
since it was granted legislative power in 1994, and they've played
a role in the city's economic and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
The provincial legislature has approved regulations on economic
development zones and free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is home of many overseas Chinese, so special local
regulations are made to protect the rights and interest of
returned overseas Chinese and their relatives who reside in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the provincial legislature organizes teams of
overseas Chinese to come and have a look at the implementation of
local regulations on overseas Chinese. For the past five years,
these teams have cooperated with government departments to look
into at least 60 problems of this kind.

<HEADLINE> EMI President on Role of Future Eurobank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The new European
Central Bank (ECB) expected to be operational by July 1 will be a
"small but efficient" administration, President of the European
Monetary Institute William Duisenberg said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg was speaking at a briefing on the future European
System of Central Bank (ESCB) on the second day of the six-day
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of
Davos.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank to be established will replace the current
European Monetary Institute. Duisenberg is running for the first
governor of the new bank.
</P>
<P>
The ESCB will consist of national central banks of the European
Community and the ECB with the governing council as the supreme
decision-making body for the euro area.
</P>
<P>
With a staff of only 500, Duisenberg said, "The ECB can serve
as a role model for a strong but efficient European
administration."
</P>
<P>
The ECB would have "a high degree of institutional, personal,
functional and financial independence," but implementing policy
would remain with the national central banks, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said he was convinced that the ESCB would act as "a
credible guardian of a stable euro, a reliable anchor for
participating countries, and thereby will contribute to the
stabilization of the international monetary scene."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Asia's financial markets turmoil, Duisenberg
said, "The euro train is moving. The Asian crisis, so far, has
had remarkably little impact on developments with the euro."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Vice Minister Offers Different View on Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Vice
Minister of Finance Eisuke Sakakibara Friday offered a sharply
different perspective of Asia's financial crisis, saying that
Asian economies were not melting down despite the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a panel session at the World Economic Forum's
annual meeting underway in Davos, Sakakibara said, "Asian
economies are not in a meltdown mode, nor is this a sign of a
bursting of the bubble economy."
</P>
<P>
"Rather, I believe that what we are witnessing is a crisis of
global capitalism," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Sakakibara considered the Asian crisis to be a private sector
problem, involving several borrowers and lenders. He said that
the governments in this region have consistently pursued policies
that encourage high savings, low inflation and high economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese vice minister felt that the trigger for the
current crisis was the massive inflow of foreign capital into
South-East Asia in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This led to reckless borrowing by Asian companies and reckless
lending by international financiers. Hence we should look at this
problem as an international financial crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sakakibara believed that the core of the issue was to find ways
to manage huge capital inflows. He told the session that he was
interested in an idea of setting up an international financial
institution to monitor flows of capital.

<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese industrial
leader Friday ruled out the possibility of devaluating China's
national currency, the Renminbi (RMB) yuan, saying that
devaluation would not necessarily increase competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, was speaking in Davos at a panel session on China
Business of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
"Today, there is much speculation about the possibility of
devaluating the RMB. I think it is not necessary," Jing said.
</P>
<P>
"Partly due to the trade surplus and the favorable balance of
international payments, the RMB has been appreciating for 31
months on end against the U.S. dollar," Jing told the session.
"Over a long period, the RMB has been under the pressure of
continued appreciation,"
</P>
<P>
"The drastic depreciation of the currencies in South-East and
East Asian countries has now helped relieve such pressure, but it
does not mean that in order to increase competitiveness China is
bound to devalue its currency," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China is fully aware that any attempt to depreciate the RMB
will lead to further destabilization of the financial situation in
Asia," Jing stressed.
</P>
<P>
"What is more, the depreciation of the RMB is bound to create a
chain reaction and destabilize the Hong Kong dollar, which will
deal a devastating blow at the Hong Kong economy."
</P>
<P>
"To keep the RMB stable means keeping the confidence of the
people, both at home and abroad," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, I think this is extremely important, not only
to China, but also to all other countries that would not like to
see further deterioration of the financial situation in Asia," he
concluded.

WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Union officials representing

Clinton's activities unless their involvement in the case is

said it would be "very, very difficult" for Secret Service agents

<P>
At a news conference, Carbone said, "All we're saying is that
if it's non-criminal activity that they're compelling Secret
Service personnel to testify to, it should be off-limits."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, reportedly
ruled that Secret Service agents protecting Clinton may not be
called to testify in the sexual harassment suit brought against
the president by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright granted a request from
the Secret Service that was filed in response to subpoenas from
Jones's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
But concern remained over the Secret Service's potential role
in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury investigation,
particularly regarding their relationship with the White House.
</P>
<P>
Lou Cannon, another FOP official, said, "In the absence of
criminal misconduct, confidentiality of the activities of the U.S.
Secret Service protectee must be preserved in order to maintain a
comfortable and trusted relationship."
</P>
<P>
The union officials said they were not aware of any Secret
Service agents being subpoenaed by Starr as of the news
conference.

NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
ended the week with a soft note amid profit-taking following four
sessions of gains.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.52 to 7,906.50 and
broader market indexes also saw a decline at the close today.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, declining issues
outnumbered advancers with 1,464 up, 1,489 down and 507 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
A total of 608.13 million stocks changed hands against 749.62
million shares traded at the NYSE Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 5.21 to 980.28 and
the NYSE composite index dived 2.50 to 510.63, while the Nastaq
composite index fell 1.44 to 668.62.
</P>
<P>
The Dow gained a total of 272.26 points in the first four
sessions of the week, tremendously reversing the bearish scene
previously due to investors' fears about the impact of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
As major blue chip stocks reported good performances in the
last quarter of 1997, the Dow saw a surge of a combined 202.53
points Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Even the Dow stood at just 1.75 points short of its 1998
starting point of 7,908.25 on the last trading day of the month,
and the S&AMP;P 500 finished with a gain for January, a month that has
predicted the market course for the whole year in most cases.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
indication of ruling out the possibility of near-term interest
rates hikes and the government's report on a 3.8 percent GDP
growth for 1997 are encouraging news for the market next week.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: It May Be Too Late for Diplomacy With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said today that it may already be too late for
diplomacy to solve the Iraq crisis over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to push the diplomatic opportunities to the
very last extent, and it may be that we have reached that point
but I'm not aware of it yet," he told reporters after giving
testimony to a House of Representative committee.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president (Bill Clinton) hasn't ruled anything in
and out. We obviously feel very strongly about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work with our other allies on this and the
talks and discussions will continue until we're satisfied there is
no other option left," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States seems to be moving toward a military strike
against Iraq, with or without the support of its allies after
weeks of deadlock and argument over how to defuse the current
standoff with Iraq over the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the House Banking Committee that solidarity against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the United Nations could help
avert a conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very important that the United Nations remains
solid and unified in its statements about condemnations of his
actions. The more solid the United Nations is, the less likely
conflict will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Saddam Hussein thinks he can split the Security Council
members, then "he has a better chance of seeing an end to what he
has seen as a restriction on his ability to generate the kind of
revenues that will allow him to rebuild his military," he told the
committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses With Chirac on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
called French President Jacques Chirac and discussed a possible
military action on Iraq in order to force Iraq into abiding U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that the two
presidents talked through telephone about 30 minutes and their
conversation focused "almost entirely on the situation in Iraq,"
including military action.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents agreed that the situation with respect to
the status of U.N. mandates in Iraq is a serious one now and they
needed to continue to consult closely... as we continue to
contemplate additional steps," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry described Clinton as saying "the time for diplomatic
solutions was quickly running out." "The two presidents reviewed
what additional steps might be necessary," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said in Paris that the
two presidents agreed to warn Baghdad of "grave consequences" if
it keeps up its defiant stand on the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Clinton that "all options remained open" but that
Paris preferred a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis, Colonna
said.
</P>
<P>
"Among the possible options, France prefers the diplomatic
route. It will step up its efforts in this direction," she added.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Records 3.8 Pct Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. gross domestic
product growth accelerated in 1997 to 3.8 percent, the fastest
pace in nine years, boosted by a burst of production in the fourth
quarter, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth, the sum of all goods and services
produced within U.S. borders, represents the fastest pace since an
identical rate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. produced an inflation-adjusted 7.19 trillion U.S.
dollars in goods and services for the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The economy concluded 1997 by growing at a brisk 4.3 percent
pace in the October-December quarter, much higher than the 3.6
percent average of private economists' predictions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, inflation was totally under control. A price measure
linked to the GDP rose 2 percent, the smallest increase since
1965. In the final quarter of the year, it increased at a scant
1.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Last year's growth was led by a technology-driven business
investment boom and supported by healthy consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Business investment in equipment from computers to turbines
soared 12.2 percent last year, the largest increase in 13 years,
despite a decline in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending
advanced 3.3 percent, the best in three years. Spending on durable
goods from autos to household appliances jumped 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. exports jumped by 12.5 percent, the biggest gain in
nine years. At the same time, imports climbed 13.9 percent, the
highest growth in 13 years. So, overall, the country's trade
balance was a slight detraction from growth.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction grew 2.8 percent last year while
commercial building increased 3.6 percent. Government spending
inched 1 percent higher, with a drop at the federal level more
than offset by an increase in state and local spending.
</P>
<P>
The pattern was different in the fourth quarter. Growth in
consumer spending was healthy, a 3.2 percent annual rate, with
services rather than goods providing the biggest boost. But
business investment in equipment fell at a 3.9 percent annual
rate, the worst in nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the year as a whole, trade was a big contributor to
growth in the fourth quarter. Exports increased at an 11.3 percent
rate, but imports grew at a scant 1.3 percent pace, held back by a
decline in oil prices.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Conclude "Open Skies" Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- After protracted
negotiations, the United States and Japan have reached an
agreement over "Open Skies," the White House announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new pact, the U.S. and Japanese airlines will
"dramatically increase" commercial flights between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow more U.S. cities to have direct
service to Japan and give U.S. airlines extensive new rights into
and beyond Japan, U.S. President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement will expand a 10 billion U.S. dollar market
that services nearly 12 million passengers and carries well over 1
billion pounds of cargo each year," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will update the 45-year-old treaty governing
U.S.-Japan airline service, which was signed in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called today's deal "a landmark agreement... that will
dramatically increase air service between our countries."
</P>
<P>
Under a 1952 agreement, only United Airlines, Northwest
Airlines, Federal Express and Japan Airlines have unlimited rights
to fly between the two countries and on to other Asian
destinations through Japanese airports. A handful of other U.S.
carriers are allowed a limited number of flights only to Japan and
back.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government wants another major carrier, All Nippon
Airways, to be added to the list with unlimited access while the
United States wants to obtain so-called beyond rights, which allow
U.S. airlines to fly on to other Asian points after picking up
passengers in Japan, for more of its carriers and the ability to
fly more frequently and from more U.S. airports to Japan.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 4 Wounded in Lebanese Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beirut, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese former parliament
member and a government army officer were killed and four security
soldiers wounded Friday night when Lebanese army tried to defuse a
dispute within the Hezbollah (Party of God).
</P>
<P>
Local radio reports said that the clashes began when Lebanese
soldiers tried to calm down the escalating tension between the
heavy-armed supporters of Hassan Nasrallah, current Hezbollah
leader, and its former leader Sobhi Tufaili over the possession of
a religious institute in the country's eastern area of Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
Tufaili, who was dismissed from the Hezbollah recently, and his
followers have for months waged a campaign of civil disobedience
against the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, explosions and machine gun fire could still be
heard in Baalbek, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leaders called on their followers and those of
Tufaili to avoid any clashes and they asked the government to
evict Tufaili's supporters.
</P>
<P>
The tensions between Tufaili's supporters and those of
Hezbollah reflect the first major split in the Shiite movement.
