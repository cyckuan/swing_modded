<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian parliament delegation
decided to postpone a visit to Israel scheduled for today because
of recent tension in Israeli-Palestinian relations, the Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an unidentified diplomatic source as saying here
today that the visit is expected to take place shortly as the
relations have begun to improve following the Summit of
Peacemakers held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The world leaders attending the summit, co-chaired by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton,
called for joint efforts to save the Middle East peace process and
fight terrorism.
</P>

responsibility for the attacks, which killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended negotiations with the Palestinians and imposed
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the wake of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has blasted Israeli punitive measures against the
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Lebanon will accelerate
steps to work out a new agreement on promoting trade ties between
the two countries, according to an Egyptian-Lebanese joint
communique here today.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued at the end of a three-day visit to
Egypt by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri, who headed a
high-ranking delegation including the ministers of agriculture,
industry and oil, economy and trade and minister of state for
financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hariri discussed with Egyptian officials
means of increasing volume of bilateral trade, which now stands at
some 80 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, during a meeting with Egyptian and Lebanese businessmen
here today, said that bilateral economic ties need to be enhanced
as they have not matched the two countries' strong political and
cultural relations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that bilateral relations are developing in the
best interest of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Also today, in an address to members of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in Cairo, Hariri said that Lebanon will establish a large
free trade zone at Beirut Airport within three years, and will
help market Egyptian products through the zone.
</P>
<P>
Hariri also called for the strengthening of inter-Arab economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During Hariri's visit, the two sides discussed setting up a
joint chamber of commerce and encouraging exchange of visits
between the two countries' businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Egypt and Lebanon also stressed the
importance of making efforts for the continuation of the Middle
East peace process on all tracks to establish a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon
and the Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also underlined the need for acknowledging the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination
and establishing their independent state.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Hariri signed with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
el-Ganzouri one agreement on encouraging mutual investments and
anther on preventing dual taxation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Hariri met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in the southern city of Aswan.

<HEADLINE> Central Government Will Send No One to Supervise SAR  -- Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that there will be no one to be sent by the Chinese
Central Government to supervise the work of the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Answering reporters' questions at a gathering of Hong Kong
Wushu Union, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch, said that the Chinese government will resolutely
carry out the principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people running Hong Kong" after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that "one country, two systems" is a consistent
principle of the Chinese government and it has been written into
the Sino-British Joint Declaration and expounded in the Basic law.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the "through train" for the Legislative
council, Zhang said that the "through train" has been destroyed by
the British Hong Kong Authorities and the term of Hong Kong's last
legislative council will expire on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The "through train" refers to the original arrangement between
the Chinese and British sides for Hong Kong's transition around
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that even if a "through train" still existed, the term
of the last Legislative Council would likewise expire on June 30,
1997, and could not last beyond that date.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if the election of the last Legislative
Council were conducted in line with the Basic Law, and the
qualification of the members of the council met with the related
stipulations of China's National People's Congress, the members of
the council could shift to serve on the first Legislative Council
of the Hong Kong SAR with a two-year tenure after obtaining the
approval of SAR's Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the issue of the so-called four-year
tenures for members of the last Legislative Council did not exist
from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
When asked about an appeal for the so-called compensation for
the legislative council members who can not "ride on the through
train", he said that it is simply a "colossal absurdity."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai PM's Visit to Myanmar Enhances Bilateral Ties (by Zhang Yunfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa's two-day official visit to Myanmar has further
enhanced bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued at the end of Banharn's visit this
evening said the visit marked "the beginning of a new chapter in
the bilateral relations of Myanmar and Thailand in their efforts
to further promote the friendly relations and mutually beneficial
cooperation between their two countries and peoples."
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Thai prime minister to Myanmar since
1980, followed the 12th Myanmar-Thai Regional Border Committee's
meeting last month in the southeastern Myanmar city of Mawlamyine,
at which progress was made in resolving some border issues between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a friendly gesture on the eve of Banharn's visit, Myanmar
Saturday reopened two of the three border checkpoints at
Tachilek-Maesai and Kawthaung-Ranong. A third one at
Myawaddy-Maesot will be reopened on March 19.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) and Prime Minister of Myanmar Senior
General Than Shwe met the Thai prime minister and held talks with
him on strengthening bilateral relations as well as on enhancing
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also witnessed the signing of a border trade
agreement between the two countries. Myanmar has already signed
similar border trade accords with neighboring China, India and
Bangladesh since 1988.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Myanmar side has agreed to release some
100 Thais or have their sentences commuted as a gesture to mark
the 50th anniversary of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej's ascension
to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Monthon
Kri Watnussorn, who accompanied Banharn during the visit, also met
Myanmar Deputy Minister for Livestock Breeding and Fisheries U
Aung Thein and discussed with him on fish and prawn breeding.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Association of Southeast Asian nations
(ASEAN), Thailand also plays a leading role with its "constructive
engagement" policy in supporting Myanmar's endeavors of joining
ASEAN by inviting Myanmar leader Senior General Than Shwe to last
year's 5th ASEAN summit and Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw to
the 27th ASEAN ministerial meeting in 1994 in Bangkok as guests of
the host country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which is the 4th largest foreign investor in Myanmar
after Britain, Singapore and France, had an investment totaling
443.87 million US dollars in 30 projects in Myanmar at the end of
1995.

<HEADLINE> Compromise on New LSE System Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
board is likely to decide to introduce order-driven share dealing
initially for large companies' stocks only when it meets this
week, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Directors are expected to vote in favor of moving to the
controversial order-driven system, which matches buyers and
sellers by computer, but they may at first limit it to the FT-SE
100 shares, and they will continue to allow market- making firms
to deal outside the system in large stakes.
</P>
<P>
The LSE board will meet on Thursday, a day after chairman John
Kemp-Welch is called back to be questioned by MPs of the Treasury
select committee about the exchange's future and the reasons for
sacking chief executive Michael Lawrence last January. MPs were
not satisfied with his answers last month.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence's proposal to move to order-driven dealing was opposed
by the market-making firms. The likely outcome of this week's
board meeting, at which the large market-making firms are strongly
represented, will be a compromise which retains a role for them.
</P>
<P>
Smaller companies' stocks could be brought onto an
order-dealing system later, depending on the reception of market
users to dealing that way in FT-SE 100 shares.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Meets Balkan Leaders to Push Dayton Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher is meeting three Balkan leaders here Monday afternoon
in a bid to maintain pressure to implementation of the Bosnian
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meetings at the U.S. mission in Geneva are
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Franjo Tudjman of Croatia
and Acting President Ejup Ganic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
High Representative Carl Bildt who also attended the meetings
told reporters earlier this afternoon that although the
Croatian-Bosnian Federation has come upon some serious problems at
the moment, he did not fear that the federation could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
Ganic told reporters before the meetings that he would suggest
to conduct reviews of the implementation of the Dayton agreement
every week. But he did not mention how to do so and at which
level.
</P>
<P>
"There is no crisis at the moment, but we have to look for
methods of surveillance for the implementation of the Dayton
accords," Ganic said.
</P>
<P>
So far the Dayton agreement has been basically honored on the
military aspects but faces a number of setbacks with regard to the
Croatian-Bosnian Federation, the return of refugees and elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which regards the implementation of the
peace agreements as a top priority in the year of presidential
elections, has been trying hard to break the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Before the afternoon talks between Christopher and the three
Balkan leaders, representatives of the Contact Group on Bosnia
also met in Geneva in the morning at the initiative of the United
States to prepare for the afternoon talks.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who had threatened to boycott the contact group meeting
because it had not been consulted beforehand, finally sent an
observer to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Divorce Hearing To Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The divorce case between
South African President Nelson Mandela and his estranged wife
Winnie will go ahead without delay, a supreme court judge said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Justice Frikkie Eloff said he had denied a postponement
requested by Winnie's attorney, Ishmael Semenya, who said the
couple still had a chance for reconciliation and that Winnie had
not yet be informed of the details of Mandela's personal assets.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any reason why action for divorce should not
proceed," said the judge, adding that President Mandela had
already made up his mind to end the 38-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
However, Eloff ordered that Mandela's lawyers report the
president's assets to Winnie's lawyers by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Semenya said the couple should try
mediation by Mr. Mandela's relative, chief paramount Kaizer
Matanzima, in terms of customary law.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 78, married Winnie Madizikela in 1958. The couple
separated in 1992, two years after Mandela's release from 27
years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Winnie has asked for half of her husband's assets as part of
the condition for the divorce, claiming she contributed to his
wealth during their marriage.

<HEADLINE> UK Job Prospects Show Weaker Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A slowdown in the rate of growth
in new jobs in Britain is predicted by Manpower, the independent
employment agency, in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
Although employment prospects are positive, the year-on-year
trend for the second quarter of this year is the worst for three
years, says Manpower.
</P>
<P>
Lilian Bennett, chairman of Manpower, says: "While the overall
outlook is still positive, the year-on-year slowdown is cause of
concern."
</P>
<P>
Flexibility of the workforce is now one of management's top
priorities, with the demand for temporary staff still growing, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The survey, covering more than 2,200 companies, shows 22
percent of employers plan to recruit more staff, while 13 percent
predict a fall in the number of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The nine percentage points difference compares with a balance
of 12 percent in favor of job creation a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, little more than one in 10 employers take any active
steps towards recruiting disabled people, says a report published
today by the Institute of Employment Studies.

<HEADLINE> Pan-African Youth Conference Opens In Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The first pan-African
conference on youth and development opened today at Africa Hall
in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "the African youth in the 1990s and beyond:
peace, participation and development", the five-day meeting will
mainly discuss issues concerning integration of African youth in
development with emphasis on environment, employment, health,
education, peace and democratization process.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly organized by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and
the Pan-African Youth Movement.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister
Tamirat Layne said: "Young people of Africa hold the future of
peace and development of this continent in their hands."
</P>
<P>
But "too many children and young people of Africa are not
getting the opportunity to attend school" he pointed out, noting
"it is difficult to expect African economies to develop...when
our youths are neither acquiring the necessary skills nor are
able to find productive employment."
</P>
<P>
"The African youth population is projected to increase by
nearly 40 percent between 1990 and the year 2000," according to
the Ethiopian deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"If we equip them with the pre-requisite technical knowledge
and skills, I believe African youth can adequately deal with the
numerous and complex challenges of the modern world," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
OAU and ECA officials, on their parts, appealed to the African
youth to participate in the peace activities and development of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
ECA Deputy Executive Secretary M. Sarr said that "young people
have been forced to the centre of many of Africa's internal
conflicts, as fighters or victims".
</P>
<P>
"Investment in youth is the insurance policy for the world of
the 21st century," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Spending keeps rising Last year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government spending kept
rising last year even as President Clinton was cutting the Federal
payroll, The New York times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government spent 103 billion dollars in 1995 in salary
and expenses for its employees, according to an official of the
Office of Management and Budget. That is a very slight decline,
about 1 billion dollars, from its payroll costs in 1994 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar value of U.S. government's contracts with
private companies reached to 114 billion dollars last year, more
than a 3.5 percent rise a year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has referred frequently to the elimination of
more than 200,000 government positions--about 10 percent of the
Federal work force--during his 3-year tenure of office. "The era
of big government is over," said the president in his State of
Union Message earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that while those jobs have vanished on
paper, many of the responsibilities are being fulfilled by outside
private contracts and little money has been saved.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating Federal jobs and giving them to private contractors
is a trend not only at rapidly shrinking agencies such as the
Ministry of Defense, but at departments that are still growing
like Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government plans to cede broad new law-enforcement
responsibilities to private contractors, who will run most of new
government prisons but will not be subject to Federal rules.

<HEADLINE> HKWU Chief: Make Wushu Olympic Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- All people in Wushu (Martial
Arts) should unite to make the sport an Olympic discipline, head
of the Hong Kong Wushu Union said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ian C. W. Fok, president of the Union, said their present task
is to put Wushu into the competition program for the Bangkok Asian
Games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sport had been included in the Asian Games in 1990 in
Beijing and in the 1994 Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, Fok said the long-term goal for the sport is to make
it an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Fok said the Hong Kong Wushu Association and the
Chinese Wushu Assiociation have made great common efforts.
</P>
<P>
Anthony H.Y. Wan, member of the Union's newly-elected executive
board, said that Wushu's world governing body World Wushu
Federation has perhaps more than 75 members, which were the
minimum needed to apply for making an Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wan, who is responsible in the Union for promoting the sport,
said western athletes demonstrated an impressive performance at
the world championships last August in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The Asians would face a tough challenge from them in three to
four years," he said. "We have but to take this challenge."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Build Coal Upgrading Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian state-owned coal
mining company Pt Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam plans to build a
coal upgrading facility at its mining area in Tanjung Enim, South
Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
The up-grading plant will improve low-quality coal to make it
fit for various consumer purposes and exports, according to the
company's technical director Purba at a recent seminar on energy
demand.
</P>
<P>
The coal processed by the company, Budit Asam, which came from
surrounding regions, was of low quality since 69 percent of it
consisted of lignite coal, which has a low calorific value and
high water content, making it less popular for consumer usage.
</P>
<P>
Bukit Asam coal is currently used to operate power generators
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bukit Asam's plans were made to anticipate increasing demand
for coal, both from the domestic and export markets.
</P>
<P>
The role of coal as a source of primary energy in Indonesia has
shown a steady increase, particularly for power generation.

<HEADLINE> Duma's Resolutions May Lead to Confrontation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Communist-controlled State
Duma's denunciation on Friday of the 1991 agreements which
dissolved the Soviet Union mark "the first steps along the path
leading to confrontation of powers" an aide of President Boris
Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Ryurikov, who is in charge of international affairs, told
a news briefing that the resolutions passed last Friday by the
Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament), which is
dominated by the Communist Party, was "a show of strength (by the
communists), although a very dubious strength."
</P>
<P>
He said the communists, who maintain the agreements were
unconstitutional, were trying to destabilize Russia and had
succeeded in creating "chaos and confused the picture in order to
facilitate their own grasp for power."
</P>
<P>
Ryurikov accused the sponsors of the Duma resolutions of trying
to disrupt integration among members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States at a time when negotiations are heading for a
breakthrough. Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have been holding
talks on deepening cooperation and possible integration.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Yeltsin, who as President signed the 1991
agreements, may use force in his struggle with the Duma, a
response to Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov's statement
earlier today that "there are hot heads in the president's
entourage who intend to ban the State Duma's activity."
</P>
<P>
Ryurikov said, "I know nothing about such consultations but, in
any case, it is not a method favoured by the president, and the
president will not agree to any forcible steps".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin himself also issued a denial. "As you can see, nothing
has happened, let them not fear anything. Zyuganov will not need
an armored vehicle to get to his own office," Yeltsin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, 51, is seen here as the strongest rival for Yeltsin
in the presidential elections scheduled for June 16.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Companies Buy Back Own Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A record number of listed
companies on the New York stock market are planning to buy back
shares of their own stock.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today reported that so far this year, 293 companies
have said they will be repurchasing an estimated 38 billion U.S.
dollars of stock.
</P>
<P>
Repurchase announcements boost stock prices because they signal
a big buyer coming to support prices. "It is a sign of confidence
in the company" from insiders, says Richard Peterson, analyst at
Securities Data, which is tracking the trend.
</P>
<P>
The analyst predicted that 1996 will witness more than 1,200
announcements for more than 150 billion U.S. dollars of stock.
</P>
<P>
Buybacks got hot in 1994, with 1,012 announcements, up from 606
the year before. Then the stock market was going nowhere and
corporations could easily argue that their shares were bargains.
But as stock prices surge in 1995, buy-back plans kept coming,
with a record 1,108 announcements for 99 billion U.S. dollars of
stock.
</P>
<P>
History and logic say that the trend should stop when stocks
climb, according to economists, who now attribute the unexpected
buying spree to strong cash flows and pressure from shareholders
for higher stock prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, dividends are taxed as ordinary income for
shareholders. Buybacks can produce capital gains, which are taxed
at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
Economists have argued on the buyback trend, trying to figure
out the best way for investment: whether to invest in stock or in
new factories, equipment and products.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fast increase of buyback announcements, the actual
buying was not as high as expected. Securities Data estimated that
companies carry out only a third of announced plans.

The other half is based on spot prices.

<HEADLINE> Barings Case to Go to Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- At least one of the nine former
Barings managers charged with misconduct by the Securities and
Futures Authority (SFA) is ready to refuse a settlement and take
his case to a tribunal to force the debate about the merchant
bank's collapse into the open.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that the executive, who did
not wish to be named, said he was meeting his lawyers next week
and was prepared to contest the SFA's charges that he had failed
to act with "due skill, care and diligence" before the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The SFA, the regulator for brokers and futures dealers, which
has been investigating 12 former senior Barings employees, Friday
served notices of disciplinary proceedings against the nine former
executives of Barings.
</P>
<P>
The authority, which grants the vital licenses needed to
operate in Britain's financial markets, is suspending the
individuals from its registers for one to three years, and it has
charged them costs of 10,000 pounds (15,200 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The nine executives,including Peter Norris, the former chief
executive of Barings Investment Bank, and Ron Baker, the former
head of the financial products group, have 10 working days to come
to a settlement with the SFA, and a further 10 if they wish to
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Five African Leaders Pledge to Ensure Refugees' Safe Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Five African presidents today
called on the international community to provide necessary funds
to ensure the refugees, most of them from Rwanda, to go home
safely, according to reports reaching from Tunis.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day Central Africa Summit which began Saturday in
the capital city of Tunisia, the presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and
neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire said they would launch a
new crackdown on extremists in the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, they pledged to shut down the arms flow
to all those perpetrating cross-border raids.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's refugees fled after hardline Hutus killed up to 1
million minority Tutsis and allied Hutus in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A Tutsi-led government now runs Rwanda, and has urged all
exiled Rwandans to return.
</P>
<P>
Extremists in refugee camps in neighboring Burundi, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zaire have stirred fears that returnees risk jail,
torture or even death.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the five African leaders, along with former
U.S. President George Bush, discussed the security measures that
will persuade 1.9 million Hutu refugees, most of them from Rwanda,
to return home in peace.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is for all refugees who are not guilty of genocide to
return to Rwanda," said Carter, who mediated the three-day talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the removal of the intimidators will be another
major step forward, adding that the intimidators will be
identified and arrested.
</P>
<P>
The five African presidents also pledged to ease simmering
ethnic tensions in Burundi where more than 100,000 people have
died in violence since Tutsi soldiers murdered the Hutu president
in October 1993.

<HEADLINE> India's 3rd Force Launches Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Front-Left Front
(NF-LF) combine in India today virtually kicked off its election
campaign with a call to reject the hawala-tainted Indian National
Congress and Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the Press Trust of
India said.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case refers to an 18-million-US-dollar bribery
scandal which involves many leading politicians in the country
including BJP President L.K. Advani and some cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Patna, Bihar, senior leaders of the
parties stressed the need for evolving a third front to "combat
the forces of corruption and communalism" represented by the
ruling Congress Party and major opposition BJP.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the best use of the hawala scandal, parties of
the NF-LF combine have met repeatedly for the formation of a third
force.  Due to the lack of a prominent figure to lead the force
and some other differences among them, the parties have so far
failed to reach an agreement on the issue even as the general
elections are around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad, who also addressed the rally
today, put forward a proposal urging former prime minister V.P.
Singh to come out his "self-imposed political exile" and steer the
NF-LF combine to power in the coming elections.

<HEADLINE> UK to Secure a Defense Contract from UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- General Electric Co. (GEC),
Britain's leading defense contractor, is on the brink of securing
a multi-billion pound order to supply a set of new weapons systems
to the United Arab Emirates(UAE), according to a report in the
Times today.
</P>
<P>
The deal, believed to be worth up to five billion pounds
(roughly 7.5 billion US dollars) involves development of a new
"super-intelligent" missile similar to the American Tomahawk
cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
Secret negotiations on the contract have been under way for
more than a year, and the technology involved has been
exhaustively tested over recent months.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the deal has taken so long to negotiate
because the UAE has in recent years loosened its dependence on
Britain as its prime supplier of armaments and has been trying to
cut defense procurement costs by encouraging competitions among
foreign manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Britain has also been negotiating with the UAE
on a military treaty, similar to tie-ups being negotiated between
the Emirates and the US and France, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, probably in the form of a memorandum of
understanding, would cover deployment and stationing of British
troops in UAE.
</P>
<P>
Although it is not a trade agreement, the memorandum would form
a framework within which commercial negotiations could proceed.
</P>
<P>
GCE has long supplied its Hakim guided weapon system to the
UAE, and is said to be offering one of two possible upgraded
versions of this system.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Rule Out Early Release of Hostages  in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the kidnappers group,
Free Papua Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya, said they have no
immediate plan to free the 11 hostages they have held for more
than two months.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Kwalik and Daniel Kogoya confirmed this in a written
interview with the Indonesian popular daily "Kompas".  The
interview, dated March 2, only reached "Kompas" on March 16,
according to sources from local media here today.
</P>
<P>
"We will hold the hostages until there is a recognition by the
Indonesian government and the international community," said the
OPM leaders in the written interview.
</P>
<P>
OPM, an anti-government organization, has been fighting for an
independent state in Irian Jaya, the former Dutch colony, which
became the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The demand had been flatly refused by the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
OPM abducted 26 people including seven foreigners on January 8.
 Later, on separate occasions, OPM freed 15 hostages including one
Germany. There are still 11 hostages in the hands of OPM
including four Britons and two Dutch nationals.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Armed Forces' spokesman Brigadier General Amir
Syarifudin said on March 17 in Surabaya that the Indonesian Armed
Forces intended to continue to use their "persuasive" approach in
getting the release of all hostages, said Antara report.

</P>
<P>
"We will promote and encourage Chinese companies to have more

<HEADLINE> Christopher Cautiously Optimistic over Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said here today that he was cautiously optimistic that
a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty could be reached this year
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that now we stand on the threshhold of being
able to realize and reach that important goal," Christopher told a
news conference after a series of meetings this morning which were
designed to push ahead the ongoing negotiations on the test ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who came to Geneva Sunday, met representatives of
other four nuclear weapon states, namely Russia, China, France and
Britain, as well as representative of the Group 21 of the
non-aligned countries.
</P>
<P>
He told the reporters that he had called on the other nuclear
weapon states to take the lead to accelerate the negotiations and
synchronize their approaches to a test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he had "good discussions" with Russia and
China Monday morning on one of the key outstanding issue, namely
the scope of a test ban treaty and the three "are drawing close
together" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said he did not want to be overoptimistic.
"I'm not saying that either of the two countries or any of the
parties have given up positions they previously asserted," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the scope issue, the United States support the Australian
proposal which suggest to ban "any nuclear weapon test explosion
or any other nuclear explosion". But China has proposed that the
peaceful nuclear explosions should be exempt from the test ban.
</P>
<P>
Later Monday morning, Christopher also met representatives from
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco and Pakistan of the Group
21.
</P>
<P>
He assured them that a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
will contribute to the nuclear disarmament goal and will help to
prevent the creation of new generation of nuclear weapons by
nuclear weapon states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Christopher also warned that linking the test ban
treaty to a fixed time table of nuclear disarmament, which is
demanded by the non-aligned countries, would be "non-productive"
and would jeopardize the ongoing test ban talks.
</P>
<P>
To push ahead the nuclear test ban talks is only one objective
of Christopher's Geneva trip. He would also meet three Balkan
leaders Monday afternoon to maintain pressure for implementation
of the Bosnian peace accords.

<HEADLINE> Adoption Official Explodes Orphan Mistreatment Myth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The recent report by the
U.S. Human Rights Watch alleging maltreatment in Chinese
orphanages "does not present an accurate picture," says Filis
M. Casey, executive director of the International Adoption Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a signed opinion published in the Washington Post on March
13, Casey described as "false" the implication that there is an
official policy in China allowing children to die through
inattention, as contained in a report entitled "American Parents
and Chinese Babies" published by Human Rights Watch on February 21.
</P>
<P>
Casey said she had visited many orphanages in China and had
"witnessed the substantial improvement in the physical facilities
and level of care provided because of the donations made to such
orphanages by those families adopting Chinese orphans or abandoned
children."
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have discussed in depth their concerns for
children with special needs, she added.
</P>
<P>
"I can state that the reported mistreatment does not reflect
the experience of those of us involved in Chinese adoptions over
the past few years," Casey said.
</P>
<P>
The director went on to say that her experience only confirms
her belief that "the staff of these orphanages are committed to
providing a safe, healthy, loving environment to the extent
possible under difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging "there may have been neglect or abuse in
the past," Casey stressed: "we believe the current state of
commitment to care for the orphans or abandoned children in China
demonstrates a strong commitment by the Chinese government to the
care and protection of one of the most vulnerable segments of
society: children who are in need of families."
</P>
<P>
She called on people to encourage the efforts that have been
made during the past few years rather than "criticizing what may
have occurred in the not-so-recent past."

<HEADLINE> China Hosts International Water Resources Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference is co-sponsored by the the UN Conference on
Human Settlements (Habitat 2), the Chinese Ministry of
Construction and the Beijing municipal government. Nearly 200
officials and experts from over 50 countries, over a dozen
departments of the UN, and the various Chinese ministries.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on urban water resources management,
water supply cost and financing, water demand management, control
of waste water and sustainable utilization of water.
</P>
<P>
Wally N'Dow, assistant secretary-general of Habitat 2, in a
written speech to the conference today, called water shortage
a global crisis. He said that "Water for Thirsty Cities" is the
theme of the World Water Day this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report made by the World Bank in 1995, nowadays
some 80 countries, with 40 percent of the world's population, lack
water. Also, in developing countries one billion people do not
have access to clean water. It is estimated that the water demand
all over the world will double every 21 years. The UN official
urged joint action by all countries to combat the water
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Construction Minister Hou Jie briefed the attendants on
China's water-supply situation at the conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is a developing country short of water
resources. The per capita water volume stands at only 2,440 cu
m, which is only one fourth of the world's per capita figure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the minister added, rainfall is unbalanced in both
timing and location, and the insufficiency of water supply has become
an important constraint on economic development in Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the Chinese government has all
along given top priority to water resources management and urban
water supply, and has made considerable progress in this respect.
</P>
<P>
At present, the daily water supply capacity in Chinese cities
has reached 182 million cu m, the country's annual water supply
volume has hit 45.9 billion cu m and the coverage rate of water
supply in cities tops 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has established a complete system of
urban water supply management regulations and legislation, and
formulated detailed medium and long-term plans for urban water
supply development.
</P>
<P>
Besides, water conservation and utilization departments have
been set up from the central government down to localities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1990 to 1994 China's cities saved a
total of 9.8 billion cu m of water, saving annually an average of
nearly two billion cu m of water. The recycling rate for
industrial-use water increased from 45 percent in 1989 to 60
percent, giving a strong boost to the sustainable development of
the urban economy.

two countries could reach mutual understanding on those disputes
occurring along the border.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that his two-day official visit to Myanmar has
enhanced mutual understanding between the two countries and he
believed that the bilateral relations between the two countries
will turn better and better in the future.
</P>
<P>
Banharn led a 50-member government delegation to Myanmar
Sunday, including Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Varian and Foreign
Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri. The two countries issued a joint
communique and signed a border trade agreement during the period.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Development Bank to Issue Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Development Bank
(ADB) of China is expected to float ten billion yuan-worth of
financial bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the bank to issue bonds since its
establishment in 1994, said ADB officials.
</P>
<P>
"Raising long-term funds on the financial market will improve
our debt structure, reduce our reliance on the central bank for
capital supply and pool more funds for agricultural investment,"
they added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the State Development Bank of China is
expected to arrange 12.843 billion yuan in loans for 252 state key
projects within the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by March 7 the bank had provided
6.572 billion yuan in loans, and another 5.757 billion will flow
into the targeted projects by March 20.
</P>
<P>
These loans will benefit such state key projects as the Three
Gorges Project, and the development of commodity grain production
bases, coalfields, railway lines, automobile factories,
water-control projects and fertilizer factories.
</P>
<P>
The bank has paid special attention to hydroelectric projects,
the construction of which is usually affected during the flood
season, in arranging loans this winter.

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A fire raged through a nursing
home in eastern U.S. overnight, killing at least eight residents
and injuring two others, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire with billowing smoke swept the men's wing of the
Scotch Meadow Rest Home at Laurinburg, North Carolina, late Sunday
night, but it was quickly contained and extinguished.

Fire officials said all the eight victims had been overcome by
heavy smoke. The two injured also suffered mainly from smoke
inhalation.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party Determined to Save Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) Party is determined to defeat a no-confidence motion
against the three-party coalition government under Sher Bahadur
Deuba in a special parliament session later this week.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the NC parliamentary party held here today decided
to save the Deuba government while it is facing the no-confidence
challenge from the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML).
</P>
<P>
The NC parliamentary party called on two other parties in the
ruling coalition, the National Democratic Party (RPP) and Nepal
Goodwill Party, to defeat the no-confidence motion unitedly.
</P>
<P>
The UML party last week registered the no-confidence motion at
the parliament secretariat and was expected to table the motion in
the special house session starting from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, whether the three-party government would step down or
not depends on the second ruling party RPP as it holds 19 seats in
the 205-seat House of Representatives. The main ruling NC and the
main opposition UML party have 86 and 88 MPs respectively in the
House.
</P>
<P>
UML has requested support for its motion from RPP and offered
to form a RPP-UML coalition government led by RPP parliamentary
party leader Rokendra Bahadur Chand to replace the present NC-led
one.
</P>
<P>
But RPP, which holds the key to survival of the present
government, so far has not clarified its stance on the
no-confidence motion as its leaders were divided into two groups
with contrary views on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Military Leader Meets French Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military leader
said here today that no one should make irresponsible remarks
about Chinese military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said that the recent military exercises and the missile test
launches are regular drills, and they have demonstrated the
determination and capacity of the Chinese armed forces to
safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks here this afternoon when meeting with a
French business delegation headed by Jeannou Lacaze, president of
the Universal Investment Group of Paris and former chief of staff
of the armed forces of France.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the fundamental reason for the present tense
situation in the Taiwan Straits lies in the activities of some
leaders of the Taiwan authorities who advocate "Taiwan
independence" and of some foreign forces who support this
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is an integral part of China and the
issue of Taiwan is purely an internal affair of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has often reiterated its basic
principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems", he said.
</P>
<P>
China will never promise to abstain from resorting to arms on
the Taiwan issue, Zhang said, adding that such an eventuality
would only occur in the case of a declaration by Taiwan of
"independence" or invasion of Taiwan by foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
Lacaze said that France is very much concerned about China's
stand on the issue of Taiwan, and it believes each country in the
world has the right to safeguard its own interests.
</P>
<P>
And therefore, he said, France fully understands the importance
of a powerful and unified country, and fully understands that
China cannot turn a blind eye to what happens in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Zhang and the guests also exchanged views on
the promotion of cooperation between businesses of the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops to Withdraw from Chechnya: Grachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev today said Russian troops would start a gradual pullout
from Chechnya in April, but said Interior troops would remain.
</P>
<P>
"A gradual withdrawal of military units and formations, not
engaged in special operations, outside Chechnya will begin in
April as the president has promised," Grachev told reporters,
referring to a plan adopted by the Security Council last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But he said the army would continue to help Interior troops in
the rebel republic carry out special operations until the
remaining armed Chechen separatists are completely defeated.
</P>
<P>
Special operations will also be necessary to fight any new
criminal gangs which may emerge, he added.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said he supported a "complex approach" to the
Chechen settlement which includes both military and political
measures.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Chechnya cannot be solved only by power
methods, there should be a combination of military, political and
socio-economic methods of the settlement," the military leader
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that had there not been peace talks with
Chechen separatists last summer under the orders of Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the conflict in Chechnya could have been
settled earlier.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had foreseen the current situation back in
1995 and had warned that a suspension of fighting after the
hostage drama in Bubennovsk would have a negative impact on the
whole situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1995, Russian troops temporarily suspended
hostilities after the separatists, under the command of Shamil
Basayev, raided Budennovsk in southern Russia and seized several
thousand hostages.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has promised an end to the 15-month war in Chechnya
before the country's presidential elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Security Council approved a Chechen settlement
plan. Yeltsin told reporters after the meeting that he would soon
address the nation to announce details of the plan.

survey and demarcate as soon as possible the entire boundary
except the sector already demarcated under the 1991 memorandum of
understanding relating to the fixed boundary on the Maesai-Namruak
rivers sector.
</P>

The agreement on border trade between Myanmar and Thailand,
which was signed on March 17, would help promote trade between the

met here today with a French delegation of business executives
headed by Jeannou Lacaze, president of the Universal Investment
Group of Paris and former chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of
France.
</P>
<P>
The delegation came to China at the invitation of the China
Council for Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) for the
purpose of exploring the possibilities for establishing joint
ventures, expanding bilateral cooperation in trade, economy and
education.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li said that China and France enjoy a
long-term sound cooperation in trade, economy, science and
technology.

"We are happy to see that bilateral cooperation has developed
smoothly since the obstacles, once emerged in the way of bilateral

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC) and the Triton Energy Corp. of the US signed a
second contract here today to explore for oil in the 16/03 block
of the Pearl River Delta, about 150 km southeast of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Block 16/03 is about 8,900 sq km, with water depths ranging
from 100 to 200 m, according to the CNOOC.

collection, information analysis and drilling of exploratory wells.
</P>
<P>
The Block is contiguous to Block 16/22, its second oil
contract with the CNOOC, which is surrounded by oil fields on two
sides. Geological studies show that the two blocks are promising,
for they are located on moving oil-and gas-bearing
structures.
</P>
<P>
Triton expects to begin drilling the first exploratory
well this April.
</P>
<P>
Triton is an independent oil and gas exploration company
primarily focussing on oil and gas exploration and

<HEADLINE> Trial of Two Former S. Korean Presidents Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The second session on the mutiny
and treason charges involving former South Korean Presidents
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo was held at the Seoul District
Court here today.
</P>
<P>
At the trial, prosecutors charged that Chun and Roh as well as
their cronies mobilized troops to arrest then Army Chief of Staff
Chung Sung-hwan and several other loyal generals without an
presidential permit with the intention to control the armed forces
on the evening of December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the same court were 11 close aides of
the two ex-presidents, who played key roles in the military mutiny
on December 12, 1979, which was led by Chun and Roh.
</P>
<P>
However, Chun claimed that he and his colleagues had to mobilize
troops because some army generals made rebellious acts first.
</P>
<P>
He contended that Major General Chang Tae-wan ordered his men
to kill him and shell the Kyongbok Palace area of Seoul
indiscriminately to "jeopardize national security."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution today questioned Chun and two of his coup
colleagues, Yoo Hak-seong, then deputy defense minister for
logistics, and Hwang Young-si, first corps commander. Roh Tae-woo
was questioned at the first trial session on March 11.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the Army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have been indicted
for mutiny and treason, in addition to graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The third session on the trial of Chun and Roh will be held
on March 25.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace in Kwazulu/Natal, a Long Way to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for convening a
long-planned peace gathering among Zulus named Imbizo in
Kwazulu/Natal Province is becoming increasingly elusive when a
top-level pre-Imbizo meeting of traditional leaders (Amakhosi)
failed last week.
</P>
<P>
The planned Imbizo, proposed by President Nelson Mandela
earlier this year, was widely considered as an urgent step to
bring an end to the unabated political violence in strife-torn
Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Amakhosi on Friday, which was supposed to set
the date and scene for the planned Imbizo, failed to reach any
agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the five-hour meeting, attended by Mandela, Zulu King
Goodwill Zwelithini and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, was marked by heated acrimonious exchange,
interjections and jeers by some chiefs, especially when Mandela
told them not to raise Buthelezi above the King.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the president, who had earlier taken a
conciliatory stance, lashed out at the chiefs. He later took a
harder line, telling the apparently hostile hecklers: "You can
shout until you are blue in the face, but I am going to lay down
the riot act for everybody in this country if you are killing
innocent people."
</P>
<P>
Mandela further claimed that dark and sinister forces were at
work in Kwazulu/Natal fuelling violence between the African
National Congress (ANC) and the IFP.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 20,000 people had been killed
in the province since fighting broke out between the two black
rival organizations in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, several speakers, including Buthelezi, raised a
number of issues that were stumbling blocks to an Imbizo,
claiming the Zulu nation is being mistreated by the government.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the government has ignored their demands
for a self-governing Zulu kingdom and for international mediation
over the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the meeting, Buthelezi protested that the
National government was on the verge of taking away "the
ancestral land of the Zulu nation" and that King Zwelithini would
no longer be the trustee of land on behalf of chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi also complained that Zwelithini was no longer
leading the Zulus in their struggle to attain a Zulu kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"How can we go into an Imbizo to promote peace and unity when
echoes of accusations and counter-accusations of murder and
general mayhem reverberate every day?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Although the meeting was a failure in whichever way one looks
at it, Mandela was still optimistic about the prospects of the
holding of the planned Imbizo, saying he was not discouraged by
the outcome of Friday's meeting of Amakhosi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria on Saturday, Mandela said:
"I don't get discouraged when we meet obstacles. The overwhelming
majority of people in Kwazulu/Natal are for peace. I fully
believe we will be able to sort out this matter and that we will
have an Imbizo."
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that Mandela will make another bid this
week to revive the peace initiative in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's director of communications Joel Netshitenzhe said on
Sunday the President would consult various role-players and that
a date for a follow-up meeting would be set during the course of
this week.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no matter what the peace Imbizo might lead to in
the future, Friday's meeting of Amakhosi suggests the ANC and
IFP, the chiefs and the government, Mandela and Buthelezi, are
still far apart as they ever were.
</P>
<P>
This does not augur well for Kwazulu/Natal, because
deep-rooted political differences between the ANC and IFP cannot
be uprooted by a mere peace gathering, Observers here say.
</P>
<P>
Peace in Kwazulu/natal remains a long way to go.

<HEADLINE> China's Domestic Satellite Telecom Network Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A domestic satellite
telecommunications network covering 20 cities in China has taken
shape, after the country built 12 and expanded 21 satellite earth
stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has made a breakthrough in satellite
communications from analog technology to digital technology,
according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) China
built or expanded satellite earth stations in Beijing, Chongqing,
Guangzhou, Xi'an, Kunming, Lanzhou, Hohhot, Urumqi, Haikou and
Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 the ministry decided to put a total investment of 620
million yuan (about 75 million US dollars) into constructing a
domestic satellite digital telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase the ministry constructed seven and expanded
seven satellite earth stations, while in the second phase it
constructed five and expanded 14.
</P>
<P>
Following five years of construction China has considerably
expanded the capacity of the long-distance telephone service,
especially in remote areas such as the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The present domestic satellite digital telecommunications
network is now capable of carrying voice, picture and data
traffic, whereas the old network could only carry voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth-Five Year Plan period (1996-2000) the ministry
intends to make special efforts to complete a satellite digital
telecommunications network with a large capacity and high speed
covering all provincial capitals and medium-sized cities in
economically-developed areas.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The most important Buddhist
lamasery in the Chinese capital ushered in the holiest day of the
year when lamas performed a traditional dance supposed to vanquish
demons and monsters here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
That was the climax of an annual week-long grand Buddhist rite
held in the Yonghe Lamasery, the largest and best preserved
lamasery outside the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Mandela, Winnie In Court For Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
and his estranged wife Winnie Madizikela-Mandela, arrived at
Johannesburg's Rand Supreme Court this morning for the start of
their divorce proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is represented by human rights advocate Wim Trengove
while Winnie is by advocate Ishmael Semenya during the divorce
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mandela's lawyer Semenya asked for a postponement on the
grounds not all reconciliation attempts had been made, saying
customary law provisions had not been utilized.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela's attorney Trengove told the court a
postponement should not be granted in the divorce proceedings
against Winnie because reconciliation was not possible between
them.
</P>
<P>
Trengove told the court that reports of Mrs. Mandela's "brazen
infidelity" had never been explained.
</P>
<P>
In response to the customary law aspect, Trengove said Mr.
Mandela's relative, chief paramount Kaizer Matanzima, who would
be expected to negotiate a reconciliation, was basically a
"sell-out who only gained power during apartheid."
</P>
<P>
Trengove said it would be unethical for the chief to mediate
in reconciliation attempts because at one time he had tried to
compete for Mrs. Mandela's affections. He lost to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and his wife sat stern-faced and did not
look at each other for the first part of the legal proceedings to
end their 38-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit before the court, Mr. Mandela said he
respected customary law but viewed his marriage as being "on
paper only."
</P>
<P>
The president said he knew of no custom that dealt with the
dissolution of marriage.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 78, who initiated divorce proceedings, married Winnie
Madizikela in 1958. The couple separated in 1992, two years after
Mandela's release from 27 years's imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
A legal source said money would be the central issue in the
divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
Winnie was reportedly claiming half of her husband's estate,
worth an estimated 40 million Rand (about 11 million US Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Lao Party President Delivers Political Report  at Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENTIANE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Khamtay Siphandone, president
of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, said here today that
during the 1991-95 period, the gross domestic product of Laos
reached an annual average increase of 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed this in his political report delivered to the
three-day sixth congress of the party, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
However, he said during the next five years up to the year
2000, the living standard and cultural level of the Laotian people
will rise, considering that the country has good land, rich
forest, water, mine ores, and tourism resources such as beautiful
scenery.
</P>
<P>
For the next five years (1996-2000), the party will strive to
ensure that the economy grows to the tune of 8-8.5 percent per
year. By 2000, per capita income must reach 500 US dollars (not
considering inflation), he said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say how much it is now. It is widely believed
that per capita income now stands at 350 US Dollars. Land-locked
Laos is listed by the United Nations as one of the world's least
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Khamtay also said that Laos must build a number of basic works
to serve as basis for the further industrialization and
modernization of the country.
</P>
<P>
He is also committed to solving food scarcity and poverty in
some priority areas in close connection with all-round rural
development.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, he said Laos follows the policy of peace,
independence, friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said Laos' traditional friendly relations
and all-round cooperation with China have been expanded in terms
of scope and depth.
</P>
<P>
In years to come, Laos will develop the solidarity and
friendship, all-round cooperation and mutual support and
assistance with China.
</P>
<P>
Its relations with neighboring countries, such as Myanmar and
the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) have stepped up to a higher degree.
</P>
<P>
Laos will continue to prepare actively to become member of
ASEAN and actively participate in its activities with other member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Laos must open wider relations and cooperation with
various countries in the world, monetary institutions and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said opening up of external economic relations and promotion
of foreign investment is a major policy of the party aimed at
tapping the international potentials to combine with domestic ones
for the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, Laos must prepare all conditions for membership
of ASEAN's Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the World Trade
Organizations (WTO), he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Breweries Makes Profit After Years Of Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Breweries
Limited (TBL) has declared its first dividend of 7 million US
Dollars for 1995 for its joint venture partners after making
losses for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before President Benjamin Mkapa's speech to mark the
official inauguration of Mwanza Brewery in Mwanza over the
weekend, TBL Board of Directors Chairman Mr Paul Bomani said the
company's 1995 performance signals return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
TBL is a business partner with the South African Breweries
(SAB) through its subsidiary, Indol.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was concluded in November 1993 and building of
the Mwanza Brewery started in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mr Bomani said that declaration of the dividend was a result
of the joint venture's 1995 profit of 14 million US Dollars after
substantial rehabilitation had been made at the Dar es Salaam
Brewery.
</P>
<P>
The Mwanza Brewery is located at Pasiansi, a few kilometers
from Mwanza town, on the shores of Lake Victoria. Since starting
production, it has produced over 260,000 crates of beer.
</P>
<P>
After improving production level by 12 percent in 1994, up
from the 1993 level, performance during 1995 showed an increase
of 83 percent despite power and water supply problems. This is 61
percent rise on the 1994 production level.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects Separation with Palestinians Within 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Internal Security
Minister Moshe Shahal said today that he expects the plan of
separation between Israel and the Palestinian areas to be
completed within one to two years.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided to implement the separation
plan especially following the recent wave of Hamas suicide
bombing attacks in Israel, which killed 58 people within nine
days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour to the coastal area between Israel
and the Gaza Strip, Shahal also said he has decided that
checkpoints at the sea-line between Israel and the Palestinian
areas will be jointly operated by both sides.
</P>
<P>
His decision thus reversed earlier recommendation by Israeli
security officials to have separate posts.
</P>
<P>
Shahal added that the close international cooperation against
terrorism has made it possible for the Israeli police to
investigate into two Hamas-affiliated Islamic institutions, which
were recently closed down in Nazareth and east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security sources said today that since the
closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was eased this
week, 500 tons of flour, rice and milk have entered the
Strip from Israel via the Karni crossing point.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also allowed shipment of some 640 tons of flour to
enter Gaza from Egypt via Rafah.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there is no shortage of food in Gaza and
that the Palestinians have not submitted any request for more
food supplies.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Welcome UN Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leaders, Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto, have welcomed the U. N.
Security Council concern over the humanitarian situation in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the Somali Salvation Alliance
(SSA) led by north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
said the alliance welcomes "the keen interest that U.N. always
shows" to monitor the situation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The SSA also said they will cooperate with all genuine efforts
which the international community may undertake to help the
Somali community.
</P>
<P>
they further said they welcome the UN initiative to send to
Somalia a fact-finding mission to ascertain about the reasons
behind the renewed deterioration of the humanitarian condition.
</P>
<P>
The SSA argued that all Somali factions have an equal share of
responsibility in perpetuating the current ordeals of Somalia.
"the responsibility of the political and humanitarian instability
in Somalia lies on the shoulders of some handful anti-peace
elements," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The SSA doesn't believe that any military solution could be
possible to settle the protracted political crises.
</P>
<P>
It also said they don't agree with the attitude of
generalizing with the notion of general culpability with regard
to responsibility of the past failures.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the SSA also said they have never attempted
to make a self proclamation exercise as done by General Mohamed
Farah Aidid, another main faction in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement of the SSA itself was issued from an
office called the Office of the President of Somali Republic
referring to Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Both radio north and south Mogadishu reiterate the presidency
of their owners, Ali Mahdi and General Aidid respectively.
</P>
<P>
On Friday or March 15, the UN Security Council have expressed
its concern over the worsening humanitarian situation is Somalia.
It said diseases and malnutrition are increasing in Somalia with
the lack of healthy political settlement.
</P>
<P>
They blamed the Somali factions for their failure of
reconciling among themselves. The security council attributed the
worsening humanitarian situation mainly to the continuing closure
of Mogadishu seaport.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the spokesman of General Aidid's
government, Mr Mohamed Qanyeare Afrah, said today his government
is welcoming any humanitarian assistance to Somalia and ready to
cooperate with the relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, Mr Afrah, the Interior Minister of General Aidid's
government, said his administration doesn't accept food messed up
with politics, saying, "we don't accept anybody to meddle in our
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He said his faction is not responsible for the worsening
humanitarian situation in Somalia, noting, "we're not those who
closed both the air and sea ports in Mogadishu."
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu seaport was closed last October after Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto accused Sombana and Somali
Fruit, Banana Exporting Companies, of providing financial
assistance to their rival General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
However, some natural seaports including Merca, 100 km south
of Mogadishu and El-Ma'an, 30 km north of the capital, remain in
use by the merchants.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Newspaper Criticizes U.S. Bill against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Helms-burton Bill against
Cuba is an "insolent bill defying morality and the fundamental
principles of international laws and runs counter to the trend of
free trade and cooperation for common development, a Vietnamese
leading newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The "Nhan Dan" (people) newspaper said in a commentary that the
U.S. bill aimed to tighten economic sanctions against Cuba is in
fact an attempt to internationalize the economic and trade embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Cuba bill had been adopted by the U.S. congress
following two U.S. airplanes were shut down by Cuba air force last
month. Havana accused Washington of violating Cuba's air space.
</P>
<P>
"The bill is typical of Washington's policy of placing its laws
above international law, giving itself the right to interfere
while ignoring a country's sovereignty and the right of
self-determination," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The approval of this bill by the U.S. government is a dangerous
precedent in international relations because it challenges not
only one country but also the world as a whole, the commentary
added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that far before it became law, the Helms-burton bill
imposing trade embargo on Cuba 35 years ago had stirred up a wave
of protest in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Latin America, the Caribbean countries as well as Russia, China
and even U.S. allies Canada and 15 European Union countries all
considered the passing of this bill a serious mistake unacceptable
in current time, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Although the United Nations' general assembly passed four
resolutions condemning the U.S. and requesting it to stop its
blockade against Cuba, the extreme right wing in the U.S. is still
pursuing its hostile policy, Nhan Dan noted.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called on the United States to immediately put an
end to its "outmoded hostile policy against Cuba".

During their meeting, VNA reported, General Secretary Do Muoi

<HEADLINE> Iranian Extremists Stage Demonstration against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Iranian extremists today
staged a demonstration in front of the German embassy here to
protest over a warrant issued by German Federal Prosecutor's
Office for arresting Iranian Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan.
</P>
<P>
Holding large black and white photos of blind-folded American
hostages, Ansar-e Hezbollah, a riotous and frightening group in
Iran, burnt U.S. and Israeli national flags in front of the German
embassy to condemn actions of "the pro-Zionist lobby" in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group held frequent demonstrations in Tehran
University, mosques and other public places in the past
months. They are often responsible for burning down book shops and
 making disturbances in universities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from the group chanted slogans of "Europe
Beware," "Denounce U.S.A.," "Down with U.S.A." and "Down with
Israel." Loudspeakers placed on the back of a pickup truck
carried the voice of a boy directed to the embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the German ambassador to Tehran,
the demonstrators demanded an apology for insulting "a sitting
minister" in the cabinet of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The letter demanded that the warrant for Fallahiyan's arrest
should be canceled, and called on the German government to be
alert against U.S. and Israeli influences.
</P>
<P>
"We want a relationship based on mutual respect. If that
is achieved, the Moslems do not see any necessity to chant
Death to Germany in addition to Death to America and Death
to Israel," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
Some of the staff at the German embassy gathered behind
the windows to listen to the text of the letter. Some 100
policemen guarded the embassy
</P>
<P>
The letter criticized those Moslem politicians who thought that
Germany was a friend of Moslems. It further appealed to Iranian
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to announce "full alert to all the
Hizbollah members around the world to safeguard the honor and
dignity of Islam."
</P>
<P>
"We the Moslems do not have anything to lose in the world and
we would be gladly prepared to give up our lives in order to
safeguard Islam," it added.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant has been issued by German Federal
Prosecutor's Office for the Iranian information minister, charging
him with ordering the killing of four members of the Iranian
Kurdish opposition in Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iran's parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
termed as a grave mistake and unacceptable the verdict issued by
the German Federal Prosecutor against the Iranian information
minister.
</P>
<P>
The speaker stated that the German judicial system is an
independent power and that the verdict has no effect on the
existing relations between Tehran and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry deplored the arrest warrant, saying
that the case against Fallahiyan was not the least corroborated by
evidence.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry said "there was
absolutely no evidence on file pending in the said court that
adduced to the Iranian officials having been involved in its
subject-matter."
</P>
<P>
After four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany has gone through periodic crises.

<HEADLINE> Balkan FMs' Meeting Significant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of foreign ministers of
Bulgaria, Greece and Romania in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of
Varna is of important significance for the Balkan region, said
Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Varna showed the criteria of mutual relationship
in Europe have flowered among some Balkan people, Videnov told
reporters after meeting with the foreign ministers of the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities are open to other Balkan countries to get close
to or ally with the three countries, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite meeting, which started Saturday afternoon and
ended Sunday evening, was focused on economic cooperation in
general and cooperation in infrastructure and telecommunications
projects between the three countries.
</P>
<P>
These included a second bridge over the Danube river, which
separates Bulgaria and Romania, and the project of an oil pipeline
linking Bulgaria and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Greece at the meeting expressed interest in
creating an integrated Balkan telephone network, an idea applauded
by Serbia. For this, the post ministers of the three countries
will meet in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania agreed to
meet again in Bulgaria's capital in June this year, saying their
meeting will be helpful to developing regional cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The first foreign ministers' meeting of the three countries
took place last August in Greece, when it was agreed that
periodical meetings would be held, open to the foreign ministers
of other Balkan countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports May Be Affected by EU's New GSP Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s new
proposal of Generalized System of preference (GSP) on agricultural
products will affect certain categories of Thai exports to the
Western trading bloc when it comes into force this year, a Thai
Commerce Ministry report said today.
</P>
<P>
The new move of EU's GSP was based on a criterion similar to
that of industrial products, which would particularly affect
export of Thai seafood, food products, and decorated flowers, said
the report carried by the Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the new GSP proposal, approved by the EU's Commission on
March 6, developing countries with relatively higher development
levels, like Thailand, are more likely to be withdrawn from the
trading privilege in some categories of farm products, especially
those considered sensitive ones.
</P>
<P>
Thailand considers the EU proposal as unfair and discriminatory
in the narcotic policy, and will acceleratedly lobby EU member
countries to change the policy before the proposal's final
approval in late April, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Makes up One Third of Malaysia's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
sector accounted for 33.1 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1995, International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
After launching the country's "Industry Excellence Award 1996"
at her ministry, Rafidah said the figure represented an increase
of 1.5 percentage points over 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, sales of manufactured products
totaled 159.189 billion Malaysian ringgit (about 63.67 billion US
dollars) in 1995, up 22.6 percent from 129.799 billion ringgit
(about 51.92 billion US dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah stressed that the good performance of the industry is
due not only to government policies but also, more importantly, to
the awareness of the industry itself.
</P>
<P>
On the "Industry Excellence Award," Rafidah said this year's
emphasis was on both promoting understanding of the requirement
for performance excellence and the need to share information on
the successful business or performance strategies.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, there is also a special award to
encourage manufacturers to reduce imported content in their
products.
</P>
<P>
With Malaysia's trade deficit standing at 9.2 billion ringgit
(about 3.68 billion US dollars) in 1995, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad earlier asked local manufacturers to cut imports and
increase exports.

<HEADLINE> Zamiba's City Councils Urged To Sell Houses At Affordable Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has urged city councils in the country to sell government
houses at affordable prices to sitting tenants, "Zambia Daily
Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the call during his inspection of
council properties in northern city of Ndola yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba regretted that the civic authorities had set
exploitative prices on government houses being offered for sale
to residents.
</P>
<P>
He said councils had failed to sell their houses because they
were overpriced beyond the means of most of the sitting tenants.
</P>
<P>
"Let the people own their houses is part of a government
exercise to empower the people," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the civic authorities should start tapping new sources
of revenue to sustain their operations after the sale of houses.
</P>
<P>
At present, collection of government house rents is one of
major sources of councils' income to support their operations.
</P>
<P>
To sell government houses to sitting tenants is part of the
government reform policy on housing.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today further
eased a three-week closure imposed on the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel
earlier this month, which left more than 60 dead and over 150
wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, basic medical supplies
will be transferred from Israel to Gaza, and flowers will be moved
from Gaza to Israel for packaging.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of Palestinian workers from the Gaza
Strip employed in the Erez industrial zone will also be increased.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Israel eased aspects of the closure as
foodstuffs had been allowed into the Gaza trip, and Palestinians
have been permitted to move freely inside the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 500 Palestinian workers from Gaza, for the
first time in more than three weeks, were allowed to go back to
their jobs in the Erez industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Palestinian goods would also be able to
proceeded under Israeli army's escort from Gaza to the Ashkelon
port for export.
</P>
<P>
A decision will be made in the coming days on whether to permit
the transfer of goods by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip into
Israel, the report added.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Israeli security source said Israel would
consider its stand on the closure only after Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) president, arrests those
responsible for terrorist attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel would continue exerting pressure on
Arafat in order to arrest Mohammed Dief Baith and Hassan
Suleiman, both activists of the Hamas military wing Izzadin
Kassam.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the closure, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres Sunday proposed a 100-million-U.S. dollar international fund
to create jobs for the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Peres told the weekly cabinet meeting of the Israeli
government that the closure would continue indefinitely because
Arafat and the PNA have not yet done enough to combat terror.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, Israel's planned pullback from the West
Bank town of Hebron on March 28 would be delayed indefinitely
until the PNA catches all top Hamas fugitives on the list given to
them by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Apart from continuing the closure, Peres also said that he
favors deporting Palestinians linked to suicide bombers and will
continue blowing up the houses of families of suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli High Court has been asked to allow
Palestinian medical personnel to go back to their jobs in
hospitals in east Jerusalem from the sealed off areas.
</P>
<P>
The petition, submitted by various human rights groups, noted
that three hospitals in east Jerusalem have virtually shut down
because the doctors are unable to cross in due to the closure.
</P>
<P>
The PNA estimates losses from the closure, which has barred
more than 40,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel, at 2 to
3 million U.S. dollars a day from salaries alone, and about the
same in terms of trade.
</P>
<P>
According to a Palestinian Radio report, the joint liaison
committee of donor states will meet twice in Gaza this week to
put together a 40-million-U.S.-dollar employment-generating
program so that Palestinians can weather what is expected to be a
long closure.

<P>
SHENYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, one of China's heavy
industrial centers, has pledged to apply science in the
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
It plans to form seven industrial setups, ranging from grain,
vegetables, fruit, animal husbandry, aquatic production and forest
and local and special products, to export-oriented agriculture, by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Social services in pre-farming supply, agro-techniques and
marketing, are expected to cover 80 percent of the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At least one half of the farm, animal and aquatic products will
be turned into processed goods by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the plan, the province will build 100
processing-transport-marketing enterprises, and 200 farm
production bases.
</P>
<P>
More households and villages will be encouraged to specialize
in certain crop cultivation and livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wencai, deputy governor of the province, said that Liaoning
is a province, with an urban population exceeding its rural
population in size. But, it is now self-sufficient in grain and
non-staple food.

KAMPALA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The National Inter-party
Cooperation (IPC) campaign team today accused the government of
planting its cadres and supporters to disrupt president hopeful
Paul Ssemogrerere's preparation for the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the IPC said the Uganda government

The IPC was reacting to last Saturday's violent incident in
which members of the IPC campaign team were attacked and beaten
by a group of people in Fort Portal town, southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The mob stormed the IPC's consultative meeting at their
offices on Kiboga road and pelted them with rotten tomatoes, eggs
and stones.
</P>
<P>
The situation was saved after police came to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The IPC doubted whether the government has the capacity and
commitment to ensure safe, free and fair elections in Uganda,

<HEADLINE> BBC Reporter Threatened with Death in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Correspondent of the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Ms Anna Borzello based in Gulu,
northern Uganda has received death threat from the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, reported a local daily today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have accused her of "biased reporting" of the
insurgency in the Gulu area.
</P>
<P>
The paper "the New Vision" said, the threat was conveyed to
the BBC "Focus On Africa" editor, Robin White on Thursday by the
rebels' Nairobi-based spokesman, Dominic Wanyama.
</P>
<P>
White rang Borzello in Gulu the same day to inform her of the
threat, said the paper, adding that White warned her to take
extra precautions or pull out of the area altogether.
</P>
<P>
A military source in the government army was quoted by the
paper as saying the army have gathered intelligence report that
the rebels plan to take Borzello hostage to draw international
attention to their cause.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Gulu Resident Minister of State Mrs.
Betty Bigombe as saying two rebel co-ordinators in Gulu Town last
week met rebel commander Alex Otti-Lagony. They discussed the
launching of a political wing as "the next step toward winning
the war" and the intensification of propaganda aimed at
influencing public opinion in favor of the lRA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Bigombe said the rebels could have been angered by Borzello's
reports which did not portray them in good light, but she
believed Borzello has been reporting mostly what she saw.
</P>
<P>
She said the Uganda government would try to raise the Wanyama
issue with the Kenya government soon, because she and her
colleagues know he, living in and operating from Nairobi, has
been to Sudan three times in the last two years to meet Kony,
leader of the LRA and the Sudanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
Wanyama hails from Busia and holds the rank of "Captain"
awarded him by Kony who promoted himself to the rank of Major
General.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Long Journey of Pilgrimage to Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The magnificent Potala Palace and
the shining roofs of the Johkang Monastery looked so near. After
eight months' trudging, the scene was almost too good to be true
for Dungzho Doje.
</P>
<P>
"At long last we're in Lhasa," he said, with tears streaming
down his face.
</P>
<P>
Dungzho Doje, 37, is a lama with the Xiyu Monastery in Chindu
County, Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
He set out on his pilgrimage in July, 1995, together with his
68-year-old mother, Zhouga, and younger sister, Baima Como.
</P>
<P>
The road from Chindu to Lhasa, a holy city for Tibetans, and
the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, is more than 2,000
kilometers long, with an average altitude of 4,500 meters above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
Dungzho Doje said, "Winter on the plateau is bitterly old. The
freezing wind, high mountains and snow storms gave us tremendous
trouble."
</P>
<P>
"However, no difficulty on earth could waver our devotion to
Buddha," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dungzho Doje kowtowed all the way to Lhasa, a way of showing
his piousness to Buddha.
</P>
<P>
When a Tibetan Buddist kowtows, he clasps his hands, raises
them above his head, then lowers them to his chest. He does this
three times before prostrating himself on the ground. Then he
makes a mark with his stretched hands, stands up, walks to the
mark, and kowtows again.
</P>
<P>
"Before leaving for Lhasa I was so fat that a short walk made
me feel breathless," Dungzho Doje said.
</P>
<P>
"But once I made up my mind to pay the pilgrimage, nothing
could stop me," he added
</P>
<P>
Dungzho Doje, the first person in his village to make such a
pilgrimage, developed the idea during his 12 years of service as a
lama.
</P>
<P>
He said his reason of making such a pilgrimage is showing his
devotion to Buddha, as well as getting Buddha's blessings for his
mother and brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
When he first started the journey, he could go only one or two
km a day.
</P>
<P>
"Every day, I was aching all over, as though my back and legs
were all broken," he said. "I wasn't sure at all whether I could
reach Lhasa."
</P>
<P>
But before long, he could go eight km a day.
</P>
<P>
After a day's kowtowing, Dungzho Doje looked no better than a
beggar. Sometimes he was soaked with the snow on the road.
However, he read Buddist scriptures for three hours every night
with the help of a flashlight, no matter how tired he was.
</P>
<P>
While he kowtowed on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, his mother and
sister would lead their donkey to where he would arrive at dusk,
erect their small tent and prepare food.
</P>
<P>
"Without the help of my mother and sister, I could never have
reached Lhasa." Dungzho Doje said.
</P>
<P>
"I also met many kind people on my way," he added. "Many truck
drivers we met gave us food, clothes and money. Some offered to
take messages to our families."
</P>
<P>
After more than eight monthes' trudging, the three pilgrims
arrived at Lhasa on March 4, and were joined by thousands of other
pilgrims from all parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa residents presented the pilgrims with buttered tea and
hadas, silk scarfs regarded as tokens of respect.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we'll do this afternoon is to pay respects to
Buddha," Dungzho Doje said.
</P>
<P>
After paying respect to all the monasteries in Lhasa, he
planned to kowtow his way to Samyai, the oldest Temple in Tibet,
about 100 km south of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"I'll kowtow to Buddha for myself, my family and all the people
who have helped us," he said. "May Buddha bless us all."

<HEADLINE> Economist Calls for Help for Middle and Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China has been urged by a leading
economist to launch a massive drive to open up the country's
hinterland areas.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government must play a key role in the initiative
which would see more railways, roads, power plants and
infrastructure projects across vast areas in central and western
parts of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for the hinterlands has been proposed by the
noted Chinese economist Dr Hu An'gang to spur economic growth in
underdeveloped provinces.
</P>
<P>
"China should gradually pool two thirds of investments for
public projects into the less developed central and western areas,
which are home to two thirds of China's population," said Dr. Hu
An'ang, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"In areas with lower per capita gross domestic production, a
larger proportion of the investment should come from the central
government, as the underdeveloped provinces and autonomous regions
have weaker capability to accumulate capital."
</P>
<P>
Gaps in regional development have been widened in recent
years. Last year Chinese Premier Li Peng said in his government
work report to the National People's Congress that conditions be
created to narrow the gaps in regional disparities in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
In the recently-published "Regional Disparities in China", the
result of a survey on the regional development across the country
over a period of more than two years, Hu suggested that China set
up a fund for constructing railways, highways and
telecommunication facilities in the less developed regions through
issuing treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments should repay the principal of the fund, the
central government should pay interest on the fund, and they
should both buttress the fund with tax revenues at the same time."
</P>
<P>
"Investors should have rights to use and develop land and real
estate properties along the railways and highways," said Hu, who
was educated at America's Yale University.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to arranging preferential loans from
foreign governments and international financial institutions for
the infrastructure projects, and foreign investors should be
allowed and encouraged to take part in these projects through
holding shares in, or raising funds for, these projects."
</P>
<P>
China should build more railways and highways in the central
and western regions, Hu said. "In the next ten years, China should
construct 50,000 km of railways, of which half should be in the
central and western regions."
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that China constructs on a wide scale large
power energy bases and water conservancy projects, and harness
long rivers in the interior areas.

SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Back home from a local park in
downtown Shanghai, where 79-year-old Zhou Guoqing and his
69-year-old wife, Fei Ruilian, have been doing their morning
exercises, the old couple take a relaxing break.
</P>
<P>
Zhou sits beside Fei while she makes a carpet with some old
knitting wool, telling her the latest news he has learned.
</P>
<P>
Close by, hanging on the wall, is the latest addition to their
home, their wedding picture. It was taken just two months ago to
mark their anniversary after many years of wedded bliss.
</P>
<P>
More and more old couples like the Zhou's in Shanghai, China's
biggest city, have been pursuing an easy and romantic way of life,
with improvements in living standards.
</P>
<P>
Today it is quite common to see old couples have their wedding
pictures taken to mark anniversaries of their marriages. They
flock, often hand in hand, to one of the many luxury studios which
have sprung up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to a photographer at one local studio, one-fourth of
his customers wanting wedding pictures are old couples, a sharp
increase from a few years ago when few old couples sought such
pictures.
</P>
<P>
Sending gifts to each other on such occasions as birthdays, or
wedding anniversaries, has also become popular among local old
couples.
</P>
<P>
At many dance halls old couples are found dancing amid young
people during the day.
</P>
<P>
With more spare time and money these couples now are able to
take trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot imagine having such a chance to go abroad before, as
we were busy with our work, and taking care of children," a couple
who have just applied for a 10-day trip to Thailand said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sex, which used to be a taboo in China, has become a
open topic on the local radio station and in classes at
universities for senior citizens, which are well-received among
local old people.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists attribute this change to being aware of new ideas,
noting that it is good for their health.

<HEADLINE> Longest Sub-marine Cable to Link China with World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to be given a new
high-tec link with the rest of the world by forming part of the
world's longest submerged optical cable.
</P>
<P>
The Eurasian optical cable will connect Shanghai, China's
industrial and financial center, to the world's biggest
telecommunications web.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint of the Shanghai section of FLAG, as the cable
system is known, has been unveiled by the Chinese government, said
the Communications Weekly published in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch cable will run into the sea via Nanhui
County, and link to the main trunk cable in the East China Sea, at
a point of 127 degrees and nine minutes east longitude, 280
degrees and 10 minutes north latitude.
</P>
<P>
The 27,000-km-long submarine cable starts at Britain, and heads
eastward, joining the Pacific submarine cable system through a
node in Japan, via a dozen countries and regions, such as Italy,
Spain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, India, Malaysia, Thailand,
Hong Kong, China and Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) technology
which can increase its transmission speed to five Gb/s, the
fastest of the world, the Eurasian optical cable will be the
longest submarine trunk, and the last part to form a world-wide
telecommunications web.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the cable will provide more than 10,000
telephone lines to Shanghai, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-related Taxes in Yantai Grow Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Beach city Yantai, in east China's
Shandong Province, collected a record 309 million yuan in
foreign-related taxes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
One of China's 50 economically most advanced cities, Yantai's
progress in collecting foreign-related tax was possible due to
entrepreneurs from 48 countries and regions which had established
3,034 foreign-funded firms by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that an improved investment
environment has enabled more than 90 percent of the foreign-funded
firms to make profits, laying a basis for the increase in
foreign-related taxes.
</P>
<P>
To take in more foreign-related taxes, Yantai has set up
special organizations in all its districts and counties to provide
better services to foreign-related firms.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has given priority to upgrading
tax-collecting mechanisms in order to raise tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Guangdong, a booming province in south
China, took in over 198 billion yuan in industrial and commercial
taxes over the past five years, with an annual growth rate of 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has topped all provinces in China in collecting
industrial and commercial taxes annually since 1992. Those taxes
broke the 50 billion yuan barrier in 1994 after it expanded by 10
billion yuan annually for three straight years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangdong contributed 46.77 billion yuan in taxes
paid to the central government, up 23.2 percent. Over the past
five years, it has set up a tax collecting-mechanism which is in
line with a market-oriented economy.

<HEADLINE> More Burundi Hutus Flee Into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 hutu
refugees have been fleeing into Tanzania daily since the
beginning of this month due to the crisis in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ngara District Commissioner Brigadier Sylvester Aggrey Hemed
told newsmen on the phone from Ngara in northern Tanzania on
Sunday that he has been receiving between 100 and 150 Burundi
nationals daily during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Tanzania/Burundi border is still closed. On humanitarian
ground we are being forced to allow some Burundi nationals to
cross into Tanzania," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of those seeking to enter Ngara are children,
women who are still breast feeding, aged men and other women. The
horrow stories they narrate to us at border posts make us fail to
send them back," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hemed further said the refugees alleged that Burundi
Government soldiers visited villages and killed people,
particularly members of the Hutu organization named FRODEBU
(Front Pour la Democratic au Burundi).
</P>
<P>
He added the Burundi refugees were kept at Mbuba transit point
before being moved to Keza which is close to the border with
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He noted the fresh refugees would not be sent to the refugees
camp because some believed that the situation back home could
normalize soon. At Mbuba transit point, the refugees are given
relief services.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen Keen to Learn Foreign Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Rushing to an "English corner"
on weekends on a small island off the coast of east China's
Zhejiang Province is a matter of urgency for Yao Aguo and other
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Yao, in fact, is a fisherman, and he and his friends here in
Zhoushan have decided to learn a foreign language and are trying
to practice what they've studied.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign language study is not just a fashion. Foreign
languages can be a useful tool," noted Yao.
</P>
<P>
With the booming fishery business, increasingly local people
are travelling to foreign countries in their work, and
international fishing co-operatives have mushroomed in this
province.
</P>
<P>
So, the villagers, especially the younger fishermen, made up
their minds to learn a foreign language in order to pave the way
for further co-operation with overseas business people.
</P>
<P>
In Zhoushan's Putou District, 27 language programs that were
started by the local government have helped more than 1,000
fishermen learn to speak fluent English.
</P>
<P>
Toting their English text books with them whenever they go, the
fishermen learn the language using self-study methods and by
practising what they've learned in direct contacts with foreign
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Liwei often goes to foreign countries on his fishing
voyages. In explaining his motive for studying a foreign language,
he says, "I want to learn English so as to lay a good foundation
for understanding foreign countries and people, as well as for
business affairs."
</P>
<P>
He has also found that languages are a direct means of
communication in negotiations and exchanges in his work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The building of a new power
station, to ease Beijing's electricity bottleneck, has moved a
stage nearer.
</P>
<P>
The Export and Import Bank of China is expected to arrange 24.6
billion yen (about 234 million US dollars) in loans for the
building of the plant in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The Exim Bank will extend the loans, provided by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, to the Sanhe Power Plant in
Hebei, according to an agreement signed between the bank and the
plant.
</P>
<P>
A key project listed in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) blueprint, the plant will ease the bottleneck effects
in electricity supply in Beijing after it is put into operation.
</P>
<P>
Lei Zuhua, president of the bank, said that the bank "has
introduced loans offered by governments in Japan, Germany,
Finland, Australia, Denmark, Kuwait, Norway, the Netherlands, and
Austria, as well as the North Europe Investment Bank into China."
</P>
<P>
To date, the bank has transferred 2.3 billion US dollars in
such loans to 68 projects in electricity, railway, ports, urban
infrastructure, posts and telecommunications, agriculture, and
forestry, and nearly 40 percent of the loans has gone into
electricity-related projects.

<HEADLINE> Expert Warns of More Shark Attacks in HK Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The fatal shark attacks in
waters around Sai Kung which caused the deaths of three people in
June last year could happen again this year, an Australian expert
warned yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Vic Hislop, a veteran great shark hunter, also accused the HK
authorities of failing to act and prevent such attacks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Hong Kong newspaper Eastern Express
yesterday, Hislop said that further complacency could lead to more
deaths in the coming months, as the South China Sea warms and
sharks migrate towards Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hislop believes the same great white shark that was responsible
for the deaths will return and the best solution of the matter is
to kill the shark.
</P>
<P>
After a summer season featuring shark attack fears, the Urban
Council awarded last November two contracts worth about 40 million
HK dollars to fence off waters at 11 beaches in the area.
</P>
<P>
Armed police were sent out in patrol boats with orders to kill
the killer shark or sharks. Some of the beaches have nets in
place to keep the sharks away from the bathers.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's fatal attacks, the Regional Council
called for nets to be installed at all Hong Kong beaches.

<HEADLINE> Israel Closes Down 2 Suspected Hamas Financial Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel has closed down two
suspected Hamas financial bases -- the Holy Land Fund in
Jerusalem and the Islamic Relief Committee in Nazareth -- as part
of the continuing crackdown on the Islamic extremist organization.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli reports, the Israeli police and army made
the move against the two institutions on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The police confiscated documents from the Holy Land Fund,
which investigators hope will allow them to locate the exact
sources of Hamas funding.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is demanding foreign governments close
down those sources, which are believed to come from the United
States and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Holy Land Fund, located in Beit Hanina neighborhood, is
the second Hamas-affiliated organization shut down in Jerusalem
since the Dizengoff bombing on March 4. Police sources said more
Hamas-affiliated groups in the city also face closure soon.
</P>
<P>
The closure was for 14 days, but the Israeli army would also
consider shutting down the office for one year. The Holy Land
Fund directors were given 96 hours to appeal the closure.
</P>
<P>
In Nazareth, the police confiscated thousands of shekels in
cash as well as hundreds of checks, documents, fax machines,
computers and other office equipment.
</P>
<P>
The measure was taken in accordance with orders issued by
Defense Minister Shimon Peres and Head of Northern Command of the
Israeli army, Amiram Levine.
</P>
<P>
The raid followed investigations lasting over a year into the

<HEADLINE> Feature: Islamabad Residents Plagued by Pollen (By Hu Xiaoming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Ambreen Khalid, the 24-year-old
daughter of a Pakistani businessman, died in Islamabad last
Thursday night after being attacked by asthma caused by pollen
allergy.
</P>
<P>
On the same night, 360 people with pollen allergy syndromes
reported at the city's Pakistan Institute of Medical Science
(PIMS) alone, which had to declare a state of emergency to deal
with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people have reportedly died of pollen allergy so
far in the worst outbreak of this yearly scourge in the Pakistani
capital, where beautiful flowers in the full spring are making a
curse of life to the residents.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of pollen allergy patients, complaining of running
nose, sneezing, itchiness in the eyes, cough, skin irritation and
asthma attacks, are visiting hospitals for treatment on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, doctors are not able to prescribe any wonder
drug to soothe the suffering of patients.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot do much to stop these allergies when the patients
come at the peak of the spring. By this time, the allergy has
already developed and there is no set way to cure it," said Dr.
Yawar Qazi, a chest specialist at the PIMS.
</P>
<P>
"Patients should take preventive measures well before spring
sets in," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The preventative measures suggested by doctors include using
air filters, wearing face masks, closing windows and doors tightly
and having enough rest.
</P>
<P>
On the advice of doctors, some patients have left Islamabad and
its adjoining areas to flee from the menace.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that their recovery is astonishing once they are
out of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
A test camp will be set up Thursday at the National Institute
of Health in the capital and offer free tests on 20 allergies.
</P>
<P>
The pollen comes mainly from the paper mulberry tree, which was
introduced from the Philippines in the 1980s, according to local
press reports.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Capital Development Authority said allergy is
also caused by weeds, shrubs, plants, ornamental flowers and other
plant families like Cyperaceae.
</P>
<P>
The greenery around the capital helps pollen to spread while
rains aggravate pollen allergy because of a higher humidity level,
said the officials.

<HEADLINE> Pilgrimages to Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The cold winds from the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau sweeps the grasslands in the northern part
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, reminding the herdsmen that the
pilgrimage season has arrived.
</P>
<P>
The herdsmen, finishing their work for the year, set out with
their whole families for Lhasa, their holy land.
</P>
<P>
The traditional winter pilgrimage starts in November and
usually lasts until March. The deciding factor for the return to
the grasslands is a special date on the Tibetan calendar.
</P>
<P>
Braving the freezing wind and snow, pilgrims from every corner
of Tibet trudge all the way from their homes to Lhasa, the
cultural, political and religious center of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Potala Palace, the largest temple and the holy palace in
Tibet, receives about 10,000 pilgrims everyday in winter.
</P>
<P>
These people, holding butter lamps, and swinging their prayer
wheels, wait patiently in line for their turn to pay their
respects to every hall and figure of Buddha in the palace.
</P>
<P>
Tradition requires that Tibetans make at least two visits to
the Potala Palace during their lifetime, making and redeeming
their vows to Buddha. Those who can afford it are expected to pay
their respect to the palace every winter.
</P>
<P>
The Johkang Monastery, in the center of Lhasa, and Gandain,
Sera and Zhebung monasteries, all located in the suburbs of the
city, are also places not to be missed by the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Their hearts and minds blessed and in peace, the pilgrims,
return to their hometowns at the end of the pilgrimage season and
start preparing for another year's hard work.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Trans-century Goal to Succeed -- Editorials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- a number of the Hong Kong-based
newspapers today carried editorials hailing the successful
conclusion of the annual sessions of China's top legislature and
advisory body, noting that China's trans-century goal will
succeed.
</P>
<P>
The editorials stressed that the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) and the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) that ended in Beijing on March 17
and 13 respectively will promote China's reforms and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Wen Wei Po" said in its editorial that the Outline of China's
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and Social
Development and Long-Range Goals for the Year 2010 approved at the
current NPC session will serve as a guideline for China's overall
development, adding that it will produce significant effects on
China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
It said that the outline also provides an opportunity for Hong
Kong's development and that China's steady economic growth will
surely benefit Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, "Ta Kung Pao" said that the outline will lead
China to be a vigorous and powerful country in the next century,
which will contribute to the world peace and human progress.
</P>
<P>
It noted that during the ninth five-year plan period, the value
of China's external trade will exceed 1,700 billion US
dollars. Of the total, quite a large proportion will be managed
through Hong Kong, which will add to Hong Kong's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It said that with the approaching of 1997, the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
accelerating its work and most of the Hong Kong people are
dedicating their efforts to Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily devoted two pages to the closing
of the NPC and CPPCC sessions, saying that the sessions have set
an important guideline for China's future development.
</P>
<P>
Its editorial noted that in the next century China will be
stronger and the Chinese people will be wealthier. " China will
play a more important role in world affairs," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, the editorials of the three newspapers
pointed out that after Hong Kong and Macao return to the
motherland within this century, the settlement of the Taiwan issue
will be a concern to all the Chinese people both at home and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
They condemned the splitting tendencies pursued by the Taiwan
Authorities and other factions, and warned the splittists in
Taiwan not to go too far in their games.
</P>
<P>
The editorials said that Lee Tung-hui's games on "two Chinas",
"one China, one Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence" are against the
historical trend and will be doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> 11 Billion Yuan Investment in Jilin's Telecom Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 11 billion yuan is to
be invested in telecommunications in northeast China's Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
The investment over the next five years almost doubles the
total spent during the past five years, and will add over two
million new telephone lines to the province's exchange
capacity. Long-distance optic cables, with a combined length of
1,860 km, will also be added to Jilin's telecommunications
infrastructure, according to the "Communications Weekly".
</P>
<P>
State-of-the-art technical developments will also be adopted,
including a system to digitalize phone switching and transmission,
in countryside areas.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the telephone density of the province will
increase to 13.6 telephones per 100 persons, compared with the
current 6.2 sets per 100 people. The density will be even higher
in urban areas, reaching 35 sets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mobile telecommunications will cover all the
province's transportation trunks and major townships, with the
walkie-talkie density in urban areas reaching 2-3 sets per 100
persons.
</P>
<P>
Yang Liansui, administrator of the province's posts and
telecommunications bureau, said that the smooth achievement of the
targets will largely depend on a sustained increase in the state's
investment, as well as further extending bank loans and overseas
capital.
</P>
<P>
He added that the province is willing to raise loans from
foreign governments, if necessary, to ensure sufficient financial
support.
</P>
<P>
The province's investment in telecommunications will climb to
22.5 billion yuan in the first decade of the 21st century, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> More Flood Relief Projects in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Forty reservoirs are earmarked for
east China's Fujian Province as part of a province-wide flood
control system.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reservoirs will have a total storage capacity of
1.78 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
More water storage reservoirs will also be constructed in dry
areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
The plans form part of Fujian's proposals for the Ninth Five
Year Plan Period between now and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province has built a flood forecast system on the Minjiang
River. The system has already forecast many floods, and prevented
serious disasters from occuring since it became operational in
April of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian invested 160 million yuan in consolidating 400
kilometers of sea embankments in 1995, exceeding the annual target
by 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 1,000 kilometer-strong "coast great wall" to contain high sea
tides is expected to be completed this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work to build flood control walls along the lower
reaches of the Minjiang River, Jinjiang River and Jiulong River is
going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Fujian started construction of 93 water storage projects and
completed 28 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 210
million cubic meters last year
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province's 56 counties and cities, where floods
often occur, have mapped out plans on flood control. Twenty-five
of them have started construction of flood control projects.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi on Three Express Freight Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The three express freight trains
supplying Hong Kong and Macao with fresh and frozen foods and
livestock have run more than 36,000 times since the service
started 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics say that the total one-way distance has
amounted to 52.47 million kilometres, equal to more than 1,300
around the equator.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great achievement and miracle in China's railway
transport and foreign trade history," said Wu Yi, Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, in an interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The three express freight trains, starting from Shanghai,
Zhengzhou and Wuhan, have carried more than 85 million pigs, five
million head of cattle, one million tons of frozen foods, and a
large amount of eggs, fresh fish and vegetables in the past 34
years.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the three express freight train services started
in 1962, with the support of Premier Zhou Enlai, to meet the
demands of the Hong Kong and Macao compatriots for fresh foods.
</P>
<P>
She said that the service has never been interrupted, even in
the years of natural disasters, Culture Revolution period, heavy
railway transport periods, or when the floods, bridge collapses
and landslides happened en route.
</P>
<P>
"This act fully shows the kindred feelings between the Chinese
government and people and the Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and
it is also very important to maintain the social stability in the
two regions and ensure the economic prosperity there," she pledged.
</P>
<P>
The railway departments now have a large number of special
freight trains for transporting livestock and frozen food, while
also giving priority to the food trains.
</P>
<P>
More than seven thousand people in the mainland are engaged on
the transport service, escorting the goods, and 12 service stops
have been established en route, providing water, ice and a
maintenance service.
</P>
<P>
Some local departments have also set up bases to raise
livestock, while increasing the proportion of fine breed pigs and
cattle in a bid to ensure the quality of the goods shipped to Hong
Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the central government has attached great
importance to the three express freight trains. Chinese leaders Li
Peng, Qiao Shi and Li Lanqing all gave important instructions and
wrote inscriptions on the task, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec)
has established a special office, responsible for giving
instructions to the whole process of the work, including giving
quotas, organizing the supply of goods, ensuring transport and
market sales.
</P>
<P>
She promised that the Moftec will, as always, cooperate with
the railway departments, and accomplish the supplies to Hong Kong
and Macao in accordance with the principle of "good quality,
proper quantity, balance and promptness".
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the service of the three express freight
trains will change after Hong Kong returns to the motherland in
1997, she said that the service is by no means an expedient
measure, adding that as the return of Hong Kong and Macao is
approaching, the work is sure to be enhanced and further
improved.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi to Expand Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
will take measures to boost its foreign trade sector in the next
15 years, governor of Shanxi Sun Wensheng has stated.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi plans to maintain a faster growth rate in foreign trade
than the national level during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), Sun said at a provincial conference on foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked province is currently maintaining the fastest
growth rate in foreign trade business among 18 provinces and
autonomous regions in central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"We'll take more practical measures to expand imports and
exports," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
More economic departments, as well as local cities and
counties, will be authorized to directly engage in business with
overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes of coal, one of the major export commodities of
Shanxi, is expected to be worth 2.3 billion US dollars in the year
2000 if the province sells more coal after accomplishing a
State-planned export quota.
</P>
<P>
The province has chosen 100 well-operated large and
medium-sized State-owned enterprises and 100 township enterprises,
to substantially increase their import and export volumes in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi will also improve the investment environment, by
publishing more preferential policies for foreign investors, and
upgrading road, air and telecommunication facilities, Sun
said.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Free judicial services are being
provided for the needy under the first legal-aid system set up in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Rongxian County Attorney Legal-Aid Center will assist poor
residents and enterprises facing court cases in taking up
lawsuits, -- free of charge, according to the Provincial Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
More centers of this kind are to be established across the
province in the near future, officials of the department told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is not the first province in China that has set up
legal-aid centers. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Zhengzhou
established similar centers last year.
</P>
<P>
Seen as way of reforming the attorney's role, and enhancing
their social responsibility, the legal-aid system was launched in
late 1994 by the Ministry of Justice, with the aim of aiding those
unable to pay for legal services to defend themselves against
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The Rongxian county center will establish a special legal aid
fund to provide legal remedies for the lawyers involved in such
cases.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Plan for International Stardom as Tourist Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen, one of China's top-ten
holiday destinations, has drawn up a ten year plan to attract more
tourists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The city, in east China's Fujian Province, is determined to
become known as an international scenic port city, said mayor Hong
Yongshi.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-to-ten year plan the number of overseas tourists
to the city will increase up to 20 percent a year in the next five
years. It will mean between 400,000 and 630,000 foreigners
visiting the city each year by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the number of domestic tourists will grow
at an annual rate of 10 to 15 percent, attracting between 6.23 and
7.78 million people a year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the century's end, the city is expected to earn almost six
billion yuan a year from tourism, the plan says.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate will be slowing in the early years of the 21st
century, the plan predicts.
</P>
<P>
It estimates an annual rate of eight to 10 percent, which means
that by the year 2010, the city will be receiving 880,000 to 1.9
million overseas tourists and 13 to 20 million domestic tourists a
year, with a total tourism revenue of 17 billion to 36 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
A top-10 tourist city of China, Xiamen has welcomed 1.2 million
overseas and 16 million home tourists in the last five years. Its
foreign currency income from tourism has totalled 2.3 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
With its rich natural attractions and varied culture heritage,
its brisk trade and overseas investment, and its developed tourism
facilities, Xiamen is determined to advance its position in the
national tourism industry. Its Mayor Hong Yongshi said Xiamen will
be built into a "scenic international port city".

<HEADLINE> Aerial Sowing Vital to Gansu's Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Forestry officials looked to the
sky in more ways than one when they embarked on a massive
tree-planting drive.
</P>
<P>
They decided that aerial sowing was an important alternative to
traditional planting in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
But they made the trees-from-the-sky program even more
efficient by liasing with weather experts and air force officials.
</P>
<P>
It helped them work out the best time - and the best weather
conditions - for their aerial sowing expeditions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 16 years, the province has afforested an area
approaching a million hectares by aerial sowing, turning large
tracts of barren hills into luxurious forests.
</P>
<P>
To increase the survival rate of the trees planted by this
means, local forestry departments intensified co-operation with
meteorological departments and air forces.
</P>
<P>
After carrying out a number of experiments to choose the best
sowing time, sowing amounts, sowing places and varieties of seeds,
the province now reduced the cost of aerial sowing to 7.2 yuan
(about 87 cents) per mu, only one third of the cost by artificial
planting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various departments have set up over 30 centers
across the province to manage, and protect the growth of trees.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province was stricken by its worst drought in 60
years, but the germination percentage in the sown area still met
the ministry-set levels.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan-funded Enterprises Growing in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Large amounts of Taiwan funds
have poured into east China's Zhejiang province, making it one of
the hottest destinations for investors from across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The province now ranks in a high spot, behind Guangdong,
Fujian, Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai along the east coast of
China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office show that
by the end of last year, 2,400 Taiwan-funded enterprises had been
approved for operation by local governments, involving a total
investment of 4.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a strong sign of improvements in the scale and quality of
investments, long-term, massive projects, each involving huge
amounts of money, have gradually taken the place of small-scale
firms. Now, 20 out of the top hundred enterprises in Taiwan have
established branches in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province has approved 60 large-scale Taiwan-funded
projects with each involving an investment of at least 10 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another new trend is that Taiwan investors are making
additional investments, to expand profitable projects they have
run on the mainland. In 1995 alone, over 100 million US dollars
were invested to this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flow of funds have diversified, from traditional
trades like clothing and services, to sectors like energy,
communications, and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the surge of Taiwan funds in Zhejiang to an
improved investment environment.

Amour has declared his government will never hold dialogue with
the Civic United Front (CUF), reports from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Amour was quoted by reports from Zanzibar yesterday as
saying, "We shall not have dialogue with CUF because they don't
love peace and unity."

<P>
He said this when addressing a huge public rally in Zanzibar.
</P>

The president insisted that there is no person in or out of
Tanzania to force the government to have dialogue with the
opposition.

He said there are external forces using the opposition as
camouflage to recapture Zanzibar, adding that these forces won't
succeed since the government is on the alert.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Pemba is part of Zanzibar and will never break
away under any circumstances. "We will make sure the twin islands
of Pemba and Zanzibar remain one thing forever. The government
will not tolerate any person wanting to split the two islands",
he said.
</P>
<P>
He declared the Isles House of Representatives will continue
to carry out their duties despite the absence of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The president asked magistrates in the Isles to execute their
responsibility fairly and dispense justice regardless of one's
political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Amour said the government will strive to restore accountability
in the civil service, adding that any worker who does not want to
respect regulations should better resign.
</P>
<P>
In his speech broadcast live by Radio Tanzania Zanzibar,
President Amour reiterated that there is no need to form a
government of national unity in the Isles.

percent and 22.3 percent over the corresponding period last year.

assets during the past two months, an increase of seven percent on

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Laud EA Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians have lauded
the newly-founded East African Cooperation saying it was an
important historic step towards achieving African economic
independence, a local paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a cross-section interview with Dar es Salaam residents
here in past few days, the people felt that the re-activation of
the East African Cooperation should go further and put in place
independent institutions that would stand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Party for Democracy and Progress
(CHADEMA), Edwin Mtei said, "Although they did not care to invite
me as former East African Community Secetary-General, I am
encouraged that the East African Cooperation has been possible to
build something that will be tangible for East Africans".
</P>
<P>
While agreeing that the East African Community cannot be
re-activated, Mtei said the East African heads of state should do
whatever is practicable to resuscitate some of the common
services such as railways, marine services in Lake Victoria and
post and telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mtei also called for relaxation of border restrictions and
liberalization of currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
He urged Tanzanians to produce goods that would sell in East
Africa#,saying, "We should be able to produce quality goods at
competitive prices. What will save us is efficiency and not a
common market".
</P>
<P>
Mtei added as former secretary-general, he would like the
East African Cooperation to bear tangible results.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the National Convention for Construction
and Reform (NCCR-Mageuzi), Anthony Komu said cooperation in any
form was a welcome move among East Africans, adding that the East
African leaders should create independent institutions that can
be able to withstand pressures from heads of state on personal
interests.
</P>
<P>
He asked the East African presidents -- Benjamin Mkapa of
Tanzania, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Daniel arap Moi of Kenya
to be open, daring and foresighted if the cooperation is to bear
any positive fruits.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, "Personal differences among East African
leaders led to the demise of the then East African Community. The
present leadership should not allow these to override East
African interests".
</P>
<P>
A Dar es Salaam trader, Abdallah Juma, said East Africans
should be able to move from one country to another with the
minimum of inconveniences from customs and immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped for the harmonization of customs duty so as to
discourgae what he called "black transactions".
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Smuggling can be killed if the three states
agree on common customs and tariffs as is the case with the
European Community".

<HEADLINE> China's First Museum of Rare Stones from Northern Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- With black eyes and a pink mouth,
a chick crouches in a white eggshell -- the object is a rare and
precious stone.
</P>
<P>
It is a natural art treasure, according to owner Zhang
Jing, an old man in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businessmen offered one million US dollars for the
piece of agate, but Zhang refused it. It is now safely kept in the
Construction Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
China has another artificial agate chicken in the Palace
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Zhang brought thousands of precious stones,
collected in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's desert, to
Beijing, and set up a museum in the capital to display the natural
arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
The old man said "The stones collected from the desert
enthralled me because of their solid nature, rich color and unique
style."
</P>
<P>
More than 800 stones, including crystal, agate, jasper,
chalcedony and opal form Zhang's collection. Some are in the shape
of human beings, animals and flowers, and the largest weighes 350
kg.
</P>
<P>
These rare stones are silicide, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang collected money to set up a company in Xiamen, a city in
southeast China's Fujian province in 1986, to export jade
decorations and stone carvings.
</P>
<P>
Hard work and difficult conditions are blamed for the cancer he
suffered in 1990. After an operation, he continued exerting
himself to develop the culture of the stones.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was invited to visit a Singapore museum featuring unique
stones in 1993. After his return, he had a desire to set up a
similar museum in China.
</P>
<P>
"These natural arts and crafts are an important part of
culture," the old man said, adding, "I hope to spread the unique
culture in China, even across the world."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Restricts Level of Petrol Aromatics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
imposed restriction on the level of aromatics in the controversial
new unleaded petrol, known as Octane 96.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Doug Kidd today announced that the maximum
level of aromatics in the new petrol should be 50 percent while
oil companies must lower that level to 48 percent in one month.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after oil companies found that petrol in
some of their storage tanks contained as much as 56 percent of
aromatics.
</P>
<P>
The high level of aromatics in the new fuel is blamed for
eroding some rubber components in old cars and causing car fires
in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The oil companies said they were sending special deliveries of
petrol with the aromatics level below 50 percent to service
stations to replace the fuel containing a high level of aromatics.

DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's food situation,
already hard hit by production shortfall, may further deteriorate
as the US government has expressed its inability to provide more
food aid to this country, the local press said today.

COLOMBO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has accepted the challenge of opposition leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe for a live television debate on the Tawakkal case,
according to a news release here today.
</P>
<P>
The parliament itself will also start a three-day debate
Tuesday on the issue -- the purchase of the shares of Sri Lanka's
Puttalam Cement Corporation by the foreign-owned Tawakkal Group
Companies.
</P>

The president pointed out that the present government had to
rectify improper practices of the previous administration and
address the issue of corruption that had taken place.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that neither the government nor any individual
cabinet minister had taken any kickbacks or bribes from the
Thawakkal Group Companies.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the opposition leader to stand by his offer
for the live television debate without trying to sneak away again
by finding some excuses as he had done in the past.

<HEADLINE> 35,000 More Vietnamese Boat People to Be Sent Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- About 35,000 more Vietnamese boat
people in Hong Kong, Japan and southeastern Asian countries will
be repatriated home, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Dinh The Lap, deputy director of the Department for Refugees
and Repatriation of the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and
Social Affairs (MOLISA), said that the repatriation would be
conducted with the assistance from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and Repatriation (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
There was in the mid-1980s an exodus of people who fled the
country by boats to Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia and other places
in the region, and their illegal departures "caused big problems"
to where they went and to the international community, Dinh said.
</P>
<P>
Most of these refugees left the country for "economic reasons,"
because they were fishermen and peasants living in coastal areas,
and handicraft-men and small traders in urban areas who lived a
hard life when the country was beset with economic difficulties in
the early 1980's, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1988, with the help of some international
organizations, the Vietnamese government launched a program for
voluntary repatriation of the boat people. The Interior Ministry,
Foreign Affairs Ministry, provincial and municipal people's
committees and the MOLISA were asked to get involved in the
program.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted a lenient policy toward the returnees,
promising not to punish them for their illegal departures but to
provide them with assistance that would help stabilize their life
in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some 77,000 boat people have returned from refugee
camps abroad and returned to normal life in their home country.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Enforces Mass Curfew in Bangladeshi Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition parties
have decided to start a "mass curfew" today in the country's
largest port of Chittagong, where the government had deployed navy
forces to try to restore its operation Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Sunday at a meeting of the port city's
All-Party Action Committee presided over by Chittagong Mayor and
opposition leader A.B.M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
The committee resolved to scale up the opposition's current
"non-cooperation" campaign against the government to press for the
cancellation of the February 15 parliamentary polls and fresh
elections under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
It sought the solidarity of all those concerned with the port
and urged them not to cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Chittagong port, the country's largest
commercial lifeline, still remained almost paralyzed by the
opposition's strike-like campaign despite the deployment of the
navy forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an official release said shipping services at the port
had returned to normal Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Law Makers From EU, Central, East Europe End Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians from the European
Union and central and east European countries ended their meeting
here today after discussing the role of parliaments in European
integration and the EU's extension to eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
During their three-day meeting, many representatives demanded
that the parliaments of the EU member countries get involved in
the EU summit to be held in Turin, Italy, on March 29. The summit
will discuss and amend the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
President of the European Parliament Klaus Hansch also asked
those parliaments to send observers to the summit.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Austrian National Council President Heinz
Fischer spoke against European integration by some countries
first. "We must prevent the EU member countries from being divided
into different ranks," he said. The structural reform in the EU
should not harm the rights of small countries.
</P>
<P>
On the EU's extension to the east, Fischer said the EU does not
have the capability to accept east European countries whose
political and economic conditions are not qualified for the EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hansch and Fischer announced a joint
statement, stressing that the Turin summit would be a milestone in
the EU and European development and its task would be to create
conditions for the EU's eastern extension.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five parliamentarians from the EU, central and east
European countries attended the meeting.

<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
stressed today that the European Union (EU) must undergo reforms
before its possible eastern expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a TV interview, Juppe said only a united Europe can
maintain its strength and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the EU summit scheduled for March 29 in
Turin, Italy, should discuss how to manage the 15-member union
smoothly and establish new common mechanisms on a single currency,
joint defense and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Some east European countries, especially Germany's neighbors,
have asked for EU membership. But France, worried that their entry
will lead to a more powerful Germany, is reluctant to accept them
as new companions.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic economy, the prime minister, who had proclaimed
"spring is coming" two days before, insisted that he can see the
first signs of recovery. "I promise that there are positive
signs," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
In particular he pointed to a fall in interest rates, a
reduction in long-term unemployment, boosted consumer spending and
a fresh enthusiasm among investors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who told the audience that he does not want
to be "a weather forecaster," predicted that France and Germany
will have seen a favorable turn in their economies by the end of
1996.

BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Justice Ministry is
proposing posting legal advisers abroad to protect Thai overseas
workers in the wake of the execution of five Thai workers in
Singapore last week on charges of murder and robbery.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Chalerm Yubamrung said Sunday he would submit
a proposal Tuesday to Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa for
posting legal advisers to those countries or regions where there
are significant numbers of Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
Chalerm is scheduled to meet Singaporean diplomats in Bangkok
Tuesday on the issue of four other Thais on death row in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Thai workers have no access to immediate legal advice
when they have legal problems while most court cases are almost
over before they reach the Thai government, said Chalerm.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is now under fire for paying scant
attention to the plight of Thais working aboard.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communist Party Leader Outlines Election Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov set out his election program Sunday, offering not
to restore the Soviet Union by force, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his program for running for the presidency, Zyuganov,
51, stressed that he favors the resolutions approved by the State
Duma (the lower house of Parliament) Friday that denounced the
1991 accords that led to the dissolution of the former Soviet
Union. But, he said, this does not mean that "tomorrow someone will
forcibly annex anyone's territory or encroach on anyone's
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He said that all necessary measures would be taken for a
voluntary restoration of all contacts between Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus and Kazakhstan -- the "big four" among the 12 members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Three other former
Soviet republics, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia have refused to join the CIS.
</P>
<P>
The Party leader also offered to bring an end to the
15-month-long war in the breakaway Chechnya and prevent fresh
military conflicts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He promised to "guarantee the right of all citizens to work,
rest, housing and free education" if he wins the June 16
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he offered "to bring wages, salaries, pensions and
student grants into line with real subsistence minimum" and "to
make up for savings lost by the depositors as a result of the
so-called reforms." He also promised to work for family, mother
and child welfare and secure a radical change in the position of
women in society.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov announced an intention to uphold the interests of
the home producers at enterprises of all forms of ownership and
take urgent measures and apply a state regulation of the economy
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He promised to save the country's scientific, technical and
cultural potential and give state support to high-tech plants in
the defense sector.
</P>
<P>
His program contains a promise to strengthen the financial
system, ensure the stability of the rouble, establish state
monopoly on foreign trade in natural resources and strategic
commodities. He recognized the multi-structural character of the
economy, with the state retaining the management of strategically
important sectors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, measures will be taken to fight corruption in the
state apparatus.
</P>
<P>
As for his foreign policy, Zyuganov noted it will be "an active
one." "We shall not stop short of terminating inequitable
treaties which infringe upon the interests" of Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Rutskoi, Russia's former Vice-President and leader
of the "Derzhava" (Great Power) national-patriotic movement,
today announced his support for the candidacy of Zyuganov as a
single candidate from the national-patriotic forces.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov, who is the presidential candidate from a so-called
"bloc of national-patriotic forces" with his Communist Party as
the main force, has been regarded here as the most strong rival
for President Boris Yeltsin, who has decided to run for a second
term of office in order to safeguard the ongoing reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Michael Chang of
the United States captured his second career Champions Cup title
by beating Paul Harrhuis of the Netherlands 7-5, 6-1, 6-1 Sunday
in the final of the 1.95 million U.S. dollars Champions Cup in
Indian Wells, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who ousted world number three and third seed Andre
Agassi in the quarter-finals, needed just an hour and 52 minutes
to wrap up the best-of-five-set contest.
</P>
<P>
He earned 320,000 dollars for the victory in the first of the
ATP Tour's "Super 9" events of the year.
</P>
<P>
Haarhuis had beaten three top-10 players to reach the final,
including world number-two and top seed Pete Sampras, the two-time
defending champion who fell in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals he beat sixth-seeded Croatian Goran
Ivanisevic, winner of four tournaments this year, and he beat
number nine Thomas Enqvist of Sweden in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Chang stretched his career record against Haarhuis to 5-1. With
the win he will move ahead of Germany's Boris Becker, a
second-round loser, to number four in the world rankings.

<P>
XI'AN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province, site of the
2,200-year-old terra-cotta warriors and the tombs of 73 emperors,
is relying for its long-term prosperity on applied science and
technology, not just tourism, "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
"As a major high-tech base Shaanxi developed China's first
planes, rockets, colour TV tubes and integrated circuits," said
Governor Cheng Andong.
</P>
<P>
The province has over 1,000 research institutes, 56
universities and a high-powered labour pool including 820,000
professionals, giving it a research strength second only to that
found in Beijing and Shanghai, he said.
</P>
<P>
An industrial development belt is emerging between the
provincial capital of Xi'an and Baoji, about 300 kilometres to its
west.
</P>
<P>
Cheng predicted that five years from now, 10 group
companies--contributing 50 billion yuan(6.02 billion US dollars)
in added industrial value and five billion yuan taxes
annually--will have taken shape there.
</P>
<P>
One high-tech focus will be the province's drought-stricken
agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
This northwestern province is considering co-operating with the
Ministry of Water Resources to carry out a water-diversion project.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to turn 1.33 million hectares of dry
farm land into irrigated land and to relieve the shortage of
drinking water in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration farm, Yangling High-tech Agricultural
Development Zone, which is scheduled to cover 20 sq km, is being
created along the Xi'an-Baoji industrial development belt.
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery and excavation of the terra-cotta warriors
in the 1970s, tourism has remained one of Shaanxi's pillar
industries.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Steps Up Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is expected to launch 10
environmental protection projects this year in a bid to control
dust discharge, air and noise pollution, and protect underground
and surface water resources.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 dust discharge in the Shijingshan District,
where many large industrial plants are situated, will be cut by
5,500 tons, the national English-language newspaper China Daily
reports today.
</P>
<P>
"Around 15 factories and workshops causing serious air, water
or noise pollution will be ordered to stop production or move out
of the urban area by December 31," the paper quoted an assistant
mayor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 sources of heavy industrial pollution will be
cleaned up or relocated within specific time limits in 1996, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 factories and workshops have left the capital
city since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Safe disposal of solid wastes will be enhanced, and the
suburban area controlled by noise pollution measures will be
expanded by 15 sq.km.
</P>
<P>
He said "controlling the discharge of pollutants is one of the
most important tasks for the municipal government in the next five
years".

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's major observatories have
set up a coordination group in Shanghai to jointly observe the
Hale-Bopp comet as it approaches the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The coordination group, consisting of the Shanghai, Yunnan,
Purple Mountain and Beijing Observatories, and the Chinese
University of Science and Technology, will use over a dozen
telescopes to observe the comet, which has a cycle of some 4,200
years.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third time observatories have launched joint
observation exercises in China. Sky-watchers worked together to
observe Haley's Comet and the crash between Shoemaker-Levy and
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
Hale-Bopp will keep a distance of 150 million km from the Earth
when it reaches the perigee, and will have no direct influence on
the latter, according to researchers of the Shanghai Observatory.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Shanghai and Yunnan Observatories have shot
several useful pictures of the approaching Hale-Bopp comet.

<P>
London, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Diane Modahl is sueing the British
Athletic Federation for 480,000 pounds (750,000 U.S. dollars)
compensation over her drugs case, the federation's annual meeting
was told in Birmingham this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The figure was disclosed by treasurer John Lister, who said
that 195,000 pounds (300,000 dollars) had already been spent on
the case.
</P>
<P>
Modahl, an 800 meters specialist, was banned for four years by
the federation's disciplinary hearing after testing positive in
Lisbon in 1994, then cleared by an appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
She is claiming for legal and scientific fees and loss of
earnings while suspended.
</P>
<P>
Next weekend, the International Amateur Athletic Federation
will decide whether to accept the panel's verdict or refer the
case to arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Expressways to Link Changchun with Other Jilin Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Four express highways are
expected to become the roadway to economic expansion in northeast
China's Jilin province.
</P>
<P>
Provincial capital, Changchun, will become the hub of the new
network of major arteries, giving the whole area a real shot in
the arm.
</P>
<P>
Jilin's first super-highway, from Changchun to Siping, is
scheduled for opening in October. The three others, including two
expressways linking Changchun with the cities of Jilin and
Yingcheng, and the Changchun express ringroad, are projected for
completion next year, the provincial communications department
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With upgraded rail transport, the province has shifted its
transport-construction aims to road building in the past few
years, bringing a boom for expressway development.
</P>
<P>
The four expressways, which will cost an estimated 6.4 billion
yuan, stretch for 337 km, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun-Siping expressway is already 70 per cent finished
after work started in 1994, and was originally earmarked for
completion in 1999, thanks to the use of loans totalling 126
million US dollars from the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, investment has been promised this year for
Changchun's ring expressway and the super-highway to
Yingcheng.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soccer Players on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of soccer-mad Italians
were deprived of their favorite sport Sunday as the country's
highly paid professional soccer players staged their first ever
strike.
</P>
<P>
The players announced the strike last week to press for a
greater say in the running of their sport, the immediate abolition
of transfer fees and the creation of a solidarity fund for players
in financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Many unhappy fans were forced to spend the day indoors with
their families by a combination of bad weather and the absence of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
The organization said Sunday's strike was a "clear
demonstration of bad management" in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Serie A clubs devoted the day to training, with Ac
Milan preparing for its Uefa Cup quarterfinal against Bordeaux
Tuesday and Juventus for a Champions' Cup clash against Real
Madrid Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the strike will cost the Italian Olympic
Committee, which finances other sports from official gambling on
the soccer results, around d40 million in lost earnings but the
money should be made up when the day's matches are rescheduled at
the end of the season.

BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislative body, concluded its annual plenary session yesterday
by adopting a blueprint for the nation's development through the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, described the
Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the Long-Term
Target for the Year 2010, --endorsed by the Fourth Plenary Session
of the Eighth NPC held from March 5 to 17 in Beijing-- as the
"most splendid" trans-century document ever seen in Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
-- An editorial carried on this leading newspaper in China
hails the successful conclusion of the Fourth Session of the NPC
and the Fourth Session of the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) ended
in Beijing on March 17 and March 13 respectively.

that with regard to the Taiwan Question, the Communist Party of
China and the Chinese government do not change their basic

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Wins S. Leone's Presidential Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Tejan Kabbah, leader of the
Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), has won the presidential runoff,
said an official announcement here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah score 608,419 votes (59.49 percent), defeating
81-year-old Karefa-Smart, leader of the United National People's
Party (UNPP), according to an announcement broadcast tonight by
the Electoral Commission through the state radio.
</P>
<P>
Karefa-Smart polled 414,335 votes (40.51 percent) in the
second round of the presidential election done on March 15,
according to James Jonah, chairman of the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The total casted votes are 1,227,540 but don't include two
polling stations in the Koinadugu District in the far north of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Results from these two stations will in no way affect the
general voting trend," said Jonah, who is also a former assistant
secretary general of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah had also led Karefa-Smart in the first round of the
presidential election on February 26 and 27 but fell short of
emerging a winner of the election.
</P>
<P>
He had won 35.8 percent of the vote while Karefa-Smart had
gained 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution of the West African state, a
president elect must get at least 55 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two candidates had to run the second round of
the election last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, bad road conditions and poor communication facilities
prevented most of the votes being brought to the Freetown,
capital of the West African state, from remote areas until
Saturday and early today.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said it is still not clear when the
military government led by Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio,
would hand over to the new civilian government.But State house
sources said privately that it will be done within 21 days.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the SLPP comes to power. The oldest
party of Sierra Leone brought the country to independence in
1961. But in 1967, it was defeated by the All People's Congress
which was overthrown by the military in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Hague Tribunal Wants to Open Office in Serb State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Hague-based international tribunal proposed today to set up an
office in Bosnian Serb state.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia Graham Blewitt made the proposal at a
meeting with Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic in Pale, the Serb
stronghold east of Sarajevo, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt told reporters after the meeting that he expected an
affirmative reply to the proposal from the Serb authorities.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said his talks with Serb officials were very important
since it had laid a firm foundation for the tribunal's
investigation in Republika Srpska, which would cover victims and
witnesses of crimes against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kasagic said the tribunal had asked for Serb
cooperation and proposed that tribunal's experts be able to
question witnesses and victims of crimes against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal also asked to be given access to mass graves and
to be permitted to make exhumations in order to gather evidence
about crimes against Serbs, the Serb premier said, adding that the
Serb authority was yet to give a definite answer to the requests
and proposals made by the tribunal's officials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressman Commends Nigerian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A United States Congressman has
described Nigeria's local government delegate's election as a
remarkable start for the enthronment of an enduring democracy in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Roy Inis, who led a team of U.S. congressmen as observers to
the Nigerian election told the News Agency of Nigeria that the
turn-out was "amazing and impressive", and "We did not envisage
this huge turn-out."
</P>
<P>
Inis condemned the attitude of those Nigerians, who fled the
country and were calling for the boycott of the election from
abroad and urged them to stop the act and join hands with
compatriots at home to establish an enduring democracy for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Inis, who is also Chairman of the U.S.-based congress for
racial equality, noted, the outside world "has been misinformed
about the goings-on in Nigeria, hence the call for sanctions
against the country from several quarters".
</P>
<P>
The U.S.team, which is in Nigeria to observe and monitor the
election, is obliged to inform the U.S. government correctly of
Nigeria's democratisation process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been critising Nigeria for jeopardising democracy
and imposing together with a few other western countries
sanctions against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"As observers," Inis stated, "We hereby appeal to all persons
involved in the campaign of calumny against Nigeria to visit the
country before reaching conclusions."

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Council of Ministers
today held a special session to discuss the island's course
toward the European Union (EU) and expressed satisfaction over
the work done so far on the EU harmonization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after a 90-minute meeting, Foreign
Minister Alecos Michaelides said he presented before the council
a general picture of the various plans prepared so far but
emphasis was given on the Cypriot contribution to the structured
dialogue with the EU and the harmonization process.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the structured dialogue is an
opportunity for the Cypriot ministers to have contacts with their
EU counterparts, in a bid to learn the problems, the views and
the issues associated with the acquis communautaire.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is an opportunity for the island's
ministers to project progress made by Cyprus and what it was
doing in its effort to be fully harmonized with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides noted that today's cabinet meeting was the
beginning of a series of similar meetings aimed at examining
Cyprus' course toward the EU, during which the government will
be checking whether its targets set within the framework of the
structured dialogue, are being fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a total of 21 working groups was working in
various ministries, preparing the ground for Cyprus' smooth entry
into the EU.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all ministers attending the meeting had
reported to the council about the work done in their respective
ministries in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been divided since the 1974 Turkish
invasion, applied for the EU full membership in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided in March 6, 1995 to start
accession talks with Cyprus six months after the EU
Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for this year.
