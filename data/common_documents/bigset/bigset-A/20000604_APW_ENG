Archaeologists Discover Lost Cities
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- Archaeologists scouring the Mediterranean seabed
announced Saturday they have found the 2,500-year-old ruins of submerged
Pharaonic cities that until now were known only through Greek tragedies,
travelogues and legends. Among the stunning discoveries at the sites -- where
the cities of Herakleion, Canopus and Menouthis once stood -- are remarkably
preserved houses, temples, port infrastructure and colossal statues that stand
testimony to the citizens' luxuriant lifestyle, which some travelers had
described as decadent.

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fijian coup leader George Speight resumed meetings Sunday
with the country's military rulers to discuss his latest demands for the release
of more than 30 hostages being held in the parliament building. The meeting
outside the Fijian capital of Suva was the first chance the two sides have had
to discuss a nine-point plan Speight issued Friday for ending the crisis. The
plan, however, appeared to push a peaceful resolution further away than at any
time since he and six gunmen stormed parliament on May 19.

   HAVANA (AP) -- A day after a massive march demanding the return of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, a reported 70,000 people rallied in eastern Cuba, demanding the
boy be repatriated immediately. ''We raise our voices so our enemies can hear
us: Bring back Elian!'' Madelin Gonzalez, one of a dozen speakers, shouted from
the stage in Banes, in the eastern province of Holguin. The rally followed a
massive march in Havana on Friday by a reported half-million women angered by
the latest delay in Elian's return to his communist homeland.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years ago, the biggest global gathering of women

equality of the sexes; still very far from that goal, the same nations meet
Monday to try to agree on an accelerated roadmap toward equality for women. But
the Vatican and a group of Islamic countries are objecting to the same proposals
they did in Beijing in 1995 -- including sexual and reproductive rights for
women, adolescent sex education and the definition of the family -- as well as
some new ones.

<HEADLINE> Better Anti-Terrorism Campaign Urged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional advisory commission is
recommending more drastic measures to stop terrorism against
Americans, including monitoring foreign students and blacklisting
more countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat is changing and it's becoming more deadly,'' the
panel's chairman, L. Paul Bremmer III, told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Terrorism, a panel of private experts
and former government officials, was created by Congress two years
ago after bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. It is due to report
to lawmakers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among suggestions the commission will make that the United
States should designate Pakistan and Greece as nations ''not
cooperating fully'' with anti-terrorism efforts, the Post reported
in its Sunday edition. Such nations are not allowed to purchase
U.S. military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Greek and Pakistani citizens should not enjoy privileges
that allow visitors from friendly countries to travel here without
visas. Greece, the report says, has been ''disturbingly passive''
in response to terrorism and Pakistan was cited for providing safe
haven for ''several groups engaging in terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan, meanwhile, should be moved from the noncooperative
list and instead designated a ''state sponsor'' of terrorism --
countries that face even stricter sanctions -- the commission's
report says. Countries designated terrorism sponsors currently
include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At home, a regional pilot program for tracking foreign students
should be expanded, the panel says. The program keeps tabs on such
things as changes in students' study plans -- a switch from an
English literature major to nuclear physics might arouse suspicion,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also is recommending that the military lead the
response to any major terrorist attack on U.S. soil, as opposed to
the FBI or the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it said the CIA and the FBI should be less
restricted in opening investigations of terrorist suspects or using
informants who may have unsavory backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the terrorism commission's recommendations are expected
to spark controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the process of guaranteeing security, we cannot run
roughshod over the basic rights of the Constitution, which is the
centerpiece of what the country is about,'' James J. Zogby,
president of the Arab American Institute, told the Post.

<HEADLINE> Surge in Campus Alcohol Arrests  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcohol-related arrests on college campuses surged 24.3 percent
in 1998, the largest jump in seven years, according to a survey by
The Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and crime experts attributed the
increase to more heavy drinking among college students coupled with
better reporting and tougher enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alcohol abuse is the No. 1 problem on every college campus in
this country, and I don't care how big they are or how small they
are,'' said police Capt. Dale Burke of the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The university's 39,700-student Madison campus reported the most
liquor law violations -- 792 -- of any of the 481 four-year
institutions surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Sunday, showed an 11 percent increase in
college campus arrests for drug violations and an 11.3 percent
increase in arrests for forcible sex offenses, as well as smaller
increases in arrests for weapons violations, assault, arson and
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tuttle, a policy scientist and past public safety director
at the University of Delaware, warned against reading too much into
the statistics. He noted that while the numbers are required to be
published in some form under federal law, the Department of
Education will not begin uniform reporting until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor law arrests, for example, are supposed to include
citations. But in the past, some universities reported only
instances in which a person was taken into custody, Tuttle said.
Now that more schools understand the definition, the number of
reported arrests may rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle also pointed to increased enforcement as a possible
explanation for the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think more institutions are seeing the courts as a way of
dealing with these problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts noted that while enforcement is up, so are
reports of hard-core drinking by college students.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released this year by the Harvard School of Public
Health found 22.7 percent of the college student population
reported frequent binge drinking in 1999, up from 19.8 percent in
1993 and 20.9 percent in 1997. The survey included 14,000 students
at 119 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent binge drinker was defined as a man who drank at least
five drinks in a row, or a woman who drank four, at least three or
more times in the two weeks before the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wechsler, a social psychologist and Harvard researcher who
led the study, said that until the past decade, alcohol abuse was
the ''little secret'' of colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colleges do have traditions where drinking is part of their
culture, and that needs to be changed,'' Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Tony Kleibecker of the Michigan State University Police
and Burke of the University of Wisconsin said many alcohol arrests
come after football games or special events such as concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, with 42,600 students, ranked second in the
survey in 1998 alcohol arrests with 655, and first in weapons
violations with 49. Thirty of the weapons arrests were misdemeanors
involving small knives or clubs, Kleibecker said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the University of California at
Berkeley was second in weapons violations with 34 on a campus of
30,300 students, followed by the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte with 26 on its 16,500-student campus, and the University
of North Carolina at Greensboro with 23 on its 12,530-student
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley also led the survey's list in drug arrests with 280,
followed by Rutgers University at New Brunswick with 138 on a
campus of 34,420; North Carolina at Greensboro with 132; and the
University of Arizona with 123 a campus of 33,740.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Adan Tejada of the UC Berkeley police force said the numbers
reflect the fact that Berkeley is in the middle of a city and a
block away from People's Park, the famously freewheeling area that
has long attracted drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of these things are happening south of
campus,'' Tejada said. ''We're not talking about central campus
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 20 murders and one manslaughter case reported
in 1998, compared with 18 murders and two manslaughter cases in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of robbery, burglary and motor vehicle theft declined
from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Michigan State
University, the schools listed in the survey with the highest
numbers of alcohol arrests in 1998 were the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities with 606 on a campus of 45,400; Western
Michigan University with 405 on a campus of 26,130; and Berkeley
with 382.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol often plays a role in the other crimes, particularly sex
offenses, said Nancy Schulte, coordinator of drug education
services at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, colleges are beefing up alcohol and drug
awareness programs. They need to be asking themselves, ''How am I
vulnerable?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Missed Opportunities Doom Dallas  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Up a goal and owning a two-man advantage, the
Dallas Stars were in position to take control of Game 3 of the
Stanley Cup finals and maybe even the series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars failed to get off a shot during 49 seconds of
5-on-3 action late in the first period, then failed to score the
rest of the night and wound up losing 2-1 to the New Jersey Devils
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really could've put the nail in them if we'd scored on
that,'' said Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock, whose team also wasted two
more stretches with extra skaters in the final 4:15 to fall behind
2-1 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Added center Mike Modano: ''We had our chances. Some of our
decisions weren't very good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing at home for just the second time in the last 13
playoff games, the defending champion Stars gave back the home-ice
advantage they'd gained by winning Game 2 in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It would've been understandable if Dallas' power play unit was
rusty after only getting one opportunity the first two games, but
the Stars cashed in their first chance at 13:08 of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvain Cote found the puck on his stick courtesy of a poor
clearing pass by Devils captain Scott Stevens, then fired it into a
virtually wide open net to give Dallas a 1-0 lead and some
much-needed momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:05 later, the Stars were on the power play again, but
struggled to get the puck in front of the net against the Devils'
penalty-killing unit that had been successful on 49 of its previous
52 attempts coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a hard cross-check by Claude Lemieux into the back of
Modano for the 5-on-3.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Dallas had a two-man edge was the second period of
Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. Hitchcock used his time
out to stress the importance of the opportunity and Brett Hull
responded with a game-tying goal. Although Dallas lost the game, it
was a key moment.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no timeout. And no goal. Not even a shot on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the turning point in the game,'' New Jersey
defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ''If Dallas goes up 2-0, it's a pretty
big hole to climb out of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had one blast that went wide of the net, but the
Devils got the rebound and cleared it out of the zone. Lemieux's
penalty continued once the first one ended, but Dallas still
couldn't put pressure on New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seemed to control the play,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a few good looks, but they blocked a few and they
didn't get through to Brodeur,'' center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 seconds after the penalty kill, the Devils tied the
game when Jason Arnott slid a puck under Ed Belfour after he left
the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ''That goal took the wind out of our sails,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour kept the game close with 29 saves and several
spectacular plays, although a second goal went in on a shot by Petr
Sykora that popped in and out of the pocket of Belfour's glove
midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ''That goal deflated us,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said.
''We never really got it back.''
</P>
<P>
   A delay of game penalty on Brodeur gave Dallas a final power
play with 4:15 left. The Stars got just one good look.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 1:19 left, Dallas went with an empty net. Hull nearly
put in his fourth goal of the series, but Brodeur got his body on
it and covered the rebound before Jere Lehtinen could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to say whether we got enough chances,'' Hatcher
said. ''It doesn't really matter. We lost the game.''

<HEADLINE> Devils Road Warriors Of Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- If the New Jersey Devils win the Stanley Cup, it
might be appropriate if they do it on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in one of the toughest buildings in hockey, the Devils
beat the Dallas Stars 2-1 on Saturday night to take a 2-1 lead in
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey improved to 8-2 in the playoffs away from the
Continental Airlines Arena, handing the Stars only their second
loss in 11 games at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are really confident on the road,'' defenseman Ken Daneyko
said. ''Going into today we felt good about our chances. We just
had to work hard. For some reason, we play really simple and smart
on the road. We don't make as many defensive mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson said his team also seems to enjoy the challenge
of being on the road, the pressure and maybe having people feel
they can't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't try to do the fancy things that we try at home,'' he
said. ''Maybe we feed off the other team's crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Devils dominance on the road in the postseason
follows a regular season in which they were 17-19-5 in away
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regular season is one thing and the playoffs are
another,'' defenseman Scott Niedermayer said. ''You have to go out
when you are on the road and be focused and try to play your
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have done that under Robinson since he replaced
Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Home is another story. New Jersey is 6-4 there in the playoffs
and the difference in the team's play is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils play a much more conservative game on the road. They
do all the little boring things that make them tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   They get the puck deep in their opponent's zone, they forecheck,
they counterattack and they convert. It's team orientated hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils didn't start Game 3 like a typical road game.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing one power play in the first two games, New Jersey
picked up three penalties in a 2:16 span in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   A slashing penalty on Sergei Nemchinov, the first of the trio,
set up the Stars' only goal, a rebound by defenseman Sylvain Cote
at 13:08.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Martin Brodeur stopped the initial shot, but he and
defenseman Scott Stevens had a miscommunication trying to clear the
puck and Cote had an open net to shoot at for his second of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth short-handed goal the Devils had given up
in 53 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov and Claude Lemieux picked up penalties giving
the Stars a 49-second two-man advantage, but the Devils did not
allow a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the turning point for us,'' said rookie John Madden,
the Devils' leading penalty killer. ''That was tough. They have
some big weapons with Mike Modano and Brett Hull and they can shoot
the puck. If we went down 2-0 it would have been very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott tied the game late in the first period by splitting
the defense and beating Ed Belfour in close with 1:54 left in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora got the game winner on a power play at 12:27 of the
second period. Brodeur made the lead stand up, stopping a wrist
shot by Brett Hull with less than a minute to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to come in here and have a big, solid road game and
we did that,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The goals by Arnott and Sykora came just two days after the
Devils' top line -- Patrik Elias is the other member -- was
criticized by Robinson for a no-show effort in a 2-1 loss in Game 2
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been doing it for a long time,'' Niedermayer said of
Arnott's line. ''They are talented guys, working real hard and they
are a big part of this team's offense. We depend on them and they
have been coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   The win guaranteed that the Devils will go home for Game 5 on
Thursday no worse than tied 2-2 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came in here looking for a split,'' Madden said. ''We may
want to get greedy now.''

<HEADLINE> Padres 7, Mariners 4  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Stan Spencer came within one out of his first
major league complete game and Ryan Klesko hit a two-run homer to
lead the San Diego Padres over the Seattle Mariners 7-4 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer (2-1), making his fifth start since being called up from
Triple-A Las Vegas on May 12, allowed a two-run homer to Mike
Cameron in the sixth, but both runs were unearned because shortstop
Damian Jackson's throwing error that pulled Klesko off first base.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez (17th) and Jay Buhner (12th) hit solo homers in
the ninth. After Brian Boehringer walked David Bell, Trevor Hoffman
got the final out for his 13th save in 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone put San Diego ahead with an RBI single in the fourth
off John Halama (6-1) and Klesko made it 3-0 in the sixth with his
10th homer, a 410-foot shot to right following Phil Nevin's single.
It was Klesko's first this year off a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego broke open the game with four runs in the seventh. Rob
Ramsay relieved with two on and later walked Klesko with the bases
loaded. Boone then hit a sacrifice fly off Kevin Hodges, Carlos
Hernandez drove in a run with an infield single and Hodges walked
Jackson with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, who allowed a franchise-record 10 stolen bases to
Florida on May 18, allowed two to the Mariners. He struck out four
and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, bidding to become the first Mariners starter to start
7-0, gave up five runs and nine hits in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa pitched a scoreless ninth in his first appearance
since giving up seven hits in Tampa Bay's 11-run eighth inning last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mariners left fielder and leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson
did not play because of a stiff neck. He came out of Friday night's
game after five innings. ... Javier started in Henderson's place
and played for the first time since last Saturday. He went home to
the Dominican Republic this week because his 7-month-old daughter
was ill. ... Klesko hit his first homer off a left-hander this
season. It was his 149th career homer. ... Owens had his 24th
multihit game, second-most in the NL. ... The temperature when the
game started at 6:09 p.m. PDT was 79 degrees, the warmest
temperature for the start of a Mariners' game at Safeco Field this
season. A crowd of 44,183 turned out.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils lured the Dallas Stars into
their trap. Now, they have the lead -- and the momentum -- in the
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' top line scored twice, with Petr Sykora and Jason
Arnott each scoring their third goal in three games, and shut out
the Stars' frustrated big scorers for a 2-1 victory Saturday night
in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils overcame an early deficit, in one of the toughest
buildings for any road team to win, behind goaltender Martin
Brodeur's strong play to seize a 2-1 advantage over the defending
champions. Game 4 is Monday night in Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''We controlled the puck and didn't give a whole lot of
chances,'' Devils defenseman Scott Stevens said. ''They can't score
if they don't have the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   It has started at the top for the Devils, who lack Dallas' big
names and big guns yet are getting a huge series from Sykora,
Arnott and Patrik Elias, who have 14 points to four for the Stars'
Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Devils' top line met privately to discuss
their ineffectiveness in the Stars' 2-1 victory in Game 2. In the
opener, trio combined for four goals and 11 points as the Devils
won 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were pretty quiet,'' Arnott said. ''We all knew what we had
to do to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, get a lead, then let the Devils' neutral zone trap
defense and Brodeur protect it. Brodeur made 22 saves, several
during a power play resulting from his own delay-of-game penalty
with 4:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our penalty killing won this game for us,'' said coach Larry
Robinson, whose Devils killed off a two-man advantage after Dallas
opened a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's biggest save may have come against Hull in the closing
minutes. Modano set Hull up perfectly in the slot, just as he did
during Hull's two-goal night in Game 2, but the shot bounced off
Brodeur's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough, because we had enough chances,'' Stars defenseman
Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott scored the tying goal late in the first period, then set
up Sykora's game winner on a power play in the second. Apparently,
the Devils' top liners paid attention when Robinson said he wished
he had split them up because of their ineffectiveness in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't play that well in second game. We knew we had to
come back and score some goals,'' Sykora said. ''This is the way we
wanted to come back. We could've scored a couple more, but we'll
take those two goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykora, who had two goals in Game 1, took Arnott's pass and
snapped it past goaltender Ed Belfour, who mistimed the hard shot,
closing his glove a millisecond after the puck flew by at 12:27.
The power play resulted from Sylvain Cote's elbowing of John Madden
directly in front of referee Terry Gregson.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the 14th goal allowed by Belfour in the Stars' 11
home playoff games. Belfour played well, turning aside 29 of 31
shots, many on acrobatic saves, but had no help from his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their desperation to defend was more evident than our
desperation to score,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ''Their
ability to defend was everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano was unhappy his line didn't go against the Devils' No. 1
line nearly as much in Game 3, and that the Stars had so much
trouble getting open in the clogged neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel very flat footed in the neutral zone,'' Modano said.
''We are standing around, and they are coming through pretty fast
and they have some defensemen who can skate. They also counter off
mistakes very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' top line ineffectiveness is even more glaring because
it isn't getting help from the second line. Joe Nieuwendyk, the MVP
of last year's playoffs, doesn't have a point in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the key to our success is our depth,'' Modano said.
''If we're scoring one or two goals a game, we need support. That's
they way it was last year, we always got key goals from the other
guys in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars supposedly had the advantage going back to a humid
Reunion Arena, where the ice is always soft and the Stars hard to
beat, going 9-1 previously in the playoffs and 11-1 since the Cup
finals a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils' defense-driven road show plays successfully just
about everywhere, as evidenced by their 8-2 playoff road record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ice was bad and it was really hot, but we came through,''
Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a 1-0 lead, just as it did in Game 2. With the Stars
on only their second power play of the series, Lehtinen's hard shot
from the left circle deflected off Brodeur's chest. Stevens tried
to clear, but swept the puck into the right circle directly to
Cote, who wristed it into the top of the net at 13:08 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, the Stars missed an excellent opportunity
to expand the lead when they couldn't score during a two-man power
play lasting 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have put a nail into things if we had scored there,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute after Claude Lemieux's cross-checking penalty
expired, the Devils tied it at 18:06 on Arnott's seventh goal of
the playoffs. Derian Hatcher and Dave Manson couldn't get the puck
out of the Stars' end, allowing Arnott to drive down the slot and
steer a shot by Belfour just as he was swept off his skates.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 lead -- New Jersey is 9-1 when leading into the third
period -- allowed the Devils to be at their neutral zone-trapping
best in a third period in which Brodeur had to make only a couple
of difficult saves. He stopped 22 of 23 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a chance to tie it when Brodeur drew a delay of the
game penalty for shooting the puck into the stands at 15:45.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know my backhand was so good,'' Brodeur said. ''It
was a bad mistake, but my team came through for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after the penalty was called, Madden skated up to Brodeur
and said, ''Don't worry about it. We'll kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   They did and, along with it, any chance Dallas had to take
command of the series at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a great opportunity that slipped by us,'' Modano
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars got their usual thunderous support from their 101st
consecutive sellout crowd in Reunion Arena, a low-roofed concrete
relic from the 1970s they will abandon a year from now for a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   However, the white towels the fans usually wave were missing. It
seems they were shipped to Minnesota -- the Stars' former home -- and
weren't rerouted in time for the game. Late in the second period,
arena staffers handed out substitute white paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   But, just like the Stars' ineffective top line, they weren't a
reasonable facsimile of the real thing.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 2, Rockies 1, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- James Mouton just wanted to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton's 12th inning pinch-hit single gave the Milwaukee Brewers
a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we've got to play that long, we've got to go ahead and try
to win that one,'' Mouton said.
</P>
<P>
   His hit snapped Milwaukee's three-game losing streak and
Colorado's six-game winning streak, it's longest since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Belinda (1-1) hit Lopez with a pitch leading off, the
fourth Brewers batter hit during the game. Lopez took second on
Raul Casanova's sacrifice and went to third on a wild pitch before
Mouton singled to center. ''Three-and-two (the count), I'm just
looking to put the ball in play, that's all I'm doing,'' Mouton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy to see him get that hit and get a smile on his
face again,'' Milwaukee manager Dave Lopes said of Mouton.
</P>
<P>
   Valerio De Los Santos (1-2) pitched two hitless innings for his
first career win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo, back in Milwaukee for the first time since being
traded in the offseason, said the hit batters were unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough loss,'' he said. ''In that situation, you don't
want to hit someone. Two of them started innings. It wasn't like we
were trying to hit any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio hit Lopez in the fifth inning and Jose Hernandez
in the seventh. Mike Myers hit Jeromy Burnitz in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes tied the score in the ninth with an RBI single off
Astacio after a throwing error by catcher Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds' 10th home run of the season gave the Rockies a
1-0 lead in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hit batter, sacrifice, wild pitch, now you're really in
trouble with a guy on third base with less than two out,'' Rockies
manager Buddy Bell said. ''That's how they scored their runs
(strange plays). In a game like this, those are the kind of things
that eventually help you lose a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Astacio allowed five hits and struck out seven in nine innings,
throwing a pair of wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Jamey Wright made his first appearance against Colorado since
being traded and his third start since coming off the disabled list
May 23. Wright, who had been sidelined by a tear in his right
rotator cuff, gave up three hits in eight innings and struck out a
career-high seven.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Brewers were without starters shortstop Mark Lotetta,
who broke a bone in his left foot in Friday night's game, and
catcher Henry Blanco, who is in Venezuela because his father is
ill. ... Jamey Wright struck out the side to start the game. ...
Jeff Cirillo's hitting streak ended at nine-games. ... Going into
Saturday night's game the Rockies led the NL in hitting with a .300
average, but were second-to-last in club pitching with a .292
opponent average.

Clinton, Putin Meet in Moscow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Vladimir Putin were ''serious and
focused'' in Kremlin discussions Saturday night, with Clinton intrigued by the
new Russian president's suggestion he has relaxed his stern opposition to a
planned U.S. system to defend against missile attacks. A senior administration
official, briefing reporters later, refused to specify whether Putin
demonstrated a willingness to go along with a modification of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
The meeting -- the leaders' first since Putin took office -- was described as
friendly, though the presidents did not address each other as ''Bill'' and
''Vladimir.''

Better Anti-Terrorism Campaign Urged
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional advisory commission is recommending more
drastic measures to stop terrorism against Americans, including monitoring
foreign students and blacklisting more countries. The National Commission on
Terrorism, a panel of private experts and former government officials, was
created by Congress two years ago after bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. It
is due to report to lawmakers on Monday. Among suggestions the commission will
make that the United States should designate Pakistan and Greece as nations
''not cooperating fully'' with anti-terrorism efforts, the Post reported in its
Sunday edition. Such nations are not allowed to purchase U.S. military
equipment.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fijian coup leader George Speight resumed meetings Sunday
with the country's military rulers to discuss his latest demands for the release

outside the Fijian capital of Suva was the first chance the two sides have had

us: Bring back Elian!'' Madelin Gonzalez, one of a dozen speakers, shouted from

Bomb Explodes in the Philippines
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A bomb exploded early Sunday outside the arrival
area at Manila's international airport, badly damaging a public toilet but
causing no injuries, officials said. The explosion, the fifth in the capital
area in recent weeks, dug a crater in the sidewalk outside the women's toilet
and ripped apart its walls. Two women suspects were being interrogated, police
said. Police said there were no signs of shrapnel, indicating that the bomb was
not designed to kill or injure large numbers of people. A string of recent
explosions in Manila and other parts of the country have been blamed by police
on Muslim rebels who are under attack by the military in the southern

   NEW YORK (AP)---- Alcohol-related arrests on college campuses surged 24.3
percent in 1998, the largest jump in seven years, according to a survey by The
Chronicle of Higher Education. Law enforcement officials and crime experts
attributed the increase to more heavy drinking among college students coupled
with better reporting and tougher enforcement. The report, released Sunday,
showed an 11 percent increase in college campus arrests for drug violations and
an 11.3 percent increase in arrests for forcible sex offenses, as well as
smaller increases in arrests for weapons violations, assault, arson and hate
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Mass Nude Photo Shoot in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after the U.S. Supreme Court denied an
attempt to stop them, 150 flabby, thin, tattooed, pierced, pale,
sunburned and hairy people posed nude under a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Spencer Tunick won the right to carry on the photo
shoot beneath the Williamsburg Bridge when the high court rejected
the city's request to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The mass disrobing, which took place shortly before sunrise
Sunday near the East River, was viewed by many as a symbol of
artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick, who has been arrested five times since 1995 for staging
nude public photo shoots in New York, called it a victory for ''any
contemporary artist working with the body.''
</P>
<P>
   He sued the city last summer after dozens of officers showed up
at a photo shoot to arrest the participants. Tunick canceled the
session and claimed in court that his constitutional rights had
been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The city argued that New York law criminalizes public nudity,
but Tunick maintained that state law does not prohibit nude
photography.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, a federal appeals court in Manhattan agreed with him,
ruling that he had a First Amendment right to take his unusual
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick said the photos taken Sunday depict ''a living organism
of hundreds of bodies forming a landscape, the relationship between
the anonymity of public space and the human body.''

<HEADLINE> Luxury Entices Some Movie-Goers  </HEADLINE>
By HEIDI B. PERLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Forget stale popcorn and watered-down
soda. Forget broken seats, tiny screens and bad speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theater owners want people to think mixed drinks, rib-eye
steak and squash-filled ravioli. Served in leather chairs in front
of screens that go from floor to ceiling. With intense,
near-deafening sound.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from full dinners to Ferris wheel rides now are being
offered to lure consumers, who are faced with an increasing number
of options to going to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century after well-dressed theatergoers crowded to
see the first moving picture, a night at some theaters has returned
to what it once was: an event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that you could pay 25 cents and get more than
just a feature-length movie for your money,'' said Terrance Demas,
director of the League of Historic American Theaters in Baltimore.
''With TV, that somehow got lost. Now, that's what people want
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, theaters took in nearly $7 billion in ticket sales, up
more than $1 billion from the previous year, according to the
National Association of Theater Owners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid growth of new media and home entertainment
systems, theater owners are concerned those numbers could start to
drop if they don't offer their patrons more than just popcorn and a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Sony recently opened a 15-screen Metreon
Theater in a massive marketplace, complete with restaurants, an
amusement park, a children's museum, Sony stores and four IMAX
theaters that show multidimensional films.
</P>
<P>
   Resort Theaters of America is planning to open about 500
theaters at resorts in California, Utah and Colorado that will
offer gourmet coffee, chocolates and pastries in the lobby, a
supervised playroom for children, and a digital screen show before
the movie begins.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Maryland, General Cinemas
has opened Premium Cinemas, where patrons can have dinner --
anything from oven-roasted scrod to chocolate mousse cake -- and see
a movie under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   At Framingham's Premium Cinema, reservations are recommended and
no one under 21 is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons can dine just outside the cinema. A full bar is set up
for drinks, and slow eaters can take their plates into the theater.
Waiters also offer table service inside the auditorium for late
orders, dessert and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   For the show, moviegoers sit in leather lounge chairs with ample
leg room behind private tables. Popcorn is free and waiting at each
reserved seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sick of being in a crowded theater with kids kicking me
and screaming in my ear,'' said Michael Kelly, 26, of Marlborough,
before a recent showing of Mission: Impossible II. ''For me, just a
chance to have a drink and watch a movie without kids around is
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   People loved to be catered to, said manager Ed Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take care of people from the minute they come in until the
movie is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That much special treatment isn't cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the average price for admission is $4.26, according
to the National Association of Theater Owners. But in major
metropolitan areas, and at most chain theaters, adult ticket prices
range from $5 for matinees to $10 for evening shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the Premium Cinemas, an adult ticket is $15. That doesn't
include appetizers, which start at $7, or entrees, which range from
$12.50 for the squash ravioli to $18.50 for a rib-eye steak.
</P>
<P>
   Two burgers, some chicken satay and two sodas -- refillable -- on
a recent weekday night came to about $32. Add to that a tip for the
service, and two tickets to the movie, and the total cost for the
night comes to just under $70.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's stupid,'' said Julie Feiler, 28, of Cambridge. An avid
movie-goer, she regularly goes to theaters featuring art and
foreign films. And she never buys popcorn or drinks from the snack
stands.

   ''I like to sit in the dark and watch a movie,'' she said. ''I
don't need luxuries. If I wanted to be that comfortable, I'd stay
home.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say $15 isn't outrageous, particularly taken in the
context of the cost for other entertainment, such as athletic
events or concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''People today are just unwilling to go anywhere where they
won't be coddled,'' said Lucy Fischer, head of the Film Studies
Program and the Society for Cinema Studies at the University of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''And why should they? They've grown up having dinner on couches
in front of big-screen TVs. Why go to the movies at all?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lawrence, chief operating officer of Resort Theaters of
America, said he's confident that no matter what else is out there,
people will always want to go to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've moved from a services economy to an experience
economy,'' he said. ''People want to have an experience today, and
the places that do the most to make sure you have a good one are
the ones that will survive.''

<HEADLINE> After a decade, new hearings on Soung cleanup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) --Ten years ago, sewage washing up on the
shores of Long Island Sound routinely closed beaches and fish kills
devastated those making their living on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of lobsters are dying off in a mystery
scientists are rushing to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the cleanup spurred from the outrage and ideas voiced
in public hearings on the Sound in 1990, environmental officials
are this year holding a new round of forums. The goal is to build
on the efforts that have improved the health of the Sound and
tackle problems that remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the new hearings ... really put a spotlight on these
critical areas,'' said David J. Miller, executive director of the
National Audubon Society of New York State, who organized the
Listen to the Sound hearings in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Those hearings, where more than 400 people testified, led to the
creation of a Citizens' Agenda for the future of Long Island Sound
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a serious and beneficial impact on the Comprehensive
Management plan adopted by the EPA,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency Comprehensive Conservation
and Management Plan was finalized and adopted by the governors of
Connecticut and New York in 1994, along with a Long Island Sound
Restoration Agreement. The agreement committed the federal
government and the states to carry out the plan, which resulted in
the reduction of sewage and toxic pollutants in the Sound and its
surrounding marshlands.
</P>
<P>
   Annual beach cleanups have become a staple on the New York and
Connecticut shorelines. So have regular education programs. Most
schools in shoreline communities have some curriculum based on Long
Island Sound ecology, said David Galt, director of Environmental
Programs for the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection's sale of Sound preservation license plates has funded
183 projects in 53 towns since its inception in 1992. On May 31,
the state announced it had sold 100,000 plates, and awarded
$336,000 in grants to 22 environmental projects to benefit the
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Galt said more needs to be done, including improvements at
sewage treatment plants in New York, which have lagged behind
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements are hard to gauge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as all the marine life in Long Island Sound, has it
improved? Well, we've just had the lobster die-off, and it's also
affecting crabs,'' he said. ''There have been ups and downs of
specific species, but is that a natural occurrence? We don't
know.''

<HEADLINE> Police tackling theft of heavy equipment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) -- It may seem hard for a thief to hide a
two-ton truck or piece of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities say the theft of heavy equipment has become a
lucrative trade, and some police officers don't know where to look
--or how.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide last year, police reported 16,500 missing pieces of
construction equipment valued at about $567 million. Most of the
equipment sold for 10 to 20 percent of actual value within 300
miles of where it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Few pieces have been recovered and law enforcement officers
concede they have not paid enough attention to an expensive
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all get excited looking for a stolen Toyota worth $8,000,''
said Paul Morgan, a sheriff in Charles County, Md. ''But few of us
know how to find a stolen dump truck that might be worth $60,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who travels nationwide to teach police officers and
vehicle inspectors how to spot stolen heavy equipment, recently led
a class at the Connecticut Police Academy. About 50 municipal
officers, state vehicle inspectors and state troopers learned about
trucks and the documents the drivers are required to carry.
</P>
<P>
   They also were shown as many as 18 places on construction
equipment where manufacturers put hard-to-find, and
harder-to-erase, ID numbers. Morgan told officers to carry a can of
brake cleaner and lots of rags so they can wipe away grease or
spray-paint that thieves sometimes use to conceal the more visible
ID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The course, the first of a series, was sponsored by the state
police vehicle-theft task force, which recently broke up a ring
that may have stolen as much as $1 million worth of construction
equipment from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stolen construction equipment is a big problem that we're
targeting. It's bad along the I-95 corridor,'' said task force
commander Lt. John Duley. ''Our unit had to learn how to look for
it. Now we hope these classes will increase enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Jones, an inspector with the state Department of Motor
Vehicles anti-theft unit, said he had always just checked
tractor-trailers to ensure they are registered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I'll know how to check the bulldozers, backhoes and other
stuff that's on the trailers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the equipment is often sold at bargain prices to
struggling contractors who don't question the cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had one case of a stolen skidder worth $18,000 sold for
$1,600,'' Morgan said. ''The guy who bought it had to know it was
stolen. He told us he'd bought it from some guy he met on a job and
he only knew him as 'JimBob.'''
</P>
<P>
   The skidder was stolen from a dealer's lot by thieves who pulled
up with a tractor, hooked up a trailer and drove away, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statistics show that police throughout the
country recover just 16 percent of stolen heavy equipment --compared
with 60 percent of all stolen cars, Morgan said. That's often
because road patrol officers don't know what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heavy equipment is confusing. They're not like cars. They
don't require titles, registrations or licenses,'' he said. ''You
could stop a tractor-trailer that is properly registered and have
no clue that the $70,000 loader it's hauling is stolen.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard cuts Delaware River patrols, blames tight budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The U.S. Coast Guard has ceased routine
patrols of the Delaware River between Trenton and the Delaware Bay
to cut costs, though officials said it will stay on call for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason we're reducing operations is to protect our
emergency search-and-rescue capability and for those surge
operations -- hurricanes, floods -- the public-safety issues we have
to keep number one,'' Coast Guard Cmdr. Pat Philbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin, aide to Coast Guard Commandant Adm. James M. Loy, spoke
Friday from Washington, D.C., where the agency is seeking $71
million more than is in the current $4 billion budget in order to
restore services such as river patrols across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel costs have increased sharply since the Coast Guard budget
was approved last year, but Philbin said the rising fuel costs are
''only about 10 percent of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The larger problems are rising medical costs, pay, and
personnel issues,'' he said. ''More than two-thirds of every dollar
is spent on personnel costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those costs are fixed, hurting the agency's ability to
quickly cope with a budget pinch, Philbin added.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really difficult to save a lot real fast, because a lot
of our money is wrapped up in personnel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard eliminated its daily warm-weather two-boat
patrol of the Delaware River between Trenton and the Delaware Bay
in early May.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard patrolled the river Friday as part of Maritime
Day, which had been scheduled before the cutback. The event
celebrating commerce on the river includes a tugboat parade, rowing
races and a regatta.
</P>
<P>
   At the wheel of the 41-foot patrol boat, Petty Officer Peter
Mallett was uncertain whether the absence of patrols would affect
boating safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard would still respond to any emergency on the
river, such as the recent collapse of Pier 34, Mallett said.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that other agencies, such as the Philadelphia
Police Department, New Jersey State Police, Pennsylvania Fish and
Boat Commission and Delaware Department of Natural Resources
regularly patrol the river.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sgt. Edward Oleyn, aboard a 23-foot outboard from the
Philadelphia Police marine unit, pointed out, ''The more people you
have, the better protection you have.''

<HEADLINE> Copenhagen, Contact Favored at Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Copenhagen,'' a thoughtful examination of the
morality of physics and friendship, and ''Contact,'' a daring dance
play which pushes musical-theater boundaries, were the favorites
Sunday as Broadway honored its best at the 2000 Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest competition for ''Copenhagen'' in the best-play
category was expected to be ''Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's
fanciful homage to sex goddess Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   Also nominated were ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,'' Arthur
Miller's tale of an unrepentant bigamist, and ''True West,'' a dark
comedy by Sam Shepard about two fiercely competitive brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' a look at three very different relationships,
attempts to redefine the modern musical, creating its characters
and stories mostly through dance. It uses little dialogue and
prerecorded music, mostly standards ranging from Rodgers and Hart
to Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact'' faces its stiffest challenge from ''The Wild
Party,'' adapted from a Jazz Age poem. The other nominees for best
musical include ''James Joyce's The Dead,'' based on the Irish
writer's famous short story, and ''Swing!'', a revue featuring
big-band music and swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, after a year's absence, was again chosen to
preside over the three-hour ceremonies at Radio City Music Hall,
with an assist from Nathan Lane. The first hour was scheduled for
PBS before switching to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has vowed there would be no repeat of what occurred
last year when the CBS portion of the program threatened to run
long and forced a number from ''It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues,''
one of the nominated musicals, to be cut from the show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said she gave the nominees a pep talk earlier in the
week, telling them to keep their speeches ''short, concise and
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody really cares about their agent and their manager,'' she
said. ''And that if they come up holding a piece of paper, it is
not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to assume that they are going to win and tell the
audience who's watching -- 90 percent of whom have never experienced
live theater -- why they have dedicated their life to this
profession. Hopefully, some of their enthusiasm will spill over and
we can inspire other people to participate or just come and enjoy
the art form.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway season, which ended May 28, was considered a robust
one, although production slipped a bit, from 39 shows last year to
37 this year. It grossed a record $603 million, a 2.6 percent
increase over the previous year, according to the League of
American Theaters and Producers. Attendance was the second highest
in Broadway history, 11.4 million, down slightly from a record 11.7
million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in 21 categories were chosen by 705 members of the
theatrical profession and journalists. The Tony Awards were started
in 1947 by the American Theater Wing, a theater service
organization. They were named after Antoinette Perry, an actress
and past chairman of the Wing.

<HEADLINE> Wagner Family Clash Over Festival  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The Festspielhaus theater was built by Richard
Wagner in the 1870s as the ideal setting for his epic operas, and
thousands of the cultural elite flock to the Bavarian town of
Bayreuth each year for its always sold-out festival to see the
Valkyries fly in their natural setting.
</P>
<P>
   As the world-famous Bayreuth festival heads into its 89th year
under the leadership of Wagner's descendants, a dispute is brewing
within the family worthy of a dramatization by their famous
forefather.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's great-granddaughter, a leading candidate to become
festival director at a vote Monday, has made the dramatic
suggestion to move parts of the festival out of the theater into
the open air -- and even to include more Beethoven and less Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   But her 80-year-old uncle, who has headed the festival for 50
years, vows to prevent her from getting the post and thwart the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for the festival to change isn't just coming from
within the family.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Germany's Culture Minister Michael Naumann was booed
at the festival over plans to trim its federal subsidies, and
demonstrators protested his invitation to the opening performance.
</P>
<P>
   As an answer to drying-up government money, Nike Wagner has
proposed staging festival activities outside the Festspielhaus in
Bayreuth's main square that would be financed with corporate
joint-ventures.
</P>
<P>
   And in a homage to composers who both inspired Wagner and were
inspired by him, she suggests that more non-Wagner works be
included in the two-week program staged each summer -- such as
Beethoven, but also modern composers and works yet to be written.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wagner's drama thrives on risk, not routine,'' Nike Wagner
wrote in a passionate article in Germany's leading Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper with her co-candidate for artistic
director, Elmar Weingarten, director of the Berlin Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it does not seriously concern itself with the situation of
music theater and art today, the festival will risk becoming
repetitive, always returning to its old-fashioned roots.''
</P>
<P>
   But the festival's patriarch, Wolfgang Wagner, grandson of
Richard Wagner, has vowed to stay on in his lifetime post if such
proposals win the day -- insisting that his second wife and longtime
assistant, Gudrun Wagner, is the only one who can succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of who heads the festival reaches to the highest
levels of German government: Federal, state and local officials all
vote on the 24-member festival board that includes four members of
the Wagner family.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is revered by opera lovers but also has a special place
of honor and controversy in Germany, where his rousing arpeggios
ornamenting stories of mythical Germanic heroes were a favorite of
Adolf Hitler. The festival continued under the Nazi regime, and
Wolfgang's mother and then-director, Winifred, was a glowing
admirer of Hitler -- whom the family gave the fond nickname
''Wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner has publicly blasted his niece, Nike, and has
dismissed his daughter, Eva Wagner-Pasquier -- who had been viewed
as his eminent successor -- as unfit for the post. He says his wife,
whom he wants in the spot, has been the victim of a smear campaign.
At three women are in their mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Nike Wagner's plans for the festival are ''unrealistic'' and
''contrary'' to the idea for the festival, Wolfgang Wagner said in
this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time have I made it unclear that I will continue to
fulfill my contract as long as by my assessment an unqualified
successor is named,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner isn't in much of a hurry to leave, anyway. He
has already pledged to stay on as director at least until 2001,
when a celebration of his 50th year heading the festival is
planned.

<HEADLINE> Firefighter's device links those deep in blaze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VERNON, Conn. (AP) -- John Bieback knows how the heat, smoke and
muffling breathing masks can make the distance between firefighters
standing feet apart seem like miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've stood at funerals and said, 'There's got to be a better
way,'' said Biebeck, a member of Manchester's fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Bieback, 53, has spent more than a decade and $70,000 of his own
money to develop TeamTalk, a device that allows firefighters to
communicate in burning buildings. The palm-size, wireless radio
clips onto a firefighter's breathing mask and is activated by
pressing a button on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The device, being developed by Bieback's Vernon-based Safety
Tech Industries Inc., is not expected to hit the market until later
this year. But it has already gotten positive reviews from
firefighters from Michigan to Waterbury who have tested it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those firefighters ended up investing in the product,
including Waterbury Fire Capt. Michael Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   ''They thought this thing out. That's the beauty of it,'' he
said. ''They didn't rush this into production. You can tell this
equipment is designed and built by firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bieback, who has dabbled in electronics since high school, said
he conceived of the idea after responding to an attic fire in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was yelling through the mask. It was absurd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An engineering graduate who left the field when he was 35 and
discovered volunteer firefighting, Bieback said the prototype has
gone through many changes at the suggestion of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are designing it whether they know it or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Oaks Fire Department in Michigan tried TeamTalk in a
building in which firefighters donned full gear and used fans and
generators to create background noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It worked well in practice,'' said Royal Oaks, Mich., Fire
Chief Richard Strehlke, who is not one of Safety Tech's investors.
Other devices on the market just amplify the firefighter's voice or
have wires that must be connected to a radio, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, TeamTalk joins a growing arsenal of technology
designed to give fire scene commanders a better feel for how
firefighters fare when they enter burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Bieback believes the demand will be great for TeamTalk among the
nation's 32,000 fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you read about the most tragic types of fire, when
there is a loss of life, one of the biggest things in the
investigation is the lack of communication,'' Connecticut State
Fire Administrator Jeff Morrissette said.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has to demonstrate that the device won't cause
a spark when operated and is awaiting final approval from the
Federal Communications Commission, but Bieback does not believe
those are major hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, Peter LaPlaca, are now meeting with venture
capitalists to secure $3 million for production and the national
launch.
</P>
<P>
   The introductory price will be $450 a unit, which will not yield
much of a profit, LaPlaca said. The price is expected to go up by
about $100 a unit the next year.

<HEADLINE> Eccentric engineer goes from Ellis Island to guiding G.E., America  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY PATRICK
The Daily Gazette
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- Charles Proteus Steinmetz stood less
than 5 feet tall, an odd-looking hunchbacked man U.S. immigration
officials nearly sent back to Prussia when he arrived at Ellis
Island in 1889. But within four years, Steinmetz had become chief
consultant engineer at General Electric Co., eventually working out
of its showcase Schenectady plant.
</P>
<P>
   He was an engaging, eccentric personality full of ideas and
determination; he kept a menagerie -- an owl, raccoon, alligator,
cranes and a monkey -- in his back yard and operated his own home
greenhouse and laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the century, he had persuaded GE to take the
major financial risk of establishing a laboratory dedicated to
industrial research. That laboratory, today known as General
Electric Corporate Research and Development in the Schenectady
suburb of Niskayuna, this year is marking its 100th anniversary,
paying tribute to Steinmetz's founding vision and the evolution of
the laboratory through the decades that followed.
</P>
<P>
   A century has changed many things. When Steinmetz began lobbying
for creation of the research laboratory, General Electric was a
young, pioneering company in the fledgling electrical industry. It
specialized in the manufacture of electric streetcars, industrial
motors and light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, GE is one of the world's biggest industrial
conglomerates, with a market value of more than $518 billion and
annual sales of $117.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While all sorts of factors have shaped GE, the research
laboratory has provided many of the ideas on which that growth has
been based. Over the years, its researchers have won two Nobel
Prizes and secured more than 60,000 patents. Their work has
stretched from better light bulbs to plastics, man-made diamonds,
nuclear energy and medical imaging.
</P>
<P>
   When Steinmetz began lobbying for creation of a research lab,
General Electric already had scientists working in laboratories.
But the research laboratory was something new, something far
different than company founder Thomas Edison's famed ''invention
factory'' in Menlo Park, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the first industrial laboratory dedicated to pure
research as opposed to coming up with inventions,'' said George
Wise, a retired GE scientist who has studied the center's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Edison's lab, the scientists had to keep coming up with
something useful.'' Steinmetz's vision was for a research lab where
scientists were sheltered from the pressures of the production line
and business department.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, the laboratory was steeped in a
pragmatism that began, at its founding, with the light bulb. Screw
in one of Thomas Edison's old light bulbs today and -- 100 years
later -- there's a chance it may still light up.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, a lot of the old light bulbs
fizzled out after only a few hours of use. The inconsistency rested
with the filament, the slender thread of material that becomes
incandescent as electricity passes through.
</P>
<P>
   Edison's original light bulbs used carbon, which, while
inexpensive, proved to be a fickle medium for filament. In some
cases, it seemed to burn forever. In others, it burned out within
hours. Carbon filament was also difficult and expensive to
manufacture, involving hammering and shaping individual pieces of
carbon and baking them in a furnace. Despite its shortcomings, the
carbon filament light bulb was brighter and safer than the
gaslights of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But for Edison's company, the fledgling General Electric Co.,
the manufacturing inconsistency was a nagging problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, research laboratories in Europe were working
on ways to improve the light bulb, using metal filaments in place
of carbon. Steinmetz, aware of those developments, stepped up his
lobbying for a research lab to do similar work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to the extreme slowness with which we are moving in this
matter, it appears that the field will be exploited before we start
to do anything therein and we s h a l l b e l e f t b e h i n d,''
Steinmetz wrote in a Sept. 20, 1897, letter to company Vice
President Edwin Rice. For emphasis, he carefully spaced out the
typed letters of the last four words.
</P>
<P>
   Albert P. Davis, a top GE official at the time, made a similar
appeal to Rice, this in a September 1900 letter: ''If someone else
gets ahead of us in this development, we will have to spend large
sums in buying patents or patent rights, whereas if we do the work
ourselves, this necessity will be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate officers, led by Rice, were convinced. That fall,
after several years of lobbying, Steinmetz got the approval he
needed from GE's board of directors to set up a company laboratory
devoted to research.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Davis told an interviewer: ''I was never able to
make up my mind whether the first suggestion for the Research
Laboratory came from Steinmetz or from myself. Looking back on it
now in 1933, I see that it may well be that Steinmetz originated
the idea, and that in his efforts to get Mr. Rice and myself to
endorse it, he was astute enough to make each of us separately feel
himself the originator.''
</P>
<P>
   With his approval in hand, Steinmetz went about the business of
setting up shop. Steinmetz asked for $20,000 to buy equipment for
that first lab.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Drawn to Reclaimed Land  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALONG THE LEBANON-ISRAEL BORDER (AP) -- In villages and wide-open
stretches of hills and valleys that form the Lebanon-Israel
frontier, Lebanese have been drawn to their country's southern edge
to take their first close look at the land they've reclaimed and
the enemy who left.
</P>
<P>
   All traffic seemed to head south in the week after May 24, when
Israel finished withdrawing its troops and ended 22 years operating
in southern Lebanon. Thousands came to the border fence -- the
closest they can get to Israel -- to celebrate, to vent a lifetime
of anger or just to gawk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mommy! An Israeli, mommy!'' a girl of about 5 cried out,
pointing to an Israeli soldier who peeked out from behind a border
outpost less than 30 feet away that was being pelted by
stone-throwers on the Lebanese side.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the occupation, people rarely saw an Israeli so
close. Israel's allied Lebanese militiamen had patrolled villages,
while Israeli soldiers tended to stay closer to their hilltop
bases, out of sight of guerrillas and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, excitement reigned all along more than 60
miles of border fence -- from the disputed Chebaa farms in the
foothills of Mount Hermon in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in
the west.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were reminders that many in Lebanon don't
consider the liberation complete.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors to Chebaa left celebrations in the village behind
for a few quiet moments among the goats grazing near a barbed-wire
fence patrolled by Israeli soldiers. Lebanese want Israel's
withdrawal to include the lands on the other side where Chebaa's
residents once farmed.
</P>
<P>
   Borders between Lebanon and Syria in the area known as Chebaa
farms have never been clear, and the farmland is unlikely to be
returned until Syria and Israel make peace. So for now Lebanese
landowners can approach, but not enter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope and wish that all those people who came here and walked
away will have the chance to come back and walk on their land,''
said Ismail Sharifa, 43, who said his family owns land beyond the
locked yellow gate.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles along the fence to the southwest, across hills dotted
with U.N. checkpoints and blown-up remains of Israeli outposts, a
Hezbollah guerrilla stands as a border guard near the Abbassiyeh
gate, where Lebanese Druse used to cross to work on Israeli farms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the guerrilla says, no one is allowed within 200 yards of
the gate. ''There is no contact with the enemy except with weapons
and steel,'' he says, refusing to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some compromises, however, are required. Checkpoint guards tell
two Druse men they can approach to collect their final pay through
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pullout, the largest groups by far have gathered at
the Kfar Kila border, 12 miles along the fence west of Abbassiyeh
gate, where vendors set up stands selling date rolls, beans and
corn on the cob.
</P>
<P>
   At times, flag-waving celebrations turned violent. On May 28,
Israeli gunfire wounded at least three people during stone-throwing
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to go inside ... to challenge them,'' Fayad Abbas
Uzayer, a 19-year-old Hezbollah supporter said, his face flushed
with excitement after jumping the fence and drawing warning shots
from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   There was more stone-throwing at the site on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles south, Amin Ahmed Mataar, 66, and two dozen children,
grandchildren, nieces and nephews chose a quieter stretch of fence.
Climbing a rusted bedspring to the low roof of an abandoned house
five yards from the border, they looked down on Margoliot, Israel --
built near the village Hannin that Mataar fled at age 14 in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mosque was there. I still remember the mosque,'' Mataar
says, pointing past a sign warning of land mines in Arabic, English
and Hebrew and toward a cluster of trees on a low hill a half mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mataar, who now lives in Nabatiyeh 12 miles to the
north of where they were standing, told his family stories about
his childhood in Hannin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down there was my grandfather's house,'' says 13-year-old Ali
Fawzi Mataar, a nephew of the elder Mataar. ''They were sitting in
their house when the Israelis kicked them out and took our land.
... I want to see it when the Zionists leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Palestinians in Lebanon, the end of Israeli occupation
allows a look at their homeland but doesn't change the dim
prospects for their return.
</P>
<P>
   At a narrow ledge above Doheira, 30 miles further southwest
along the fence, Palestinians whose families fled or were driven
out at Israel's creation in 1948 greeted relatives who stayed on
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Without the buffer zone, relatives who'd never met or hadn't
seen each other in 52 years were reaching through barbed wire to
shake hands, share a pot of coffee and catch up on births,
marriages, deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Maher al-Ali's family once lived in Basa, a village six miles
from where he stood that has since become an industrial zone of the
Israeli community of Shlomi.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the 20-year-old said, he had the chance to
vent his views directly to an Israeli in a conversation with a
soldier through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him this country is for us, not for him, and he said
this country is for him because his grandfather said it was for
him,'' al-Ali said. ''I told him he was a stranger and what is
taken by force will be returned by force.''

<HEADLINE> Boris Yeltsin on Political Sidelines  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- At state ceremonies in Russia these days, it's
common to see former President Boris Yeltsin standing beside his
successor, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Yeltsin walks stiffly to his stretch Mercedes
limousine, still decorated with little Russian flags bearing the
presidential emblem and zooms back home to his retreat outside
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such honors and trappings, the man ceremoniously
referred to as Russia's ''First President'' since he stepped down
on Dec. 31, remains mostly on the political sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is schfile high, said historian Roy
Medvedev, who has written extensively about Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeltsin wants to show he hasn't left the political scene,''
Medvedev said. ''He doesn't want people to forget about him.''
</P>
<P>
   When 69-year-old Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly last December,
aides and family members said he would set up a political
foundation and travel frequently. He was given an office in the
Kremlin and there was talk that he would use his influence abroad
to negotiate on some diplomatic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin named Putin acting president, giving him a huge
advantage in the presidential elections that Putin won in March.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin makes occasional remarks that indicate he still believes
his sway on Russian politics is high.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under my influence, he will not let us down,'' Yeltsin said of
Putin in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's health apparently hasn't gotten any better since
his days as president, when bouts of pneumonia, an ulcer and heart
problems frequently left him hospitalized. Now he sometimes looks
off-balance and his speech is slow and halting. At other times he
seems fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has never criticized Yeltsin, saying that the two keep in
touch and that he's occasionally visited the former president to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin still has authority as a defender of civil freedoms and
reforms, and Putin wants him around to legitimize his own quick
rise to power, said Ekaterina Yegorova, a one-time image consultant
to Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident at Putin's May 7 inauguration, when the crowd
fidgeted through a meandering Yeltsin speech marked by his
customary long pauses. Yet his presence was a powerful symbol for
Putin, Yegorova said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin needs Yeltsin to show he's a man who doesn't forget
history, that he will continue democratic reforms,'' she said.
''That highlights his positive qualities.''

<HEADLINE> Women Pray Aloud at Western Wall  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Dozens of Jewish women, some draped in prayer
shawls, prayed out loud at the Western Wall on Sunday, a week after
parliament passed a bill that would sentence them to seven years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in the adjacent male section at the
site considered most sacred to Jews shouted ''Shame!'' and
''Quiet!'' at the women, as they faced the stone wall that was once
part of the biblical Second Temple compound.
</P>
<P>
   Four men were detained for possessing eggs police said they
planned to throw at the women. No violence was reported, but dozens
of police were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   A bill forbidding women from praying aloud at the wall was
passed last week by a half-full parliament in a preliminary
reading, but would have to pass some half-dozen more legislative
steps before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill directly contradicts a Supreme Court ruling last month
allowing women at the site to read aloud from the Torah, the Jewish
Bible, and don prayer shawls traditionally worn by men. But in
Israel the legislature can pass laws that override Supreme Court
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Orthodox Jewish tradition, men and woman are
separated during prayers. Some Orthodox rabbis have ruled that a
woman's singing voice is lewd, and women must not wear skullcaps,
prayer shawls or phylacteries, traditionally used by men.
</P>
<P>
   Anat Hoffman, a leader of the Women of the Wall group, said that
the women would not give in to the attempts to keep them away from
the holy site. She noted that the women have been praying at the
site at the beginning of every Jewish month for some time. The
group is made up mostly of members of liberal streams of Judaism,
though some activists are Orthodox women.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal streams allow men and women to pray together, and
most recognize religious equality between them. They are a tiny
minority of practicing Jews in Israel, though they represent the
majority of Jews elsewhere. Most Israelis define themselves as
nonreligious.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a big and significant enough group that we should be
allowed to pray here,'' Hoffman said as she held a white prayer
shawl in her hand near the wall. She said several men had
''desecrated the holy site'' by swearing at the women.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman suggested that a timetable be made up to allow groups
with different interests to share the site. The court gave the
government six months to arrange for women to pray without
interference.

<HEADLINE> Japan PM Chided for Military Talk  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Days after apologizing for calling Japan a ''divine
nation,'' Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was criticized again Sunday
for using language associated with the country's militaristic past.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign speech on Saturday night, Mori referred to
Japan as a ''kokutai'' or ''national polity'' -- a now-archaic term
used in the decades leading up to World War II to connote a
Japanese nation-state ruled by a divine emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, used it while criticizing the Japanese Communist Party
for rejecting the emperor's current constitutional role as a symbol
of the state and for opposing Japan's security treaty with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can (such a party) ensure Japan's security and defend the
national polity?'' he said during a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks made front-page headlines in several national
newspapers, and opposition politicians condemned Mori during a
television debate broadcast Sunday on the Asahi network.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a term originally based on the idea of rule by the
emperor,'' said Naoto Kan, a leader of the Democratic Party of
Japan, the country's largest opposition group. ''Why did he use it
specifically?''
</P>
<P>
   Hideyo Fudehisa, chief policy-maker for the Japanese Communist
Party, questioned Mori's leadership credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of language may be acceptable from any person of his
age, but it's not acceptable from the prime minister of this
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shizuka Kamei, a senior member of Mori's Liberal Democratic
Party, blamed the media for ''twisting'' the prime minister's
words.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was unquestionably talking about the (current) national
system,'' Kamei said.
</P>
<P>
   Mori said in a speech later Sunday that he had made a ''slip of
the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was supposed to speak for 30 or 40 minutes and got in
trouble because I ended up talking for more than an hour and made a
slip of the tongue,'' he told an audience in the southwestern city
of Matsuyama.
</P>
<P>
   The government is still reeling from the uproar caused late last
month when Mori called Japan ''a divine nation centered around the
emperor.'' His remarks stirred memories of soldiers marching off to
war in the name of an emperor-god.
</P>
<P>
   Though the prime minister apologized at a news conference on May
26, the controversy has dealt a heavy blow to public support for
his administration just three weeks ahead of national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspaper polls showed Mori's approval ratings tumbling
to 20 percent or lower from about 40 percent when he took office on
April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Last month opposition parties called his ''divine nation''
statement ''unconstitutional'' and demanded he resign.
</P>
<P>
   The emperor was reduced to symbolic status by Japan's 1946
constitution, which provides for the separation of church and
state.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fields Russians' Questions  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton fielded curious Russians'
questions Sunday about how he made his first dollar, whether he was
tempted to use the police against the media -- and would he mind
being ''first mister'' if his wife Hillary ever becomes president?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to relax and enjoy himself in the informal
setting of a 25-minute call-in show in the studio of Echo of Moscow
Radio, which followed formal talks at Kremlin with President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians appeared eager to hear about Clinton's
personal life -- information they rarely get from their own leaders,
including Putin. Hundreds of people had sent in questions hours in
advance by e-mail and by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave patient, easy answers to questions such as how he
earned his first dollar (cutting lawns) and whether he was
satisfied with daughter Chelsea's progress in college (he is).
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and got a bit red in the face when asked by show host
Aleksei Venediktov ''are you ready to return to the White House as
the spouse of the president, as First Mister?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was proud of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for Senate from New York. He said his wife had promised to
serve a full term if elected.
</P>
<P>
   After that, ''If she wants to continue in public life, I'll
support her in any way I can,'' said Clinton. Clinton added that he
expects Vice President Gore to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed shocked when asked by Venediktov if he'd even
been tempted to crack down on journalists. ''Could you ask the tax
authorities to audit CNN?'' asked Venediktov.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never did that ... That would be illegal,'' Clinton said
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station belongs to the Media-MOST group, which was
raided May 11 by ski-masked police investigating allegations the
group's security service was bugging people. MOST head Vladimir
Gusinsky says the company was being punished for critical coverage
of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   There were no queries about Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who has received extensive
media attention in Russia, although questions submitted about her
appeared on the station's website.
</P>
<P>
   One listener wanted to know when was the last time Clinton
handled cash. ''About an hour ago,'' said Clinton. ''I'm going to
dinner after I talk to you, so I brought my money with me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mood was generally positive, some callers betrayed the
suspicion that colors many ordinary Russians' opinions on the
United States and reflect their country's poverty and loss of world
power.
</P>
<P>
   Denis from Samara asked whether Clinton considered Russia a
Third World country. ''No... no!'' said Clinton. ''Russia was badly
hurt by the recent economic crisis'' but wasn't a Third World
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the radio interview Sunday, the NTV television station
aired its popular satirical puppet show ''Kukly,'' which showed
Putin, an ex-KGB officer, dream that he recruits Clinton to the
Russian secret services.
</P>
<P>
   Putin tells Clinton that if he doesn't join, the American people
will learn that he avoided the draft and other secrets. Clinton
laughs, telling him America already knows all there is to know
about him.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Israeli Boy Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By EYAL WARSHAVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOD, Israel (AP) -- A 12-year-old Israeli boy who was kept in
horrifying conditions in a cold, wet basement in southern Russia
for nine months and maimed by his kidnappers returned home on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Looking thin and pale, Adi Sharon smiled at relatives waiting
for him at the Ben Gurion Airport as he was carried on a stretcher
to a waiting ambulance. He was taken to Tel-Hashomer hospital,
outside Tel Aviv. He was also met by the minister for immigration
and absorption, Yuli Tamir, foreign ministry officials and a crush
of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, the head of the children's intensive care unit,
Dr. Zohar Barzilai, said Adi was hemorrhaging on the flight from
Moscow and was in a very poor nutritional state. ''He looks
frightened, pale, tired and worried, but he is fully conscious. He
speaks quite freely,'' Barzilai told Channel 2 television.
</P>
<P>
   Adi was in ''moderately serious'' condition, said Alexander
Valerin, head of the Russian Interior Ministry hospital where the
boy was treated after his release, adding that it could take months
for him to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Adi was rescued Friday in the town of Penza, about 350 miles
southeast of the Russian capital of Moscow. He had come to Moscow
in August to visit his father, who was there on business, when he
was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Yosef, was also captured, but freed a few days
later on condition that he pay $8 million for his son's release.
</P>
<P>
   Adi was held in a narrow, sometimes cold and wet pit in a
basement, his feet shackled, Russian and Israeli news reports said.
Kidnappers cut off parts of the little fingers on both his hands
and sent them to his father as demands for ransom payments.
</P>
<P>
   Video footage broadcast on Russian television Friday showed
police pulling the trembling boy out of a basement filled with
trash. Adi's feet were wrapped in plastic bags and rags, and
Israeli news reports said gangrene had set in.
</P>
<P>
   Adi was severely emaciated, doctors said. He could not stand or
walk when he was taken out of the basement, according to Russian
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak praised Russian President
Vladimir Putin for his role in the rescue, saying Adi's release
showed that the two countries are on the same wavelength when it
comes to fighting terrorism ''with determination and seriousness
and without wavering.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why it took the Russian authorities so long to rescue the
boy, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo -- who accompanied
the boy from Moscow to Israel -- said Russia is much bigger than
Israel and a large number of people were involved in the
''conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear whether any ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen people have been detained in Moscow, Penza and the
Caucasus Mountains republic of Ingushetia -- next to the breakaway
region of Chechnya -- on suspicion of being involved in the
kidnapping, Russian news reports said. The reports said several of
the suspects were from Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Tsunami Feared Off Island Sumatra  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A great earthquake, capable of causing massive
damage, struck Sunday off the Indonesian island Sumatra, and the
U.S. Geological Survey said it was likely to have caused a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's Carolyn Bell said the quake was measured at
magnitude 7.9 and occurred at 11:28 p.m. local time, or 12:28 p.m.
EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The shock was felt strongly at Benjkulu, 70 miles
north-northeast of the epicenter, where it could have caused
''major structural damage,'' she said. It also was felt as far away
as Jakarta, the capital, 335 miles north-northwest of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the epicenter was 33 kilometers -- almost 20{ miles --
beneath the Earth's surface, very shallow in geological terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It set up a possible tsunami situation in the area of the
Indian Ocean, where there are no warning systems,'' she said. ''If
tsunami were going to happen, it has already happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A tsunami is a massive wave caused by an earthquake or volcanic
eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven minutes after the original shock, an aftershock was
recorded at magnitude 6.7, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the first quake and the aftershock were larger than the
largest temblor in recent years in the area. In 1995, a 6.4
earthquake occurred there.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Japanese As Healthiest  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The Japanese have the best prospects for long and
active lives, while Americans lag behind because of miserable
standards among the U.S. poor -- who fare worse than many Africans,
the World Health Organization said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese can expect 74{ years of healthy life, according to a
WHO study that measures ''disability-adjusted'' life expectancy,
subtracting years according to the prevalence and severity of
ailments ranging from malaria to lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, at 73.2 years, came second, followed by France,
Sweden, Spain and Italy. The United States, which spends the most
on health, rated only 24th, with an expectancy of 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, whose people can expect less than 26 years of good
health, was at the bottom of the WHO list. The 23 lowest ranked
countries among the 191 WHO members were all in sub-Saharan Africa,
hit by the AIDS epidemic, malaria and other tropical diseases, poor
nutrition and unsafe water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Healthy life expectancy in some African countries is dropping
back to levels we haven't seen in advanced countries since medieval
times,'' said Chris Murray, director of the U.N. agency's global
program on evidence for health policy. AIDS has cut five years or
more from African life expectancy in the past decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the WHO said global life expectancy averaged 64.5 years
in 1999, six years more than two decades ago. But its study focused
on healthy life expectancy rather than the number of years spent
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the U.N. agency decided to switch to the healthy
life assessment as a better indicator for the real state of health
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a real concern that (people) are spending those
extra years of life in bed disabled,'' Murray said. But ''the
countries at the top of the list are getting a double bonus --
they're living longer and they're spending more of their time in
good health.''
</P>
<P>
   The WHO said Japan's traditional low fat diet and low lung
disease rates have been key factors in its top position, but it
appears to be losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Second-placed Australia ''is on its way up,'' Murray said,
having reduced smoking, campaigned effectively against the spread
of the AIDS virus and cut road accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States, which spends the most on health, stands out
as not doing as well as they should be,'' although rich Americans
class as the world's healthiest people, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom 2{ percent of Americans have health life expectancies
characteristic of sub-Saharan Africa in the 1950s, according to
Murray. ''Native Americans, poor rural black populations and some
of the inner city populations have terrible health status,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally high rates of tobacco-related disease and high
homicide and injury rates also dragged down the U.S. score, said
Alan Lopez, coordinator of WHO's epidemiology team.
</P>
<P>
   According to WHO figures, 56 million people died across the
world last year, 10.5 million of them children under 5. Developing
countries accounted for 98 percent of the child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While noncommunicable diseases resulted in 33.5 million deaths
worldwide -- more than half the total -- they were responsible for
only one in five deaths in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Cite Terrorist Threat  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir
Putin acknowledged ''a dangerous and growing threat'' of nuclear
attack from emerging powers such as North Korea but failed to agree
Sunday on how to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a joint news conference in the Kremlin that he
doesn't believe a missile defense system like the one he is
considering ''is a threat to strategic stability and mutual
deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian side disagrees,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're against having a cure which is worse than the disease,''
Putin said, tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the document signed by both leaders left open the
possibility for modifications in the ABM Treaty down the road ''to
preserve strategic stability in the face of new threats.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials characterized that as an important concession on
Russia's part.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the two leaders -- meeting in the
Kremlin for the first time since Putin was sworn in last month --
adopted a statement pledging intensified cooperation on
missile-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've asked our experts to keep working to narrow the
differences, and to develop a series of cooperative measures to
address the missile threat,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that he still hasn't made a decision on whether
to go ahead with such a system, which would be aimed at protecting
U.S. shores against attack from North Korea, Iran or other states
with a nuclear weapons potential. He has said he will decide later
this year whether it is feasible and worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also signed agreements putting in force
initiatives begun by Clinton and former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin: To reduce weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles by 34 tons
each; and to set up a joint center in Moscow to monitor missile
launches.
</P>
<P>
   These are ''major steps to reduce the nuclear danger,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin appeared to hit it off fine, even if they
weren't yet on a first-name basis.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of talks, Clinton said he believes Putin, a
former KGB official, ''is fully capable of building a prosperous,
strong Russia.'' Putin said Clinton is ''a person who is a very
comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a proposed limited national missile defense -- and
the changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty that would be
required to accommodate it -- was a top issue on the agenda for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had lowered expectations for a breakthrough
in advance of the session, and none was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton
that Russia continues to oppose changes to the ABM Treaty that the
United States has proposed since last September,'' Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who is also Clinton's special adviser on Russia, said
the summit produced ''neither a dead end ... nor a destination'' on
the subject of missile defense. He said Putin was clearly sensitive
to the threat from so-called rogue regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world that is covered by the ABM treaty changed very
vividly on August 31, 1998, when the North Koreans fired that
missile,'' Talbott said, referring to the multistage missile fired
by North Korea that passed over Japan and fell into the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint statement, Clinton and Putin agreed that ''the
international community faces a dangerous and growing threat of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery, including missiles and missile technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The missile shield concept also has critics in the United
States, from arms control activists worried about a new arms race
to conservatives who favor a more ambitious program along the lines
envisioned by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's proposal for a space-based missile defense program was
ridiculed by Democrats at the time as ''Star Wars.'' Clinton, an
earlier opponent of such a system, last year reversed course to
support a limited missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, who favors a
more expansive program, had urged Clinton to leave negotiations
with Putin to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin took notice of the U.S. presidential campaigns, saying,
''We're familiar with the programs of the two main candidates.'' He
suggested he was willing to improve US-Russian ties ''no matter who
gets to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reiterated U.S. opposition to the continuing
Russian military crackdown in the separatist region of Chechnya.
They talked about tensions in the Balkans, and Russia's economic
plight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that although they couldn't agree on everything,
the two presidents at least explained their differences with
''clarity and candor. And I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking through an interpreter, said the talks were
''very candid, very open, and very topical.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders and top aides met in the Kremlin's ornate St.
Catherine's Hall, and the wrap-up news conference was held nearby
in St. George's Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Between sessions, Clinton and Putin took a 50-minute walk around
the gardens in the Kremlin, which is a walled city in the heart of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton got in some sightseeing, visiting a newly
reconstructed Russian Orthodox church, Christ the Savior. The
original church had been destroyed in the 1930s by the Communist
regime and replaced by a municipal swimming pool.

<HEADLINE> Wesley Snipes' Camp Plan Hits Snag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga. (AP) -- Wesley Snipes' plan to convert a 300-acre
farm into a training camp for security guards has hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   The Putnam County Planning and Zoning Board upheld an
inspector's rejection of an application to build a training camp on
the farm, which is now owned by local contractor Stanley Bishop and
zoned for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's attorney said Friday he would appeal the decision to
the County Commission, saying his client's application should be
judged on its own merit, not on the plans of a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wesley Snipes' involvement is irrelevant with regard to these
proceedings,'' David Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Snipes have confirmed that the actor is
negotiating with Bishop to buy the land. Snipes' half brother, Rudy
Snipes, attended Thursday's appeal hearing but did not participate,
said Marianne Tanner, Putnam County registrar and administrative
assistant to the zoning board.
</P>
<P>
   Victor McGauley, vice president of the actor's Los Angeles-based
film production company, Amen Ra Films, said Snipes wants to
reassure people that ''this is a good company and a good project.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Checks Blocked 204,000 Sales  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Background checks blocked 204,000 of the more
than 8.6 million prospective gun sales last year, according to a
Justice Department report that shows state and local police
rejected a higher percentage of would-be gun buyers than the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 figures brought the number of purchase rejections since
the Brady Act instituted background checks in February 1994 to
536,000 out of almost 22.3 million applications, the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics reported. That confirmed earlier
estimates of more than 500,000 rejections.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's report provided the first hard numbers on the
differences between checks by state and local police and those by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI performed 4.5 million of the 8.6 million last year,
compared with 4.1 million by state and local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection rate among state and local agencies was 3 percent,
compared with 1.8 percent for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The report attributed this difference to state agencies' access
to more detailed criminal history records than the FBI's. In 1999,
73 percent of rejections were because would-be buyers had been
convicted of or indicted on felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the report said, all state agencies had access to
''computer databases that record past felony convictions, and many
accessed databases with other disqualifying information such as
fugitive status, court restraining orders, mental illness and
domestic violence misdemeanor convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration long has argued that the states are
better equipped than the FBI to do background checks, but some
states have not wanted to pay the costs. Twenty-six states handle
some or all their checks.
</P>
<P>
   The overall national rejection rate has remained 2.4 percent
since 1994, despite the Nov. 30, 1998, switch to computerized
instant checks and the addition then of checks on long-gun
purchasers. Only handgun buyers were checked before.
</P>
<P>
   A second statistics bureau report largely recapped data already
released by the Justice Department during its debate with the
National Rifle Association over gun controls during the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The gun owners' group opposed President Clinton's gun control
proposals and argued federal prosecutors were not enforcing
existing gun laws. The administration said federal prosecutors were
focusing on serious offenders and shifting smaller cases to state
and local prosecutors and that combined gun prosecutions were up.
</P>
<P>
   The report said preliminary 1999 data showed 6,728 defendants
were charged with federal firearms offenses, up from 6,287 in 1998.
It also showed that between 1992 and 1997 the number of federal
firearms defendants decreased 19 percent, from 7,621 to 5,993.
</P>
<P>
   The report attributed part of this decline to the Supreme
Court's 1995 Bailey vs. United States decision limiting
prosecutors' ability to charge defendants with using a firearm
during a violent or drug offense. It estimated that 2,500 more
defendants would have been charged with illegal gun possession
between 1995 and 1998 if the court had ruled differently.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said prosecutors compensated by seeking longer
sentences for weapon use.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said that
since 1992, combined state and federal gun prosecutions grew by
more than 22 percent. When final data are assembled, ''the number
of people charged with federal gun crimes in 1999 should be equal
to the number of people charged in 1992, even though there has been
a dramatic drop in gun crimes during that period,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the number of federal firearms offenders
sentenced to more than five years in prison is up more than 41
percent, and the average sentence rose by almost two years between
1992 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Five Die in Russia-Chechen Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHALI, Russia (AP) -- Military troops on Sunday raided a home
where suspected Chechen rebels were hiding, triggering a shootout
in which five people were killed, two of them Russian soldiers, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The troops used an armored personnel carrier and other vehicles
to smash through a fence of the home in the Chechen town of Shali.
A hail of gunfire came from inside the house, killing one soldier
and a colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service, the official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians returned fire, killing three people, including the
target of the raid -- Musa Dzhamalkhanov. Three women were also
wounded, and two unidentified people in the house were detained.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why the Russians wanted to arrest Dzhamalkhanov.
The official said he had fought in the previous Chechen conflict in
1994-96, but not in the ongoing one.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rebels fired on a government convoy on a major
Chechen highway and severely wounded a Russian soldier, the
military said Sunday. The convoy of trucks from the Emergency
Situations Ministry had been heading west from the Chechen capital,
Grozny, to the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   The highway through the forest has become increasingly dangerous
for Russian forces, as rebels continue their hit-and-run attacks,
undercutting Russian claims that the organized rebel resistance has
been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery bombarded the forest where the rebels escaped
after the attack Saturday night in the western Samashki region.
Commandos searching for rebels in the forest Sunday found and
defused several mines laid by the retreating militants, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   The military claimed to have destroyed 10 rebel bases since
Saturday, and said federal forces in Grozny had arrested three
female snipers and the owner of the apartment they used as a base.
The claims could not be independently confirmed; the military has
often exaggerated its success in destroying rebel forces and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The military conceded on Saturday that as many as 500 rebels
were in Grozny, even though the Russians took control of the city
more than four months ago.

   Russian warplanes continued Sunday to bomb suspected rebel
hide-outs in the woods in the Nozhai-Yurt region, near Chechnya's
eastern border with Dagestan. The planes were shelling suspected
bases in the southern Argun and Vedeno gorges, which serve as vital
rebel supply routes to Georgia in the south -- the only foreign
country bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were driven out of Chechnya in the 1994-96 war.
They re-entered in September, after Islamic militants based in the
breakaway republic crossed over into the region of Dagestan and
seized several villages.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Clinton Get Along  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Nobody heard them call each other ''Bill'' and
''Volodya,'' but the leaders of the United States and Russia had no
apparent trouble getting along at their first summit.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin,
reserved smiles replaced the gripping embraces and boisterous good
humor of Clinton's meetings with former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, whom he planned to see again before leaving Russia on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, President Clinton is a ... person who is a very
comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiations,'' Putin said at a
news conference with Clinton at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was less personal in response to the same question on
how the two leaders view each other: ''If you want to know what my
personal assessment is, I think he is fully capable of building a
prosperous and strong Russia while preserving freedom, pluralism,
and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin called each other ''Bill'' and ''Boris,''
and when Putin met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori in St.
Petersburg on April 29, the two called each Other ''Yoshi'' and
''Volodya.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. officials, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, denied any significance to the fact that Clinton and
Putin did not use first names -- at least not in their first meeting
-- and brushed off a question about the chemistry between the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a very easy-going nature to the conversation. It was
quite clear that they knew each other, that they knew a lot about
each other's positions, and they were very interested in hearing
directly from each other about each other's positions,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner together Saturday night, Clinton and Putin held
formal talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both came out praising the talents of the other, with Putin
being the more lavish.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everyone behaves the way President Clinton has behaved, not
trying to find dead ends and problems, but to seek ways of moving
ahead, I think between us in the future our relations really will
be successful,'' Putin said, speaking in Russian with a translator.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two leaders established ''not only good business
ties, but also personal relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed his ''really serious work'' with Putin and
reserved the warmest praise for Putin's ability to express candid
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expressed our differences with clarity and candor, and I,
for one, appreciate that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin made it clear his intention of having good relations with
America go beyond any personal relationship with Clinton, pointedly
saying he knew the positions of the main U.S. presidential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton passes the baton, he said, ''no matter who gets to
be president, we're willing to go forward on either one of these
approaches.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor takes HMO to court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A surgeon has filed a lawsuit on behalf of
doctors throughout the New Jersey, accusing the state's largest
managed care plan of harassing doctors who decide not to join its
provider network.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, pending in state Superior Court in Somerville,
claims Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey refuses to
directly pay the doctors on claims for services. The lawsuit
charges Horizon pays its network doctors directly but sends
payments for services by non-network doctors to their patients. The
doctors then must collect the money from the patients, a situation
that creates an additional cost the doctors must bear, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vessa, the Bedminster surgeon who filed the lawsuit, said
he hopes the lawsuit will be granted class-action status to cover
all doctors in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Vessa, 42, opened his practice seven years ago and said he at
first joined every plan he could. But he said he eventually came to
feel the quality of care he was able to offer patients was limited
because of pressure from insurers. Vessa said the atmosphere
eventually caused him and his business partner to drop out of the
plans. He said he wants insurers to treat in-network providers and
out-of-network providers as equals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shouldn't be financially penalized for a decision on how
you want to practice,'' Vessa told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Sunday's editions. ''I'm still as busy, but I feel a lot better
when I walk out of the (examining) room that I haven't shorted
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Horizon will dispute Vessa's claim, said Fred Hillman, a
company spokesman. Hillman also said the company's would ask that
Vessa's lawsuit be dismissed because it has no merit and because it
doesn't qualify as a class action.
</P>
<P>
   About 12,100 physicians are affiliated with Horizon's managed
care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vessa, many doctors in New Jersey, especially specialist
surgeons, say they have reduced their enrollment in managed health
care plans in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lospinuso, a spine surgeon who practices in Red Bank,
said he has been dropping out of some managed care plans because of
hassles including shrinking reimbursements and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the aggravation, the lack of reward, the disgruntlement
of the patients. It delays the care; it delays the outcome,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vessa's lawsuit comes at a time when medical groups are
increasingly willing to fight insurers in court and in
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of angst out there,'' said Robert Conroy,
special counsel to the New Jersey Medical Society. ''There will
probably be a lot of other suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langevin, president of the New Jersey Association of Health
Plans, which represents nine of the state's biggest health
insurers, said he has seen an increase in lobbying on part of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Association is suing that state's three
largest for-profit health insurers, claiming the companies have
forced doctors to provide less-than-adequate health care to
patients. That lawsuit, filed last month in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco, claims the companies impose unfair contract terms,
deny and delay payments for medically necessary treatments and
deliberately underpay doctors. The CMA also charges the companies
with fraud under the civil provisions of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit similar to the one in California has been
filed against health insurance companies in Alabama.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Spar Over Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's expected arrival in the Middle East, Israel and the
Palestinians exchanged sharp words that could bode ill for the
latest U.S. efforts to revive the flagging peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak repeated accusations Sunday
that the Palestinians were dragging their feet, and said he had
instructed his negotiators to refrain for now from discussing what
may be the most explosive issue between the two sides: the status
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat retorted angrily that the city
belongs on the agenda of so-called final status talks, which are
meant to resolve crucial disputes including the borders of a future
Palestinian state, the fate of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian
refugees, and Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians
claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The final status issues include Jerusalem, and whoever doesn't
like it can go drink from the sea,'' Arafat told reporters in the
West Bank town of Ramallah. ''Jerusalem will be the capital of a
Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tensions, far-right Jewish settlers have been
using increasingly inflammatory rhetoric in recent days to try to
forestall the uprooting of settlements in the West Bank as part of
any peace pact with the Palestinians. Some settlers have accused
Barak of treason and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Security surrounding Barak has been beefed up as a result of
threats, Israeli media said, and one alarmed Cabinet member,
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, on Sunday likened the
climate to that preceding the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing nationalist opposed to territorial
concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself told his ministers that he believed that settlers
understand that ''pivotal historical processes can't be stopped
with acts of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson met separately with Arafat
and Barak on Sunday and offered to host another round of
negotiations in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were holding talks in the Swedish capital until
last month, when Barak summoned his negotiators home after a
firebombing attack in the West Bank town of Jericho that critically
injured an Israeli toddler.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have since met again at an undisclosed location in the
Middle East. Arafat said after meeting Persson that he hoped talks
could return to Stockholm, though Barak was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Israeli army lifted a ban Sunday on Israelis and
foreign nationals entering the Palestinian-controlled parts of
Hebron. That ended a ban imposed across the West Bank after the
Jericho firebomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Barak met with his government ministers and
accused the Palestinians of causing ''backward progress'' in the
peace talks by engaging in ''strange'' behavior, a Cabinet
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister emphasized that the Palestinians are
foot-dragging,'' the statement added. Senior Arafat adviser Nabil
Abourdeneh accused Israel of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also characterized talks with the Palestinians as ''still
in the initial phase'' and said because of that, he had told his
negotiators ''not to hold discussions at this point on Jerusalem.''
Israel insists that the city will never be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's schedule was still being finalized, but her arrival
was tentatively set for Monday afternoon or evening, with separate
meetings with Barak and Arafat expected to begin that evening or
the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said time was growing short to meet a mid-September
deadline for a peace accord, and Abourdeneh urged the Clinton
administration to pressure Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met Sunday to
discuss Palestinian demands to release some of the 1,600
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel for anti-Israeli activity.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf
nations held talks to discuss the Middle East peace process, as
well as international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa hailed Israel's withdrawal
from southern Lebanon last month, but said the Arab nations backed
Syria's demand for a return of the Golan Heights, occupied by
Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait are also attending the two-day meeting --
members of the Damascus Declaration security and economic pact
reached with Syria and Egypt in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldiers Honored in French Town  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERIERS, France (AP) -- World War II veterans and their families
honored the U.S. 90th Infantry Division on Sunday, commemorating a
monument to the more than 1,000 men it lost in bloody battles to
liberate this Normandy town.
</P>
<P>
   Aging veterans saluted as a U.S. Army cloth was lifted from
''the four brave'' -- a life-sized bronze statue of four young
Americans killed near Periers before Hitler's army was driven out
of the town on July 27, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives, some of whom knew the four soldiers only from
black-and-white photos, stood weeping as they took video of the
unveiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never knew my father. I've only seen pictures of him,'' said
Ann S. Giese, 55, of Oahu, Hawaii, who was born six months after
her father, Sergeant Andrew Speese, died. She laid a wreath around
the neck of the statue modeled after her father. ''It's a very good
likeness, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   In another war-era ceremony, Britain's Prince Charles joined
aging veterans to mark the 60th anniversary of the Dunkirk
evacuation -- the stunning operation to whisk some 338,000 Allied
soldiers under German siege across the English channel to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the ceremony will be the last, since the Dunkirk Veterans
Association is going to disband after losing more men to old age.
</P>
<P>
   An 81-year-old veteran, Walter Darvill, of Pontefract, West
Yorkshire, collapsed and died at Sunday's ceremony at Dunkirk,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Periers, the monument was unveiled on a grassy plot in front
of the town hall. It depicts Virgil Tangborn, a medic from Bemidji,
Minn., helping the wounded Speese, of Philadelphia. Watching over
them is soldier Richard Richtman, of Minneapolis, as Sergeant
Tullio Micaloni, of Oneida, Penn., gestures for his tank crew to
roll forward.
</P>
<P>
   The four represent the approximately 1,140 soldiers from the
90th Division who died in the assault to push German troops from
the area around Periers. The first Allied bombing of the town ahead
of the assault was on June 8, 1944, and by the time the town was
liberated it was bombed to ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Periers sat in the middle of the German supply road and also
provided Hitler's army with an escape route to the northern port of
Cherbourg, some 40 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   ''These men gave so much to us,'' said Henri Levaufre, 70, a
lifelong resident of Periers, a town of 2,600, and president of a
French-American group named after the 90th Division that raised
$50,000 to fund the monument's construction. ''Whatever I can do in
return is nothing compared to what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a memorial to every soldier who has taken up arms
against tyranny,'' said U.S. Gen. David Bockel, commander of the
90th Regional Support Command, based in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a U.S. Army marching band led some 50 veterans and
family members through the town streets following a Mass in the
town's vaulted 13th century stone church, rebuilt after Allied
bombings that reduced it to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 people gathered outside the church for the monument's
unveiling, part of a three-day ceremony ahead of the 56th D-Day
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before the June 6, 1944, D-Day landing at Normandy,
Allied troops had been beaten back by German forces and were
trapped on the beaches at Dunkirk. That prompted an impromptu
armada of minesweepers, destroyers, fishing vessels and tugs that
ferried the 338,000 British, French and Belgian soldiers across the
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 800 former soldiers, some in wheelchairs,
others holding flags high, lined Dunkirk's town square as Prince
Charles spoke about the stunning evacuation, which brought hope
amid defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This miracle, which permitted the United Kingdom to fight on,
was a magnificent piece of improvisation supported by countless
acts of individual courage by British and French soldiers,'' the
prince told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat at Dunkirk had been shattering. But Operation Dynamo,
as the flotilla was called, offered light amid the darkness. The
term ''Dunkirk spirit'' has come to mean persistence and hope in
the toughest circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rescued soldiers went on to serve during other key
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without Dunkirk, there wouldn't have been a D-Day,'' Prince
Charles told the vets. ''We must recognize the evacuation of
Dunkirk for what it was: a miracle.''

<P>
   The Royals rallied to win after Jerry Spradlin gave up a

<P>
   Jason Rakers (2-0) got three outs for the win. Dan Reichert came

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 15, Mets 5  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitching in the American League, Esteban Yan
never had to swing a bat before. After Sunday, he could get to like
this National League custom.
</P>
<P>
   Yan hit the first pitch of his first professional at-bat for a
home run and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays routed the New York Mets
15-5.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Martinez, who also had never homered before in the majors,
connected on the pitch before Yan hit his homer. Bubba Trammell
added his third pinch-hit home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff got his 2,000th career hit and Gerald Williams had
three doubles and four RBIs for the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was 10 years old in the Dominican Republic, I played
catcher and outfield, but I never had a professional at-bat, not
even in the minors,'' Yan said. ''I hit the ball well and I was
hoping it would be two bases, so I was running hard. (Coach) Jose
Cardenal said it's going, so then I slowed down. It's going, I
might as well taken my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yan's homer was a stunner, but not to manager Larry Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitched batting practice to him in the minors,'' he said.
''I thought he had a chance the way he could swing. I didn't expect
that, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the victim, loser Bobby J. Jones (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he felt he had his best fastball and best slider that
he's had this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Against Martinez, I left a fastball over the plate,'' he said.
''The next guy never had a bat in his hands. I tried to make a good
pitch and he hit it. Anyone with a bat in his hands is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez homered with two outs in the Tampa Bay second after
Jones walked John Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   Yan (3-3), batting because there's no DH in interleague games at
NL parks, hit the next pitch into the left-field bullpen for a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came back in their half of the second when Mike Piazza
walked and scored on Jay Payton's fourth home run. New York tied it
in the third when Kurt Abbott was hit by a pitch and scored on
Piazza's double off the glove of left fielder Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing opened the Mets fifth with a triple and scored on
Piazza's sacrifice fly for a 4-3 lead, but the Devil Rays came
right back, batting around and scoring five runs in the sixth on
just three hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' two-run double capped the big inning as the Devil Rays
rallied for the victory. Vaughn opened with an infield single,
McGriff walked and Flaherty hit an RBI single that tied it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo walked, loading the bases and then reliever Pat
Mahomes walked Martinez, forcing in the go-ahead run. Pinch-hitter
Jose Guillen bounced out, scoring Flaherty, and Williams doubled
for two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Williams delivered a sacrifice fly and Russ
Johnson had an RBI single before Trammell's homer as Tampa added
five more runs against reliever Rich Rodriguez following an error
by Abbott at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The scoreboard identified Tampa Bay rookie Steve Cox as the
active leader in grand slams with 14. That distinction belongs to
Robin Ventura of the Mets. The oversight was corrected in Ventura's
first at-bat. ... The Mets have at least one home run in 25 of the
last 31 games and 14 homers in the last eight games. ... McGriff
hit his 400th career home run Friday night at Shea Stadium.

   With third baseman Willie Greene playing back, Halter dropped a

   Lieber, who lost 1-0 to Greg Maddux and Atlanta his last start,
has allowed three runs and seven hits in his last 17 innings, but
is 0-1 in the two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Greene hit his sixth home run with two outs in the second off
Tigers starter Brian Moehler to open the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez singled to lead off the fourth and Higginson
followed with his sixth home run to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who had missed three games before this series because
of a strained left foot, then left the game because he had fouled a
ball off his foot. His status was day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and two outs in the Cubs fifth, Eric Young hit an
RBI double to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler gave up two runs and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In three games back after being sidelined for three games,
Gonzalez was 4-for-9 with a triple and RBI. He was batting .358
(24-for-67) in a 17-game stretch since May 12. ... Detroit hitting
coach and former Cub Bill Madlock sang ''Take Me Out to the
Ballgame'' during the seventh inning stretch.

<HEADLINE> Cheers, boos and a handshake as candidates do Israel parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton shook hands with her past
and present opponents in the Senate race at the Salute to Israel
parade on Sunday, but she was dogged by hecklers throughout the
22-block march along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Clinton campaign volunteers turned out to cheer her,
but they were largely drowned out by cries of ''Go home, Hillary!''
</P>
<P>
   ''The first lady should be marching in the parade for Yasser
Arafat,'' said Ron Torossian, an Israeli immigrant who lives in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Torossian and other critics remain angry at Clinton because she
sat silently last year while Arafat's wife, Soha, accused the
Israelis of using ''poison gas'' against the Palestinians. Clinton
and Mrs. Arafat embraced at the conclusion of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Kisses Terrorists,'' said one sign. ''Hillary loves
Soha,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, cheers abounded for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his
successor as the GOP Senate candidate, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!'' shouted Dan Lindenfeld of Woodmere as
Clinton strolled by. Reminded that the mayor is no longer running,
he said, ''What's his name? La-zi-o!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shook hands with the mayor and Lazio at the parade
reviewing stand. It was the first time Clinton and Lazio had met
since he entered the race two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him how he was doing, asked him how his daughters were
enjoying the campaign,'' Clinton said. ''We just exchanged some
pleasantries. It was a really nice occasion. We were stressing the
need for bipartisan, non-partisan, above-partisanship support for
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before the parade with Giuliani, Lazio said
he stood ''four-square behind Israel ... our strongest and only
democratic partner in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   He endorsed the plan to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel, which
is now in Tel Aviv, to ''the undivided capital of the state of
Israel, Jerusalem.'' Clinton holds the same position.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of a Palestinian state, Lazio said: ''I have
some serious questions about whether or not a Palestinian state is
sustainable, considering the security concerns of the state of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Before running for the Senate, Clinton said a Palestinian state
was ''important,'' but more recently she has said it should be
decided in negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But she did take a swipe at Lazio's courting the endorsement of
the Independence Party, which is the state arm of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how anybody who would wish to represent all of New
York could be on a ticket with Pat Buchanan,'' she said. ''I
roundly reject his anti-Semitism and his prejudicial comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also shrugged off the boos she got from parade-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who support you and people who don't,'' she
said. ''That's part of America. One of the great experiences of
anybody running for office in our country is you know you've got to
go out and earn every vote and convince people that you're right on
the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Two couples from Brooklyn watched the candidates pass by with
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Kaplan said she was undecided about Lazio but would never
support Clinton. ''What do I think of Hillary? You don't want to
know,'' she said. ''I don't think she belongs here. What does she
know about New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Stanley, said he supported Clinton's support for
the Mideast peace process -- including her earlier support for a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's right in line with my view of the world,'' said Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends, Norman and Phyllis Weiss, are backing Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't support Hillary because she has a lot to prove, that
she's not just a carpetbagger,'' Norman Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Giuliani, Clinton and Lazio attended the
Philippines Independence Day parade. Lazio worked the crowd dressed
in a traditional embroidered white shirt called a barong, while
Clinton was greeted by a group of scantily clad tribal drummers.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady began Sunday at the annual breakfast for the
Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a non-partisan organization
that has worked in the past with Lazio on housing issues.
</P>
<P>
   The group traditionally bars anyone but elected officials from
speaking at the breakfast, but Met Council director William
Rapfogel said he was informed by the first lady's office that her
position is equivalent to that of an elected official. The group's
board of directors then agreed that she could speak.
</P>
<P>
   Before Giuliani was elected mayor, he was denied permission to
speak at the breakfast.

<HEADLINE> Corzine and Florio exchange barbs on final weekend  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Trading recriminations to the end,
Democrats Jon Corzine and Jim Florio marked the final weekend of
their Senate primary battle by sparring over Corzine's spending and
a brochure produced by Florio backers.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, during a public schedule spanning 13 hours on Sunday,
accused Corzine of trying to use his personal wealth to buy a seat
in the U.S. Senate. Corzine, on pace to spend a record-breaking $33
million on the Senate primary, said people are concerned with money
from special interests, not from a candidate's own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest dustup, Corzine complained about a four-page
brochure distributed by the Camden County Democratic organization,
which supports Florio. The brochure alleges a link between Corzine
and slavery because Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. financed an oil venture in
Sudan during Corzine's tenure at the Wall Street investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell Jon Corzine not to profit from slavery in Africa!'' reads
its cover.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine called the mailing untrue, divisive and an indication
the Florio camp believes ''you need to be negative'' in order to
win African-American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he had nothing to do with preparation of the
brochure but defended its tone and substance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The linkage between his efforts and these activities that are
reprehensible is fairly clear,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing for support in Tuesday's primary, Florio courted
minority, senior and labor votes during morning stops in Burlington
County.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Boyea of Roebling, who heard Florio address the Burlington
County AFL-CIO Central Labor Council meeting, said he supports
Florio's government record and opposes Corzine's campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are tired of big money and big business. Corzine has
just about admitted he's buying this thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fuel a voter backlash, Florio prepared his supporters
for an unprecedented get-out-the-vote drive by Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to spend in one day, to try to buy voters, what I
have spent in my entire campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Florio said, ''we have people who are in a crusade,
who say public office should not be bought. I think crusaders
always beat mercenaries.''
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon rally in Hoboken, Florio was greeted by the
theme song from ''Rocky.'' He told 75 supporters, ''What we're
doing is going up and down the length and breadth of New Jersey
giving a message: New Jersey is not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spent the day campaigning alongside the man he hopes to
succeed, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. Lautenberg, who chose not to
seek a fourth term in the Senate, has urged voters to elect Corzine
as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   At a festival in the ethnically diverse neighborhoods of
Harrison, Corzine heard himself addressed as ''senator'' in half a
dozen different accents.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Mayor Ray McDonough escorted Corzine through the city's
streets, introducing him to residents, police officers and priests.
The only sour note: three times Corzine shot a basketball, and
three times he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Licata, taking a break from selling sweet and hot peppers,
said Corzine's wealth is a plus, not a negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I like about him is, he came from nothing,'' Licata said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, using strong language to condemn Corzine's campaign
for employing private investigators, Florio declined to say whether
he would support Corzine in November if he is the party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Sunday he trusts that ''cooler heads'' will prevail
once the primary is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all want Democrats in these important offices,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighting Copter Crashes in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FT. MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A government helicopter fighting
wildfires in southwest Florida crashed Sunday morning, killing the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell UH-1 Huey was equipped to carry 200 gallons of water,
said Liz Compton, a Florida Department of Agriculture spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had dumped the load and was going back to get more water
when he crashed,'' Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was being flown for the Division of Forestry. The
cause of the crash is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whose name was not released, had been fighting a fire
that reportedly threatened about a dozen homes near Fort Myers.
Fire officials could not immediately confirm the extent of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first of the year, 3,300 fires have burned 120,000
acres in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, hot, dry conditions have fueled wildfires in
several states.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in New Mexico had a blaze in the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains about 70 percent contained Sunday. The fire had forced
the evacuation of hundreds since it began Monday in a pine forest
east of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire threat in the area remained high despite
thunderstorms Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, an 11,000-acre fire in the Kaibab National Forest
was about 75 percent contained Sunday. Authorities said the steep
rugged terrain has made part of the fire impossible to reach, but
natural barriers and fire lines now ring the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody expects it to be completely out until we get some rain
on it,'' fire information officer Jason Abraham said.

<HEADLINE> Scherrer, Kemper's 9th Winner  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Just as his playing partners predicted a few
days earlier, Tom Scherrer became the ninth first-time PGA Tour
winner at the Kemper Insurance Open.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer, who didn't lead until the back nine on the final day,
closed with a 4-under-par 67 Sunday for a two-stroke victory. He
was the only player to shoot sub-70 rounds each day, his
67-68-69-67 effort earning him the $540,000 winner's check.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's pro-am, the amateurs in Scherrer's fivesome
reminded him of the Kemper's legacy of producing first-time winners
and suggested this might his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer seemingly was due. The 29-year-old Syracuse, N.Y.,
native had been playing his best golf lately, with a career-best
second-place tie finish in Tucson in February and rounds of 69 and
71 in the Memorial last week before falling back over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lowery, the third-round leader, shot a par 71 and tied for
second with Justin Leonard (69), Greg Chalmers (68), Kazuhiko
Hosokawa (66) and Franklin Langham (70).
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer joins Fred Couples (1983), Greg Norman (1984), Bill
Glasson (1985), Tom Byrum (1989), Billy Andrade (1991), Grant Waite
(1993), Steve Stricker (1996) and Rich Beem (1999) as first-time
tour winners at the Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer first made the tour in 1996, but it lasted just a year
when he finished 141st on the money list. After two years on the
Buy.com Tour, he regained his card and returned last year.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer began the day at nine under, trailing Lowery by two
strokes. Scherrer made up the deficit with birdies at Nos. 2 and 6
before a disheartening 3-putt from 14 feet gave him a bogey at the
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer recovered immediately, however, hitting a birdie putt
from 22 feet at No. 10 and another from 5 feet at No. 11 to take
the solo lead for the first time at 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Scherrer and Lowery went back and forth. Scherrer
won by making two nice par saves, while Lowery bogeyed twice down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lowery tied Scherrer with a birdie at the 13th, but
Scherrer chipped within a foot at the short par-4 14th for a birdie
to retake the lead at 13 under. Lowery nearly duplicated the feat
moments later, making a short putt to tie Scherrer again.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer nearly lost the lead when his approach sailed the green
at No. 15, but he saved par with a 15-foot putt. He was well in the
rough by the trees at the 16th and then put the next shot in the
bunker, but again he saved par with nice wedge to 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery fell out of the tie when he missed an 8-foot putt for par
after landing in the sand at the 15th. The victory was sealed for
Scherrer when Lowery's tee shot landed in the water at the par-3
17th.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed Chalmers would walk away with the
tournament. The left-handed Australian birdied four of the first
five holes -- he made a 30-foot putt at No. 4 -- to take the lead at
12 under. But he put his tee shot in the water at the par-3 9th and
moved back into a four-way tie for the lead with Lowery, Scherrer
and Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had an 11-foot birdie putt at No. 9 and also birdied No.
11 to hold the lead by himself at 12 under, but it lasted only one
hole. He pulled his tee shot into the rough at the difficult 12th
for a double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive run was made by Hosokawa, who started the day five
strokes off the lead at 6 under. Hosokawa had four birdies on the
back nine and nearly made a 15-foot birdie putt at the 17th that
would have tied him for the lead. He also came within an inch of
holing from the rough at 18, finishing a 31 on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Another gorgeous day -- Friday was the only unbearably humid day
this year -- made conditions good for a course that usually doesn't
yield many birdies. Michael Clark II, one of the early starters,
tied a tournament record Sunday with an 8-under 63.

<HEADLINE> Langenbrunner Might Return to Stars  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Jamie Langenbrunner might be ready to return to
the Dallas lineup, and not a moment too soon for the struggling
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jamie looks like a player tomorrow,'' Dallas coach Ken
Hitchcock said Sunday, the day before Game 4 of the Stanley Cup
finals. ''It's a decision for tomorrow, but right now we're leaning
towards he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars trail the New Jersey Devils 2-1 in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner has not played since injuring his knee in Game 5
of the conference finals against Colorado. The Stars advanced
without him, but are again trailing 2-1. This time they're behind
the Devils following a 2-1 home loss on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was noncommittal as to whether Langenbrunner would
return to a line with Joe Nieuwendyk. But with Nieuwendyk pointless
since Langenbrunner went out, it seems to be the most logical place
to play him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you can bring a 16-, 17-, 18-minute player back in
your lineup, it is going to make you more effective,'' Hitchcock
said. ''Whether I play him with Nieuwendyk or not at the start,
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner barely stepped on the ice Saturday morning prior
to the Stars' loss in Game 3. His return might have been further
delayed had the Stars been victorious.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is Dallas needs him to help create offense
outside of the line consisting of Mike Modano and Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say it is pretty much on the predicament side,''
Hitchcock said of why the time is right now. ''We are not in a
hole, we are in a little bit of a ditch, so we need to get out of
this ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   OTHER PLANS: Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was asked Sunday about
local newspaper coverage that seemed to be writing off his team's
chances in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the series 2-1 is exactly where it deserves to be,''
Hitchcock said of Dallas' deficit to New Jersey. ''I think they
were better for more minutes (Saturday). We were great for about 30
minutes, but they were better in a significant area of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer was a bit too technical, so Hitchcock was pressed
again.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked to respond to talk that the Stars were merely worn
out in their drive towards a second straight Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Then he fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, they are probably tired of covering this,'' he said of the
local reporters. ''They want to get on with the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NO COUNTDOWN FOR DEVILS: Just two wins away from the
franchise's second Stanley Cup, the key number for the New Jersey
Devils is still one.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars have been counting down since the playoffs
began, writing the number of victories needed to repeat as Stanley
Cup champions on a board in their locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anything like that, no countdowns,'' forward
John Madden said. ''I'm pretty good with numbers and I think we've
got two games left to win the Stanley Cup. I think it's more of a
memory countdown, you don't have to remind us how many games to win
the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dallas, the board still reads three.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOP DEVILS: Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora have
moved to center stage at the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The trio combined for 11 points in a Game 1 win. Then they were
bottled up in Game 2 as New Jersey lost. Coach Larry Robinson
criticized the play of Elias and Sykora and they responded for New
Jersey's latest win in Game 3 -- Arnott and Sykora getting both
Devils goals.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for three guys, two from the Czech Republic and another
from Ontario, who were thrown together as a line last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think every guy is putting some special stuff to the line,''
Sykora said Sunday. ''If one guy is not playing well, the whole
line is not playing well. To be successful, all three guys must be
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The language of choice is English, unless Sykora and Elias want
to exclude Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't really let him into our conversations,'' Elias said
with a smile. ''We've got a good communication between all three of
us and there is a lot of English words going through.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HULL'S TIMING: Not only has Brett Hull scored 11 of Dallas' 49
playoff goals, he gets the big ones as well. Hull has scored the
game-winning goal in three of the Stars' five victories the past
two seasons in the Stanley Cup finals. Hull scored both goals in
Dallas' 2-1 victory over New Jersey in Game 2, but was shut out in
the Stars' losses in the first and third games.

<HEADLINE> John Rocker Confronts SI Reporter  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker could be in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled Braves reliever had a confrontation Sunday with
the Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote the story in which Rocker
made offensive comments about gays, minorities, immigrants and his
own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, Jeff Pearlman, said Rocker threatened him, though
there was no physical contact between the two. The Braves said they
were investigating and teammate Brian Jordan called him a
''cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed he hasn't handled himself the right way,'' said
Jordan, one of the leaders in the clubhouse. ''Geez, if the guy has
nine lives, he's using them up pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got one guy being a cancer time and time again,'' the
outfielder said. ''Eventually, it's going to have an effect on the
team. Hopefully, he'll change.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman, in Atlanta to do a story on the Braves meeting the New
York Yankees in a rematch of last year's World Series, had a chance
meeting with Rocker in a service tunnel beneath Turner Field about
two hours before the final game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pearlman, Rocker made threatening comments such as,
''This isn't over between us,'' and, ''Do you know what I can do to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation lasted about two minutes and became so heated
that Rocker flipped around the bill of his cap so he could get
face-to-face with the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared,'' Pearlman said. ''But he didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker attempted to get Pearlman banned from the clubhouse. The
Braves stressed that he was allowed the same access as any other
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware that there was an incident,'' general manager
John Schuerholz said in a statement. ''We immediately began to
address the matter internally and are continuing to do so. We
respect the rights of Jeff, as a legitimate member of the media, to
cover the Braves in general and this series against the New York
Yankees in particular. We will do everything in our power to insure
that similar incidents do not occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no other Braves players saw the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, there are some situations where John feels he has
to stand up for himself,'' Chipper Jones said. ''I've heard him say
time and time again that he feels like he was misrepresented in
that article. Obviously, he still has issues with the guy who wrote
the article.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, the right thing to do would have been to walk away. But
I haven't seen John back down from a conflict yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who has struggled this season after 38 saves a year ago,
pitched a scoreless ninth inning against the Yankees. The first two
hitters singled and moved up a base when Rocker was called for a
balk. But he escaped trouble by getting Chuck Knoblauch on a popup
and Derek Jeter on a flyout.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker came back to the dugout, he received a hug from
starting pitcher Terry Mulholland. But it was clear that some
players were getting tired of his antics.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tom Glavine, one of the team's most personable players, got
short with reporters who brought up Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to answer any more questions about him in any
shape or form,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker declined comment when making a brief stop at his locker
after the game. He grabbed his clothes and muttered a sarcastic
comment at reporters before heading back to the training room.
</P>
<P>
   After Rocker's comments in a December issue of SI, the team
called together about a half-dozen players to discuss what action
should be taken with Rocker. The consensus was to give him another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he expects management to call another meeting soon
to discuss Rocker's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made his bed, now he's got to sleep in it,'' Jordan said.
''If he feels (confronting a reporter) is the best way to handle
it, he's going to get burned. You have to grow up sooner or later.
He's not only hurting the team, he's hurting himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman said it was the first time he has spoken with Rocker
since the December article, in which the pitcher said he would
never play for a New York team because he didn't want to ride a
subway train ''next to some queer with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ''I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. ... How
the hell did they get in this country?'' In addition, Rocker called
a black teammate a ''fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rocker for the first month of
the regular season and fined him $20,000, but an arbitrator reduced
the suspension to two weeks and the fine to $500. The pitcher also
was ordered to undergo sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has 10 saves since rejoining the team May 18 but also has
struggled with his control, issuing 25 walks in 18 1-3 innings. His
ERA is 3.85.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his anger is misdirected,'' Pearlman said. ''I really
do feel bad for the guy. I feel bad for his family. It was not my
intent to do that kind of story.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine and Franks collect additional endorsements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Democrats Jon Corzine and Jim Florio and
Republican Bob Franks won additional endorsements from New Jersey
newspapers on Sunday, while Republican Murray Sabrin picked up his
first.
</P>
<P>
   With little enthusiasm, The Trentonian of Trenton endorsed
Corzine over former Gov. Jim Florio but called both men
''bedraggled candidates covered from head to toe with mud.''
</P>
<P>
   In its editorial, the newspaper said Corzine brings to the race
''the potentially useful perspective of a political outsider and a
successful businessman.'' But it added, ''We share the general
revulsion over the incredible sums of money Corzine has spent, even
though it is his own dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has also been endorsed by The Times of Trenton and New
York's Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Courier-Post of Camden endorsed Florio, saying Democrats on
Tuesday will ''decide if there's a price tag attached to their
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio previously received the backing of The Star-Ledger of
Newark, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The New York Times, the Daily
Record of Parsippany, The Jersey Journal of Jersey City and the
Record of Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, The Trentonian and the Record of
Hackensack threw their support to Franks, R-Berkeley Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Record cited Franks' experience, including seven years in
Congress and, before that, 13 years in the state Assembly. The
newspaper said Franks ''showed a troubling reactionary bent early
in his Washington career'' but has since moderated his positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Trentonian called Franks ''a moderate, sensible guy who
knows how to run a disciplined, focused campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks previously received the endorsement of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Courier-Post, giving Sabrin his first endorsement, called
him ''an unapologetic defender of personal liberties and an
advocate for less government interference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, state Sen. William Gormley, has been backed
by The Star-Ledger of Newark, The Times of Trenton and The
Philadelphia Inquirer.

<HEADLINE> OAS Assembly Begins Monday  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- As hundreds of anti-free trade
protesters chanted outside, Foreign ministers from the Organization
of American States launched their annual assembly Sunday, expecting
to focus on Peru's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Windsor protest -- which was mirrored by another across the
U.S. river border in Detroit -- brought the OAS, which also deals
with trade issues, face-to-face with the same movement that
obstructed December's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocating security measures and hundreds of police in riot
gear prevented demonstrators from crossing into a security zone set
up within a 10-foot fence around several blocks in downtown
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Police sprayed two people with pepper spray when a group tried
to climb the fence. There were no other immediate reports of
unrest. Police arrested about two dozen people Friday and Saturday
in the run-up to the OAS meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some OAS delegates complained that the organization was being
wrongly targeted, noting there were no clear trade issues on the
assembly's agenda. The OAS represents more than 30 member Western
Hemisphere nations.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the hundreds waving signs and chanting, protest
speakers said the OAS -- as part of an international power structure
including the WTO and International Monetary Fund -- had helped
erode workers' rights and exacerbate poverty through free-trade
agreements and other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Activist author Noam Chomsky rejected what he called the
''childish nonsense'' of free-trade advocates who say globalization
is an unstoppable tidal wave engulfing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free trade agreements are nothing of the sort, and they're
certainly not agreements,'' he said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm protesting an organization that essentially wants to make
decisions about my life and about other workers' lives without me
having any say about it,'' said Craig Regester, 29, a Detroit
protester. ''This isn't Seattle, but this is definitely an emerging
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old OAS had planned during the Windsor meeting to
focus on human security issues in the Americas while taking care of
normal business, such as approving a next year's budget and
electing some officers and committees.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Premier Jean Chretien was to open the assembly Sunday
night, though some ministers held informal discussions Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   OAS delegates were also scheduled to consider last month's
presidential run-off in Peru, after a human rights report accused
the South American country of failing to meet democratic election
standards. If the foreign ministers agree, they could subject Peru
to OAS sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The electoral process in Peru clearly constitutes an irregular
interruption of the democratic process,'' according to the report,
prepared by an international human rights commission. The report
also called for new elections that conformed to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
   An OAS monitoring team left Peru before the vote to protest the
government's refusal to allow it to study new computer software for
counting ballots. President Alberto Fujimori was the only candidate
on the ballot, after challenger Alejandro Toledo boycotted what he
said was an unfair election process.
</P>
<P>
   Several former world leaders, including former President Jimmy
Carter, sharply criticized Peru in an open letter to the foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a democratic election,'' stated the letter, which
was also signed by former Barbados Premier Erskine Sandiford and
former Costa Rican President Rodrigo Carazo, who led a National
Democratic Institute-Carter Center mission assessing the Peru
election.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, led by special envoy to Latin America
Kenneth ''Buddy'' MacKay, have supported a harsh response to Peru's
elections, while Mexico and Brazil have expressed fear over setting
a precedent of OAS intervention over electoral issues. Mexico is
holding a presidential election next month.
</P>
<P>
   The organization must avoid becoming ''a substitute for
functions that correspond to state institutions,'' said Mexico's
OAS ambassador, Claude Heller.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS meets through Tuesday in Windsor, a middle-class city of
about 262,000 across the Detroit River from the Motor City.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils Sex Slave Numbers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Hundreds of women, mainly from the former
Yugoslavia and neighboring countries, are being forced to work in
Britain as prostitutes after being kidnapped or answering phony job
ads, a government report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first attempt by Britain's Home Office to assess
the extent of the sex slave trade, said a survey of police forces
found that 71 women were known to have been smuggled into the
country to work as prostitutes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But a conservative estimate of the true number in 1998 alone was
at least 142, and the figure could be as high as 1,420, the report,
titled Stopping Traffic, said.
</P>
<P>
   The women are kidnapped or answer advertisements in their home
countries for jobs as au pairs, secretaries or waitresses, the
report said. They were often brought to Britain on false passports
and accompanied by minders posing as a husband or boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   On arrival, traffickers took the women to brothels and seized
the forged documents. They were then made to repay transport costs
-- sometimes put at more than $20,000 -- by working as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the women working in apartments, massage
parlors and saunas in central London's Soho district, notorious as
a red light area, were foreigners, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators identified an organized trade in
prostitutes 10 years ago after raiding several brothels run by a
Hong Kong-based crime syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended creating a new crime of ''sexual
exploitation'' and increasing penalties for forced prostitution.

<HEADLINE> BEA 2000: A 'dot' in every sentence  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- When bookstore owner Michael Powell arrived at
BookExpo America his schedule included leading a seminar on
electronic publishing. He soon discovered he was the one who needed
leading.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I knew as much as anybody about it,'' Powell said.
''On Wednesday we had the seminar. By Friday, I realized everything
I said was wrong. Fortunately, everything everybody else said was
wrong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If you listened carefully the past few days at McCormick Place
you could hear the sound of heads being scratched, eyes opening and
minds processing it all. BookExpo America, which ended Sunday, both
confirmed and continued the rise of digital media in the publishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lectures and panel discussions on e-books, electronic rights and
related issues attracted standing-room-only crowds. The most talked
about speaker wasn't a writer but the founder and CEO of
Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos. Companies either ignored or nonexistent two
years ago found themselves with all the attention they could
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a 'dot' in every sentence now,'' said
Stephen Corrick, a literary agent based in Chicago. ''It's been
around the fringes, but this is the first time it's gotten to the
middle of the discussion. It's a period of great excitement and
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year marked by Stephen King's electronic novella
''Riding the Bullet'' and multimillion dollar investments by
everyone from Microsoft to Random House, few were doubting that
online bookselling and print on-demand would catch on. The question
was when. Some said in a decade, or three years, or six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people will see this as one of the most significant
moments in publishing history,'' Powell said. ''It's coming down
the road at lightning speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released over the weekend confirmed how quickly the
market is changing. A study reported that books sold online tripled
their market share between 1998 and 1999, from 1.9 percent to 5.4
percent. More than 50 million titles were purchased by adults and
no one doubts that number will increase significantly next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing we can imagine slowing down that trend,''
said Barrie Rappaport of NPD Group Inc., whose firm did the study.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ones most in danger of being damaged by Internet
sales appear to be independent stores, which already have been hurt
badly by superstore chains. Their market share dropped from 16.6
percent to 15.2 percent in 1999, less than half of what they
controlled 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which
represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet
would also benefit his group's members. Avin Mark Domnitz said that
BookSense.com, a home page providing links to independent stores,
should be ready by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to see real changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the industry also talked books, the paper kind. Many
a bookseller (and journalist) visited the booth of Scholastic,
Inc., seeking in vain an early copy of the next Harry Potter story.
The fourth in author J.K. Rowling's series, title and content both
still a mystery, is due July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipated titles for the fall include Margaret Atwood's novel
''The Blind Assassin''; ''The Island of Lost Maps,'' a nonfiction
work by Miles Harvey about cartographic crime, and new books from
Jane Hamilton, Caleb Carr and David Baldacci.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know which medium will be carrying the message, but I
still think paper will be carrying the vast bulk for a long time,''
said Wendy J. Strothman, an executive vice president at Houghton
Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is very exciting, but you miss that opportunity
for customers to browse, that serendipity of finding a book on the
front table of an independent bookstore.''

<HEADLINE> Griffey's Bat Hurts Red Owner's Kin  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. felt bad when the bat flew
from his hands and conked a 10-year-old girl on the head.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, he got more bad news. It wasn't just any young fan who
wound up with a gash on her forehead in the fourth inning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Lindner's granddaughter, right?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's bat hit the granddaughter of Cincinnati Reds owner
Carl Lindner on the left side of the head, forcing the family to
leave the game for a trip to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Christine Lindner was reportedly doing fine after
getting a few stitches for the cut. That was a relief for Griffey,
who's had two tough months with his hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm gone,'' Griffey joked. ''You hit .200 and the owner's
granddaughter?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey singled and struck out three times Sunday during a 3-2
victory over Minnesota in 10 innings, leaving his batting average
at .210. He has six hits in his last 50 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The bat accident happened on Ken Griffey Jr. Growth Chart Day, a
promotion that drew 40,169 paying customers. Some fans unrolled
their life-size charts to use as banners.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey took a big swing at a pitch from Mark Redman in the
fourth. The black bat flew from his hands and went twirling towards
the Reds dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner and Reds chief operating officer John Allen were seated
in the row directly behind the 10-year-old girl. Allen leaned
forward to shield her, but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen moved down a row to help the girl. A trainer in the dugout
tossed Allen a towel to soak up the blood coming from her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey stood outside the batter's box watching. The game was
held up for a couple of minutes, until it became apparent that the
girl was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner and others in his group walked up the aisle behind the
girl as she was taken for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just feel bad,'' Griffey said. ''You don't want to hurt
anybody, but those things just happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't mind as much if it was an adult but when it's a
kid, that's the kind of thing that ruins an at-bat or your whole
day. You just don't want to see things like that happen unless it's
some loudmouth who's been on you the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey struck out swinging to finish the at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner approved the nine-year, $116.5 million contract that
brought Griffey home as part of a trade with Seattle last February.
Lindner sent his private jet to fly Griffey to Cincinnati from
Florida when the deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner bought the team last September from Marge Schott, who
often sat in a front-row seat next to the dugout. She was hit in
the left shoulder by a foul ball from Atlanta's Ozzie Virgil on May
8, 1986, but wasn't seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Schott went to a first-aid room for an exam after getting hit,
but later returned to her seat.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Fernandez Injures Elbow  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds starter Osvaldo Fernandez left
at the start of the fourth inning Sunday after hurting his elbow on
a swing in the previous half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, trying to come back from two major elbow operations,
hit a soft liner to second for the second out in the third inning
against Minnesota's Mark Redman.
</P>
<P>
   As he warmed up to start the fourth, pitching coach Don Gullett
went to home plate umpire Tony Randazzo before heading out to the
mound to check on Fernandez's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Benito Santiago and shortstop Barry Larkin joined
Gullett to translate because Fernandez speaks little English. The
pitcher said a few words, pointed at his elbow and left the mound
with his head down.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays found no fracture and the injury was diagnosed as a
jammed elbow. It was too early to tell whether Fernandez will have
to miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hurt it swinging the bat when I lofted the ball to the
second baseman,'' Fernandez said, with Santiago acting as
translator. ''It's nothing serious. We'll just ice it for a couple
of days and I should make my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he was scared when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt, then it started getting better and that was a good
sign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Kremchek said the injury didn't appear to be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''He may or may not miss his next start,'' Kremchek said. ''We
took him out for precautionary reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wound up beating Minnesota 3-2 in 10 innings. They've
won all five of the games that Fernandez has started.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, 31, missed most of the last two years because of
elbow problems. He had the elbow cleaned out in 1997 and had
reconstructive surgery on May 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to win a spot on the Reds' roster in spring training,
but was called up after Pete Harnisch went on the disabled list
with a weak shoulder on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   He went 2-0 in his first four starts for the Reds and was coming
off one of the finest performances of his career. Fernandez allowed
only two hits in seven innings and retired the last 19 batters he
faced in a 2-0 victory over Montreal last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Fernandez said he was pitching better than
before the operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a mainstay on Cuba's gold medal Olympic team in
Barcelona in 1992, defected in 1995 and was signed by San
Francisco. He went 10-17 with a 4.70 in 41 games for the Giants
from 1996-98.

<HEADLINE> Solvig Outduels Trip to Win Regret  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Solvig, ridden by Pat Day, took the lead
at the top of the stretch and outdueled Trip for a one-length
victory in the $168,450 Grade III Regret for 3-year-old fillies at
Churchill Downs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Winning for the first time since capturing the Tropical Park
Oaks on Jan. 1, the daughter of Caerlon covered 1 1-16 miles in
1:42.95 and paid $4, $2.40 and $2.20 as the even-money favorite in
the field of nine. Trip paid $2.80 and $2.60, while Miss Chief
finished another 2\ lengths back in third and paid $3.20 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the Revocable Trust of Bentley Smith and trained by
Carl Nafzger, Solvig earned $104,439 to boost her lifetime earnings
to $317,314. The victory was her second in four starts this year
and fifth in eight lifetime starts, all on turf.
</P>
<P>
   The track announced a record crowd -- 19,032 -- for a Sunday. The
attendance figure marked the fourth day-of-the-week record
established during this spring meet. The previous largest crowd for
a Sunday was 18,017, set on May 14.

<HEADLINE> Rioting at Drug Treatment Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Police were searching Sunday for about 400
prisoners who fled a drug treatment center for convicted criminals
following a riot that left at least 19 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners escaped after violence broke out between
Vietnamese and Hong Kong inmates at the Hei Ling Chau center on an
outlying island, the Correctional Services Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The sparely populated island is located far from Hong Kong's
urban areas so there was little likelihood that the prisoners could
remain at large for long.
</P>
<P>
   The Hei Ling Chau center was built in 1975 to treat male drug
addicts convicted of crimes. It is run by the Correctional Services
Department and has slightly more than 400 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what triggered the argument between the inmates,
who fought each other with iron pipes and homemade weapons.
</P>
<P>
   S.Y. Pang, Deputy Commissioner of the Correctional Services,
said the prisoners set fire to some offices in the center and at
one stage threatened to ignite a liquefied petroleum gas cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Four injured Correctional Services officers were flown out of
the island by a helicopter for treatment at a hospital on the main
Hong Kong island, he said. Eight police officers and seven inmates
also were injured and treated.
</P>
<P>
   Marine police boats surrounded the island after receiving a call
for assistance from the drug center. Prison officers regained
control of the situation after four hours, Pang said.

<HEADLINE> Devils on Road to Stanley Cup  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The road to the Stanley Cup is proving to be
exactly that for the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after needing an exceptional comeback just
to stay alive in the playoffs, the Devils now need only avoid a big
comedown to win their second Stanley Cup championship since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, underdogs to the defending champion Dallas Stars
when the series began, take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 Monday night
following their 2-1 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what this game means now,'' Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens said Sunday. ''It means being tied 2-2 or ahead 3-1. It's a
big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even bigger than Saturday's game, one that could have swung
the series New Jersey's way. Eighteen of the last 21 teams to win
Game 3 in a previously tied series won the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing to us what we'd like to be doing to them,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are doing it with a top line that is paid a combined
salary less than 60 NHL players make by themselves, with a road
show that plays well no matter how hostile the venue. They are 8-2
on the road, with three consecutive victories -- a near carbon copy
of the formula they used to win the Stanley Cup in 1995, when they
were 10-1 away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this has been much harder than 1995,'' goaltender Martin
Brodeur said. ''The only time we were down in any series that year
was 1-0 to Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Devils won twice each in Florida and Toronto,
then won three times in Philadelphia while rallying from a 3-1
deficit in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're really confident and staying patient and
staying with it until we win the Stanley Cup,'' forward Patrik
Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Devils coach Larry Robinson, asked before Game 3 if
the goal was to gain a split in Dallas, said, ''We're coming here
to win both games.''
</P>
<P>
   Both?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how to explain it,'' said Robinson, an assistant
last season when the Devils set a NHL regular-season record for
road victories. ''Maybe it's the fact our team tries to keep the
game a little more simple. Maybe we feed off the other team's
crowd. I really don't have an answer for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't, either, when asked about his stars' inability
to get going in two of the three games. The Stars were blown out
7-3 in Game 1, needed two goals from Brett Hull to sneak away with
a 2-1 decision in Game 2, then were shut down again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Devils' top line of Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr
Sykora dominated Dallas' No. 1 line, with Arnott and Sykora each
scoring their third goal of the series. Combined, they have 14
points in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice playing with two guys who care about the game as
much as you do and want to win as badly as you do,'' said Arnott, a
Canadian who is flanked on his line by two players from the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' top line of Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, by
contrast, went scoreless in Game 3, even though Modano
double-shifted much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a second line that has badly missed the injured Jamie
Langenbrunner (knee) didn't contribute any offense. Joe Nieuwendyk,
last year's playoffs MVP, is scoreless in the series, and no doubt
will welcome Langenbrunner's expected return Monday. Hitchcock
anticipates him to play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it doesn't seem to add up. Arnott makes $1.8 million and
Elias and Sykora made $625,000 each; a combined salary of $3.05
million. That's half the $6 million that Modano makes. Hull makes
$5.5 million and Lehtinen is paid $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, that's $3.05 million for 14 New Jersey points and $13
million for four Stars points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the offense the Devils' line is producing,
Hitchcock is more concerned about the Stars' inability to solve New
Jersey's neutral zone trap defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey makes you pay a healthy price to get in those areas
to score,'' Hitchcock said. ''At the end of the day, you are going
to have to decide whether the Cup and the accolades that go with it
are worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the possibility of falling behind 3-1 in the Stanley Cup
finals will create that sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we're disappointed we lost, disappointed to be down
in the series,'' said defenseman Derian Hatcher, who was on the ice
for both New Jersey goals in Game 3. ''But we talked about it and
we'll bounce back for Game 4. We have a choice. It's fight on or
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars win Monday, they will be 2-2, just as they were in
last year's finals against Buffalo. The difference is they must
play Game 5 and, if necessary, Game 7 on the road. Even if they win
Game 4, they will have only one more game in Reunion Arena, where
they had won 11 of their last 12 playoff games before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, we're in the Stanley Cup finals,'' Kirk Muller of the
Stars said. ''Nobody said it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   One statistic in their favor: the Stars have won their last nine
playoff games following a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey is a team with a very steely exterior and
interior,'' Hitchcock said. ''They are as determined as we are. If
we're waiting to put it into gear, it's not going to work. We've
got to go now.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 7, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Kelvim Escobar struck out a season-high 10 in his
third career complete game and Carlos Delgado hit his 20th home run
as Toronto beat Florida 7-2 Sunday to snap a three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar retired 12 Marlins in a row, seven with strikeouts,
between the fourth and seventh innings.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a pair of singles to start the eighth, Escobar
got a fly out and a key double play to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scoring was done in the first three innings. Delgado
hit a three-run homer in the first off Vladimir Nunez (0-6).
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's homer brought home Shannon Stewart and Craig Grebeck.
Nunez hit Stewart and walked Grebeck to start the game. Delgado
finished 3-for-5 with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins cut the lead to 3-2 in the bottom of the first with
consecutive two-out singles from Cliff Floyd, Preston Wilson and
Mike Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   But Escobar (5-6) settled down after the first, striking out the
side in the second and allowing just five hits -- all singles -- over
the next eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar struck out four of five hitters in the fourth and fifth
innings, baffling the Marlins. After Floyd's whiff to end the
fifth, he slammed his bat to the ground in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar had the Marlins frustrated. Seven of his strikeouts came
against Florida's 7-8-9 lineup spots, including Paul Bako three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto added two runs in the third, a run in the seventh and
one in the eight. Jose Cruz Jr. and Alex Gonzalez had back-to-back
run-scoring hits in the third, scoring Grebeck and Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart led off the seventh with a double, advancing to third on
Floyd's error in left field, and scored on Grebeck's single.
Stewart's eighth-inning single brought home Gonzalez with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez left after giving up six hits and five runs in three
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto catcher Darrin Fletcher left the game in the fourth
inning with a right shoulder strain. He is day-to-day. ... Marlins
2B Luis Castillo, who leads the majors in stolen bases with 23,
missed the game with a sore left ankle. ... The Marlins hit
back-to-back pitches off Escobar's glove in the third. The first, a
line drive by Dave Berg, nearly hit Escobar in the face, but he got
his glove up just in time. Floyd followed with another line drive
that Escobar tipped when he whipped his glove behind his back. 3B
Chris Woodard picked up the deflection and got Floyd out at first.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Free Press in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton recommended a free and open
press as ''an instrument of stability'' in a democratic Russia --
even if what is printed hurts. He said he ought to know because no
modern American official has faced more negative or painful
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave his lecture on freedom of the press Sunday night on
a Moscow radio talk show after the host suggested that any
president would at times have a desire to squash the press for
hounding him and looking for dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have you ever had a desire to shake a journalist real
strong?'' asked Aleksey Venediktov.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't really answer that one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said it is inevitable that any political leader will
see things he believes to be untrue or unfair, ''and you can get
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said ''we think that democracy is more stable and people
are more free when the press is free. And we trust the people to
understand if the press is either false or unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ''when someone says something about me that's not
true, I can go on a program like this, and I can say here's what
they say, here's the truth. I can go on television. I can give a
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done all the above during his travails over Whitewater,
the long investigation that eventually led to the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't mention any of that. He was in instructional
mode.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even when a free press acts irresponsibly, ''you
still have more stability in society by letting people be free, by
letting the debates unfold, and by trusting that the citizens, the
voters, in the end will get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed
press freedom in their summit talks. ''I quoted his statement,
President Putin said that without civil society and a free press,
the Russian democracy couldn't go on,'' he said. ''And I think
that's a wise statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that ''this is something that has to be
debated and fought for and struggled for,'' something that has
taken the United States two centuries, while Russia has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working on this a long time,'' Clinton said. ''But
the trend has always been for more freedom of the press,
particularly where public issues and public officials are
concerned,'' he said. ''It's served us well.''

Powerful Earthquake Shakes Indonesia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake and several strong
aftershocks rocked the island of Sumatra, seismologists said Monday, causing
widespread damage and at least three deaths. The Indonesian Meteorological and
Geophysical Service said the quake, measuring 7.3, was centered beneath the
Indian Ocean, about 400 miles northwest of Jakarta. The U.S. Geological Survey
in Golden, Colo., reported the earthquake's strength at 7.9. At least three
people were killed by falling debris on Sumatra Island, the official Antara news
agency said. The death toll was expected to rise.

Alleged Terrorist Claims Attacks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who said he coordinated most of Iran's terror
operations of the last decade claimed responsibility for two major attacks on
the United States, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 and the Khobar Towers
bombing, ''60 Minutes'' reported today. The man, whom the CBS News program
identified as Ahmad Behbanani, told a ''60 Minutes'' journalist that he proposed
the 1988 Pan Am operation, brought on board a radical Palestinian terrorist
living in Syria, then imported and trained Libyan operatives to do the job. The
program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's mistaken shooting
down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger plane.

Better Anti-Terrorism Campaign Urged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials should consider designating Greece and Pakistan
as countries ''not cooperating fully'' in the battle against terrorism and
strengthen the category by banning those countries' citizens from traveling here
without visas, a blue-ribbon commission says. Pakistan provides ''safe haven,
transit and moral, political and diplomatic support to several groups engaged in
terrorism'' and Greece -- a NATO ally -- ''has been disturbingly passive in
response to terrorist activities,'' according to the National Commission on
Terrorism, a panel of private experts and former government officials. The
commission is due to report to lawmakers on Monday.

Gun Checks Blocked 204,000 Sales

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Background checks blocked 204,000 of the more than 8.6
million prospective gun sales last year, according to a Justice Department
report that shows state and local police rejected a higher percentage of
would-be gun buyers than the FBI. The 1999 figures brought the number of
purchase rejections since the Brady Act instituted background checks in February
1994 to 536,000 out of almost 22.3 million applications, the department's Bureau
of Justice Statistics reported. The bureau's report provided the first hard

Five Die in Russia-Chechen Fighting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SHALI, Russia (AP) -- Military troops on Sunday raided a home where suspected
Chechen rebels were hiding, triggering a shootout in which five people were
killed, two of them Russian soldiers, an official said. The troops used an
armored personnel carrier and other vehicles to smash through a fence of the
home in the Chechen town of Shali. A hail of gunfire came from inside the house,
killing one soldier and a colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service. The
Russians returned fire, killing three people, including the target of the raid
-- Musa Dzhamalkhanov. Three women were also wounded. It was unclear why the
Russians wanted to arrest Dzhamalkhanov.

Report Cites Japanese As Healthiest

   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization said Sunday that the Japanese
have the best prospects for long and active lives, and can expect 74{ years of
healthy life. A WHO study measured ''disability-adjusted'' life expectancy,
subtracting years according to the prevalence and severity of ailments ranging
from malaria to lung disease. Americans lag behind because of miserable
standards among the U.S. poor -- who fare worse than many Africans. Australia,
at 73.2 years, came second, followed by France, Sweden, Spain and Italy. The
United States, which spends the most on health, rated only 24th, with an

Women Pray Aloud at Western Wall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Dozens of Jewish women prayed out loud at the Western Wall
on Sunday, a week after parliament passed a bill that would sentence them to
seven years in prison. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in the adjacent male section at
the site considered most sacred to Jews shouted ''Shame!'' and ''Quiet!'' at the
women, as they faced the stone wall that was once part of the biblical Second
Temple compound. A bill forbidding women from praying aloud at the wall was
passed last week by a half-full parliament in a preliminary reading, but would
have to pass some half-dozen more legislative steps before becoming law.

<HEADLINE> Young Golfers Get Tips from Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The fluid swing and made-for-TV pose after the
ball takes flight quickly attracts a group of curious spectators,
reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Some shots flying off the battered, kid-sized driver go slightly
right or left but most are down the middle, prompting one observer
to speculate on the young boy's future as golf's next phenom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get him through kindergarten first,'' says Edna Herring,
who's 5-year-old grandson, R.J. Young, was among about 125 children
invited Sunday to a junior golf clinic sponsored by the Tiger Woods
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a Titleist visor and Nike clothing favored by his idol,
R.J. received tips from Denver-area pros while the 24-year-old
Woods gave personal instruction to 25 hand-selected players ranging
in age from 10 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I probably have more credibility with these kids just
because I am close to their age,'' Woods said. ''For example, I
don't really understand what Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Wilt
Chamberlain and Bill Russell did for the game of basketball. I
wasn't around. But I know what M.J. (Michael Jordan) did. That
lends more credibility if these kids have grown up watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicki Birdsong, the Class 5A state champion, is just six years
younger than Woods and showed no sign of being star struck as she
popped shot after shot high into the air with the world's
top-ranked golfer offering bits of advice from a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just have to breathe deep and hope you don't miss the
ball,'' said Birdsong, who will play for the University of Denver
next year. ''I've met other pro players before, but this was such a
thrill because he's so much closer to my age.''
</P>
<P>
   The admiration is mutual. Woods said he is amazed at the talent
level of young golfers across the country. With two more of his
junior golf clinics scheduled this summer in New Orleans and
Norfolk, Va., Woods may be providing the building blocks for future
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was growing up and playing junior golf, there were only
a handful of us that were any good,'' he said, ''but now there are
kids all around the country who hit the ball further than I did,
straighter than I did. They're getting bigger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Justin Tafoya is among the new breed of young
golfers. He started swinging a club when he was about 3 and likely
will play varsity golf as a freshman next fall at Denver East High
School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving personal attention from Woods, Tafoya
also came away with a better impression of the influential
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was completely the opposite of what I thought,'' Tafoya
said. ''I thought he would be a stuck-up kind of guy, but he's
nice. It's incredible. He's that guy on TV that you'll never meet.
It's just amazing to finally meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, whose popularity rivals Jordan, said he is humbled by
children who consider him a role model, and his sincerity is
confirmed as he patiently works with young students on everything
from their grip and stance to their posture and head position.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something I believe in,'' Woods said. ''I think that's
what comes across and I think that's why the kids really respond.
If you put an athlete or any person into a position where they
don't really believe in it, then obviously it's not going to come
across.''

   Warrick, a wide receiver from Florida State, was the fourth
overall pick in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   He will get more than $10 million in signing and reporting
bonuses this year, said his agent, Jim Gould.
</P>
<P>
   The contract contains a seventh voidable year, meaning the deal
could be shortened to six years if Warrick plays 45 percent of the
downs in any season.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day contract negotiations ended at noon Sunday when
Blackburn met Gould at her home in the Cincinnati suburb of Indian
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the room is counting on him making the full $42
million,'' Gould said. ''It's very doable.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were the Bengals' shortest with a first-round
pick since Ohio State's Dan Wilkinson signed his seven-year, $14.4
million contract in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick is the third first-round pick to agree to a contract
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Browns defensive end Courtney Brown and New York Jets
tight end Anthony Becht also have come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick won't work out with the Bengals until he completes more
of the community service sentence he received in Florida after
pleading guilty to a petty theft charge.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, a former Florida State teammate and a store clerk were
charged after the two players paid $21.40 for more than $400 worth
of clothes last Sept. 29 at a Dillard's department store in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain in Florida cleaning up trash along highways as
part of his 30-day sentence. His agents expect him to complete the
sentence before training camp starts July 21, the Bengals' Web site
reported.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senate candidates court the faithful, seeking plurality  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The four Republican candidates for New
Jersey's U.S. Senate seat courted core supporters Sunday, each
hoping to produce enough votes to assemble a plurality on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, spent the day in Ocean
and Atlantic counties, tending to his base in southern New Jersey.
Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, toured areas of the state
where his past service as state party chairman has helped him earn
organization support.
</P>
<P>
   Ramapo College economics professor Murray Sabrin, the most
socially conservative candidate, said he was cheered by gun owners
he met in northwestern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And Essex County Executive Jim Treffinger, eschewing public
events, visited key county supporters around the state to plan how
to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on core supporters reflected the political reality
of a four-candidate primary field. As Sabrin said, ''You don't need
51 percent to win. You just need, theoretically, 26 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Absecon, where beer flowed by the keg and pizza disappeared
by the tray, Gormley's smile and vigorous handshake highlighted
that he felt comfortably at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley met with some 80 of his party's faithful in a grove
outside an American Legion hall. Though he spent Saturday in
northern New Jersey, Gormley made clear that he is counting on the
southern part of the state on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is saying, especially in North Jersey, that (the
race) is undecided,'' Gormley said. ''Well, I will tell you this.
It is decided in South Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks disagrees. His ''Franks on a Roll'' bus tour stopped
Sunday in such southern locales as Burlington and Gloucester
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''When (Gormley) says he's South Jersey's candidate, he's only
partly right,'' Glenn Paulsen, the Burlington County GOP chairman,
told 50 Franks supporters outside party headquarters in Mount
Holly. ''He's a South Jersey guy, but he's not South Jersey's
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks won the endorsement of the Burlington GOP, giving him a
favored position on the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the crowd, Franks took aim at the two Democratic
candidates for Senate, Jon Corzine and Jim Florio. Asked later why
he seemed to be looking past Tuesday's primary, Franks replied,
''We are going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger spent most of the weekend meeting privately with each
of his county coordinators throughout the state, planning a phone
bank operation to get supporters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided to purposely forgo the usual photo-op stuff and
just take care of business,'' Treffinger said. ''I'm going to meet
with all my coordinators and make sure all my phone lists are done.
The whole object now is identify the vote as scientifically as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin was preparing to wrap up his campaign with a nonstop,
24-hour tour of New Jersey diners in all 21 counties beginning at 7
a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His stops Sunday included a crawfish festival in Stanhope, where
long lines prevented him from tasting the catch of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, his campaign aggressively disputed charges
that Sabrin, who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1997, shares
that party's support for decriminalizing drug use and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to supporters, Sabrin wrote, ''I have
never advocated the legalization of drugs, prostitution or gay
marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they battle for a victory on Tuesday, the Republican
candidates cannot help but look across the party divide at what the
victor may face in the fall: Corzine, and his proven willingness to
spend tens of millions of his own dollars to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have thought about that,'' Treffinger said. ''I imagine
everybody has.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, joking about Corzine's estimated $400 million in
personal wealth, said Republicans will give him a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, Corzine has been spending interest from his
wealth,'' Gormley said. ''We are going to make sure he has to spend
some of his principal.''

<HEADLINE> Powerful Quake Shakes Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake followed by
strong aftershocks rocked the island of Sumatra, causing at least
17 deaths and leaving thousands homeless, seismologists and police
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said the
quake, measuring 7.3, hit at 11:29 p.m. Sunday and was centered
beneath the Indian Ocean, about 400 miles northwest of Jakarta. The
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., estimated the earthquake's
strength at 7.9.
</P>
<P>
   The quake lasted several minutes and shook a wide area. A major
aftershock hit minutes later, followed by many more smaller tremors
before dawn Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Bengkulu -- with a population of 1.2 million located
60 miles east of the quake's epicenter -- appeared to have been the
worst-hit area.
</P>
<P>
   Falling debris killed five people in the city and another 12 in
surrounding villages, Bengkulu police Sgt. Hariyono said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quake went on for many minutes. Dozens of homes have been
destroyed, and almost all houses and buildings in the city seem to
have been damaged,'' said Hariyono, who like many Indonesians uses
only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Many more people were reported injured in demolished houses, and
the death toll was expected to rise as volunteers and emergency
workers searched ruined buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts were hampered by widespread electricity and
telephone cuts, he said. Thousands fled their homes, taking shelter
outdoors as aftershocks continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are terrified every time they feel aftershocks,''
Hariyono said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Bengkulu treated the injured in the open, fearing
aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official
Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Damage was also reported at Bengkulu airport.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent
years, was felt across much of the western half of the archipelago
nation and the neighboring island state of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about
20{ miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean -- very shallow in
geological terms. But there were no immediate reports of a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the southeastern island of Flores. A
magnitude-7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major
fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals.

<HEADLINE> Thousands bid farewell to mambo king Tito Puente.  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Saddened fans and fellow musicians lined up at a
Manhattan funeral chapel Sunday to bid a fond farewell to their
beloved El Rey, mambo king Tito Puente.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing their love and admiration at an afternoon wake,
mourners held Puerto Rican flags, wore T-shirts emblazoned with his
image and listened to his music while trading memories of the
flamboyant percussionist and bandleader outside Riverside Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, a famed timbale player, died Wednesday at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost a brother, and like the rest of the world, I am
deeply saddened,'' said fellow timbale player Jimmy Sabater, who
said he'd known Puente for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands waited on line for as long as four hours to see their
hero one last time, as he lay in a small chapel, dressed in a white
suit with a pair of timbale sticks cradled in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great loss.... He was the king immortalized,'' said
George Padilla, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of mourners waved Puerto Rican flags as cars draped
with the flag drove past. Even a dog walked around the crowd
wearing a Puerto Rican flag jacket and straw hat.
</P>
<P>
   The service not only provided many with an opportunity to
express national pride, it also allowed others to reflect upon Tito
Puente's remarkable ability to be both Puerto Rican and American; a
talent that allowed him to seamlessly blend Latin music and
American Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a citizen of the world, not just of Puerto Rico and the
United States,'' Sabater remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was loved all over the world,'' said Puente's youngest
sister, Asia ''Cookie' Kwolek. ''He was the last of the masters.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd reveled at the sight of various luminaries from the
salsa and merengue pantheon who periodically stopped in to pay
their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has left a beautiful legacy. He was the greatest
ambassador, not only for Puerto Rico, but for all the Americas,''
singer Jose ''Cheo'' Feliciano said amid a horde of
autograph-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having to wait for hours as the line to see Puente
inched its way up 76th St., most mourners were unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have to wait here till 7 o'clock, that's fine. Whatever
it takes to say goodbye,'' said Maria Duceman, who came from
Philadelphia to bid Puente farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the crowd turned sour when the funeral home shut its
doors at 5:30 p.m., 90 minutes earlier than scheduled. Police said
the funeral home was abiding by the wishes of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people left standing in the street began to chant in
Spanish, ''We want to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pretty upset by this. I have waited close to four hours
to see him,'' said Carmen Gonzalez said as she stood just feet from
the closed doors, holding two dozen roses in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a police officer said over his cruiser's speaker
system that the family was asking for privacy and that people come
back the following day did the crowd begin to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't come back, I have to work tomorrow,'' said Maggie
Rondogiannis.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services were scheduled to continue Monday in
Manhattan, with a funeral Tuesday morning in Nanuet.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Arnott Joining Elite Ranks  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A little more than 2{ years ago, Scott Stevens
didn't think much about offering an extra room over his garage to a
mixed-up and disappointed young man whose hockey career had taken a
nose dive in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott needed a place to stay after being traded by the
Oilers to New Jersey and Stevens, the Devils' captain, gave him one
for two months.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a learning experience. Arnott got a friend,
ate the right foods and learned how to make a commitment to the
sport he loved, just by watching Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons learned could result in a Stanley Cup for the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much of a contribution Arnott is making to the
Devils' run toward hockey's top prize.
</P>
<P>
   Only Dallas' Brett Hull and Mike Modano have scored more points
than Arnott (seven goals, 12 assists) in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those goals have come in the Cup finals against Dallas.
None was bigger than the one he scored late in the first period of
Game 3 to tie Saturday's game. It took the momentum away from
Dallas and helped New Jersey to a 2-1 win and a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of play the Oilers always expected from Arnott,
who was the seventh pick overall in the 1993 NHL Draft. The
6-foot-4, 225-pounder scored 33 goals as a rookie but he never had
more than 28 in any one season after that and it made him a target
of the fans in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers traded him and defenseman Bryan Muir to New Jersey in
January 1998 for Bill Guerin and Valeri Zelepukin.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's not fun coming to the rink, it's hard to play,''
Arnott said. ''At that time it wasn't. Then I came here and the fun
got back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott only had five goals in 35 games for Edmonton when he was
traded and he added another five in 35 with New Jersey that year.
</P>
<P>
   However, living with Stevens and his wife, Donna, got the then
23-year-old Arnott refocused and also improved his practice habits,
learning to work as hard as his landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember late night staying up and talking with them just
about life, nothing about hockey,'' Arnott said. ''It was nice. At
that time when I got traded it was tough. They made me feel right
at home, It was a family away from home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a chance to talk to them about personal stuff, personal
feelings,'' Arnott added. ''It was like sitting in the kitchen
taking to my mom. It was definitely helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   A nutrition freak, Stevens also helped Arnott with his diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Single guys always eat whatever they want,'' Arnott said. ''I
wasn't eating all that bad but I definitely ate a lot a more
healthy there.''
</P>
<P>
   The change on the ice started last year when then-Devils coach
Robbie Ftorek moved Arnott to center with Patrik Elias and Petr
Sykora on the wings. The two natives of the Czech Republic are
great skaters and that has made Arnott move his feet and play
better.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott had 27 goals and 54 points last season and he added 22
goals and 56 points this year. His game has taken off in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think to be an elite player in this league you have to have
that cocky attitude in a good way,'' Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko
said. ''And Jason has finally come to the forefront. He is a big,
strong, powerful man and he's starting to use it along with his
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Arnott provided scoring in the playoffs, he's also
one of the leaders in the locker room, another influence from
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He taken those other two guys (Skyora and Elias) under his
wing and talked to them and taken care of them,'' goaltender Martin
Brodeur said. ''He's been as good as I have seen a big guy play.
</P>
<P>
   ''... He's getting away from the Edmonton stuff and he really
has his niche.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's close to helping the Devils win their second Stanley
Cup since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if the Devils win, the frontrunner for the Conn
Smythe Trophy would be Stevens, whose physical play set the tone
for New Jersey to win their first three series.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who might beat him out is Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scott is a great guy. He's our captain,'' said Arnott, who
lives in Wasaga Beach, Ontario, about 90 minutes north of Toronto.
''Whenever a guy is in trouble and needs a place to stay, he is
there. He did that for me and I owe him a tremendous amount.''

<HEADLINE> Warrick OKs $42M Deal with Bengals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- First-round draft pick Peter Warrick has
agreed to a seven-year contract worth $42 million with the
Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals' Web site reported that Warrick was expected to sign
the contract Sunday night at the home of team executive vice
president Katie Blackburn. The team was to formally announce the
deal at a Monday morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, a wide receiver from Florida State, was the fourth
overall pick in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   He will get more than $10 million in signing and reporting
bonuses this year, said his agent, Jim Gould.

<HEADLINE> Two 1st-Timers in College Series  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Louisiana-Lafayette and San Jose State are going to
the College
World Series for the first time, and Miami won't get the chance to
repeat as national champion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana-Lafayette (47-18) beat top-seeded South Carolina
(56-10) 3-2 Sunday in the best-of-three super regionals to advance
to Omaha, Neb., for the first time in 29 seasons as a Division I
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're a small school, no one ever gives you the credit
for doing things,'' said Rick Haydel, whose two-run double gave the
Ragin' Cajuns a 3-2 lead in the seventh inning. ''It feels amazing
to do something no one thought you could.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (41-22), in the NCAA tournament for the first
time since 1971, beat Houston 3-2 Sunday to secure its first
College World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (41-19-1) was bidding to become just the fifth school to
repeat as national champion, but in-state rival Florida State
(51-17) ended those hopes with a 6-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the other super regional Sunday, Stanford advanced with 5-3
victory over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clemson, Louisiana State, Southern California and
Texas all advanced to the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Louisiana-Lafayette lost two straight to Rice after
winning the first game of the super regional, and used that memory
as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to forget that feeling,'' catcher Danny
Massiatte said. ''We've used it all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dohmann (12-5), who allowed just four hits in seven
innings, had the box score from the final Rice defeat taped in his
locker. Now, taking that box score down is at the top of his to-do
list. ''That might be the first thing I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dohmann's only mistake was a seventh-inning, two-run homer to
Tripp Kelly that gave the Gamecocks a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ragin' Cajuns rallied to do what no other team had been
able to do this season -- beat the nation's winningest team twice on
its home field.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we would advance; we expected to advance,'' said
South Carolina coach Ray Tanner, tears in his eyes, his voice
catching more than once.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just in disbelief,'' Gamecocks shortstop Drew Meyer
said.
San Jose St. 3, Houston 2:
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Tim Adinolfi and Chris Key combined on a six-hitter
and Rob Douglass and John Fagan each homered for San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Adinolfi (8-3) struck out four, walked three and allowed only
four runners to reach second base in eight innings. Key pitched the
ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan drove an 0-1 fastball from Houston starter Duncan McAdoo
(7-3) over the left-field wall to give the Spartans a 3-1 lead in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting until I could take a team there,'' said
coach Sam Piraro, in his 14th year with the Spartans. ''I didn't
think I would get there.''
Florida St. 6, Miami 1:
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Florida State freshman Mike Ziegler (9-4) struck
out nine, surrendered nine hits and did not allow a walk in a
complete game to send the Seminoles to their third consecutive
College World Series, and 18th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most exciting moment of my career -- to watch these
young men celebrate a victory and accomplish a goal,'' Seminoles
coach Mark Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, who fell one victory shy of a record-tying
seventh consecutive CWS appearance, grounded into three double
plays and never seriously threatened after scoring a run in the
first on Javy Rodriguez's sacrifice fly.
Stanford 5, Nebraska 3:
</P>
<P>
   In Palo Alto, Calif., Brian Sager (6-1) allowed five hits in
seven innings and Edmund Muth homered to lead Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Sager allowed just one earned run while striking out three and
walking four in his longest outing of the season. Jeff Bruksch got
the final six outs for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bruntlett had four hits as Stanford (47-15) reached the
College World Series for the third time in four years and 12th
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Strong had two hits for Nebraska (51-17), which just
missed reaching its first College World Series.

2,000th career hit. On Friday night, he hit his 400th home run. ...
Bubba Trammell had his third pinch-hit home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Rick Reed threw 50 pitches off the mound to test his
strained left side and reported no pain. He will throw again Monday
before a final decision is made about his projected start Tuesday
against Baltimore. ... Derek Bell, stuck in a 3-for-42 slump,
rested. ''He's mentally drained,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.
... OF Darryl Hamilton, on the DL since April 7 after foot surgery,
said his recovery is going as planned. ''The next couple of weeks
are important,'' he said. ''If things go well we'll make a decision
on when I can come back.''
Yankees-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Yankees got by without C Jorge Posada and OF Paul
O'Neill, who both left Saturday's game with minor injuries. Posada
could have played after taking a foul tip off his right knee,
shattering the shin guard, but he already was scheduled to get the
day off. Chris Turner took his place and went 1-for-4. The
left-handed O'Neill, bothered by soreness in his right leg, didn't
play with Braves starting left-hander Terry Mulholland. Shane
Spencer played right field, going 3-for-5 with one RBI and also
making a nice running catch to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Pitcher Don Wengert, called up by the Braves on
Thursday when Greg McMichael went on the disabled list, has yet to
make his Atlanta debut. When he does, he will be pitching for his
fifth team, having previous stints with Oakland, San Diego, the
Chicago Cubs and Kansas City since 1995. ... Steve Avery, trying to
come back from shoulder surgery at Class A Myrtle Beach, has
started twice for the Carolina League team. He is 1-1 with a 1.32
ERA but control has been a problem. He has issued 10 walks in 13
2-3 innings.
Twins-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Mark Redman had never fanned more than seven batters
in a game before striking out nine in Sunday's game. ... The Twins
are 2-4 on a nine-game trip that concludes with three in Houston.
... Redman grounded out in the third and struck out with the bases
loaded in the fourth. Twins pitchers were 2-for-6 with a single and
a double in the series.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Cincinnati improved to 26-20 in interleague play.
Minnesota is 24-27. ... Chris Stynes started in left field for the
first time since Sept. 26, 1998. ... Griffey struck out in the
eighth against Eddie Guardado. He's 2-for-18 career against the
left-hander with nine strikeouts. ... Reds starter Osvaldo
Fernandez jammed his pitching elbow while lining out in the third
inning. Fernandez, who missed most of the 1998-99 seasons because
of two major elbow operations, tried to warm up for the fourth but
had to leave the game. ... The game was held up for a couple of
minutes in the fourth inning, when Ken Griffey's bat slipped from
his hands on a swing and hit a granddaughter of team owner Carl
Lindner. Christine Lindner, 10, was sitting in the first row behind
the Reds dugout when she was hit. She was taken to a hospital for a
few stitches to close a cut on the left side of her forehead. ''You
just feel bad,'' Griffey said. ''You don't want to hurt anybody,
but those things just happen. ... The accident happened on Ken
Griffey Jr. Growth Chart Day, a promotion that drew 40,169 paying
fans.
Orioles-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Manager Mike Hargrove missed his second straight game
in order to attend son Andy's high school graduation in Cleveland.
Bench coach Jeff Newman filled in. ... The Orioles are 12-26 since
April 22 when they were a season-high six games over .500. ...
Albert Belle went 1-for-4 Sunday and has hit safely in 28 of his
last 31 games, going 39-for-119 (.328) over that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos raised their interleague record to 29-23,
including a 19-7 mark at home against AL opponents. Montreal, which
also swept a three-game set from Baltimore at Olympic Stadium June
26-28, 1998, is 6-0 at home against the Orioles. ... Geoff Blum
made his second straight start at second base for the injured Jose
Vidro and made two fine plays in the ninth, including sliding to
his left to field B.J. Surhoff's grounder and throwing to first for
the game's final out. ... Vidro, who was given a cortisone shot
Saturday for a sprained ligament in the middle finger of his right
hand, is expected to return to the lineup Tuesday against the
Yankees.
Red Sox-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: SS Nomar Garciaparra did not start Sunday's game, but
hit a pinch-hit infield single in the 10th inning. Garciaparra is
13-for-21 (.619) in his last six games, including two home runs and
two doubles. ... Mike Stanley is in 13-for-74 (.176) slump. Five of
the hits were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Curt Schilling began his professional career with
the Red Sox. He was the second round selection in the 1986 draft.
... The Phillies will honor their 1980 World Series champions on
June 17. ... P Cliff Politte, who was recalled from Triple-A
Scranton Wilkes-Barre when Paul Byrd was optioned, will make his
first start of the season on Tuesday against Milwaukee.
Royals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals' hottest hitter was signed to be a
defensive replacement. Kansas City got Dave McCarty with the idea
that he could play the late innings at first base for Mike Sweeney.
Given an opportunity to do more, McCarty has a .354 average and a
12-game hitting streak. There's a lesson in that for all players,
manager Tony Muser believes. ''If you can play a little defense,
you can have more lives,'' he said. ''If all you can do is hit and
you stop hitting, what else can you do? If you can play defense,
you're going to keep getting at bats.'' ... Reliever Jason Rakers
was the winning pitcher Sunday, a big turnaround from Friday's game
that saw him give up five runs in one inning. It was tough for
Rakers because he's from the Pittsburgh suburbs and he had family
and friends in the stands. ''That's more like it,'' he said after
Sunday's win. ... The Royals have won 13 games in their last
at-bat, surpassing last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Kevin Young, stuck in a 1-for-19 slump that has
lowered his average to .239, heard boos on Sunday. Young was
0-for-6 and left four runners on base. ''I can't let it get to
me,'' he said. ''This isn't like football where you can go out and
take out your frustration and anger on someone else. If anything,
you have to be the exact opposite. You have to stay calm.''
Indians-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Pat Hentgen's interleague start Monday against the
Kansas City Royals is no special occasion. He's 10-6 with a 4.04
career ERA against the Royals from his years in Toronto, including
2-1 last year. ... Jesse Orosco makes his third rehab start Tuesday
for Triple-A Memphis, although it won't last long. Orosco's first
two appearances were also starts and each lasted 12 pitches. He's
expected to be activated in perhaps another week. ... Three
Cardinals farm hands lead their leagues in reliever standings. Gene
Stechschulte has 10 saves for Triple-A Memphis, Corey Avrad has 14
saves for Double-A Arkansas and Jason Marr has 15 saves for Class A
Potomac. ... Ray Lankford sat out Sunday due to a slightly pulled
left hamstring he hurt running the bases on Saturday. ''It will
take a couple of days,'' he said. ''Maybe in another day I can try
to play on it and just don't try to push it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Dave Burba, who starts Monday at Milwaukee, has won
his last four decisions. He hasn't lost since his second start of
the season against the Rangers April 14. ... Eighteen of closer
Steve Karsay's outings have lasted one inning. He has 11 saves in
13 chances. ... Kenny Lofton, who snapped an 0-for-13 slump on
Saturday, had a home run, two singles and a double the last two
games of the series, going 4-for-8. ''I'm trying to do the little
thing and take some good swings at good pitches,'' Lofton said.
Tigers-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: 3B Shane Andrews will undergo back surgery for a
herniated disc and be sidelined a minimum of eight weeks. ...
Pitcher Kerry Wood will get an extra day between starts and go
Saturday against the White Sox. Manager Don Baylor said he will try
to give Wood an extra day whenever possible as the right-hander
continues his comeback from elbow surgery. ... Infielder Augie
Ojeda made his first major league start, starting at shortstop. He
doubled in his third at-bat in the seventh and the crowd chanted
''Augie, Augie.'' The Cubs are thin at shortstop, already losing
Ricky Gutierrez (separated right shoulder) and Jose Nieves
(strained left hamstring). ... Sunday's 12-inning game was the
longest by inning for the Cubs this season.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RF Juan Gonzalez had to leave Sunday's game after four
innings after fouling a ball off his left foot. Garner said he'll
''wait and see'' whether Gonzalez can play on the artificial turf
in Pittsburgh, starting Monday.
White Sox-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Frank Thomas, who had started 53 of 54 games and played
in all of them, was given his first full day off this season
Sunday. Thomas was replaced in the lineup by Paul Konerko, who went
3-for-4 with two doubles, a walk and two RBIs. Konerko broke out of
a 1-for-26 slump. ... The White Sox have four pitchers, Kevin
Beirne, Mike Sirotka, Kip Wells and Kelly Wunsch, who are Houston
natives.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Mitch Meluskey is leading all NL rookies in home runs
(seven), RBI (31) and extra base hits (18). His 10 multi-hit games
and 21 walks is also tied for the rookie lead in the majors. ...
Jeff Bagwell, who is 1-for-11 in this homestand, still needs two
RBIs to reach 1,000 for his career.
Giants-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Giants manager Dusty Baker, unhappy with the
team's performance over the last couple days, held a closed-door
meeting with his club before Sunday's interleague series finale at
Oakland. San Francisco lost the first two games at Oakland,
dropping to two games below .500. Baker wouldn't go into specifics
about his decision to call the meeting. ''You just get a feeling,''
Baker said. ''Usually, I talk to guys individually. A couple of
times of year, I feel the need to talk to them as a group. You
don't want to do it too much because it loses impact. The more you
yell at your kids, the less they hear you. I don't expect any
overnight action.'' ... 1B J.T. Snow was back in the lineup Sunday
after missing the previous game because of a bout of food
poisoning. Also available was C Doug Mirabelli, who recovered from
an eye irritation that sidelined him Saturday. ''He can see
today,'' Baker said. ... SS Rich Aurilia, was out of the lineup for
a fourth straight game. He hasn't played since straining his left
hamstring Tuesday. Baker said he was available Sunday in an
emergency. ''We just don't want him to pull it completely and then
be out.''
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Reliever Mike Magnante is the only Oakland player
remaining on the DL and manager Art Howe said his rehabilitation of
a strained left hamstring is coming along nicely. ''He's improving
every day,'' Howe said of Magnante, who went on the DL May 27. The
A's had some injury problems early in the season but are now close
to full health with Saturday's return of DH John Jaha from a
shoulder strain. 2B Randy Velarde has come back strong after
missing the first 31 games of the season with a knee injury. ''I
hope all these injuries are behind us,'' Howe said.
Dodgers-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Reliever Gregg Olson, on the DL with a strained
forearm since April 9, began a rehabilitation stint with Class A
San Bernardino. ... OF Todd Hollandsworth missed today's start
after having come out of Saturday's game with a strained right
hamstring. He is available in an emergency, but manager Davey
Johnson hoped to give him a full day of rest. ... Shawn Gilbert
replaced Hollandsworth in center in his first major league start
since 1998, when he was combined 4-for-27 with the Mets and
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Jarrod Washburn, removed from his previous start with a
tight shoulder after five hitless innings, entered his start Sunday
with an overall string of seven hitless innings and stretched that
to 7 2-3 before Shawn Green's single. ... For years, the Angels
went through a revolving door of second baseman next to iron man SS
Gary DiSarcina. With rookie Adam Kennedy now established at second,
but DiSarcina out for the season following shoulder surgery, Kevin
Stocker has become the team's sixth different shortstop this
season.
Blue Jays-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: INF Tony Batista missed his fifth straight game with a
strained left rib cage. Before the injury, Batista had played 151
consecutive games. ... Three Blue Jays still haven't taken a day
off this season. CF Jose Cruz Jr., 1B Carlos Delgado and SS Alex
Gonzalez have played all of Toronto's 58 games. Cruz and Delgado
haven't missed a start, either. RF Raul Mondesi has only missed one
game this year.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins clubhouse is filling up with fish,
literally. ''Big Mouth Billy Bass,'' a mounted rubber fish that
sings songs like ''The River'' and ''Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' is
now a fixture in four lockers. INF Dave Berg bought the first one
Friday for the slumping Alex Gonzalez, hoping to cheer him up.
After Gonzalez got a pair of hits Friday, several Marlins called it
a good luck charm. Now, RHP Ryan Dempster, 1B Kevin Millar and OF
Brant Brown each have a singing fish in their lockers. ... 2B Luis
Castillo missed Sunday's game with a sore left ankle. ''I don't
think one day is going to help it much, but it can't hurt. It just
hasn't healed yet,'' manager John Boles said.
Padres-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: RHP Donne Wall was placed on the 15-day DL
retroactive to June 1 with shoulder tendinitis and recalled RHP
Brandon Kolb from Triple-A Las Vegas. Kolb was 1-1 with a
league-leading 10 saves and a 1.83 ERA (4 ER, 19.2 IP) in 19 games
with Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners pitchers have a 3.29 ERA at home, the
lowest in the American League. ... More than half of the Mariners
current 25-man roster played in the National League during their
careers. ... Although Brian Meadows had never faced the Mariners,
the Seattle batters entered the game with a combined .457 average
(16-for-35) against him.
Diamondbacks-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Entering Sunday night's game against the Rangers, the
Diamondbacks played five straight one-run games on the road. They
lost four of them. ... Arizona's bullpen had allowed only one
earned run over its previous seven innings prior to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Jason McDonald and Scarborough Green will platoon in
center field this week, then Gabe Kapler will take over the job.
Kapler will play three minor league rehab games this week as he
completes his recovery from a partially torn right quad muscle.
Everyday center fielder Ruben Mateo is out for the season with a
fractured right femur. ... The Rangers will recall RHP Ryan Glynn
from Triple-A Oklahoma for Monday night's start against the
Dodgers. LHP Darren Oliver will skip a start due to a tired arm,
but is expected to be back in the rotation next Sunday. ... Rookie
3B Mike Lamb was scratched from the starting lineup due to a
slightly strained right upper back.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Rockies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Pedro Astacio has pitched nine innings in each of his
last two starts in Milwaukee, but had no-decisions both times. He
allowed one run on Aug. 10, 1999 and one unearned run Saturday
night. ... The Rockies matched their season low with only three
hits in Saturday's 2-1, 12-inning loss at Milwaukee. ''You've just
got to give credit to their pitchers,'' manager Buddy Bell said,
''and you can't expect to win the game with only one run.'' ... The
Rockies start their interleague schedule Monday at Seattle.
Colorado is 17-23 in their first three years of interleague play.
... The Rockies have three of the first 100 selections in Monday's
draft. The seventh pick in the first round is their highest
selection in team history.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Saturday's 2-1 victory in 12 innings over the Rockies
marked the first time since last Sept. 25, 1999 that the Brewers
won when scoring three runs or less. ... Milwaukee is 4-0 in
extra-inning games at home in 2000. ... Manager Davey Lopes has
faith that three regulars -- Jeromy Burnitz, Marquis Grissom and
Jose Hernandez -- will boost their numbers to match previous
seasons. ''I have to believe that,'' Lopes said. ''I can't give up
on these guys. Usually guys get close to what they've been in the
past, so that's something to look forward to in the last 107
games.''

   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Hope was optimistic about his
recovery Sunday, just days after being hospitalized in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell them I'm winning,'' Hope told his doctor in response to
the many people asking about his health.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was moved out of the critical care unit Sunday and spent
part of the day watching golf on television, Eisenhower Regional
Medical Center spokeswoman Lea Goodsell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope's condition was upgraded to stable Saturday, and he is
scheduled to be released sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very awake, very alert,'' Goodsell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, 97, received many faxes, cards, and flowers from well
wishers around the world. Former President Gerald Ford paid a visit
to the entertainer's wife, Delores, on Sunday, and Hope was
expected to be able to receive visitors other than family soon.
</P>
<P>
   He was hospitalized in Palm Springs Thursday after experiencing
abdominal pain. He was later transferred to Eisenhower Regional
with gastrointestinal bleeding.

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin isn't taking
sides in the U.S. presidential election of a successor to his
summit partner. He says the Russians are willing to go forward with
either Vice President Al Gore or Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bailey Stopped Simpson Lie Test  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Days after O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and a man
were stabbed to death, the football star underwent a polygraph test
that F. Lee Bailey says he stopped because it was not going well.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Friday, during testimony in a Florida courtroom
where his license to practice law is being challenged, that shortly
after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense
attorney Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who has said he is an expert on polygraph examinations,
said Shapiro wanted his advice about a polygraph test of Simpson in
progress that was not going well.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too
emotional a time for Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said shut the test down, you have to let him settle down,''
said Bailey, who was eventually part of Simpson's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he advised Shapiro that if Simpson was to take a
polygraph examination it should only include questions about
Goldman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Shapiro took the test results and no one has seen
them since. He said Shapiro has said he doesn't have the test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey did not elaborate further on the polygraph episode.
Messages left for Shapiro Sunday afternoon were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has said he never took a polygraph test, but was hooked
up to the machine to see how it worked.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil case against Simpson, lawyers for the Goldman
family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the deaths but the
civil jury found him liable for the crimes. He was ordered to pay
$33.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting of the polygraph incident in the Simpson case
came in Bailey's lengthy accounting of how his time was spent
defending another client, international drug trafficker Claude
Duboc. Bailey is accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of
stock Duboc held in a pharmaceutical company to pay Bailey's legal
expenses.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez tripled, doubled and drove in two
runs as the Seattle Mariners, helped by a highlight catch by Stan
Javier, beat the San Diego Padres 6-4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also scored twice to extend his AL-leading total to 55
runs scored for the Mariners, who were helped by right fielder Stan
Javier's home-run saving grab in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and one on, Nevin hit a long shot to right but
Javier leapt, extended his glove over the fence, flipped the ball
back into play, and caught it while sitting on the ground to
preserve a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Brian Meadows (4-5) walked four batters in the first
three innings -- they all scored -- and fell behind 3-0 before
recording an out.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson led off the game for Seattle with a walk and
stole second. After Mike Cameron walked, Rodriguez followed with a
two-run double to left-center. Edgar Martinez hit an RBI double
that made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the third, Meadows' control and San Diego's
fielding came back to hurt the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud and Javier walked before Tom Lampkin lifted a deep
drive to the left-field warning track. The ball went off Al
Martin's glove for a two-base error that allowed Olerud and Javier
to come home and up the score to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows escaped the inning without any further damage as Martin
made a diving catch of Mark McLemore's liner to left-center for the
third out.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott (2-2) allowed one unearned run and seven hits over 5
1-3 innings to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott left after walking Ruben Rivera and Gonzalez to load the
bases with one out in the sixth. But Jose Paniagua got pinch-hitter
Dave Magadan to hit into a 3-6-1 double play to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres rallied with three runs in the ninth inning on an RBI
triple by Eric Owens and a two-run homer by Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows allowed five runs -- three earned -- four hits and six
walks in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle added its sixth run of the game as Olerud followed
Rodriguez's triple with a sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Nevin was ejected in the seventh inning by home plate
umpire Paul Schrieber for arguing with third base umpire Terry
Craft that Rodriguez should have been called out at third on his
triple. ... The first has been the Mariners' most productive inning
of the year. With three runs in the first, they have now outscored
their opponent 53-29. ... Seattle is 7-10 in interleague games with
the Padres. ... The Mariners lead the AL in receiving intentional
walks with 16. ... Olerud walked twice and leads the AL with 44.
... The Padres placed RHP Donne Wall on the 15-day DL with
tendinitis in his right shoulder. They recalled RHP Brandon Kolb
from Triple-A Las Vegas. ... Tony Gwynn was 4-for-14 in the series
as a DH, making him 10-for-49 (.204) lifetime as a DH. ... Meadows'
six walks ties a Padre single-game high for the season.

By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his major league-leading
23rd home run and Jeff Kent homered twice and doubled twice to
drive in five runs as the San Francisco Giants avoided a sweep by
routing the Oakland Athletics 18-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks and Bill Mueller also homered to back Shawn Estes'
seven-hitter and help the Giants match their biggest scoring burst
of the season. Estes, who fanned eight and walked three in his
eighth career complete game, hit a grand slam and threw a shutout
in San Francisco's 18-0 victory over Montreal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's second road win in the last 12 tries included
six-, five- and four-run innings and followed a closed-door pregame
meeting called by manager Dusty Baker. He was unhappy the Giants
had fallen two games below .500 after starting the series at
Oakland with back-to-back losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, I talk to guys individually,'' Baker said after the
meeting. ''A couple of times of year, I feel the need to talk to
them as a group. You don't want to do it too much because it loses
impact. The more you yell at your kids, the less they hear you. I
don't expect any overnight action.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more like same-day action.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (5-2) won for the fifth time in six decisions over his
last seven starts, gave up a solo homer to Sal Fasano in the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants set the tone at the outset against Omar Olivares
(3-7), who lost his fourth straight decision while allowing eight
runs and 10 hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard and Mueller hit successive singles to start the
game and Bonds drove a 2-1 pitch into the right-field bleachers.
Kent then doubled and eventually scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Burks connected for a leadoff homer in the fourth and Bobby
Estalella's RBI single put San Francisco up 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, San Francisco sent 10 batters to the plate and
scored six.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds singled ahead of Kent's homer, which chased Olivares.
Scott Service relieved and the first three batters he faced reached
on an error and two walks before Ramon Martinez's two-run double, a
sacrifice fly by Estalella and a run-scoring double by Benard.
</P>
<P>
   Kent hit his 16th homer of the season off Rich Sauveur, a
three-run shot in San Francisco's five-run seventh and Mueller
connected off Sauveur in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sunday marked the third straight sellout in the series
between the cross-bay rivals and the three-game attendance of
145,288 was the most ever at the Oakland Coliseum for a three-game
set. It eclipsed the 140,876 who turned out to see the New York
Yankees on May 1-3, 1981. ... Kent's two homers marked the 10th
multihomer game of his career and first since June 16 at Colorado.
... Olivares has allowed seven home runs in his last six starts
after allowing one -- an inside the park homer -- in his first six.
He hasn't won since May 7, a span of five starts. ... The Giants
had 19 hits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Dodgers reliever Antonio Osuna walked
Orlando Palmeiro with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom
of the ninth inning Sunday, giving the Anaheim Angels an 8-7 win
over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels used three walks and a hit batter to score the
winning run. Anaheim won two of three from their neighbors in the
interleague series.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna (0-2) walked Kevin Stocker to lead off the ninth and with
one out, hit Tim Salmon with a pitch. A groundout moved up the
runners and Troy Glaus also walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro walked on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival (3-2) pitched one inning for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim overcame deficits of 4-0 and 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels drew even at 7 with two runs in the eighth. Bengie
Molina hit an RBI single off Matt Herges and, after Osuna came in
and walked Scott Spiezio to load the bases, Adam Kennedy had an RBI
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit a three-run homer and doubled twice for the
Dodgers. His first-inning shot was his 16th of the season and No.
227 of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cey holds the Los Angeles record with 228 homers, while Duke
Snider holds the franchise record of 389.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter capped the Dodgers' four-run first off Jarrod
Washburn. Carlos Perez allowed Glaus' RBI single in the bottom
half, and let the Angels get as close as 4-3 on Salmon's two-run
homer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers stretched the lead to 6-3 on F.P. Santangelo's RBI
single and Mark Grudzielanek's sacrifice fly in the fourth. Kreuter
hit a solo homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored twice in the sixth. Glaus drove in a run with a
grounder and Molina's single made it 7-5.
Notes: Perez has been scored on in the first inning in seven of
his 10 starts, allowing a total of 13 runs. ... Kreuter has hit in
10 straight games. ... Shawn Gilbert replaced Todd Hollandsworth
(strained right hamstring) in the lineup, his first major league
start since 1998 when he spent time with both the Mets and
Cardinals. ... Kennedy, the Angels' No. 2 hitter all season, batted
ninth for the first time Sunday and was 0-for-4.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Seismologists said a powerful earthquake and
several strong aftershocks rocked the island of Sumatra, causing at least 25
deaths and leaving thousands homeless. The Indonesian Meteorological and
Geophysical Service said the quake, measuring 7.3, was centered beneath the
Indian Ocean, about 400 miles northwest of Jakarta. The U.S. Geological Survey
in Golden, Colo., reported the earthquake's strength at 7.9. The quake lasted

OAS Assembly Begins Monday

<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- As hundreds of anti-free trade protesters chanted
outside, foreign ministers from the Organization of American States launched
their annual assembly today, expecting to focus on Peru's presidential election.
The Windsor protest -- which was mirrored by another across the U.S. river
border in Detroit -- brought the OAS, which also deals with trade issues,
face-to-face with the same movement that obstructed December's World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle. Suffocating security measures and hundreds of
police in riot gear prevented demonstrators from crossing into a security zone

Alleged Terrorist Claims Attacks
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who said he coordinated most of Iran's terror
operations of the last decade claimed responsibility for two major attacks on
the United States, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 and the Khobar Towers
bombing, ''60 Minutes'' reported today. The man, whom the CBS News program
identified as Ahmad Behbanani, told a ''60 Minutes'' journalist that he proposed
the 1988 Pan Am operation, brought on board a radical Palestinian terrorist
living in Syria, then imported and trained Libyan operatives to do the job. The
program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's mistaken shooting
down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger plane.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials should consider designating Greece and Pakistan

strengthen the category by banning those countries' citizens from traveling here
without visas, a blue-ribbon commission says. Pakistan provides ''safe haven,
transit and moral, political and diplomatic support to several groups engaged in
terrorism'' and Greece -- a NATO ally -- ''has been disturbingly passive in
response to terrorist activities,'' according to the National Commission on
Terrorism, a panel of private experts and former government officials. The
commission is due to report to lawmakers on Monday.

   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization said Sunday that the Japanese
have the best prospects for long and active lives, and can expect 74{ years of
healthy life. A WHO study measured ''disability-adjusted'' life expectancy,
subtracting years according to the prevalence and severity of ailments ranging
from malaria to lung disease. Americans lag behind because of miserable
standards among the U.S. poor -- who fare worse than many Africans. Australia,
at 73.2 years, came second, followed by France, Sweden, Spain and Italy. The

   HONG KONG (AP) -- Police were searching Sunday for about 400 prisoners who

between Vietnamese and Hong Kong inmates at the Hei Ling Chau center on an
outlying island, the Correctional Services Department said in a statement. The
sparely populated island is located far from Hong Kong's urban areas so there
was little likelihood that the prisoners could remain at large for long.

<HEADLINE> Firefighting Copter Crashes in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A government helicopter fighting
wildfires in southwest Florida crashed Sunday morning, killing the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell UH-1 Huey was equipped to carry 200 gallons of water,
said Liz Compton, a Florida Department of Agriculture spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had dumped the load and was going back to get more water
when he crashed,'' Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was being flown for the Division of Forestry. The
cause of the crash is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, George A. Burton, 48, had been fighting a fire that
reportedly threatened about a dozen homes near Fort Myers. Fire
officials could not immediately confirm the extent of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first of the year, 3,300 fires have burned 120,000
acres in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, hot, dry conditions have fueled wildfires in
several states.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in New Mexico had a blaze in the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains about 70 percent contained Sunday. The fire had forced
the evacuation of hundreds since it began Monday in a pine forest
east of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire threat in the area remained high despite
thunderstorms Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, an 11,000-acre fire in the Kaibab National Forest
was about 75 percent contained Sunday. Authorities said the steep
rugged terrain has made part of the fire impossible to reach, but
natural barriers and fire lines now ring the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody expects it to be completely out until we get some rain
on it,'' fire information officer Jason Abraham said.

<HEADLINE> OAS Launches Annual Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- As hundreds of anti-free trade
protesters chanted outside, foreign ministers from the Organization
of American States launched their annual assembly Sunday, expecting
to focus on Peru's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   While the first hours of protests were largely peaceful,
demonstrations briefly flared up in Windsor when protesters blocked
a bus outside the heavily guarded OAS meeting site.
</P>
<P>
   Police dragged off about 30 protesters, who chanted ''Shame!
Shame! Shame!'' and wagged fingers at officers, who in turn rapped
nightsticks on riot shields to move the crowd back. Protesters
tried to force their way into the area before police managed to
shut the gate, inciting the demonstrators to throw bottles and
debris.
</P>
<P>
   The Windsor protest -- which was mirrored by another across the
U.S. river border in Detroit -- brought the OAS face-to-face with
the anti-free trade movement that obstructed December's World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Suffocating security measures and hundreds of police in riot
gear prevented demonstrators from crossing into a security zone set
up within a 10-foot fence around several blocks in downtown
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Police sprayed two people with pepper spray when a group tried
to climb the fence. There were no other immediate reports of
unrest. Police arrested about two dozen people Friday and Saturday
in the run-up to the OAS meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some OAS delegates complained that the organization was being
wrongly targeted, noting there were no clear trade issues on the
assembly's agenda. The OAS represents more than 30 member Western
Hemisphere nations.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the hundreds waving signs and chanting, protest
speakers said the OAS -- as part of an international power structure
including the WTO and International Monetary Fund -- had helped
erode workers' rights and exacerbate poverty through free-trade
agreements and other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Activist author Noam Chomsky rejected what he called the
''childish nonsense'' of free-trade advocates who say globalization
is an unstoppable tidal wave engulfing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free trade agreements are nothing of the sort, and they're
certainly not agreements,'' he said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm protesting an organization that essentially wants to make
decisions about my life and about other workers' lives without me
having any say about it,'' said Craig Regester, 29, a Detroit
protester. ''This isn't Seattle, but this is definitely an emerging
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The first confrontation with authorities Sunday came before the
rally really began, when some protesters near the OAS meeting site
tried to hang an anti-free trade banner from the chain-link
security fence. A homemade smoke bomb was also lobbed over the
fence toward police, filling the air with mist, according to
Canadian Press news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about 150 people sat in the path of a bus carrying
delegates into the meeting compound, it said. Some people painted
slogans on the vehicle, and its left front tire was flattened,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Dave Rektor confirmed that 30
protestors had been arrested, according to the news agency. One
police officer suffered a minor facial injury that required brief
hospital treatment, he reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old OAS had planned during the Windsor meeting to
focus on human security issues in the Americas while taking care of
normal business, such as approving a next year's budget and
electing some officers and committees.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Premier Jean Chretien was to open the assembly Sunday
night, though some ministers held informal discussions Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   OAS delegates were also scheduled to consider last month's
presidential run-off in Peru, after a human rights report accused
the South American country of failing to meet democratic election
standards. If the foreign ministers agree, they could subject Peru
to OAS sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori was the only candidate on the ballot,
after challenger Alejandro Toledo boycotted what he said was an
unfair election process.
</P>
<P>
   Several former world leaders, including former President Jimmy
Carter, sharply criticized Peru in an open letter to the foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, led by special envoy to Latin America
Kenneth ''Buddy'' MacKay, have supported a harsh response to Peru's
elections, while Mexico and Brazil have expressed fear over setting
a precedent of OAS intervention over electoral issues. Mexico is
holding a presidential election next month.
</P>
<P>
   The organization must avoid becoming ''a substitute for
functions that correspond to state institutions,'' said Mexico's
OAS ambassador, Claude Heller.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS meets through Tuesday in Windsor, a middle-class city of
about 262,000 across the Detroit River from the Motor City.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan To Stay on Calif. Ballot  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California Reform Party members rejected a
move by Ross Perot loyalists to keep presidential hopeful Patrick
Buchanan off the ballot in the nation's most vote-rich state.
</P>
<P>
   By a show of credentials, Buchanan's opponents joined his
supporters on Sunday to kill a watered-down version of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Some could not stomach the thought of breaking up the party,
however temporarily, which they had worked years to build.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not dissolve this party on a whim because we are in the
middle of a bit of turmoil,'' said Valli Sharbe-Geisler of San
Jose, who is undecided on Buchanan. ''We disaffiliate, (then) we
create a vacuum. Fools rush in where a vacuum appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime members believe that's already happened in the
absence of Perot, who has remained silent this year and has made no
move to lead the party or run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a former White House speechwriter and expert in
foreign policy, entered the picture in October after being
overshadowed by other candidates in the GOP primary for the third
straight presidential election in a row. He's on track to receive
the Reform Party's presidential nomination at its Aug. 10-13
convention, as well as the $12.6 million in federal funding that
comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan got word of the California vote minutes after speaking
to about 50 people at the Rhode Island Reform Party Convention in
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what you're seeing is sort of last ditch efforts by
people who are unreconciled to my nomination to derail it, even if
it causes damage to the party, and they've failed at every stop so
far,'' he told reporters. ''We had a great, great weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime party members have not given up blocking him.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees to the party's platform -- which is silent on social
issues -- have been offended by Buchanan's outspokenness on abortion
and homosexuality, as well as his campaign tactics in pursuing
delegate votes to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jim Mangia, the national party secretary from San
Francisco, this group circulated a resolution at the convention
that would have given Buchanan a choice: Either promise to abide by
certain rules or wave goodbye to ballot access.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the state board's 13 directors signed off on a
resolution Saturday that said the California chapter of Perot's
Reform Party would split from the national organization -- and thus
provide no ballot in California for its nominee's name on Election
Day -- unless Buchanan agreed:
</P>
<P>
   --That the national convention delegates, not he, will select a
running mate;
</P>
<P>
   --To not apply litmus tests on social issues to that running
mate, and;
</P>
<P>
   --To not add his anti-abortion position or other views on social
policy to the Reform Party platform, which is silent on those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday when the measure came before the state convention,
Buchanan's supporters responded with shouts, boos and hisses. The
authors proposed to soften the language by applying the
questionnaire to all of the party's presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They assured delegates that the party could rejoin the national
group after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The boos died down a bit, but the prospect of giving up the
party however temporarily was too disturbing even for some
Buchanan's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to stay together as a group,'' said Sharbe-Geisler.
</P>
<P>
   The authors watered down the resolution still more by deleting
the part about disaffiliating. Without it, the party would endorse
only those candidates who answer the questions affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by a show of delegate credentials instead of a voice
vote, convention delegates rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of Reform Party members believe that Pat should
not be put to that type of test,'' said his political director, Tim
Haley.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan himself dismissed the uproar in California earlier in
the day, saying what mattered is his showing with delegate votes.
</P>
<P>
   But California, home to a fifth of the nation's voters, is only
the latest state to consider disaffiliating from the national party
to protest Buchanan's candidacy. State chapters in such states as
Colorado and Kentucky have condemned Buchanan's campaign and
discussed splitting from the national party. And in Iowa this
weekend, the state party's office holders resigned in protest.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Picks Up Tony for 'Aida'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Susan Stroman, whose musical ''Contact,'' a
daring dance play that pushes musical-theater boundaries, won the
award for best choreography Sunday at the 2000 Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice picked up the award for best score for
their pop retelling of ''Aida.'' Neither was there to accept the
prize. The show also got the Tony for scenic design.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns just as real
life does, Had I not fallen in love with Mike Ockrent I could have
never have written 'Contact,''' said an emotional Stroman
referring, to her husband, a director who died last December of
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Copenhagen,'' a thoughtful examination of the morality of
physics and friendship, was the favorite for best play.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest competition for ''Copenhagen'' in the best-play
category was expected to be ''Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's
fanciful homage to sex goddess Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   Also nominated were ''The Ride Down Mt. Morgan,'' Arthur
Miller's tale of an unrepentant bigamist, and ''True West,'' a dark
comedy by Sam Shepard about two fiercely competitive brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' a look at three very different relationships,
attempts to redefine the modern musical, creating its characters
and stories mostly through dance. It uses little dialogue and
prerecorded music, mostly standards ranging from Rodgers and Hart
to Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact'' faces its stiffest challenge from ''The Wild
Party,'' adapted from a Jazz Age poem. The other nominees for best
musical include ''James Joyce's The Dead,'' based on the Irish
writer's famous short story, and ''Swing!'', a revue featuring
big-band music and swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, after a year's absence, was again chosen to
preside over the three-hour ceremonies at Radio City Music Hall,
with an assist from Nathan Lane. The first hour aired on PBS before
switching to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has promised there would be no repeat of last year
when the CBS part of the program threatened to run long and forced
a number from ''It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues,'' one of the
nominated musicals, to be cut from the show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said she gave the nominees a pep talk earlier in the
week, telling them to keep their speeches ''short, concise and
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway season, which ended May 28, was considered a robust
one, although production slipped a bit, from 39 shows last year to
37 this year. It grossed a record $603 million, a 2.6 percent
increase over the previous year, according to the League of
American Theaters and Producers. Attendance was the second highest
in Broadway history, 11.4 million, down slightly from a record 11.7
million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in 21 categories were chosen by 705 members of the
theatrical profession and journalists. The Tony awards were started
in 1947 by the American Theater Wing, a theater service
organization. They were named after Antoinette Perry, an actress
and past chairwoman of the theater wing.

<HEADLINE> Maimed Woman Backs Wildlife Refuge  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- After a Siberian tiger tore off Renee Black's arm,
she returned to the wildlife refuge and publicly pleaded to keep
the tiger alive and the facility open.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they close it, all the work I've done and all the money
I've contributed would be washed down the drain,'' Black said.
''Then I've lost my arm for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, 28, had been a volunteer at the refuge near Agate, 55
miles east of Denver, for two years. Two weeks ago, she was showing
a potential volunteer around the refuge when she reached into the
tiger's cage to scratch his head. The tiger bit her arm off.
</P>
<P>
   The incident spurred state and federal officials to call for
investigations of the Prairie Wind Wild Animal Refuge, opened in
1991 and home to tigers, lions, wolf hybrids, foxes, mountain lions
and bears that were raised in captivity and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   At Black's urging a week after the attack, authorities decided
against killing the tiger. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture
is trying to determine whether refuge owner Michael Jurich has
violated federal laws, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife is
investigating conditions at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Black admits reaching into the cage was unwise since the tiger,
named Boris, had been at the refuge for only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Black tried to rub his head, Boris began nibbling at her
hand. She jerked back instinctively, and the tiger bit down,
tearing off her right arm just below the shoulder. Doctors said the
quick action of refuge workers who made a tourniquet with a belt to
slow the bleeding saved Black's life, but her arm could not be
reattached.
</P>
<P>
   Black's stitches were removed on Friday, and on Wednesday, she
will be fitted for a prosthetic arm. She says she still has to
raise much of the $40,000 to pay for it, and she hasn't been able
to help her husband at their sandwich shop where she used to work
the register and take customer's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Black says her top concern right now is the fate of Boris
and the other animals. She said the owner has devoted his life to
the place and has the support of 20 to 40 volunteers who feed the
animals and clean their cages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurich, the owner, refused to allow federal investigators to
inspect the 40-acre refuge after the May 20 attack on the grounds
that it is private, no longer open to the public and no longer
licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A U.S. magistrate
on May 26 issued a warrant allowing the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA previously cited Jurich for ''repeated failure to
provide an adequate diet'' to the animals, a charge he has denied.
He accuses the agency of ''capricious and arbitrary'' inspection
procedures and says he loves the animals in the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger ''didn't know what he was doing,'' Black said Friday.
''If they were to close down this animal refuge, that would break
my heart.''

<HEADLINE> Ireland 2, Mexico 2  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Richard Dunne and Domonic Foley scored in the
second half Sunday as Ireland rallied for a 2-2 tie with Mexico in
the U.S. Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams blew opportunities to win in the final minutes. Irish
midfielder Kevin Kilbane's shot went just wide, and Irish
goalkeeper Dean Kiely saved a goal at the other end by punching
Joaquin Beltran's header off a corner kick into the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish play the United States on Tuesday in Boston while
Mexico takes on South Africa on Wednesday in Dallas. The Americans
beat South Africa 4-0 on Saturday in the opener of the U.S. Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from pride and bragging rights, the game had little
meaning for either team. Ireland missed out on the European
Championship and doesn't start qualifying for the World Cup until
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish also were playing without four of their top players,
including captain Roy Keane. Keane, who plays for Manchester
United, suffered a hamstring injury and missed United's final three
games in England's Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico essentially brought a club team. Most of the players were
from Pumas, and Pumas coach Hugo Sanchez, not national manager
Manuel Lapuente, coached the Mexicans on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the club team that dominated early, taking a 2-0 lead
in the 54th minute when Horacio Sanchez tapped in a pass from
Daniel Osorno right in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   After being outshot 7-3 in the first half, the Irish finally got
going in the second. In the 60th minute, Jason McAteer took a
corner kick that sailed wide, but Gary Breen headed it back toward
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne, waiting right in front of the goal, kicked it in with the
inside of his right foot to cut Mexico's lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland scored again 11 minutes later on the smoothest play of
the game. McAteer passed to Stephen Carr, who dribbled downfield
toward the right side of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   When Carr was about six yards out, he sent a crossing pass to
Foley, who simply tapped the ball home, tying the game at 2 in the
71st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico scored its first goal in the 38th minute. Daniel Osorno
took a pass from Luis Perez and shot from about 20 yards out. The
ball deflected off of Breen and into the right side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had a chance to score in the 45th minute when Niall
Quinn headed McAteer's corner kick toward the net, but the ball hit
the post and bounced off.

<HEADLINE> Perot Backers Rebuffed in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California Reform Party members rejected a
move by Ross Perot loyalists to keep presidential hopeful Patrick
Buchanan off the ballot in the nation's most vote-rich state.
</P>
<P>
   By a show of credentials, Buchanan's opponents joined his
supporters on Sunday to kill a watered-down version of the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Some could not stomach the thought of breaking up the party,
however temporarily, which they had worked years to build.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not dissolve this party on a whim because we are in the
middle of a bit of turmoil,'' said Valli Sharbe-Geisler of San
Jose, who is undecided on Buchanan. ''We disaffiliate, (then) we
create a vacuum. Fools rush in where a vacuum appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime members believe that's already happened in the
absence of Perot, who has remained silent this year and has made no
move to lead the party or run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a former White House speechwriter and expert in
foreign policy, entered the picture in October after being
overshadowed by other candidates in the GOP primary for the third
straight presidential election in a row. He's on track to receive
the Reform Party's presidential nomination at its Aug. 10-13
convention, as well as the $12.6 million in federal funding that
comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan got word of the California vote minutes after speaking
to about 50 people at the Rhode Island Reform Party Convention in
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what you're seeing is sort of last ditch efforts by
people who are unreconciled to my nomination to derail it, even if
it causes damage to the party, and they've failed at every stop so
far,'' he told reporters. ''We had a great, great weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime party members have not given up blocking him.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees to the party's platform -- which is silent on social
issues -- have been offended by Buchanan's outspokenness on abortion
and homosexuality, as well as his campaign tactics in pursuing
delegate votes to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jim Mangia, the national party secretary from San
Francisco, this group circulated a resolution at the convention
that would have given Buchanan a choice: Either promise to abide by
certain rules or wave goodbye to ballot access.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the state board's 13 directors signed off on a
resolution Saturday that said the California chapter of Perot's
Reform Party would split from the national organization -- and thus
provide no ballot in California for its nominee's name on Election
Day -- unless Buchanan agreed:
</P>
<P>
   --That the national convention delegates, not he, will select a
running mate;
</P>
<P>
   --To not apply litmus tests on social issues to that running
mate, and;
</P>
<P>
   --To not add his anti-abortion position or other views on social
policy to the Reform Party platform, which is silent on those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday when the measure came before the state convention,
Buchanan's supporters responded with shouts, boos and hisses. The
authors proposed to soften the language by applying the
questionnaire to all of the party's presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They assured delegates that the party could rejoin the national
group after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The boos died down a bit, but the prospect of giving up the
party however temporarily was too disturbing even for some
Buchanan's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to stay together as a group,'' said Sharbe-Geisler.
</P>
<P>
   The authors watered down the resolution still more by deleting
the part about disaffiliating. Without it, the party would endorse
only those candidates who answer the questions affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by a show of delegate credentials instead of a voice
vote, convention delegates rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of Reform Party members believe that Pat should
not be put to that type of test,'' said his political director, Tim
Haley.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan himself dismissed the uproar in California earlier in
the day, saying what mattered is his showing with delegate votes.
</P>
<P>
   But California, home to a fifth of the nation's voters, is only
the latest state to consider disaffiliating from the national party
to protest Buchanan's candidacy. State chapters in such states as
Colorado and Kentucky have condemned Buchanan's campaign and
discussed splitting from the national party. And in Iowa this
weekend, the state party's office holders resigned in protest.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 6, Red Sox 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- All Kevin Jordan did was follow his
manager's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's two-out RBI double in the bottom of the 12th gave the
Philadelphia Phillies a 6-5 victory over the Boston Red Sox as the
Phillies recorded their first three-game sweep of the season.
</P>
<P>
   As the Phillies came to bat in the 12th, manager Terry Francona
told Jordan, ''if you get up, you're going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember a manager ever telling me that before,''
Jordan said. ''I kind of put it out of my mind though. I just
wanted to concentrate up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant led off the 12th with a single against Rheal Cormier
(2-1) and advanced to second on a wild pitch. One out later, Mike
Lieberthal was walked intentionally. Pat Burrell then struck out
and Jordan drove a 1-1 pitch off over the head of center-fielder
Carl Everett to score the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought at first he (Everett) might make a play,'' Jordan
said. ''I played with him in the minors and I know he is a real
good fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Francona was pleased with the three-game sweep but emphasized it
doesn't guarantee anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played a real good series, but now we have to play good
against Tampa Bay or this won't mean much,'' Francona said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, whose five-game losing streak is their longest of
the season, broke out to a 5-0 lead against Curt Schilling in the
third inning. But Boston was held to three hits and no runs in the
final nine innings by Schilling and six relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 162 game schedule,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said.
''We just have to keep going. It's a long season.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling didn't allow a hit after Everett's three-run homer
capped a five-run third inning. Schilling allowed five hits in 7
1-3 innings, struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my last two outings, there has been one inning that has
hurt me,'' Schilling said. ''Both mentally and physically I felt
real good. It's a lot less frustrating when you win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shrenk (2-1) got the final out of the 12th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero, who is off to his best start since 1995 when he
was 7-1 with Montreal, allowed four runs and eight hits in eight
innings, but was denied his seventh win in eight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've just got to get a win somewhere,'' Fassero said. ''We're
struggling right now and we got to start executing a little better.
We just have to snap out of it as quick as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   After Everett's home run, the Red Sox didn't get another hit
until Nomar Garciaparra hit a pinch-hit infield single with two
outs in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made good pitches when they had to, especially after the
third inning,'' Williams said. We just have to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies have hit 18 home runs in their last 11 games.
... Boston's Brian Daubach was hitless in four trips and now has
only four hits in his last 33 at-bats. ... The Phillies hit three
homers off Fassero, after allowing only two in his previous 10
starts.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Argentina and Brazil both eked out 1-0 victories
Sunday in
qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup to take the top two spots in the
South American standings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Argentina, the world champion in 1978 and 1986, needed Gustavo
Lopez's left-footed volley from the edge of the penalty box with
seven minutes left to beat Bolivia at Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts were sluggish in the opening 45 minutes, but dominated
the second half. Minutes after the break, Claudio Lopez tested
Bolivian goalkeeper Jose Carlos Fernandez with a swerving volley.
Later, Fernandez punched away a bending shot by Roberto Sensini,
and Gabriel Batistuta's free kick hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, owner of a record four World Cup titles and runner-up to
France in 1994, got past Peru in Lima thanks to a goal by Antonio
Carlos in the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos, positioned at the edge of the penalty box, took a long
pass from Cafu, chested the ball past goalkeeper Miguel Miranda,
then scored with a left-footed shot.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil striker Edmundo was ejected with four minutes left for a
rough tackle on Roberto Palacios, but Peru couldn't capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   Peru has won three of 32 games against Brazil since 1936, with
the last victory 15 years ago. The last time they met, in 1997,
Brazil won 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Colombia beat Venezuela 3-0 at Bogota. Midfielder
Alexander Viveros made it 1-0 in the 27th minute, defender Ivan
Ramiro Cordoba doubled the lead 15 minutes later, and Ivan Rene
Valenciano finished the scoring with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina improved to 3-0 for nine points, two ahead of Brazil
(2-0-1) and three up on Paraguay and Uruguay (both 2-1). Bolivia
dropped to 0-2-1, Peru to 1-1-1, and Colombia is 1-0-2. Venezuela
is 0-3 and has been outscored 9-0.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Terrorist Claims Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who said he coordinated most of Iran's
terror operations of the last decade claimed responsibility for two
major attacks on the United States, the destruction of Pan Am
Flight 103 and the Khobar Towers bombing, ''60 Minutes'' reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whom the CBS News program identified as Ahmad
Behbahani, told a ''60 Minutes'' journalist that he proposed the
1988 Pan Am operation, brought on board a radical Palestinian
terrorist living in Syria, then imported and trained Libyan
operatives to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's
mistaken shooting down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours ahead of the telecast, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' that the report
was interesting and her department would monitor the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you have to remember that the Pan Am 103 trial is going on
now. I think it's inappropriate to comment on the specifics of
it,'' she said. ''That trial is in the process, ... and it's been
in preparation a long time. I'm sure that they will consider all
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyans, alleged agents of Libyan intelligence, are on trial
before a Scottish court impaneled in the Netherlands on murder and
other charges. The Dec. 21, 1988, attack over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1996 truck bombing of Khobar Towers, a barracks for U.S.
airmen in Saudi Arabia in which 19 Air Force personnel died, the
man spoke of evidence that Iran masterminded the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-born associate producer Roya Hakakian, who met the man
inside a refugee camp in Turkey, said Behbahani ''referred to
himself as 'we,' and it was very clear ... that he was the person
who oversaw and coordinated these activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of tight Turkish security -- Behbahani said it was
because Turkish officials feared Iranian agents wanted to kill him
-- the interview was not recorded, the program said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could very well be (an assassin),'' Hakakian said
Behbahani told her. ''I personally posed as a reporter when I
killed Mr. Ghassemlou in Vienna.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Rahman Ghassemlou, a leader of Iran's Kurdish resistance
movement, was shot to death with two colleagues in July 1989 while
attending secret peace talks with the Iranian government in the
Austrian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Because the subject of the ''60 Minutes'' segment never appeared
on camera, his identity could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, the Washington office of the dissident National
Council of Resistance of Iran circulated a news release reporting
that Ahmad Beladi-Behbahani, Iran's deputy minister for
counterintelligence, had entered Turkey and urged the Turkish
government to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The council blamed the deputy minister for murders of many
dissidents in Europe and elsewhere and said he ''had detailed
information about the Lockerbie bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In France on Sunday, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, exiled first
president of Iran's Islamic republic, said Behbahani left Iran two
months ago and sought refuge in another country. Bani-Sadr's office
interviewed him on a number of matters, including political
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Bani-Sadr said that Turkish authorities had ''hidden'' Behbahani
and a second person, a Mr. Akbari, once top aide to former
Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian who also spoke to CBS News.
Akbari also left Iran two months ago seeking refuge, Bani-Sadr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Behbahani's jobs in Iran was that of vice-commander of the
Qods Army, which Bani-Sadr said was a division of the Revolutionary
Guard whose responsibilities included terrorist activities abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes'' said the Central Intelligence Agency in
Washington at first said it had never heard of Behbahani. After
contacting British intelligence, the program said, the CIA
confirmed that a man named Ahmad Behbahani orchestrated Iranian
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The program said CIA debriefers, after being rebuffed
previously, finally met with Behbahani during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow told The Associated Press on Sunday he
was ''not in a position to confirm or deny'' the CBS report.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Election Problems Persist  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TOOTHAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Spanish firm hired to fix the
technical problems that led to the suspension of Venezuela's
national balloting threatened to pull out of the process unless
elections are postponed until August.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Indra in Venezuela, Juan Navarro, said too many
technical problems still exist, and added that if the interim
legislature decides to hold elections in July his company ''won't
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't risk our prestige, we can't deceive our client,''
said Navarro. His comments appeared in Sunday's El Nacional
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Tribunal, the country's highest court,
suspended elections because of computer problems that threatened
the vote count for the May 28 election.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement of the vote and the subsequent resignation of
the five-member National Election Council last Monday, due to
pressure from both pro-government and opposition parties, has
created an electoral crisis and calls for reforming the electoral
process.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders insisted the postponement reflected
astonishing incompetence by members of the election board, who were
hand-picked by President Hugo Chavez's political coalition -- an
exercise widely criticized as undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral crisis comes at a critical moment for Venezuela.
Politically, the country has been in limbo since last year when
Chavez pushed through a new constitution that dissolved the
congress and called for new balloting to ''re-legitimize'' most
public offices, including the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt,
insists he is carrying out a ''social revolution'' in Venezuela
through radical reform, but his opponents claim he represents a
threat to the democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said additional time was needed to reorganize because of
problems with the database and the ballots that contain information
on more than 36,000 candidates running for some 6,200 offices.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the country's temporary congress appointed a new
election council who must scramble to correct last minute changes
in the database containing candidate lists, erroneous information
on ballots, and reprogram software before new balloting can occur.
</P>
<P>
   The process was intended to help restore public confidence in a
board that was plagued by accusations of incompetence and political
ties.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Francisco Arias Cardenas, Chavez's main
political rival, said Arias opposed giving the congress a role in
selecting the board members because the temporary legislature is
dominated by the president's political allies. He added, however,
Arias was willing to give the new board the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature is expected to set a fresh election date this
week.

<HEADLINE> Russia Patriarch Eyes Pope Meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The head of Russia's Orthodox Church said Sunday
he didn't rule out a meeting with Pope John Paul II, but said
centuries-old disagreements between the Catholic and Orthodox
churches needed to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a meeting shouldn't happen just before the television
cameras,'' Patriarch Alexy II said during a trip to northern
Russia, according to the Interfax news agency. ''It's necessary
that it be well prepared for and bring about concrete results.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alexy said ''bleeding still continues from the wounds'' that
continue to strain relations. Among outstanding issues, he
mentioned Roman Catholic dioceses in western parts of Ukraine that
he said belong to the Orthodox fold. The dioceses switched
allegiances centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials on Saturday ruled out a visit to Russia by the
pope. There was speculation that President Vladimir Putin, who will
visit Italy next week, would ask the pope to come to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei has been an outspoken supporter of a law in Russia
banning foreign religious groups from the country and has not
supported efforts to ease tensions between the Catholic and
Orthodox churches.

<HEADLINE> After a decade, new hearings on Sound cleanup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Ten years ago, sewage washing up on the
shores of Long Island Sound routinely closed beaches and fish kills
devastated those making their living on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of lobsters are dying off in a mystery
scientists are rushing to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the cleanup spurred from the outrage and ideas voiced
in public hearings on the Sound in 1990, environmental officials
are this year holding a new round of forums. The goal is to build
on the efforts that have improved the health of the Sound and
tackle problems that remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the new hearings ... really put a spotlight on these
critical areas,'' said David J. Miller, executive director of the
National Audubon Society of New York State, who organized the
Listen to the Sound hearings in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Those hearings, where more than 400 people testified, led to the
creation of a Citizens' Agenda for the future of Long Island Sound
</P>
<P>
   ''It had a serious and beneficial impact on the Comprehensive
Management plan adopted by the EPA,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency Comprehensive Conservation
and Management Plan was finalized and adopted by the governors of
Connecticut and New York in 1994, along with a Long Island Sound
Restoration Agreement. The agreement committed the federal
government and the states to carry out the plan, which resulted in
the reduction of sewage and toxic pollutants in the Sound and its
surrounding marshlands.
</P>
<P>
   Annual beach cleanups have become a staple on the New York and
Connecticut shorelines. So have regular education programs. Most
schools in shoreline communities have some curriculum based on Long
Island Sound ecology, said David Galt, director of Environmental
Programs for the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection's sale of Sound preservation license plates has funded
183 projects in 53 towns since its inception in 1992. On May 31,
the state announced it had sold 100,000 plates, and awarded
$336,000 in grants to 22 environmental projects to benefit the
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Galt said more needs to be done, including improvements at
sewage treatment plants in New York, which have lagged behind
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements are hard to gauge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as all the marine life in Long Island Sound, has it
improved? Well, we've just had the lobster die-off, and it's also
affecting crabs,'' he said. ''There have been ups and downs of
specific species, but is that a natural occurrence? We don't
know.''

<HEADLINE> Perot loyalists in California push for Buchanan's cooperation or disaffiliation </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Longtime Reform Party members here are
pushing to give conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan a choice:
Either promise to abide by certain rules or wave goodbye to ballot
access in the nation's largest state.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Buchanan, who is pursuing the third party's
nomination, says any such policy is merely a lunge for publicity by
the conservative commentator's political enemies. What counts,
Buchanan said Sunday, is his drive for delegates to the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of it is horse-race nonsense,'' he said on Fox News
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the state board's 13 directors signed off on a
resolution Saturday that said the California chapter of Perot's
Reform Party would split from the national organization -- and thus
provide no ballot in California for its nominee's name on Election
Day -- unless Buchanan agrees:
</P>
<P>
   --That the national convention delegates, not he, will select a
running mate;
</P>
<P>
   --To not apply litmus tests on social issues to that running
mate, and;
</P>
<P>
   --To not add his anti-abortion position or other views on social
policy to the Reform Party platform, which is silent on those
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked that day to respond to each of those challenges, Buchanan
said he recognizes the party's procedure for picking vice
presidential candidates, but insisted that regardless, his running
mate would be ''pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan did not answer the second question, but he has said
that he would not accept a running mate who supports abortion
rights or is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   As for the third question, Buchanan said he would not try to
change the platform this year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the resolution felt that his answers were too
vague and were putting the measure before the state convention on
Sunday. Some favored softening the language by taking out
Buchanan's name and challenging all of the party's presidential
candidates to agree to those provisions. None of the other
candidates are nationally known, and none besides Buchanan has
challenged those provisions.
</P>
<P>
   If any one of them demurred, the state party would disaffiliate
after the national convention Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach, according
to a new draft of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the effort said they likely would push to
rejoin the national Reform Party next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Haley, Buchanan's political director, monitored the
proceedings and said the proposal is a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small group of malcontented people that want to cause
trouble,'' he said. ''All they care about is getting some attention
for what I think is the minority view.''
</P>
<P>
   California, home to a fifth of the nation's voters, is the
latest state to consider disaffiliating from the national party to
protest Buchanan's social positions and the tactics his campaign
has used to win national convention delegates. State chapters in
such states as Colorado and Kentucky have condemned Buchanan's
campaign and discussed splitting from the national party. And in
Iowa this weekend, the state party's office holders resigned in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Buchanan maintains that he has the right to pursue
the Reform Party's presidential nomination in whatever way he sees
fit and has suggested that he would rescue the bickering
organization from self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   During a rousing speech here on Saturday, he urged party members
to focus on issues all sides hold in common -- primarily trade and
other foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're not united, we can't reach out and get those
conservative Republicans, we can't get those union Democrats, we
can't get those folks who voted for Ross Perot and have walked away
from politics,'' Buchanan told about 400 people in attendance at
the state's Reform Party convention.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Seek Common Ground  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Russian President Vladimir
Putin acknowledged ''a dangerous and growing threat'' of nuclear
attack from emerging powers such as North Korea but failed to agree
Sunday on how to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a joint news conference in the Kremlin that he
doesn't believe a missile defense system like the one he is
considering ''is a threat to strategic stability and mutual
deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian side disagrees,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're against having a cure which is worse than the disease,''
Putin said, tersely.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the document signed by both leaders left open the
possibility for modifications in the ABM Treaty down the road ''to
preserve strategic stability in the face of new threats.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials characterized that as an important concession on
Russia's part.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the two leaders -- meeting in the
Kremlin for the first time since Putin was sworn in last month --
adopted a statement pledging intensified cooperation on
missile-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've asked our experts to keep working to narrow the
differences, and to develop a series of cooperative measures to
address the missile threat,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that he still hasn't made a decision on whether
to go ahead with such a system, which would be aimed at protecting
U.S. shores against attack from North Korea, Iran or other states
with a nuclear weapons potential. He has said he will decide later
this year whether it is feasible and worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also signed agreements putting in force
initiatives begun by Clinton and former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin: To reduce weapons-grade plutonium stockpiles by 34 tons
each; and to set up a joint center in Moscow to monitor missile
launches.
</P>
<P>
   These are ''major steps to reduce the nuclear danger,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin appeared to hit it off fine, even if they
weren't yet on a first-name basis.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of talks, Clinton said he believes Putin, a
former KGB official, ''is fully capable of building a prosperous,
strong Russia.'' Putin said Clinton is ''a person who is a very
comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a proposed limited national missile defense -- and
the changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty that would be
required to accommodate it -- was a top issue on the agenda for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had lowered expectations for a breakthrough
in advance of the session, and none was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton
that Russia continues to oppose changes to the ABM Treaty that the
United States has proposed since last September,'' Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who is also Clinton's special adviser on Russia, said
the summit produced ''neither a dead end ... nor a destination'' on
the subject of missile defense. He said Putin was clearly sensitive
to the threat from so-called rogue regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world that is covered by the ABM treaty changed very
vividly on August 31, 1998, when the North Koreans fired that
missile,'' Talbott said, referring to the multistage missile fired
by North Korea that passed over Japan and fell into the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint statement, Clinton and Putin agreed that ''the
international community faces a dangerous and growing threat of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery, including missiles and missile technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The missile shield concept also has critics in the United
States, from arms control activists worried about a new arms race
to conservatives who favor a more ambitious program along the lines
envisioned by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's proposal for a space-based missile defense program was
ridiculed by Democrats at the time as ''Star Wars.'' Clinton, an
earlier opponent of such a system, last year reversed course to
support a limited missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, who favors a
more expansive program, had urged Clinton to leave negotiations
with Putin to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Putin took notice of the U.S. presidential campaigns, saying,
''We're familiar with the programs of the two main candidates.'' He
suggested he was willing to improve US-Russian ties ''no matter who
gets to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reiterated U.S. opposition to the continuing
Russian military crackdown in the separatist region of Chechnya.
They talked about tensions in the Balkans, and Russia's economic
plight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that although they couldn't agree on everything,
the two presidents at least explained their differences with
''clarity and candor. And I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking through an interpreter, said the talks were
''very candid, very open, and very topical.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Clinton spent 25 minutes on a call-in radio
program, fielding questions from Russians who appeared more eager
to learn about his personal life than weighty foreign policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He told listeners he was proud of daughter Chelsea's progress in
college and of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for
the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the show's host, Aleksei Venediktov, if he could direct
''the tax authorities to audit CNN,'' Clinton replied, ''That would
be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin and top aides met in the Kremlin's ornate St.
Catherine's Hall, and the wrap-up news conference was held nearby
in St. George's Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Between sessions, Clinton and Putin took a 50-minute walk around
the gardens in the Kremlin, which is a walled city in the heart of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton got in some sightseeing, visiting a newly
reconstructed Russian Orthodox church, Christ the Savior. The
original church had been destroyed in the 1930s by the Communist
regime and replaced by a municipal swimming pool.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake that lasted several minutes
and shook a wide area rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra, leaving at least
25 dead and thousands homeless. The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical

In Canberra, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said armed

   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- As hundreds of anti-free trade protesters chanted
outside, foreign ministers from the Organization of American States launched
their annual assembly today, expecting to focus on Peru's presidential election.
Police arrested 41 people -- 35 of whom were among 200 who mobbed a bus
containing three OAS delegates and a driver, according to Staff Sgt. Dave
Rossell of the Windsor Police Service. Protesters chanted ''Shame! Shame!
Shame!'' and wagged their fingers at the police officers, who in turn rapped
nightsticks on riot shields to move the crowd back. Some demonstrators tried to
force their way into the area before police shut the gate, inciting the

Alleged Terrorist Claims Attacks

the United States, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 and the Khobar Towers
bombing, ''60 Minutes'' reported today. The man, whom the CBS News program
identified as Ahmad Behbahani, told a ''60 Minutes'' journalist that he proposed
the 1988 Pan Am operation, brought on board a radical Palestinian terrorist
living in Syria, then imported and trained Libyan operatives to do the job. The
program said his motive was to avenge a U.S. Navy cruiser's mistaken shooting
down five months earlier of an Iranian passenger plane.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Long shot Pete's Sake went to the lead and never
looked back Sunday, winning the $168,600 Plate Trial Stakes by six
lengths at Woodbine.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made the 3-year-old son of 1993 Queen's Plate winner
Peteski a favorite for this year's 141st running of the Queen's
Plate on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Plate Trial has produced 22 winners of the Queen's Plate
through its 58-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Jerry Frankel, trained by New York-based Todd Pletcher
and ridden by Patrick Husbands, Pete's Sake went off at 22-1. He
assumed command of the 1[-mile race around the first turn and held
his position by keeping pace-setters For Our Sake and Volio at bay.
At the top of the stretch the Ontario-bred chestnut began drawing
clear from his nine rivals and was clocked in 1:53.05.
</P>
<P>
   I and I, the Plate winter book favorite, came from seventh to
finish second, while Bold n' Fancy was third another 7{ lengths
back.
</P>
<P>
   Strike Smartly, which went off as the 2-5 favorite, finished
fifth, 16{ lengths behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Pete's Sake earned $101,160 for his second career win, raising
his lifetime earnings to $129,460. He returned $46.80, $19.60 and
$13.80.
</P>
<P>
   I and I returned $11.60 and $7.60, while Bold n' Fancy was
$11.20 to show.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Saddened fans and fellow musicians lined up at a
Manhattan funeral chapel Sunday to bid a fond farewell to their
beloved El Rey, mambo king Tito Puente.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing their love and admiration at an afternoon wake,
mourners held Puerto Rican flags, wore T-shirts emblazoned with his
image and listened to his music while trading memories of the
flamboyant percussionist and bandleader outside Riverside Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Puente, a famed timbale player, died Wednesday at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost a brother, and like the rest of the world, I am
deeply saddened,'' said fellow timbale player Jimmy Sabater, who
said he'd known Puente for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands waited on line for as long as four hours to see their
hero one last time, as he lay in a small chapel, dressed in a white
suit with a pair of timbale sticks cradled in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great loss.... He was the king immortalized,'' said
George Padilla, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of mourners waved Puerto Rican flags as cars draped
with the flag drove past. Even a dog walked around the crowd
wearing a Puerto Rican flag jacket and straw hat.
</P>
<P>
   The service not only provided many with an opportunity to
express national pride, it also allowed others to reflect upon Tito
Puente's remarkable ability to be both Puerto Rican and American; a
talent that allowed him to seamlessly blend Latin music and
American Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a citizen of the world, not just of Puerto Rico and the
United States,'' Sabater remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was loved all over the world,'' said Puente's youngest
sister, Asia ''Cookie' Kwolek. ''He was the last of the masters.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd reveled at the sight of various luminaries from the
salsa and merengue pantheon who periodically stopped in to pay
their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has left a beautiful legacy. He was the greatest
ambassador, not only for Puerto Rico, but for all the Americas,''
singer Jose ''Cheo'' Feliciano said amid a horde of
autograph-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having to wait for hours as the line to see Puente
inched its way up 76th St., most mourners were unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have to wait here till 7 o'clock, that's fine. Whatever
it takes to say goodbye,'' said Maria Duceman, who came from
Philadelphia to bid Puente farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the crowd turned sour when the funeral home shut its
doors at 5:30 p.m., 90 minutes earlier than scheduled. Police said
the funeral home was abiding by the wishes of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people left standing in the street began to chant in
Spanish, ''We want to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pretty upset by this. I have waited close to four hours
to see him,'' said Carmen Gonzalez said as she stood just feet from
the closed doors, holding two dozen roses in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a police officer said over his cruiser's speaker
system that the family was asking for privacy and that people come
back the following day did the crowd begin to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't come back, I have to work tomorrow,'' said Maggie
Rondogiannis.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services were scheduled to continue Monday in
Manhattan, with a funeral Tuesday morning in Nanuet.

<HEADLINE> Horn of Africa Peace Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ethiopia reportedly issued new demands
for international peacekeepers Sunday as it resumed indirect talks
with Eritrea to resolve a two-year border war.
</P>
<P>
   The talks included ''serious discussion'' on security issues,
including an Ethiopian army redeployment and use of international
observers and troops in the Horn of Africa, a Western diplomat said
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's premier said his country would withdraw from Eritrean
territory if international peacekeepers were based in lands it now
occupies, the state-owned Ethiopian Herald reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief negotiator Algerian Justice Minister Ahmed Ouyahia met
separately with the Eritrean and Ethiopian delegations Sunday,
after both had studied proposals put forth Saturday on the
withdrawal of both armies and the demarcation of common borders.
</P>
<P>
   Ouyahia gave the delegations until Monday to consider a second
working document, the details of which were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The atmosphere is good. We are making progress,'' said U.S.
envoy Anthony Lake, but added that it was too early to predict an
outcome. Peace talks have been underway here for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has centered on a poorly defined border area
running 620 miles between the two African countries. Ethiopia sent
its forces into Eritrea on May 12, saying its troops would remain
until they had retaken all disputed land. Eritrea agreed last week
to retreat from lands Ethiopia had claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea claimed Sunday that it had repulsed a new offensive
launched by Ethiopia near the port of Assab on the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The large scale attack ... has been totally foiled, with the
Ethiopian army suffering huge losses,'' the Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said in a statement. Ethiopia's 38th Division was ''almost
decimated,'' and 3,755 Ethiopian troops ''were killed, wounded or
taken prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent verification of the fighting, but
Ethiopian state spokeswoman Selome Taddesse denied the claim that
Ethiopia was launching new battles.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we are concerned, the war is over,'' Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi said, according to the Herald on Sunday.
Ethiopia announced Wednesday it considered the war finished, having
achieved its territorial goals.
</P>
<P>
   However, the premier added, ''the Eritrean government has
declared that the war is not yet finished, (and) we are thus
justified to take retaliatory measures to repulse any Eritrean
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenawi said Ethiopia wanted an international peacekeeping force,
as well as an agreement from Eritrea ''that it will not again
initiate war against Ethiopia'' -- demands made known to Algiers
negotiators, according to the Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia also said Sunday that an earlier framework agreement
dealing with border demarcation -- the crux of the dispute -- should
be reviewed in accordance with the existing situation on the
ground, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be an indication that Ethiopia could claim some
territory it had previously acknowledged as Eritrean.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier document contained proposals supported by the
Organization of African Unity, which is sponsoring the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Algiers, the two delegations have yet to meet face-to-face in
the talks. Besides Lake, Italian Undersecretary of State Rino Seri
and an EU representative also played key roles in the discussions.
A first round of talks collapsed May 4.

<HEADLINE> Kelly, Pilot Differ on Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, N.Y. (AP) -- Jim Kelly acknowledges that there have been
differing accounts of the rough landing of the plane in which he
was a passenger, and the former Buffalo Bills quarterback stands by
his initial version.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, attending a VIP party Sunday for his 14th annual Jim
Kelly Golf Tournament, responded to questions that have arisen
about what exactly happened when his plane was forced to land
shortly after departing from an Alaskan hunting trip on May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what happened, I know what I had to say,'' Kelly told
the Buffalo News. ''I know that when you get out of a plane and you
go underwater, it's a little deeper than six inches. I know I'm not
a goldfish, I know I'm not that small.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly first told Buffalo's WGRZ-TV about the incident Tuesday,
when he was quoted as saying, ''I had to swim to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan National Traffic and Safety Board chief Jim LaBelle
issued a statement Friday citing pilot Jerry Jacques' version as
''landing in a tidal zone, in six inches of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kelly, ''I think, pretty much, that the pilot had to say
that. I talked to him, and I think for his own case and the Federal
Aviation Administration, he has his own things that he had to say.
I'm just glad I took swimming lessons as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he's heard his share of yarns about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got so bad, I've had people coming up to me saying, 'I
heard you got your finger ripped off by a nail,''' quipped Kelly,
who said he had a fingernail torn off during the landing. ''I heard
so many stories, by that time, who knows what's going to go on?''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect Kelly did agree with the NTSB report on was minimal
damage to the plane, a Super Cub on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prop was bent pretty good,'' Kelly said. ''The front end
of the plane was dented pretty good, there wasn't much damage. I
think maybe he thought because there wasn't much damage, why report
it? When he had to report it, six inches of water sounds a lot
better than 10 or 11 feet of water.''

<HEADLINE> Park Wins LPGA Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRELLS INLET, S.C. (AP) -- Grace Park had won tournaments
before, including the U.S. Amateur two years ago. On Sunday, thanks
a long rain delay that helped her relax and regroup, she has an
LPGA title.
</P>
<P>
   Park birdied Nos. 16 and 17, then made a par on the final hole
for a 2-under-par 70 that gave her a 14-under 274 total and a
one-stroke victory in the Kathy Ireland Greens.com Classic over
Juli Inkster and Pat Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   ''This win is something I'll remember,'' The 21-year-old rookie
said. ''This I will carry on with me forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Park trailed Inkster by three strokes after a 2-hour, 15-minute
rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Park's birdies at 16 and 17 got her to 14 under and after
Inkster missed a 10-foot par putt on the final hole for her second
straight bogey, all Park had to do to win was par the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Park put her second shot just off the back fringe, about 40 feet
away, then chipped about 4 feet past and knocked it in for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could feel my arms shake, but every time that happens I
think the putt is going in,'' Park said. ''I don't want to be, but
I can't control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who earned $111,500, said the rain delay was the key to
her round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed that break,'' said Park, who was tiring in the sticky
South Carolina temperatures that had reached close to 100 degrees
on the weekend. ''I called for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said she ate and watched a little television during the
delay, but most importantly relaxed and regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed some shots, some short putts the beginning of the
round,'' Park said. ''I needed it to redeem myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, who slammed her wedge into a tree on 17 after driving
behind it with no chance at the green, nailed a 10-foot birdie putt
on 18 for a 70 to tie Inkster for second.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, whose round included an eagle on No. 3, a 452-yard
par-5, also closed with a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal Parker had a 71 and was fourth at 10-under 278.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster appeared to have her 24th career title wrapped up. After
the final round was halted by rain, she made a 30-foot birdie putt
on the 12th and one from 8 feet on the next hole to go to 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   She still seemed in control after a innocent lay-up to the
par-5, 17th. But it skipped into thick grass behind the green and
Inkster stubbed a chip. Her lead went to one when she missed a
15-foot putt from the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Park playing a group behind Inkster, was on the way
to a birdie, rolling a difficult chip from the right of the green
within 4 feet for a tying birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster blew up again on the final hole, pushing her second shot
right of the green, hitting it 10 feet past and missing the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster said she had trouble keeping track of where Park and
Hurst stood because there were few scoreboards on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed, it was my tournament,'' Inkster said. But
''it was kind of hard to play the last two, three holes when you
have no clue where you stand. I got out of my rhythm and she caught
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Park had her bobbles on the final hole. Her second shot hit the
fringe beyond the green and she needed a delicate downhill chip and
4-foot putt to finish the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Park was feeling hopeless and doubted her game a few weeks ago
after missing four of six cuts. But she says a well-struck 3-wood
off the 15th tee at the LPGA Corning Classic a week ago got her
back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   That was never a problem for Park, who dominated amateur and
college golf while at Arizona State. Is this the week she needed to
join some the best in women's golf?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to get the win.''

<HEADLINE> Warrick Signs Deal With Bengals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Wide receiver Peter Warrick agreed to a
seven-year contract worth $42 million on Sunday, the fastest
signing for a Cincinnati Bengals' top draft pick since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick signed the deal Sunday evening at the suburban Indian
Hill home of Bengals executive vice president Katie Blackburn, the
club confirmed on its Web site. The Bengals called a news
conference for Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who played at Florida State, was the fourth overall
pick in the NFL draft. He'll get more than $10 million in signing
and reporting bonuses this year, agent Jim Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract contains a voidable seventh year, meaning the deal
would be shortened to six years if Warrick plays 45 percent of the
downs in any season.
</P>
<P>
   If Warrick reaches all of the performance goals to kick in the
contract's various escalator clauses, he will make $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll get that,'' Warrick said. ''They're very
reachable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have a history of holdouts by first-round draft
picks. Quarterback Akili Smith missed virtually all of training
camp last year, limiting him as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bengals planning to get rid of receiver Carl Pickens,
they needed Warrick signed before training camp so he could move
into a starter's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of promising things going on with the Bengals,
and we like to think that Peter's signing is now one of those
things,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who's based in Cincinnati, and agent Norm Nixon handled
the contract negotiations. Gould has represented numerous Bengals
in the past and coaches the soccer team of Blackburn's 5-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely pleased to have this done and to know that
Peter will be with us on the first day of training camp,''
Blackburn said. ''I give a lot of the credit to Norm and Jim for
being willing to talk seriously and then do a deal at this point in
the year. We've found in some past negotiations with top picks that
there was a reluctance to begin serious talks until camp was upon
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-day negotiations ended at noon Sunday when Blackburn
and the agents agreed on terms.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were the Bengals' shortest with a first-round
pick since Ohio State's Dan Wilkinson signed his seven-year, $14.4
million contract on May 5, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick is the third first-round pick to agree to a contract
this year. Cleveland Browns defensive end Courtney Brown and New
York Jets tight end Anthony Becht also have come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick won't work out with the Bengals until he completes more
of the community service sentence he received in Florida after
pleading guilty to a petty theft charge.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, a former Florida State teammate and a store clerk were
charged after the two players paid $21.40 for more than $400 worth
of clothes last Sept. 29 at a Dillard's department store in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain in Florida cleaning up trash along highways as
part of his 30-day sentence. His agents expect him to complete the
sentence before training camp starts July 21.

<HEADLINE> Astra Takes Gamely Breeders' Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- After five wins in six starts against
lesser competition, Astra beat even-money favorite Happyanunoit by
a half-length in Sunday's $240,950 Gamely Breeders' Cup Handicap at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux rallied the 4-year-old filly from fourth in the
field of five to overtake Happyanunoit within the final sixteenth
of a mile of the 1[-mile race. She was timed in 1:45 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Tout Charmant finished third, four lengths behind Happyanunoit.
</P>
<P>
   Astra, whose biggest previous victory came in April's Grade III
Jenny Wiley Stakes at Keeneland, was the Gamely's fourth choice at
7-2 odds.
</P>
<P>
   Astra, who carried 117 pounds, paid $9.60 and $4.20. She won
$157,170, nearly doubling the bay filly's earnings, which moved to
$345,424.
</P>
<P>
   Happyanunoit, the 121-pound high weight, paid $3.20 to place.
There was no show wagering.

<HEADLINE> Romanians Vote in Local Elections  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)-- Exit polls from local elections showed
Sunday the party of former President Ion Iliescu leading in the
capital Bucharest for the first time in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The local elections, in which financial unrest and
disillusionment with politicians kept many voters away, were
considered significant as a measure of political power in advance
of parliamentary and presidential elections later this year. Polls
show Iliescu favored to defeat President Emil Constantinescu in the
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Final official results were not expected before Monday in the
local contests, in which Romanians chose mayors and other officials
in the 3,000 cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, however, exit polls announced shortly after
balloting ended showed Sorin Oprescu, 49, director of the Municipal
Hospital and a member of Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy,
leading with 44 percent in the contest for Bucharest mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates -- Catalin Calin Chirita of the Democratic
Convention and Transport Minister Traian Basescu of the Democratic
Party -- were trailing with 17 percent each according to the poll.
Thirty-three other candidates shared the remaining 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There was no margin of error given for the poll.
</P>
<P>
   If the final results follow the exit polls, Oprescu will face
the second-highest vote getter in a runoff in two weeks since the
winner needs an absolute majority of votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   Iliescu said the result was a good omen for his left-leaning
Party of Social Democracy. His party held office in the capital
from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 million Romanians were eligible to vote. However, polls
remained open for an additional two hours in areas where the
turnout was below the 50 percent level necessary for the results to
be valid.

<HEADLINE> Blakemore wins for directing best musical, play at the 2000 Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Copenhagen'' was chosen best play and '''Kiss
Me, Kate,'' best musical revival Sunday, as Michael Blakemore
scored a Tony first -- winning the awards for his direction of both.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is 'Thank you, America.' And by America, I mean
New York. And by New York, I mean Broadway,'' the 71-year-old
director said during his second trip to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   A double victory has been possible only since 1960 when the
direction prize was split into play and musical categories,
Blakemore was nominated for both in 1990 with ''Lettice &AMP; Lovage''
and ''City of Angels,'' but didn't win for either.
</P>
<P>
   A grateful playwright Michael Frayn thanked the drama's
audiences who defied critics assessment that the difficult drama
about the morality of physics and friendship would be too much for
theatergoers. Blair Brown, who portrays physicist Niels Bohr's
skeptical wife in the production, was named best featured
actress-play.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman, whose musical ''Contact,'' a daring dance play
that pushes musical-theater boundaries, won the award for best
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns just as real
life does, Had I not fallen in love with Mike Ockrent, I could have
never have written 'Contact,''' said an emotional Stroman
referring, to her husband, a director who died in December of
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice picked up the award for best score for
their pop retelling of ''Aida.'' Neither was there to accept the
prize. The Disney-produced show also got Tonys for scenic and
lighting design.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Real Thing,'' Tom Stoppard's drama about the ups and downs
of love, was chosen best revival. Its two stars, Stephen Dillane,
as an adulterous playwright, and Jennifer Ehle, as his second wife,
took home the top acting awards. Ehle was competing against her
mother, Rosemary Harris, in the best actress-play category.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pakledinaz of ''Kiss Me, Kate'' won the award for costume
design, which Dame Edna gave him -- along with a big kiss. A
lipstick-smeared Pakledinaz was so flustered that he had a hard
time delivering his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   English performer Roy Dotrice, who plays the whiskey-soaked
father in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' picked up the prize for
featured actor in a play. The 77-year-old actor gave a stirring
thank-you to American audiences, ending his speech with ''God bless
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaines won his third Tony, this time for his role as a
disillusioned ad man in ''Contact'' and called himself ''president
of the lucky club.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Contact,'' a look at three very different relationships,
attempts to redefine the modern musical, creating its characters
and stories mostly through dance. It uses little dialogue and
prerecorded music, mostly standards ranging from Rodgers and Hart
to Benny Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, after a year's absence, was again chosen to
preside over the three-hour ceremonies at Radio City Music Hall,
with help from Nathan Lane. The first hour aired on PBS before
switching to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has promised there would be no repeat of last year
when the CBS part of the program threatened to run long and forced
a number from ''It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues,'' one of the
nominated musicals, to be cut from the show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said she gave the nominees a pep talk earlier in the
week, telling them to keep their speeches ''short, concise and
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway season, which ended May 28, was considered a robust
one, although production slipped a bit, from 39 shows last year to
37 this year. It grossed a record $603 million, a 2.6 percent
increase over the previous year, according to the League of
American Theaters and Producers. Attendance was the second highest
in Broadway history, 11.4 million, down slightly from a record 11.7
million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in 21 categories were chosen by 705 members of the
theatrical profession and journalists. The Tony awards were started
in 1947 by the American Theater Wing, a theater service
organization. They were named after Antoinette Perry, an actress
and past chairwoman of the theater wing.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Shakes Sumatra, 25 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake and several
strong aftershocks rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra, leaving
at least 25 people dead and thousands homeless, authorities said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said the
quake, measuring magnitude 7.3, hit at 11:29 p.m. Sunday and was
centered beneath the Indian Ocean, about 400 miles northwest of
Jakarta and 60 east of Bengkulu, a city of about 1.2 million. The
U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., estimated the quake's
strength at 7.9.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was expected to rise as volunteers and emergency
workers search ruined buildings. Witnesses reported widespread
panic in Bengkulu and said hospitals were overwhelmed with injured
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many houses have collapsed and the walls on bigger buildings
have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbors who were
trapped under rubble,'' said Edy, a resident of Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
   The quake lasted several minutes and shook a wide area. A
magnitude 6 aftershock hit 11 minutes afterward, and 53 smaller
tremors were recorded before 6 a.m. Monday, frightening residents
and hampering rescue efforts, Indonesian seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the state geophysical service in Jakarta,
Suhardjono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said 25
bodies had been recovered in or near the city, all of them killed
by falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue efforts before sunrise were hampered by widespread
electricity and telephone outages. Thousands fled their homes as
aftershocks continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bengkulu police Sgt. Hariyono said by telephone that many more
people were reported injured in demolished houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quake went on for many minutes. Dozens of homes have been
destroyed, and almost all houses and buildings in the city seem to
have been damaged,'' said Hariyono, who like many Indonesians uses
only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Bengkulu treated the injured in the open, fearing
aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official
Antara news agency reported. Damage was also reported at Bengkulu
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent
years, was felt across much of western half of the archipelago
nation and the neighboring island state of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about
20{ miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean -- very shallow in
geological terms. But there were no immediate reports of a tsunami,
a massive wave caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the southeastern island of Flores. A
magnitude-7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy
damage in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major
fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals.

<HEADLINE> UN Rights Chief Accuses Countries  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of a U.N. conference to assess
progress toward equality of the sexes, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights accused some countries of trying to reverse the
gains won by women at a global gathering five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson declined to name the countries, but Amnesty
International's Secretary-General Pierre Sane said Algeria, Libya,
Iran, Pakistan and the Vatican were playing ''a very destructive
role'' in negotiations on a final forward-looking document. Other
delegates included Sudan on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the plan outlined in the 150-page platform
drafted at the 1995 Beijing women's conference should start
pressuring governments to send a message ''that we're not
regrouping, or retrenching, or going backwards,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to fight,'' Sane echoed. ''We know that in previous
world conferences, advances have been made because of the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing platform runs the gamut from promoting women's
inheritance rights to calling on governments to provide equal
education and employment and demanding that business and government
put women in top decision-making posts.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson stressed the importance of the platform to millions of
women and girls who still faced huge inequalities in jobs,
education and living standards, and who were victims of sexual and
racial discrimination, domestic violence and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Beijing platform was being reviewed was
worrying, she said before speaking to about 1,000 women at a human
rights symposium at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would like the final document to ensure ''no
dilution'' of Beijing, to affirm that states must assume primary
responsibility for ensuring women's equal rights, and to send a
message that ''national, cultural, religious and historical
considerations ... can never be allowed to be used as
justifications for the infringement of women's human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also submitted provisions stating for the first time
in a U.N. document that women have the right to freely decide all
matters related to their sexuality and childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers estimated that 10,000 delegates and grassroots
activists would attend the conference -- compared to about 40,000 in
Beijing, which was the biggest global gathering of women in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from 188 nations were expected to speak at open
plenary sessions this week, while work on the final document would
be going on in closed-door sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Objections by the Vatican and some Islamic countries to many of
the same issues they raised in Beijing -- including sexual and
reproductive rights for women and adolescent sex education -- are
expected to keep negotiators working until Friday's close to try to
reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiatiors have agreed on the final document that reaffirms
the commitment of governments to the Beijing platform, said
Charlotte Bunch, director of the Center for Women's Global
Leadership at Rutgers University in New Jersey, which sponsored
Sunday's symposium.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, many governments seemed reluctant to
set specific goals or commit resources to implementation, she said.

   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ethiopia reportedly issued new demands for

security issues, including an Ethiopian army redeployment and use of
international observers and troops in the Horn of Africa, a Western diplomat
said on condition of anonymity. Ethiopia's premier said his country would
withdraw from Eritrean territory if international peacekeepers were based in

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

Ministry spokesman Brad Pattersfield said insurgents from the country's Malaita
Eagle Force militia were holding Prime Minister Bartholemew Ulufa'alua hostage.
In Canberra, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said armed
groups had overrun key installations in Honiara overnight in an apparent coup
attempt. The Malaita Eagle Force had seized ''key installations in Honiara
including some police stations and the Government Telecommunications Center,''
the department said.

still exist, and added that if the interim legislature decides to hold elections

U.S.-E.U. Data Privacy Deal Near

   LONDON (AP) -- Despite protests from consumer rights advocates, the European
Union has endorsed a data privacy pact with the United States that critics fear
will erode legal protections many Europeans now enjoy. The so-called safe harbor
agreement, likely to take effect this summer, will make U.S. businesses
responsible for safeguarding the privacy of any personal information they may
collect about European consumers. If U.S. companies agree to comply -- the pact
is voluntary -- they would gain ''safe harbor'' from prosecution or lawsuits by
EU governments.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Say They'll be NBA Underdogs  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers are in the NBA Finals for
the first time and don't intend to be a sacrificial lamb to Western
Conference champion Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana practiced Sunday morning, not knowing if they'd be
heading to Los Angeles or Portland for the first two games in the
best-of-seven series. That was determined Sunday night when the
Lakers beat Portland 89-84 in Game 7 of their conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which team won, the Pacers were convinced they would
be challenged and be the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The series begins Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today it was back to work. Obviously, we're very excited about
making it to this point of the season,'' guard Jalen Rose said.
''We're going in to win this thing. We like the way we match up
against both teams. We split our games with the Lakers and swept
Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of not knowing their opponent until after Sunday
night's game didn't concern the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't hard because we've got to concentrate on what we do
best. We can fine-tune a lot of things that we can do better in
order to become NBA champions,'' said Rose, the team's scoring
leader in the regular season who is second to Reggie Miller (23.8)
in the playoffs with a 20.1 average.
</P>
<P>
   For all but two of the Pacers this is the first trip to the NBA
Finals. Reserves Sam Perkins and Zan Tabak are the exceptions and
Tabak was a member of the 1995 Houston Rockets championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter if we're playing the Lakers. What counts is
what we do,'' said Perkins, who has the most playoff experience of
any Pacer with 158 games. ''The Lakers are certainly a powerful,
talented team. Whatever happens, we've got to be healthy and play
our game. We've got to go out and play relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The games in the Finals can be a once in a lifetime
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana reached the Finals by beating the New York Knicks, the
team that eliminated the Pacers twice in their previous four trips
to the conference finals, in Game 6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to take the next step. To be close so many times,
it's going to be nice to see what it's going to be like,'' center
Rik Smits said. ''We still got one more step to go. It (his career)
is still going to be incomplete if we don't finish the next step.
We're still playing, we still got a chance and we might as well
make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-4 Smits had little impact in Indiana's final two
victories against New York, going just 1-for-10 from the field and
scoring only four points in 25 minutes while accumulating nine
fouls. After going scoreless in Game 5, Smits played only 13
minutes and had three rebounds and five fouls in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd liked to have been more involved in the game,'' he said of
Game 6, Indiana's 93-80 victory. ''I felt like I made little
contribution. Certainly, I'm disappointed. But my teammates made it
and I'd like to contribute a little more in the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits, who is averaging 11.3 points and 3.4 rebounds in this
year's playoffs, was anticipating a tough matchup against Los
Angeles' Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to try and keep him away from the basket, try to
limit his touches,'' Smits said of the 7-1, 315-pound O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers center took league-leading playoff averages of 28.8
points and 15.4 rebounds into Sunday night's game. The league's MVP
led the NBA with a 29.7 point average and a .574 percentage from
the field during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they have a good day, they find him. He spins for lobs, off
of guys, they post him up,'' Smits said. ''They go to him so much,
it's going to be a tough cover.''
</P>
<P>
   A key player for Indiana in the Finals will be Dale Davis, the
team's rebounding leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Shaq it is going to be tough to get rebounds. He's big,
he's strong and he's effective under the basket,'' Davis said.
''Now there's a hungry feeling for us. We're right there, and now
we have to have a little faith.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Rights Gains Feared Reversed  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On the eve of a U.N. conference to assess
progress toward equality of the sexes, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights accused some countries of trying to reverse the
gains won by women at a global gathering five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson declined to name the countries, but Amnesty
International's Secretary-General Pierre Sane said Algeria, Libya,
Iran, Pakistan and the Vatican were playing ''a very destructive
role'' in negotiations on a final forward-looking document. Other
delegates included Sudan on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the plan outlined in the 150-page platform
drafted at the 1995 Beijing women's conference should start
pressuring governments to send a message ''that we're not
regrouping, or retrenching, or going backwards,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to fight,'' Sane echoed. ''We know that in previous
world conferences, advances have been made because of the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing platform runs the gamut from promoting women's
inheritance rights to calling on governments to provide equal
education and employment and demanding that business and government
put women in top decision-making posts.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson stressed the importance of the platform to millions of
women and girls who still faced huge inequalities in jobs,
education and living standards, and who were victims of sexual and
racial discrimination, domestic violence and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Beijing platform was being reviewed was
worrying, she said before speaking to about 1,000 women at a human
rights symposium at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would like the final document to ensure ''no
dilution'' of Beijing, to affirm that states must assume primary
responsibility for ensuring women's equal rights, and to send a
message that ''national, cultural, religious and historical
considerations ... can never be allowed to be used as
justifications for the infringement of women's human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In ground breaking provisions adopted at Beijing, delegates
stated for the first time in a U.N. document that women have the
right to decide freely all matters related to their sexuality and
child-bearing.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers estimated that 10,000 delegates and grassroots
activists would attend the conference -- compared to about 40,000 in
Beijing, which was the biggest global gathering of women in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from 188 nations were expected to speak at open
plenary sessions this week, while work on the final document would
be going on in closed-door sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Objections by the Vatican and some Islamic countries to many of
the same issues they raised in Beijing -- including sexual and
reproductive rights for women and adolescent sex education -- are
expected to keep negotiators working until Friday's close to try to
reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiatiors have agreed on wording in the final document's
political declaration which reaffirms the commitment of governments
to implement the Beijing platform, said Charlotte Bunch, director
of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University
in New Jersey, which sponsored Sunday's symposium.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, many governments seemed reluctant to
set specific goals or commit resources to implementation, she said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake Jolts Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.7 shook western Japan on Monday morning, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was centered not far below ground near Tsuruga, 200
miles west of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said. It struck at
9:54 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fear of tsunami, seismic waves caused by undersea
disturbances such as volcanic activity or earthquakes, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor was felt in wide areas in western Japan, including
Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto. It was also felt in Nagoya, a
major industrial city, 167 miles, west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said there was no connection between
the Japan tremor and a more powerful earthquake and strong
aftershocks that rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

<HEADLINE> Director Blakemore Wins Two Tonys  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Copenhagen'' was chosen best play and ''Kiss
Me, Kate'' best musical revival Sunday, as Michael Blakemore scored
a Tony first -- winning the awards for his direction of both.
''Contact,'' a daring dance play about relationships, was named
best musical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' the Cole Porter musical, was the night's big
winner, picking up five Tonys, the same number the show won when it
first opened on Broadway in the 1948-49 season. Besides director,
''Kate'' won prizes for its leading man, Brian Stokes Mitchell, as
well as for costumes and orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is 'Thank you, America.' And by America, I mean
New York. And by New York, I mean Broadway,'' the 71-year-old
director said during his second trip to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   A double victory has been possible only since 1960 when the
direction prize was split into play and musical categories,
Blakemore was nominated for both in 1990 with ''Lettice &AMP; Lovage''
and ''City of Angels,'' but didn't win for either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Copenhagen'' playwright Michael Frayn thanked the drama's
audiences who defied critics' assessments that the difficult drama
about the morality of physics and friendship would be too much for
theatergoers. Blair Brown, who portrays physicist Niels Bohr's
skeptical wife in the production, was named best featured
actress-play.
</P>
<P>
   Besides musical, ''Contact'' won the choreography prize for its
director Susan Stroman and for two of its featured performers, Boyd
Gaines and Karen Ziemba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns just as real
life does, Had I not fallen in love with Mike Ockrent, I could have
never have written 'Contact,''' an emotional Stroman said,
referring to her husband, a director who died in December of
leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aida'' wasn't nominated for best musical, but the
Disney-produced show tied ''Contact'' with four Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   Its radiant star, Heather Headley was named best actress in a
musical to the biggest cheers of the night. A tearful Headley told
Disney: ''I will work for you for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice picked up an award for their
pop-flavored score for ''Aida,'' and the lavish musical, set in
ancient Egypt, also got Tonys for scenic and lighting design.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Real Thing,'' Tom Stoppard's drama about the ups and downs
of love, was chosen best revival. Its two stars, Stephen Dillane,
as an adulterous playwright, and Jennifer Ehle, as his second wife,
took home the top acting awards. Ehle was competing against her
mother, Rosemary Harris, in the best actress-play category.
</P>
<P>
   One of the night's funniest moments occurred when Dame Edna --
Australian actor Barry Humphries -- bussed costume winner Martin
Pakledinaz of ''Kiss Me, Kate.'' Dame Edna's big, messy kiss so
flustered the lipstick-smeared Pakledinaz that he had a hard time
delivering his acceptance speech. (Humphries was a special Tony
winner, picking up a prize for his show ''Dame Edna: The Royal
Tour.'')
</P>
<P>
   English performer Roy Dotrice, who plays the whiskey-soaked
father in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' picked up the prize for
featured actor in a play. The 77-year-old actor gave a stirring
thank-you to American audiences, ending his speech with ''God bless
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, after a year's absence, was again chosen to
preside over the three-hour ceremonies at Radio City Music Hall,
with help from Nathan Lane, who was bawdy throughout the show. The
first hour aired on PBS before switching to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell promised there would be no repeat of last year when
the CBS part of the program threatened to run long and forced a
number from ''It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues,'' one of the
nominated musicals, to be cut from the show. This year, the show
ran so tightly that she and Lane momentarily had to vamp for time
at the end.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell had given the nominees a pep talk earlier in the week,
telling them to keep their speeches ''short, concise and
heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway season, which ended May 28, was considered a robust
one, although production slipped a bit, from 39 shows last year to
37 this year. It grossed a record $603 million, a 2.6 percent
increase over the previous year, according to the League of
American Theaters and Producers. Attendance was the second highest
in Broadway history, 11.4 million, down slightly from a record 11.7
million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in 21 categories were chosen by 705 members of the
theatrical profession and journalists. The Tony awards were started
in 1947 by the American Theater Wing, a theater service
organization. They were named after the late Antoinette Perry, an
actress and past chairwoman of the theater wing.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 89, Trail Blazers 84  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers saved their best for
the very last.
</P>
<P>
   What was nearly one of the greatest collapses in NBA playoff
history instead became one of the most unexpected comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, on the verge of losing three straight games for the
first time all season, scored 15 consecutive points in the fourth
quarter to erase a 15-point Portland lead and went on to beat the
Trail Blazers 89-84 Sunday in Game 7 of the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what makes champions,'' Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said.
''We watched Game 7s growing up all the time, and to finally play
in one is a real thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles advances to the NBA Finals for the first time since
1991 with Game 1 on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers in the
Staples Center. The Lakers will hard-pressed to top this one,
though.
</P>
<P>
   A team whose resolve and heart had been questioned all season
showed it when it was needed most. The homecourt advantage the
Lakers earned with 67 regular-season victories proved invaluable as
Los Angeles mounted its memorable rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game 7s are very interesting, but I've never seen any quite
like that one before,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who is
trying to bring a title to Los Angeles after winning six with
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, rendered ineffective most of the game by
Portland's double- and triple-teaming defense, scored nine points
in the fourth quarter, punctuating the rally with a thundering dunk
on a lob pass from Bryant that put Los Angeles ahead 85-79 with 40
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The usually unemotional O'Neal waved his index fingers at the
crowd with an amazed expression on his face as he ran downcourt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 18 points and nine rebounds and was 8-of-12 from the
free throws line, including two that tied the game 77-77 with 2:44
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were playing their best ball the whole game and we were
just scratching and clawing,'' O'Neal said. ''The Blazers are a
fabulous team and this is probably a rivalry that's going to last
throughout my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the other half of the superstar tandem that is supposed
to lead this franchise back to its historic greatness, had 25
points, 11 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots. He made
just six of 12 free throws, but he sank two from the line to put
the Lakers ahead for good, 81-79, with 1:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw made three crucial 3-pointers for the Lakers, one at
the end of the third quarter and two during the big fourth-quarter
rally. He and Glen Rice each scored 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace scored 30 points on 13-for-26 shooting but had
six of the Blazers' 13 consecutive misses during the Lakers' run
that wiped out a 75-60 lead. Wallace also missed two free throws
with Portland trailing 81-79 with 1:25 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, brought to Portland to provide the leadership
the team needed to win a championship, fouled out with 25 seconds
to go with 12 points and 10 rebounds. He was just 3-of-10 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 18 points for Portland but was just 1-for-5
from the field in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed 71-58 after three quarters but outscored
Portland 31-13 in the fourth. After shooting 50 percent through
three quarters, the Blazers shot 22 percent in the fourth
(5-for-27).
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a lot of things right most of the night,'' Portland
coach Mike Dunleavy said, ''but in the fourth quarter we just
couldn't make shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ron Harper made one of two free throws to put the Lakers
ahead 86-82 with 32 seconds remaining, Smith drove the lane but the
ball was knocked away with no foul called.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant missed two free throws with 25 seconds to go, but again
Portland couldn't capitalize. Robert Horry, who was 4-for-6 from
the line in the final minute and scored 12 points, made two free
throws with 17 seconds to go to boost the lead to 88-82, and the
Blazers were finished.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has six championship rings but none without Michael
Jordan as a teammate, scored nine points in the first quarter but
made one of seven shots after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to swallow right now and I'm sure it will be all
summer,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the fourth-quarter failure shouldn't obscure how the
Blazers fought back in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody expected us to push them so hard. Nobody gave us a
chance when we were down 3-1,'' Pippen said. ''There's more to feel
proud of than there is to be down about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, who had beaten the Lakers twice in Los
Angeles in the playoffs, were trying to become the seventh team to
come back from being down 3-1 to win a series and the first to do
it in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the evening, they looked as if they would.
</P>
<P>
   As had been the case throughout the series, Portland took an
early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire, Smith and Pippen hit consecutive 3-pointers in
a 13-0 run that put Portland ahead 19-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers cut it to three late in the second half, the last
time on Bryant's stuff shot that made it 42-39 just before the
halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles outscored Portland 10-4 to start the third quarter
to go ahead 49-48 on Rice's drive to the basket for a three-point
play with 6:22 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's two free throws put Portland back ahead 50-49, then
Rice made a 19-footer to give Los Angeles a 51-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, led by Smith, the Blazers took over.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored the first seven points, and 10 overall, in a 21-4
run that put the Blazers up 61-55 on Pippen's 3-pointer, his only
basket after the first quarter, with 20 seconds left in the third
quarter. Shaw's banked 3-pointer made it 71-58 after three.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers showed no signs of mounting that big finish early in
the fourth quarter. Bonzi Wells made two free throws with 10:28 to
play to give Portland a 75-60 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's basket started the big run, then Shaw hit a 3 and
the biggest 10{ minutes of the Lakers' season had begun.
</P>
<P>
Notes: O'Neal took just nine shots and made five. ... The Lakers
and Indiana split two games in the regular season. ... The Lakers
won the season series with Portland 6-5. ... The Blazers were never
called for an illegal defense, despite Los Angeles coach Phil
Jackson's pre-game lobbying. ... Portland center Arvydas Sabonis
fouled out with 2:44 to go. ... The Lakers haven't won a title
since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Leader Meets Military  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The martial law regime said Monday it was
firmly in control of Fiji, and that it had drawn the line on any
peace deal it would offer the rebel leader holding more than 30
hostages in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel boss George Speight must release the hostages and
surrender his arms to get a promised amnesty. The regime of
Commodore Frank Bainimarama would then stay in charge until law and
order were restored in Fiji, said military spokesman Lt. Col.
Filipo Tarakinikini.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his followers will be barred from participation in
any interim government -- going against one of Speight's key demands
for ending the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have stated that this is impossible,'' Bainimarama said
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bainimarama said Speight cannot end up in control of Fiji ''for
one simple reason -- there's been a lot of talk of backlash'' by
locals and the overseas community.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's influential tribal chiefs could play a role in
choosing an interim civilian government, Tarakinikini told an
Australian television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military line has been drawn, and we have told Mr. Speight
and his group that beyond this we are not going to negotiate,''
Tarakinikini said, adding that the military could stay in control
for up to three months.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was not completely at odds with Speight's proposal for
ending the crisis. He said he would accept military control to
restore law and order, but only if there was a strict time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Speight spent Sunday airing his latest demands to Fiji's
military government -- and later said that a new trust was
developing. He did not say, though, when he might free the
hostages, including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said that, after nine hours of ''cordial talks,'' one
significant remaining issue was the disagreement over how Fiji will
be governed once the standoff ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are well on the way now that the initial barriers of
concern have been broken down,'' Speight told reporters, without
elaborating. ''We have come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight's earlier plan to release his captives over the weekend
collapsed Saturday, when he accused the military regime of
bargaining in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides planned a new set of negotiations on Monday at
Bainimarama's barracks headquarters, but Speight did not shown up
by the appointed time.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has been emboldened by his confidence that the military
wouldn't try to rescue the hostages by attacking. And though many
of his goals have been accomplished -- including the scrapping of
Fiji's constitution and the removal of the president -- he presented
more demands Saturday in a nine-point proposal that would
effectively let him pick the next government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army will never attack Fijians. Never,'' Speight told
Australia's Channel Nine television.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's ethnic Indians control many businesses, and Speight wants
to prevent them from ever running the country again. Although
Speight claims to represent all indigenous Fijians, many have
rallied against him and expressed support for Chaudhry's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight also said in the interview aired Sunday that he had
offered his four female hostages freedom Saturday, but they had
preferred to stay and support their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked the ladies ... if they wished to go home today, or
sometime this weekend,'' Speight said in the interview, recorded
Saturday. ''And they chose not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a local Fijian current affairs show, Tarakinikini
thanked Fiji's Indian community Sunday for showing patience while
the hostages were still being held.
