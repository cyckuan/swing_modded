<HEADLINE> Onondaga County tracking down unaccounted-for handguns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- The crinkly document, filled out in 1942,
says a 64-year-old man got a license to carry a .38-caliber
revolver to protect himself and his home on Fitch Street in
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The man's stern, mustachioed face stares out from a
thumbprint-size black-and-white photograph attached to the license.
It is still valid. As far as Onondaga County and New York state are
concerned, the man is alive and well and packing heat.
</P>
<P>
   He would be 122 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not the only one. There are as many as 4,000 cases in
Onondaga County alone. The licenses belong to people who would be
at least 75 years old if they are alive. Many of the gun owners
would be in their mid-100s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's safe to assume they're no longer with us,'' Sgt.
Thomas Metz, head of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department's
records section, said of the oldest license holders. ''The question
is, where are the handguns?''
</P>
<P>
   Since pistol license holders own an average of three guns each,
about 12,000 handguns are likely out there, either held illegally
by relatives or unaccounted for, Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   A detective has so far found one case in which a pistol license
holder died and one of his guns wound up on the streets, traded for
drugs by a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Metz and Deputy Gary Rudiger stumbled onto the glut of
unaccounted-for handguns five years ago, when they started looking
for a way to reduce the load of paper records in the pistol license
unit. When they discovered the vast number of licenses that
apparently belonged to dead people, Metz and Rudiger looked at each
other and said, ''What about all those guns?''
</P>
<P>
   The record-keeping problem had become a public safety problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have people who, according to our records and the records
that the state has, were in their 70s and 80s in 1937, and we still
show them as alive and well and having their handguns,'' Metz said.
''The good news is, we're not ignoring it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the job of Detective Ray Herrick, supervisor of the
sheriff department's pistol license unit, to track the whereabouts
of unaccounted-for handguns once owned by people who have died.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick tries to retrieve the guns, and if he can't, reports
them missing to a national crime information database. He will
reach into files that go back to 1931 to do it, and it will take at
least five years, probably much longer, Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   That means tracking down the gun owners' survivors and asking
for weapons that they're illegally holding, often unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires relatives of a pistol license holder to turn
in that person's handguns within 15 days of his or her death. If
the guns remain in the home, it's a misdemeanor. Most people don't
know about the law, Herrick said. But they don't have to fear his
knock on their door.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out to arrest anyone,'' Herrick said. ''Our
responsibility is to investigate the whereabouts of these guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials met with the Onondaga-Oswego Funeral
Directors Association a month ago to tell them about their project.
The funeral directors, who had been unaware of the state law, have
started passing on the information to grieving families. It has
become part of their routine checklist to ask a dead person's
survivor if he or she had any licensed handguns at home, said
Patricia A. Knight, treasurer of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The county's project is getting started as a national debate
rages over handgun control and how to reduce the number of weapons
available to criminals. The project should serve notice that
thousands of unaccounted-for guns would have been off the streets
if people had known the law and followed it, Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a 50-year problem here,'' he said. ''We're going to
be at this for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   After discovering the problem in 1995, sheriff's department
clerks spent the next 15 months typing the name of every one of the
county's 41,000 pistol license holders into the department's
Criminal History Arrest Information Reporting System (CHAIRS).
</P>
<P>
   Now every week or two, the county's Bureau of Vital Statistics
sends over a list of people who have died in the county to the
sheriff's department. The list is sometimes 100 names long. The
sheriff's department tries to match every name with one of the
pistol license holders in CHAIRS. They've matched 736 people.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick's next task is to find the families of those people. Of
the 736, Herrick estimates that relatives turned in the guns in
only about 20 cases. Handguns that can't be located will be listed
in a national crime database.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not unique to Onondaga County. But officials at
the state police's pistol license division know of no other county
that has started tracking down the pistol licenses of people who
are probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that a good number of the 1.1 million pistol
licenses in the state belong to people who are long gone, said Sgt.
James Sherman, head of the state police pistol license unit.
</P>
<P>
   Metz said he hopes Onondaga County's project will become a pilot
for the state. He also hopes the shock of discovering how many guns
might be unaccounted for will prompt a change in state law to make
gun owners in Onondaga County renew their licenses every five
years. That has already happened in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk
counties.

<HEADLINE> Study: Minorities forced to go to predatory lenders  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Minority homeowners are routinely turned down by
conventional banks at greater rates than whites with comparable
incomes, according to a study by U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer's
office.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, blacks and Hispanics are forced to go to
high-interest lenders who charge much more in interest and fees
than conventional lending institutions, Schumer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is calling on conventional banks to change the trend
and has introduced legislation to prohibit some of the unscrupulous
practices of the high-interest lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could tell a tale of two cities when it comes to bank
lending,'' Schumer said. ''If you're white, it's easy to get a
conventional mortgage. If you're black at the same income level or
higher than a white family, it's next to impossible to get a
conventional mortgage. As a result, black homeowners must resort to
predatory lenders who have high-interest levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found, for example, that 20 percent of black families
making $60,000 were turned down by a conventional bank, compared
with 17 percent of white families making $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed data on nearly 240,000 1998 home loans and
refinance applications in New York City. The data were supplied to
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's study did not account for the credit histories of
applicants, employment history or other factors that banks may
consider in their lending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   High-interest lenders -- also known as subprime lenders because
they make loans to people with less than stellar credit histories --
sometimes supply the money other banks won't.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them -- Champion, the Money Store and Delta -- are well
known in the New York area because they market their services
aggressively on television, on radio and by telephone, promising to
provide mortgages to anyone who's been rejected by a traditional
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, who refer to them as predatory lenders, charge that
they also encourage people to borrow more than they can afford to
pay back so that they will default and enable the lender to
foreclose.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's study examined 12 neighborhoods of comparable median
incomes in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, half of them
predominantly black and half mostly white. In the black areas, on
average, 26 percent of mortgage applicants were rejected for a loan
at a conventional bank, compared with 14 percent of applicants in
the six white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's study showed that in predominantly black
neighborhoods, more than half of the mortgages were issued by
subprime lenders, compared with 13 percent in white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has introduced the Predatory Lending Deterrence Act to
protect consumers by, among other things, prohibiting lenders from:
</P>
<P>
   -- Charging penalties for prepaying the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   -- Financing points and fees, for which conventional lenders
require up front payment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Using negative amortization, in which mortgage payments pay
off only interest instead of principal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lending without regard to the borrower's ability to pay, which
leads to default and foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is also sending the report to conventional banks, asking
them to take steps to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gary R. Brody, vice president of the Community Bankers
Association of New York State, suggested that in some
neighborhoods, the trend could be explained not so much by the
failure of conventional banks to grant mortgages as by the heavy
marketing by the subprime lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sometimes an occasion of the predatory lenders going in
there looking to make some business -- Delta and others -- and often
starting out as offers for home improvement loans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brody cautioned against jumping to the conclusion that ''the
reason these people are being victimized is that they have gone to
the bank and for some nefarious reason been turned down. Sometimes
the lender of last resort has jumped the gun on the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some practices outlawed by Schumer's proposal are
already illegal in New York, such as penalties for prepaying a
mortgage. Others would become illegal here under regulations
proposed and soon to be adopted by the state Banking Department.

<HEADLINE> Amid Vietnam war, news media and military fought their own battles  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was called the first ''living room war,'' the
beginning of a communications revolution that has fundamentally
changed battlefield reporting and left a legacy that still affects,
sometimes bitterly, the way America's wars are covered.
</P>
<P>
   ''For better or worse, Vietnam was the most important story of
the time, and it shaped us -- and journalism -- ever since,'' says
Don North, a veteran war correspondent who first arrived in Saigon
as a freelance reporter in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Until it fell to the communists 25 years ago and became Ho Chi
Minh City, Saigon was the capital of South Vietnam, and was filled
with hundreds of journalists and would-be journalists with ambition
and a taste for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit hasn't changed, but the 20-pound tape recorders,
film cameras and other tools of that era are now museum pieces --
replaced by laptop computers, digital cameras and portable
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam also triggered a war-within-a-war -- a battle of
credibility between the military and the media that has ebbed and
flowed for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The sourness was felt in 1983, when U.S. officers tried to bar
journalists entirely from the Grenada invasion, and in 1989 in
Panama, when even Pentagon-organized ''media pools'' were kept away
from the action.
</P>
<P>
   These controversial incidents led to new ''rules of engagement''
for journalists, including media pools -- small, selected groups of
journalists who cover for all -- and ''security review'' of news
material before sent. Both were used in the 1991 Gulf war, but
failed, largely due to abuses by the military itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War showed ''resentment of the press was still there,
part of the lore,'' says William Hammond, senior historian at the
Army's Center of Military History.
</P>
<P>
   Today, training in media relations is mandatory for the
Pentagon's top uniformed and civilian officials, and it is taught,
at least obliquely, at the nation's military academies and war
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But there was none of that in Saigon in the early 1960s, where
the budding conflict was being covered by a tight group of
newcomers, notably Malcolm Browne and Peter Arnett of The
Associated Press, David Halberstam of The New York Times and Neil
Sheehan of United Press International.
</P>
<P>
   At first uncritical of the U.S. commitment, these reporters
became disillusioned by what they saw as hypocrisy, incompetence
and corruption. Their harsh assessments infuriated officials at the
U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam, known as MACV, and in
Washington. President Lyndon Johnson even tried to have some
reporters reassigned out of the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became clear early on that there was a great deal of
difference between what the Americans in the field were saying, and
the hyped-up, artificial optimism of high Americans in Saigon,''
says Halberstam, who went on to publish several books, including
the acclaimed Vietnam War study, ''The Best and the Brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gradually, the American people began to see what we saw -- that
you could grind this war on forever, and the other side, no matter
how many we killed, would keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1962 and 1975, some 5,100 journalists from 64 countries
kept coming, too, according to a recent study by Hammond for
Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center for the Press and
Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The peak number was about 600 during the 1968 Tet offensive;
about 100 were still there as North Vietnamese tanks rumbled into
Saigon on April 30, 1975.

about 100 were still there as North Vietnamese tanks rumbled into
Saigon on April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about 1,200 journalists were accredited in Saudi
Arabia during the Gulf War, but non-registered and one-time
visitors pushed the total considerably higher, say former military
information officers. They estimate more than 2,000 media people
were in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters in Vietnam, too, were one-time visitors; the
Saigon press corps also drew its share of drifters, adventurers and
even spies. MACV officers estimated in 1966 that fewer than 35
percent of the accredited press -- mostly wire service, print and
television journalists -- actually covered combat.
</P>
<P>
   At war's end, more than 70 were dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers won the most Pulitzer Prizes and suffered the most
casualties. Despite their high profile, TV crews dodged death until
1970 when eight people working for NBC and CBS were ambushed and
killed in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In other major incidents, four reporters -- three Australian and
one British -- were killed at a Viet Cong roadblock in Saigon in
1968, and four photographers, for AP, UPI, Life and Newsweek,
perished in a South Vietnamese helicopter shot down over Laos in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Saigon's media centerpiece was the daily command briefing, a
battle of semantics that ranged from hilarious to hostile and was
known as the ''Five O'Clock Follies.'' Though derided and
ridiculed, the briefings served to put information -- true or false
-- on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Competition was fierce, especially among wire services and TV
networks. But ''in the field we were mutually supportive and
cooperative -- without New York's knowledge,'' recalls ex-ABC
correspondent Steve Bell.
</P>
<P>
   World War II-type censorship was impractical in a country where
military secrets hardly existed, so U.S. officials would
''embargo'' reports of field operations until fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   The policy worked, says Hammond. Only eight journalists were
ever cited for violating security, and ''no one has ever been able
to demonstrate that any damage resulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Col. Robert Burke, MACV's chief of information in
1972-73, said military officers held ''grudging respect'' for
journalists, especially those who shared the perils of combat.
''But no one got up in the morning saying, 'God, I'm so happy the
press is over here reporting the war.'''
</P>
<P>
   What most rankled officials, says Burke, were ''inaccurate
stories'' that affected policy, and a perceived media bias that
''ignored NVA and Viet Cong atrocities and errors, while
exaggerating those of the U.S. and South Vietnamese.''
</P>
<P>
   This, and the TV images of battle being beamed into American
living rooms, led to a widespread perception that the media ''lost
the war in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   But historian Hammond doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ''What finally alienated the American people wasn't news
coverage but casualties,'' he said in an interview. ''Public
support in both the Korean and Vietnam wars dropped 15 percent each
time casualties rose by 10 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Visit Univ. of Arkansas  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton and the first lady
rekindled special memories with two of their oldest and dearest
friends during a weekend visit to the University of Arkansas -- the
campus where both Clintons taught law a quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his wife, Hillary, spent the afternoon and
evening Sunday with James and Diane Blair, who have been among
their closest companions since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair left the university faculty, where she was a
political science professor for two decades, last fall because of
illness. She suffers from terminal cancer. James Blair is a
prominent lawyer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Friends for nearly 30 years, the Clintons and Blairs frequently
keep in touch by telephone. Often when they return to Arkansas, the
Clintons visit the Blairs in this college town or at the Blair's
vacation home at Beaver Lake.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was marked by added emotion, however, because of Mrs.
Blair's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to take this opportunity to spend some time with
her,'' said White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by the Blairs, the president, first lady and
daughter Chelsea took a meandering motor trip through town and the
university campus. Later the Clintons had dinner and remained until
late in the evening at the Blair's home outside Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's friendship with the Blairs dates back to her
arrival in the state in the 1970s. Clinton, as a young governor,
gave the vows at the Blair's wedding. When the Clintons were
married, they had the reception in the backyard of the Blair's
home.
</P>
<P>
   During their days in Arkansas, the young Clinton couple would
turn to the Blairs for political advice.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Jim Blair already was one of the state's most
prominent trial lawyers. Later he became general counsel for Tyson
Foods Inc., one of the state's most powerful businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's friendship with Mrs. Clinton brought headlines when it
was learned that he had suggested she invest money in the
commodities market. She did, and turned a $1,000 investment in
cattle futures into a $100,000 bonanza in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on a streak that I thought was very successful and I
wanted to share this with my close friends,'' Blair once told an
interviewer, describing Mrs. Clinton as ''the best person at my
marriage ... a tennis partner and friend.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campus tour, the Clintons and Blairs stopped in front
of the law school, where a brass plaque commemorates the
president's and first lady's days on the faculty. He began teaching
there in 1973, she in 1974. Both departed when Clinton became state
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clintons on Law Faculty,'' reads an inscription on the plaque,
which also notes that Mrs. Clinton founded a legal clinic there.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a nice surprise,'' Mrs. Clinton said. It was the first
time the Clintons had seen the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Then along with the Blairs it was on to a ''peace fountain''
dedicated to former Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright, for whom
Clinton once briefly worked on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is the university's main building, one that
holds special memories for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back in my former life, we restored it,'' Clinton remarked,
noting that the ''Old Maine'' building was built in 1871 during the
Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. Its north tower is
taller than the south one, he pointed out. When Clinton was
governor some people in the state wanted to tear the building down,
but he intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a beautiful building. ... I don't like tearing
things down,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--Hizzoner and the Cops, Bjt,1010  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It would be hard to find a bigger booster of the
New York City Police than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Even in difficult
cases -- like the much-publicized recent killings of unarmed black
men by undercover officers -- the mayor always stands by the police.
</P>
<P>
   But not all New York cops are happy with the mayor's outspoken
support.
</P>
<P>
   Some complain that his tough rhetoric on crime makes their jobs
more difficult. Others say Giuliani, who is running for the U.S.
Senate against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, is involving them
in politics. Still others feel the mayor's campaigns against the
smallest crimes -- jaywalking or drinking in public -- bring derision
to the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to show the voters upstate he's tough on crime,
but he has us running around arresting people for silly violations,
like spitting on the sidewalk,'' said a Manhattan officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would he shut up so we can do our job?'' laments a Queens
police captain. ''He's taken things that shouldn't be
confrontational and made them confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were typical of 30 New York police interviewed in
the past week, all of whom insisted their names not be used for
fear of retribution. But police union officials and experts speak
openly of the growing annoyance by police over Giuliani's policies
-- though some say the anger grows from low police wages or simply
the mayor's absolute control of the nation's largest police
department, with about 41,000 officers, which once prided itself on
its independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very well known, within the department and by the public,
that the mayor has taken total control of the Police Department,''
said Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment
Association. ''When you have politicians running the Police
Department, rather than the knowledgeable people within the
department, you are bound to have problems. That's precisely what
is happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The last straw for many officers was Giuliani's response after
Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, was shot to death in
a confrontation with narcotics officers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dorismond, the son of Haitian immigrants, was never
convicted of a crime, the mayor ordered police to release his
record of arrests -- including some sealed records of juvenile
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage followed among the Haitian community, and some others,
and people vented their anger at protests. The tension escalated at
Dorismond's funeral in Brooklyn, when a melee broke out between
mourners and police, resulting in injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officials say the shooting badly hurt morale --
which already was at an alltime low because of meager wages
compared to suburban police and the bad publicity over the police
torture of Abner Louima and the fatal shooting of black immigrant
Amadou Diallo by four white officers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the bad press, the unions representing police
lieutenants and captains took out a full-page ad in the New York
Post recently. ''New York City Police Officers Do Care'' was the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of what anybody says, police officers day in and
day out are going out on patrol and risking their lives for the
residents of the city of New York,'' said Capt. John Driscoll,
president of the Captains Endowment Association.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Garvey, president of the Lieutenants Benevolent
Association, said the ad was needed to cut through all the
political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the political season and the volume is turned up so
high and no one is listening to the facts,'' he said. ''There are a
couple of highlighted media cases that people capitalize on, and
they turn those cases into the norm. We needed to get the facts out
to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress of the job, low morale and frustration is evident in
the exodus of cops retiring from the force. Last year, 888 officers
retired when they reached 20 years of service, compared with 617 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   One Manhattan officer said the public unhappiness with police is
partly tied to Giuliani. She said she appreciates it when he stands
by the police, but added: ''People in the minority communities hate
him so much, so when he sticks up for us, that makes them hate us
as well. A lot of cops are frustrated, especially those of us on
the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's mistrust of police has puzzled several experts who
say the people ought to be praising cops in these times. Crime is
at an all-time low, and fatal police shootings of civilians are
down from 41 in 1990 to 11 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police killings are down 75 percent and we're in the middle of
a kind of political hysteria,'' said Fred Siegel, an urban affairs
specialist and history professor at Cooper Union. ''Usually if
police killings drop more than crime, it would be thought of as an
enormous accomplishment. But it's not now, because we're in the
middle of a political season.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel was critical of the mayor's handling of the Dorismond
case, but said he believes most police still have a positive
attitude toward the mayor. He added that Giuliani's critics are
using the Dorismond case -- and the police -- against him, a tried
and true method in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racial incidents are used to polarize people -- it's how
incumbents are driven out of office here,'' Siegel said, referring
to racial or ethnic controversies that are believed to have helped
defeat former mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   Gene O'Donnell, a former NYPD officer who teaches at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice, doesn't think the mayor has cops
frustrated -- rather, it's low wages and relationships with their
bosses. Several police officers agreed, including one who said he
rarely thinks about the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But one Manhattan detective said the city needs a mayor whose
politics are less tied to the police department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we're in this situation -- we're damned if we do
something, and damned if we don't,'' he said. ''It bothers me --
this is going to be a long, tough summer.''

<HEADLINE> White House Bolsters Medicare Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Americans who pay full price at the
pharmacy window, prescriptions cost at least 15 percent more than
the discount drug prices insurance companies get, passing savings
along to their enrollees, according to a new Clinton administration
study.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the study, released today, bolsters
President Clinton's call for drug coverage for Medicare
beneficiaries. Under Clinton's proposal, which would cost $195
billion over 10 years, the government would contract with the same
drug-purchasing firms used by many private health plans to get
discounts and rebates for bulk purchases.
</P>
<P>
   That would let retirees and disabled Americans in Medicare
benefit from the same lower prices for drugs that people in private
health plans do, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration study also echoed previous findings that
retirees without supplemental private drug coverage in addition to
Medicare -- which doesn't cover drug costs except those administered
in hospital or clinical settings -- get fewer drugs than they need.
It found that although health status between the two groups is
similar, senior citizens without drug coverage purchase one-third
fewer drugs and pay nearly twice as much for them as those with
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Using new data from Medicare and audits of pharmacy pricing, the
study by the Health and Human Services Department also sought to
disprove Republican assertions that lack of drug coverage is mainly
a problem for poorer Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It showed that one out of every four Medicare beneficiaries with
higher incomes -- defined as about $45,000 for a couple -- lack
coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no significant decrease in the gap in drug spending
as income rises, suggesting that drug coverage makes a difference
across all incomes,'' the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ordered by the White House last fall, comes as the
administration and Congress are locked in a heated debate about how
to help elderly and disabled Americans who get health insurance
through Medicare pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a drug benefit available as an option for all 39
million Medicare beneficiaries that would start out paying up to
$1,000 in drug costs for a $26 monthly premium, with both coverage
and premiums increasing over time. He has criticized drug companies
for high prices and Medicare could help the elderly get discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America said that momentum is growing in Congress
for an alternative, private-sector solution and urged Clinton to
work with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's plan is the wrong solution,'' said Holmer in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans want to target aid to low-income
people who they say need the most help in paying for prescriptions.
GOP lawmakers have proposed ideas such as subsidizing premiums or
giving tax credits to low-income retirees who buy private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate passed a budget blueprint earmarking $40
billion to help older Americans pay for drugs. But the budget does
not require the new program or propose specifics.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say the HHS study probably understates the
price disparity for people without drug coverage because insurers
often get rebates after bulk drug purchases, further lowering their
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The affect of rebates, which HHS didn't examine, could mean drug
costs for people paying full retail price are 17 percent to 35
percent higher than what insurers pay, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Black Women Searched More Often  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black women passing though U.S. Customs as
they return home from trips overseas have been much more likely
than other passengers to be subjected to strip searches and X-rays,
according to congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Black American women were less commonly found with hidden
illegal drugs than others, however, said a report released today by
the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although searched passengers with certain characteristics were
subject to more intrusive searches, they were not always more
likely to be found carrying contraband,'' said the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of 1 percent of the 71.5 million passengers
entering the United States on international flights in fiscal year
1998 were singled out for searches, the report said. And the vast
majority of those 52,455 searched passengers were subjected to
simple pat-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Black women were selected for more intrusive searches -- strip
searches or X-rays -- more than any other group. Whites also had a
high likelihood of being strip-searched, and black men were chosen
more often than most other passengers to be X-rayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service has made efforts to change how passengers
are checked for drugs in recent years, as allegations of abusive
searches have surfaced. The agency faces numerous lawsuits alleging
people were singled out for body searches because of their race or
sex, including an effort by almost 100 black women to file a
class-action suit in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said the changes, most enacted after the
period studied by the GAO, already are yielding results not
reflected in the report. For instance, fewer intrusive searches are
being conducted, but more are resulting in drug seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't necessarily disagree with the report,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in an interview. ''The intimation
is a bit outdated. I think we've taken the problem head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that X-rays conducted in 1998 found drugs almost
twice as often on whites and black men than on black women. And
strip searches that year uncovered drugs on Hispanics and black men
at much higher rates than on black women.
</P>
<P>
   Also, black American women were nine times as likely as white
American women to be X-rayed, but less than half as likely to be
concealing illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such searches are intended to catch smugglers who swallow drug
packets or hide cocaine or heroin inside clothing or in body
cavities. The searches usually begin with a pat-down and, with
reasonable suspicion, can proceed to a strip search, an X-ray,
monitored bowel movement or a body cavity search.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials generally can detain passengers for long
periods of time without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who requested the GAO report,
complimented Customs' recent improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he plans to offer legislation to would put into law many
of the reforms, such as prohibiting racial profiling of passengers,
sensitivity training for inspectors, requiring annual statistics on
the race and sex of everybody searched and mandating that officials
document why someone is searched.

<HEADLINE> HUD Seeks Consumer Protections  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing
legislation to bar Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from purchasing loans
originated through predatory practices, including those with
excessive fees or unreasonable prepayment penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''This important initiative will protect consumers from being
victimized by predatory lenders and ensure that these two
government sponsored enterprises are held to the highest standard
of conduct in the marketplace,'' said Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Andrew Cuomo in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the legislation would specifically prohibit Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac from purchasing loans where the points and fees
charged the borrower exceed 5 percent of the mortgage amount.
</P>
<P>
   It also would keep the two from purchasing loans from sub-prime
lenders that have not demonstrated compliance with fair housing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo is to outline his proposal more fully on Wednesday at the
inaugural meeting of a HUD Task Force on Predatory Lending.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae spokeswoman Janice Doue said that while she could not
comment specifically on Cuomo's proposal without having more
details, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are already moving to
install procedural safeguards against the general kind of abuses
the government wants to block.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Freddie Mac did not return a telephone call
seeking reaction to Cuomo's Sunday evening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed HUD legislation is part of a broader effort to
crack down on scam lending, a combination of deceptive business
practices and excessive fees victimizing many borrowers, especially
in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, federally chartered corporations
that exert a heavy influence on the market through their mortgage
purchases and packaging, have mostly stuck to conventional loans
until recently, Bill Apgar, federal housing commissioner, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But both entities have announced they are going to move
significantly into the sub-prime market,'' he said in an interview.
''It's new territory for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Apgar said Freddie Mac has bought some $10 billion in sub-prime
loans since it started getting into those types of mortgages.
Fannie Mae has not released comparable figures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer moms who supported Bill Clinton are wary of Hillary  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCARSDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- They helped Bill Clinton score a goal in
'96. But soccer moms in the suburbs that Hillary Clinton now calls
home aren't cheering for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always vote Democrat, but I am not committed to Hillary,''
said Gerri Jaffe as she watched her daughter's team chase a ball
across a field in Scarsdale, a short drive from the Clintons'
Chappaqua home. ''We have some very good Democratic politicians who
could have been the candidate for Senate, but it was given to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I like her as a first lady, I like her very much,'' said
Maryann Mancino, of Larchmont, who works in a family owned clothing
business, as she cheered her daughter's team at a nearby stadium in
Mamaroneck. ''I think she's smart and very focused, but I don't
think she's right for New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show that among all voters, support for Giuliani and
Clinton is about even, with the mayor's standing slipping after his
handling of the case of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black man
shot by police. But among suburban voters and white women, the
mayor has led the first lady by a ratio of roughly 5 to 3 for
months.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is contrary to what might be expected. After all, New
York's suburban voters picked Bill Clinton over Bob Dole nearly 2
to 1, and Hillary Clinton is not unlike the women whose votes elude
her -- an educated, middle-class, working mother whose top issues
are education and health.
</P>
<P>
   And just like them, she rejected fabulous Manhattan and bucolic
upstate for a nice big house on a tree-lined street in the land of
Ford Explorers and golden retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   But the soccer moms aren't impressed by the Chappaqua address.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm appalled she's even running,'' said Marjorie Sagiv, a
mother of two and owner of a small import-export business. ''She
came out of no place. She's not even a New Yorker. It's a
travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's practically your neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially because she's my neighbor,'' said Sagiv. ''Who does
she think she is? She's the president's wife. But that doesn't give
her a right to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Many suburbanites also credit Giuliani with making New York City
cleaner and safer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived in New York City for eight years. I see a tremendous
change from his efforts there,'' said Monique Gotkin, of Scarsdale,
as she watched her daughter's team, the Wildcats, play in nearby
Mamaroneck.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hillary Clinton, she added, ''I don't see how she's going
to improve things here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson predicts that as female
voters get to know her, ''you're going to see a movement in the
polls among that group. One of the things that is key is for people
to know what Hillary did before she entered the White House. A lot
of people just don't know, for instance, that she was the first
female law partner in her law firm. They don't know that she was
named one of America's top 100 lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   One new poll showed women may be getting Wolfson's message. It
had Clinton and Giuliani statistically tied among white women;
still Giuliani remained ahead about 5 to 4 among suburbanites in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Even soccer moms who think highly of Clinton may not want her in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admire her but I probably won't vote for her,'' said Monica
Rafajac, a former attorney and Scarsdale mother of two. ''With
Giuliani, you either hate him or you feel like he follows through.
He can be obnoxious, but his heart is in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less impressed by Clinton's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see what she's done as first lady to get her husband's
ear on poverty, children, women,'' said Stacey Tecklin, an attorney
from Harrison with two children. ''I will give her credit as a
mother -- her daughter seems wonderful. But I think she should have
started out a little bit smaller'' in her political goals.
</P>
<P>
   As for Giuliani, Tecklin said, ''I'm not happy with his handling
of the police shooting (of Dorismond), but I will still support him
wholeheartedly. I think he really turned around the city. He's a
leader, not a follower.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fatal shooting last month, Giuliani pictured Dorismond
as a violent man, released sealed records of his juvenile crimes
and did not express condolences to his family. Clinton and many
others criticized the mayor's behavior as racially divisive.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also has some critics in the soccer-mom set.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's crazy and that he's a fascist,'' said Ann
Helpern, of Harrison, a mother of three. ''(Clinton's lack of New
York roots) doesn't bother me. The breadth of her experience, her
intelligence -- she's so thoughtful. And she cares about the issues
that are important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown about 10 percent of voters are undecided,
and many soccer moms have questions about both Clinton and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she says enough about what she really stands
for, and when she does speak, she says what she thinks we want to
hear,'' said Susan Peck, a bookkeeper from Mamaroneck with three
children. ''I think he's done a great job in the city, but he
really is city-based and I don't really know how he feels about
statewide issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''I'm a Democrat, but I'm not wedded to it.''

<HEADLINE> Eat an Orange, Banish a Gallstone?  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- An orange a day could keep the gallbladder doctor
away.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of 13,130 men and women suggests that women who
don't get enough vitamin C may be prone to gallbladder disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though the study doesn't say vitamin C can prevent gallbladder
disease, it ''supports that hypothesis,'' said Dr. Joel Simon, the
lead author and an assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology
at the University of California-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller studies have found a similar association, and research
has shown that vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs frequently develop
gallstones. Simon theorized that the same might be true in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Gallstones can form when bile, a liquid produced by the liver to
help break down fats during digestion, becomes oversaturated with
cholesterol. Animal studies have shown vitamin C regulates the
conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hypothesized that low levels of vitamin C may be a risk
factor for human gallbladder disease as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac beneath the liver where
bile is stored. Disease is frequently characterized by gallstones,
which can grow up to an inch across and cause severe abdominal
pain. Treatment may involve removal of the gallbladder.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 19 million Americans with gallbladder disease,
two-thirds are women, Simon said. Women are believed to be more
prone because the feminine hormone estrogen increases the
concentration of cholesterol in the bile, and most gallstones are
made of cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Simon examined data on participants in a national health and
nutrition survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. Low bloodstream
levels of ascorbic acid -- vitamin C's chemical name -- were
associated with an increased prevalence of symptomatic gallbladder
disease in women, but not men.
</P>
<P>
   Women with higher ascorbic acid levels and those who took
vitamin C supplements were significantly less likely to have the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though no vitamin C link was noted in the men, Simon said that
may be simply because there wasn't enough gallbladder disease in
men to detect a statistical association.
</P>
<P>
   More research is needed to examine how men might be affected and
to determine if vitamin C does in fact have preventive powers,
researchers said.

<HEADLINE> McCain praises Giuliani as independent-minded  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. John McCain ridiculed Hillary Rodham
Clinton's charge that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is in the pocket of
right-wing zealots but joked that he himself is proud to be part of
the ''vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Its members, he said with a laugh, might even help Giuliani win
his U.S. Senate campaign against the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that will be sufficient to put us over the top and
eliminate any further need for fund-raising and further
campaigning,'' the former presidential candidate cracked Sunday at
a joint news conference with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Long Island to endorse a GOP House candidate, the
Arizona senator stopped in Manhattan to meet with Giuliani at a
midtown restaurant, where he called the suggestion that Giuliani is
allied with the far right ''ludicrous on the face of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised the mayor as an independent-minded politician who, if
elected, would ''speak for those that many times in the halls of
the United States Senate are not spoken for.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has proven as mayor of this great city that he not only can
make the streets safe but help the people of New York and the
United States realize the American dream,'' McCain said. ''I
believe what's needed in Washington is a person who will speak up
for all Americans regardless of party affiliation, and I am
convinced that not only is he not a captive of any special
interest, he will be a voice for the people of Arizona as well as
the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit came as Giuliani's campaign aired a new 30-second
television ad linking him to the Arizona senator. McCain won
widespread acclaim, if not sufficient voter support, in his
maverick primary bid for the White House. In the ad, Giuliani says
he shares McCain's independent approach to public issues.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post item, quoting Clinton media consultant Ellis
Verdi as expressing surprise that Giuliani ''would associate
himself with someone (McCain) who is that far to the right,'' was
displayed on a placard as the two shared coffee and chitchat then
met with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I notice that after my last visit here that I am now part of
the vast right-wing conspiracy,'' McCain said. ''I am very proud to
be part of that organization. Obviously I received a groundswell of
their support in the campaign that I just completed unsuccessfully.
As a member of the vast right-wing conspiracy I attach myself to
this campaign, and I seek all of you to examine our tenets and our
philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the hastily arranged meeting was to show that
''I'm not going to be deterred by comments from the other side, and
that I'm very proud to be associated with John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ''Not only are we friends, but we seized this
opportunity to hatch several plots to take over the government in
the hope that one of them will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the term ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' in a 1998
television interview to describe a purported campaign by
well-financed groups and individuals to discredit President Clinton
and herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her senate campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said she has
never called Giuliani or McCain part of the alleged conspiracy but
simply pointed out that the mayor's campaign has accepted
contributions from fund-raisers identified with ultraconservative
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''John McCain is not running for the Senate, Rudy Giuliani is,
and at some point Giuliani is going to have to tell the people of
New York where he stands on the issues,'' Wolfson said.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Marine Capt. Reprimanded  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martialed Marine captain who
faces an uncertain military future says he is haunted by memories
of a reservist who died following a grueling training hike he
supervised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a day goes by that I don't think about him,'' Capt. Victor
Arana said, reading from a prepared statement, as relatives of
Lance Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto sobbed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would do or give anything to be able to bring him back. Many
nights I have lain awake haunted by the memories of my own
inactions during the march on July 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana, 28, of Chicago, was found guilty of dereliction of duty
and failure to obey an order in the death of 21-year-old Leto, of
New Milford, Conn. He was reprimanded Sunday and was ordered to
forfeit $3,600 in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Leto was found dead of heat stroke two hours after the 8-mile
hike -- conducted at night in 80-degree heat -- following a head
count that prompted a search for him.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ralph Kohlmann, the military judge who found Arana
guilty on Saturday, could have sentenced him to nine months in
prison and dismissed him from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's obviously relieved, and he's going to go home and spend
some time with his wife,'' said Arana's civilian attorney, Mark
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Pleading for leniency, Stevens told the judge Arana's career as
a Marine officer is finished. ''His promotion has been taken away.
He has a federal conviction that will follow him the rest of his
life,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Stevens said he expects Arana to resign
when his current service term ends in December, if not before. He
said Arana will report back to duty this week, not in a command
position, but in an administrative post at the Marine Corps Combat
Services Support Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will not be in charge of any other Marines,'' said Leto's
mother, Domenica. ''He will be pushing papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Arana led the hike at a faster pace than the
2{-mile-per-hour pace prescribed by training guidelines and didn't
allow enough rest breaks. Witnesses also said Arana went home
before a head count was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Maj. Chris Hamilton, asked the judge to dismiss
Arana from the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused does not deserve to wear the uniform and the rank
of an officer of the Marines,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys argued that Arana, a rookie company commander
still drawing his lieutenant's pay while wearing captain's bars,
did not receive proper instructions from his superiors. They also
said Arana's noncommissioned officers failed to communicate with
him or follow his orders for taking care of stragglers.
</P>
<P>
   While Arana made errors in judgment and leadership and was
willing to take responsibility for his mistakes, others were to
blame for Leto's death as well, Stevens argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a general failure,'' he told the judge. ''There was
a failure at the School of Infantry, there was a failure by his
staff; and he stands alone at this court-martial to pay the
ultimate price.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Lejeune tightened and revised training in standard
operating procedures for new infantry instructors following Leto's
death. They also created two new positions for inspectors to
monitor infantry school training.

<HEADLINE> 'Fail Safe' Airs Live on CBS  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Moscow and New York City took it on the chin as
a live TV performance of ''Fail Safe'' dramatized the horrors of
nuclear war -- and gave viewers a punch in the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Whew.
</P>
<P>
   A dream project of George Clooney, who has long admired the 1964
movie version, this ''Fail Safe'' revival provided a searing return
to the Cold War era and, at the same time, a bracing reprise of
TV's long-ago age of live drama.
</P>
<P>
   Live! ''We were panicked,'' Clooney confessed later at the cast
party. ''We hadn't done one really smooth rehearsal. I thought we
were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sunday night broadcast offered a chilling
reminder of today's ever-increasing nuclear threat. (As a coda, the
program cited nine countries currently with nuclear capabilities --
not just the two superpowers of a simpler past.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, ''Fail Safe'' was, as advertised, truly an event.
</P>
<P>
   To underline the starkness of the subject (and perhaps honor the
pre-color days when live TV thrived), the CBS production was in
black-and-white, as was the original film. And it aired in a
''letter box'' format (black strips above and below the picture) to
heighten the documentary effect.
</P>
<P>
   Airing 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT from Warner Bros. studios in
Burbank, Calif. (with a taped repeat for West Coast viewers), the
program was directed by Stephen Frears and starred, among others,
Brian Dennehy, Harvey Keitel, Sam Elliott, Hank Azaria, Noah Wyle,
Don Cheadle, Richard Dreyfuss and Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   The razor-sharp teleplay, like the film's screenplay four
decades ago, was written by Walter Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Harvey Wheeler-Eugene Burdick novel of the same
name, the TV ''Fail Safe'' depicted the irrevocable outcome after a
U.S. bomber is erroneously dispatched to drop a nuclear warhead on
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of thing that just couldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got checks upon checks,'' Gen. Bogan (Dennehy) assures
Congressman Raskob (Elliott) early on, in the cavernous War Room in
Omaha, Neb. ''We've got fail-safe procedures. We bypass human
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Well ... by the end, Moscow has been wiped off the map by the
U.S., and, to forestall Russia's all-out retaliation, the U.S.
sacrifices New York as a sort of peace offering.
</P>
<P>
   As in the film, the signal that Moscow is gone reaches the
audience as a shrieking sound: the ambassador's phone melting from
the heat of the fireball. A few minutes later the other shoe (and
20-megaton bomb) drops and a street scene in Manhattan bleaches out
into nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   It was the climax to suspense mounting in a surefire way: The
danger was kept off-screen, to be painfully shared in the minds of
the characters and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The action -- which was mostly tense talk -- jockeyed between the
Omaha War Room, the Washington War Room, the bomber (piloted by
Clooney and Cheadle) and the White House bunker occupied by the
President, negotiating by phone with a translator (Wyle) at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Dreyfuss, more snippy than commanding as
the President, the acting was solid.
</P>
<P>
   Especially good were Dennehy, Elliott, Keitel as Gen. Black
(handed the unenviable duty of bombing New York), and especially
Azaria as the think-tank professor arguing that the U.S. attack was
a blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clooney's pre-broadcast anxiety, gaffes were admirably
few: a handful of missed audio cues, along with a flubbed credit in
the brief introduction by ''host'' Walter Cronkite. Clooney said
Cronkite later joked, ''I got you started on the right foot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we did OK,'' Dennehy said after the broadcast, adding,
''I'm not gonna watch it. I'm superstitious.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS president Les Moonves was ecstatic. ''Boy, am I proud!''
he exclaimed. ''George did it!''
</P>
<P>
   An apt summation. Clooney's production of ''Fail Safe''
resonated with history -- both TV's and a dangerous world's -- while
staying meaningfully rooted in the present. It was a thrilling two
hours for a viewer to have shared with the players on the screen.

<HEADLINE> Big Animals To Dominate Conference  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Southern African countries were pushing
for the right to sell stockpiled ivory at a conference beginning
today to discuss trade in endangered animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Tirngeni Erkana, head of Namibia's delegation, said their
proposal for an annual quota to sell stockpiled ivory is justified
because it comes from natural mortality and legal slaughter to thin
the herds rather than from elephants killed by poachers.
</P>
<P>
   The southwestern African nation has a stockpile of 35-36 tons,
and wants to sell two tons per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my country, we have kept the level of poaching to a
minimum,'' he said. ''On average we lose two or three elephants a
year. It is a question of monitoring the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not understand why after we have taken effective
management of our elephants, we should be punished,'' Erkana said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe have also submitted ivory
sales proposals to the conference of the United Nations Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants, whales and other large animals will probably steal
the limelight from smaller animals and plants during the 10-day
conference, said Willem Wijnstekers, CITES secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our discussions on elephants, whales and sea turtles, I am
sure, at times are going to be difficult and heated, sometimes even
emotional,'' Wijnstekers said. ''This does not do sufficient
justice to the many other important proposals we will have to
decide upon in the coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 delegates from 151 countries and scores of
non-governmental organizations dealing in conservation and
environmental issues are at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 proposals on different species will be discussed,
including whether to forbid all trade in the Asian urial, a wild
sheep; the coelacanth, a unique living fossil fish; the hwamei, a
songbird; and the Chinese happy tree.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on a proposal by Kenya and India to ban all commerce in
elephants is expected to dominate the conference. CITES lifted a
ban on limited trade in some elephant products such as leather in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Indian delegation head Suresh Sharma said although India and
Kenya both want to protect their elephants, India's problem is
particularly serious because of the 100-to-1 female to male ratio
in the Indian herd. Only Asian male elephants have tusks. In
African elephants, both females and males have tusks.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations say allowing trade in any type of elephant product
increases poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said India has seen an increase in poaching since CITES
lifted the ban on the ivory trade in 1997 for the one-time sale. He
said an average of 100 male elephants are killed each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gordon Shepherd, director of international policy for
the World Wildlife Fund, wanted the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not yet time to do ivory trade. It is still a danger,''
he said. ''But it is difficult to poach elephants for skins.''

<HEADLINE> China Rejects Embassy Explanation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Unsatisfied by the firing of a Central
Intelligence Agency employee, China today rejected U.S.
explanations for last year's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade that set back relations between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said claims that
the United States did not know the correct location of the embassy
are ''not justified,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also said it was ''hard for people to believe'' that the
bombing was the fault of several officials whose mistake was not
corrected in a review process.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu repeated earlier demands that the United States thoroughly
investigate the bombing, strictly punish those responsible and give
China ''a satisfactory explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said Saturday that an agency employee blamed for
incorrectly targeting the Chinese Embassy was fired and that six
others, including a senior official and four managers, received
administrative punishments ranging from oral warnings to letters of
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Numerous CIA officers at all levels of responsibility failed
to ensure that the intended bombing target ... had been properly
identified and precisely located before CIA passed a target
nomination package to the U.S. military for action,'' CIA spokesman
Bill Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, the Chinese spokesman, said the United States told
China that eight CIA officers were sanctioned. Washington informed
Beijing on Saturday about results of an investigation into the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said that Washington ''only admitted that the U.S. side used
an inappropriate methodology to locate the target and that the
review process at every level failed to find the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The May 7 bombing, which killed three Chinese and wounded 20
others, rocked relations and sparked violent stone-throwing
protests against the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China, as well
as buildings belonging to other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were further infuriated by reports in Chinese
government-run media that suggested the bombing was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, Beijing suspended military contacts and talks on
human rights, arms control and security issues. While ties have
thawed, the bombing remains a sensitive topic and relations have
yet to recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the bombing was an accident and that the
intended target was the Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and
Procurement headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, the Chinese spokesman, said the embassy and the
Yugoslav headquarters were 500 yards apart, looked clearly
different and ''it was impossible for the U.S. side to mix up these
two buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy also was clearly marked on U.S. maps and was
clearly sign-posted, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Reassures Business Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a gathering of
U.S. and Western businessmen Monday that Russia will adopt a new
tax code and strive to protect investors' rights, a ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came as newly elected President Vladimir Putin
strives to convince foreign investors that his administration will
offer stability and opportunity following the chaotic years of his
predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Russia's the new leadership ''is creating favorable
conditions for the expansion of economic ties with Western
partners, particularly in the sphere of investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign direct investment in Russia remains tiny compared to the
country's size, reaching just $4.26 billion last year. That figure
could rise if Putin carries out so far vague promises of reform,
analysts have said. A detailed economic program is expected on May
7, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told potential investors the new leadership planned to
pass long-stalled land and tax reform legislation, and hinted at
business-friendly policies while also improving social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, for foreign partners and investors, the domestic
political situation and stability have important meaning,'' he
said. ''We are confident that from this point of view our
cooperation has great prospects.''

<HEADLINE> Submarine force celebrates its centennial  </HEADLINE>
sdnldnorsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROTON, Conn. (AP) -- The U.S. Navy bought its first submarine on
April 11, 1900 from Electric Boat, tying the Groton shipyard and
southeastern Connecticut's fortunes to the fleet for most of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the submarine force marks its centennial, it is
celebrating its history and its future. The official observances
began Sunday in Groton, with a memorial service conducted by the
U.S. Submarine Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony included a Tolling of the Boats, during which a
ship's bell was tolled for each submarine lost during the past
century.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Smithsonian Institution will open its $2
million tribute to submarining, featuring parts from three
decommissioned subs, the Trepang and the Sand Lance, which had
their last homeport in Groton, and the James K. Polk.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, the repository of the fleet's heritage, the
Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, will formally open
its new $4 million expansion, designed to better display some of
the 23,000 artifacts and 35,000 photographs and the world's largest
submarine library.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine that started it all, the USS Holland, would hardly
be recognizable by today's standards. It was just over 53 feet long
and a little more than 10 feet in diameter, powered by a gasoline
motor on the surface and a combination of batteries and electric
motors when submerged. It never made more than 10 knots.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Navy's newest sub, the Seawolf, is 300 feet
longer and 160 times heavier. These subs roam the seven seas with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   But the first subs were limited to the East Coast and primarily
to harbor defense. A decade later, they were sent to the Pacific
but during World War I saw only limited action, primarily on
anti-U-Boat patrols in Ireland and the Azores. During that time,
however, the Groton sub base expanded greatly, with 81 new
buildings, nine finger piers and extensive waterfront construction.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1930s, with war again looming, Electric Boat was
turning out three subs a year. By 1944, during the height of the
Second World War, EB was able to turn out 23 subs a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was during WWII that subs proved their worth. With the
Pacific surface fleet in ruins at Pearl Harbor, it fell to the
submariners to take the fight to the invading Japanese Fleet. Three
days after the attack, the USS Triton carried out the first torpedo
attack on the Japanese Navy south of Wake Island.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war was over, submarines sank 214 naval ships and
1,113 merchant vessels, effectively cutting off Japan's supply
routes.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called Silent Service had its own losses: 52 subs and
3,500 submariners during WWII.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. H.A. Lincoln Jr., commanding officer of the Groton Naval
Submarine Base, said it's essential that people know of the
tremendous contributions made by submarines and the sacrifices made
by their crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important that we not lose this tie, this
connection, to our past,'' Lincoln said. ''We stand on the
foundation that they built for us, and I feel we should never, ever
lose sight of this.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 43.98; Nasdaq Down 50.75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today,
with technology shares heading lower as investors wondered whether
first-quarter earnings reports will justify tech stocks' high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 43.98 at 11,155.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Nasdaq
composite index was down 50.75 at 4,395.70, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 2.32 to 1,514.03.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, still vulnerable after last week's wild
gyrations, led the decliners. Microsoft fell 2 1/16 to 87, and
Applied Materials lost 2} to 112[ on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are waiting to see whether earnings reports for the
recently ended first quarter will show the rapid growth that
convinced many people to bid technology stocks to unprecedented
levels earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology company Amgen and chip maker Motorola were
scheduled to report earnings today, with Advanced Micro Devices and
Rambus to follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits are generally expected to be quite strong for
the first quarter. Analysts expect technology and energy companies
to show the biggest improvement from the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose on the strength of American Express, up 1 13/16 to
140~.
</P>
<P>
   Advancers outnumbered decliners by a few dozen issues on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 109.25 million shares,
well behind Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.34 to 540.65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.8 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.8 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 1.7 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The Reynolds and Reynolds Co. said Monday it
plans to sell or spin off its document services business within six
months to concentrate on its automotive division.
</P>
<P>
   The document services unit, called the Information Services
Group, makes business forms for hospitals and other businesses. It
accounted for $730 million of the company's $1.56 billion in
revenues for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reynolds has built two great businesses, ISG and our
automotive solutions business, with two very different missions,''
Reynolds Chairman David Holmes said. ''We believe pursuing
strategic and clarified strategies will allow both businesses to
more aggressively leverage their strong positions and market
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   The automotive division of the Dayton-based company helps car
dealers and manufacturers manage their computer systems.

<HEADLINE> Forget that April showers stuff: Winter storm wallops state  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastern New York residents today are
wondering what happened to spring.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend storm that rolled in from the Plains brought
2-inch-per hour snow on Sunday morning and gusty winds of up to 15
mph in the afternoon. At the Albany International Airport control
tower Saturday afternoon, temperatures dropped 14 degrees in less
than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   David Skoczylas of Terryville, Conn., on Sunday said,
''yesterday it was 70 degrees and we were playing golf. Today we're
stuck in a winter storm. I brought my golf shoes but I should have
brought my boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Slick roads forced Skoczylas to extend his visit with family and
friends until today.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern and northern New York got most of the snow. The Albany
area received at least 12 inches, with communities to the north or
in higher elevations getting more.
</P>
<P>
   Tree limbs sagged under the weight of the wet snow, snapping off
onto power lines and knocking out electricity for more than 30,000
Niagara Mohawk customers, most of them in Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
   Between 3,000 and 4,000 customers were still without power
Sunday night, but Niagara Mohawk spokesman Nick Lyman said power
was expected to return to all customers before the end of today.
</P>
<P>
   Much of western New York had just a dusting or little
accumulation. Rochester and Buffalo had less than an inch while the
Southern Tier town of Sanford near Binghamton had 7.5 inches by
dawn and Chenango Forks in Chenango County had almost 7 inches. But
the storm was spotty, dropping as little 2 inches of snow a few
dozen miles from where a town was socked with 6 or 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused several accidents on eastern New York roads. In
Columbia County, a Fort Drum soldier lost both his legs when he was
struck by several vehicles while assisting stranded motorists on
the Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   State police say 23-year-old Dean Johnson of Warwick, R.I., was
injured when a car carrier jackknifed on a bridge and plunged over
the side. Johnson is listed in serious condition at Albany Medical
Center, where the truck drive is listed as fair.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend storm also played havoc with events.
</P>
<P>
   Mark DeNofio, special events director of a multi-county
walk-athon to benefit Multiple Sclerosis, had to cancel the major
fund-raising event. A local telethon to benefit the Arthritis
Foundation was also touched by the snow that made for tough
slogging and threatened power for the second day of the two-day
event in Niskayuna, outside Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Red Wings minor league baseball games against
Scranton Wilkes-Barre were canceled Saturday because of rain and on
Sunday because of snow. Other baseball games from the Binghamton
Mets in the minor leagues to the New York Mets in the majors were
also canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hit us quick,'' said R.C. Reuteman, vice president and
general manager of the Eastern League Binghamton Mets, which
suspended a tie game against the Norwich Navigators in the top of
the sixth inning before 1,827 fans. ''We were able to get a tarp
out, but the National Weather Service said it wasn't going to let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the storm was far from a record. The record for an April
snow storm is 17.7 inches, set in 1982, one year after 14.7 inches
was recorded in April, according to the National Weather Service.

<HEADLINE> Army MD Charged With Manslaughter  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -- An Army anesthesiologist charged with
involuntary manslaughter in the death of a 16-year-old girl may not
have been told that the antibiotic he administered could cause
someone's heart to stop in rare cases, a fellow doctor says.
</P>
<P>
   The Army alleges that Dr. Michael Hamner gave Katie Tyra a
massive dose of clindamycin and failed to call promptly for
assistance when she went into cardiac arrest during minor surgery
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two Army anesthesiologists offered different views on Hamner's
actions Sunday, the first day of a preliminary hearing that will
determine whether he will face a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon was to remove a small cyst on the Virginia girl's
neck, but she went into cardiac arrest, and attempts to revive her
failed. Katie never regained consciousness and died two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Sagel, a staff anesthesiologist at Walter Reed, said
Hamner, a third-year resident in 1998, kept an incomplete record of
the drugs he administered. Sagel noted that Hamner, 35, also used
too much anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something's wrong -- something's very wrong,'' Sagel said as he
looked at Hamner's record of the procedure. ''Something caused this
heart rate to climb.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagel said a large dose of the antibiotic may have made the
girl's heart stop, noting that an allergic reaction to the drug
could have had the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Mark Kline, a former Walter Reed anesthesiologist who
reviewed the case for the Army, said the ''rare'' side effect was
not widely discussed and that he had never been told about it as a
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Hamner, Kline said, would never have given the massive dose of
clindamycin if he had known it could cause the heart to stop,
calling him ''a very careful resident, more careful than most.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon performing the operation had directed that Katie be
given clindamycin to guard against infection. Physicians generally
don't give patients more than 30 milligrams per minute, but Hamner
intravenously administered 900 mg of in less than two minutes.
Kline suggested he may have been rushed by demanding surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he felt he had to get the drug administered before
they got started,'' Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   After the girl went into cardiac arrest, Hamner tried to revive
her, then called for help from his supervisors, saying he didn't
know what had caused the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hamner is the first Army doctor charged with involuntary
manslaughter due to malpractice in at least three decades, Pentagon
officials said. If the case goes to court-martial and he is
convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 30{ years in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, which is similar to a civilian grand jury
proceeding, came after a two-year push by Katie's father, retired
Marine Corps Col. William D. Tyra, for an investigation into her
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter six months after Katie died, Hamner acknowledged
that he lied about how he administered the antibiotic. Despite
Hamner's admission, the Army allowed him to continue working as an
anesthesiologist in military hospitals. He was also slated for a
promotion until the girl's father protested. Hamner was later
assigned to administrative duties.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 134; Nasdaq Down 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares
heading lower as investors wondered whether first-quarter earnings
reports will justify their high prices.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 134.65 at 11,246.13. Financial shares led the
advance after a Merrill Lynch strategist recommended clients move
some money from technology stocks into financials. American Express
rose 4 7/16 to 143{ and J.P. Morgan rose 5 9/16 to 135 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 46.58 at 4,399.87, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 4.81 to 1,521.16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, still vulnerable after last week's wild
gyrations, led the decliners. Microsoft fell 2 3/16 to 86~, and
Applied Materials lost 2] to 112{ on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are waiting to see whether earnings reports for the
recently ended first quarter will show the rapid growth that
convinced many people to bid technology stocks to unprecedented
levels earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology company Amgen and chip maker Motorola were
scheduled to report earnings today, with Advanced Micro Devices and
Rambus to follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''First-quarter earnings should be good and include some
positive surprises,'' said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist
at Warburg Dillon Read in New York. She said the biggest surprises
-- companies that easily exceed analysts' published forecasts --
should come from the old-line energy and utility industries.
</P>
<P>
   A similar vote of confidence came from Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch. McCabe told clients today that
they should reduce their exposure to technology stocks in favor of
energy, financial and consumer cyclical shares.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont rose 2 5/16 to 57 5/16, helping pull the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 268.00 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.58 to 539.41.

<HEADLINE> Rain Dampens Grain, Soybean Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices fell sharply today in
early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors pulled
back after a wet weekend throughout the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans tumbled after precipitation turned out to be more than
expected in the eastern soybean belt -- prime growing states.
Forecasts for scattered showers in the Midwest over the next two
days also added to the selling mood as drought fears continue to
subside.
</P>
<P>
   Also pressuring the soybean market were rumors that part of a
Chinese purchase of U.S. soybeans -- initial word of which drove
prices higher on Friday -- were South American soybeans instead.
</P>
<P>
   Weather also sent wheat prices significantly lower today. The
cold snap that enveloped the winter wheat belt over the weekend was
not severe enough to have caused crop damage, as some buyers had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures took an early hit from the forecasts for more wet
weather, in addition to weekend precipitation. But the losses were
quickly wiped out amid a lack of selling interest.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 4\ cents to $2.66} a bushel; May
corn was unchanged at $2.27 a bushel; May oats fell { cent to
$1.19\ a bushel; May soybeans fell 7\ cents to $5.31{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures advanced in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .05 cent to 69.15 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .30 cent to 84.30 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .50 cent to 74.50 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .08
cent to 96.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> DNA Decoding Claim Disputed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The chief scientist of an
international organization trying to map the human genetic code has
disputed a private company's claim to have already reached that
target.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins of the publicly funded Human Genome Project
claims Celera Genomics, which last week announced it had finished
the decoding phase of one person's genetic code, did not complete
even half of its planned effort.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Venter, Celera's chief scientist, said last week that the
U.S. company will now begin assembling the genetic fragments into
their proper order. The company claimed to have beaten the Human
Genome Project, an international, nonprofit consortium of
scientists, in the race to decode the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins said Celera had planned to check the sequencing data
10 times, but instead only did so three times before starting on
other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of unfortunate quotes that implied that
they had sequenced the whole human genome but that's just not
true,'' Collins said of Celera's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we all need to recognize is that for the sequencing for
the human genome, there is not going to be a finish line for any
group, for at least the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gilman, director of public policy for Celera, agreed with
Collins that some public statements about the sequencing effort had
been ''very simplistic and confusing.'' But he maintained that the
company announcement on Thursday ''was very precise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that Dr. Collins' response has to be so
negative, but we stand by the statement,'' Gilman said today.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 scientists from 50 countries are to meet this week
at a conference in Vancouver to discuss the latest findings in the
decade-old, multibillion-dollar Human Genome Project.

<HEADLINE> Children upbraid dad for killing mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The children of a woman shot to death in
1998 pulled no punches when it came time to sentence the killer --
the father of two of the three youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   A judge Friday sentenced Tymus Ford Sr. to 37 years in prison
for killed killing Juanita Moore as she napped in their New Haven
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did you take the best thing in our life?'' 8-year-old
Tymus Ford Jr. asked his father before the sentencing. ''We needed
our mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ford pleaded guilty in January to killing Moore. He
said he murdered her because she had told him she was leaving him.
</P>
<P>
   Moore left three children: Tymus Jr., 4-year-old Amos, and
15-year-old Lyndell Moore, a child by a previous union.
</P>
<P>
   After Tymus Jr. addressed his father, Lyndell Moore also spoke
to Ford, who kept his eyes riveted on the floor for most of the
lengthy sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Moore told the man who had killed his mother, ''When I was
little, you told me to look people in the eye. Give me that
respect. You can't, because you're not man enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned a crucifix Ford was wearing on a chain around
his neck. ''You should have had that cross when you took my
mother,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's brother, also named Lyndell Moore, called Ford a
coward ''who did a selfish act.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother also spoke. She told the judge about her
struggle to raise her grandchildren who she said tend to blame
themselves for their mother's death. She told of Mother's Day
observances around a tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's mother, Mary Ford Wilton, then told the court how painful
it was not to be able to see her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hurt as well,'' she said. ''I loved Juanita also. She was
like a daughter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 40, held his head down, looking up only when his mother
spoke and when he told the judge, ''If I could take it back, I
would take it back. I'm very, very sorry for what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's attorney, Richard Silverstein, said his client was
undergoing extreme emotional stress at the time of the killing. He
said Ford felt hopeless because he was out of work and unable to
provide for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone has a breaking point, people do, and when
they reach that point they often do things that have a devastating
effect. You can ruin your life and the life of another in an
instant ...''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein said Ford did not expect forgiveness from his own or
Moore's family, adding, ''Maybe he'll never even forgive himself.''

	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Relatives of Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto
wanted Marine Capt. Victor Arana thrown out of the service for his
role in the Connecticut reservist's death on a training hike.
</P>
<P>
   But they will accept the reprimand and order to forfeit pay

   ''The guilty verdict was the most important thing to us. Now

Domenica Leto, said Sunday.

   Arana, 28, of Chicago was charged in the death of Leto, 21, a
lance corporal from New Milford, Conn. He died after an 8-mile
night conditioning hike last July in 80-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Joey paid the price with his life, and we hope his
death will not go in vain,'' Rosalia DesBiens, Joey Leto's aunt
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Leto's death, the Marines took several steps to improve
how hikes are conducted, such as ensuring supervisors are trained
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Leto's family wanted Arana dismissed from the Marines, but said
the reprimand and the conviction will get the same result.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is some type of closure,'' said DesBiens, Joey's
aunt. ''We will go on. ... We have to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sentenced, Arana stood and read a prepared
statement asking for forgiveness from Leto's family and his fellow
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't matter,'' Francesco Leto said of the apology. ''My
son is no longer here.''
</P>
<P>
   Under military law, Arana could have been confined for nine
months. While accepting the outcome, Domenica Leto said life will
never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a pair of his shoes still by our back door,'' his
mother said. ''I can't move those shoes. I just can't.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Strike Texas Lockheed Plant  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Machinists walked picket lines today at
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co.'s huge aircraft plant after voting
to strike over better wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is Lockheed's primary manufacturer of the F-16
fighter, said company spokesman Joe Stout.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that their wages and bonuses from the defense contractor
have fallen behind rival Boeing Co. machinists, members of Local
776 of the International Association of Machinists voted 1,392 to
275 on Sunday to go on strike. Their three-year contract expired at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what effect the strike would have
on company operations, Stout said today. He would not say how many
workers honored the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people on strike are morning-shift employees who
work on the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed stock was down 6\ cents at $21 a share this afternoon
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its work on the F-16, the Fort Worth operation is
the only Lockheed plant that produces part of the fuselage for the
F-22 fighter and parts for the Japanese F-2 fighter, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has made several major sales during the past two years,
most notably 80 planes to the United Arab Emirates, 50 each to
Israel and Greece, and 24 to Egypt. It is a finalist for several
other contracts, including sales to Norway and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed is Tarrant County's second-largest employer with a work
force of about 10,500.
</P>
<P>
   No new talks were scheduled after the walkout, only the third in
the plant's 59 years of operation. A walkout in 1984 lasted for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Contract talks began in mid-February and continued through last
week. Stout said management made its last offer on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Health care benefits were a major issue. In February, Local 776
President Pat Lane said Lockheed was asking workers to pay higher
premiums for fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents some of the plant's most senior employees.
Because of defense downsizing and seniority rules, the average
worker at the plant is 49 years old and has 20 years of seniority.

<HEADLINE> London Shares Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Share prices fell Monday on the London stock
Exchange following indications that Friday's resurgence of the
Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States may be short lived.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange-100 share index TSE 100
closed down 36.5 points, or 0.6 percent, at 6,533.4.
</P>
<P>
   Provisional market volume was 1.2 billion shares compared with
1.5 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two key concerns for traders ... over the next few
weeks. The first is whether the current rebound we are seeing in
the Nasdaq is genuine and the second is whether the traditional
stocks can hold their attraction if another wave of panic hits the
market,'' said Brian Kiely, technical strategist at Royal Bank of

<HEADLINE> State indefinitely suspends dentist's license  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A state board on Monday indefinitely
suspended the license of dentist Kevin Ward while he fights charges
he left five children with broken bones and bruises while holding
them down to work on their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ward and the state attorney general's office agreed
to let Ward work weekday afternoons on paperwork at his Union City
office but barred him from any contact with patients until his case
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office asked the state Board of Dentistry
to keep Ward from treating children after families came forward to
say Ward broke the leg of a 5-year-old boy, the thumb of a
10-year-old girl and the wrist of a 4-year-old girl over the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also left a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old with bumps and
bruises after holding the children down forcefully in 1999, state
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the board referred the charges at Ward's request to
the Office of Administrative Law, which will schedule hearings on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ward filed court papers Monday denying charges he had covered
the mouths and noses of patients and pushed down on patients'
chests with his fist to restrain them.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has restrained unruly, uncooperative children, but
followed guidelines set by the American Academy of Pediatric
Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines state that ''partial or complete immobilization
of the patient sometimes is necessary'' but says that a doctor has
to obtain a parent's consent before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's patients have said that he never allowed parents in the
treatment room.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has treated more than 50,000 children, mostly Medicaid
patients, in the past seven years, and most have had no complaints,
said Ward's attorney, John Dizzia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Ward has devoted his practice to caring for children,''
Dizzia said Monday. ''This is a handful of cases'' before the
board, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is being sued by the parents of 5-year-old Mario Rivero, who
is in a chest-high cast and does not expect to walk for months
after his leg was broken in Ward's office on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Rivero's father, Mario, said that Ward told him he pressed down
on Rivero's leg after the child kicked him, then continued working
on his teeth after he heard the bone snap.
</P>
<P>
   Ward suggested to the boy's mother, Yeni Rivero, that the boy
see a doctor after depositing him in a chair in the waiting room,
Mario Rivero said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man had no sympathy; he had no expression. This man
didn't have any worries at all,'' Mario Rivero said.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces a lawsuit by the mother of Amanda Schwab, who
broke her wrist in Ward's office when the then 4-year-old came into
get a tooth pulled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has not been criminally charged with any of the incidents,
nor with the 1984 death of a 4-year-old boy who overdosed on
anesthesia under his care. The board suspended his license for a
year in 1987 but stayed it, meaning he was never barred from
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time he's not going to get away,'' Mario Rivero said
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Urge Thyroid Testing  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Feeling a little fatigued? A tad forgetful or
depressed? Put on a little weight lately?
</P>
<P>
   They sound like run-of-the-mill complaints, particularly if you
have a stressful job or are hitting middle-age.
</P>
<P>
   But those also are some of the frequently overlooked early
symptoms of thyroid disease -- and a new study estimates 13 million
Americans may be undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   That's a slightly higher estimate than previously thought, and
it comes as some specialists are urging that a simple $25 thyroid
test become a routine part of many adults' doctor visits even if
they don't complain of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Even mild thyroid problems might cause big consequences:
Pregnant women with an underactive thyroid risk having children
with lower IQs, and new research shows even a little hypothyroidism
can raise cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thyroid disease is easily treated if people know they have
it. How to find out: the TSH blood test.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get this message out,'' said Dr. E. Chester
Ridgway, the University of Colorado's endocrinology chief. ''We've
been trying for many years to get primary-care physicians to use
the TSH as a part of their screenings,'' but people don't realize
''it's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The bow tie-shaped gland in the front of your neck, just below
the Adam's apple, causes an amazing variety of health problems
because it produces hormones that regulate metabolism and stimulate
almost every type of tissue in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, it can become overactive and speed up
certain body functions, or become underactive and slow body
functions. Both cause a variety of symptoms once the disease
advances enough, what doctors call ''overt'' thyroid disease.
</P>
<P>
   An underactive thyroid -- hypothyroidism -- is by far the most
common problem. Symptoms are easily mistaken for other conditions:
fatigue, weight gain as metabolism slows, depression,
forgetfulness, a hoarse voice, mood swings, intolerance to cold.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of hyperthyroidism, an overactive gland, are usually
more clear: The heart beats fast, sometimes irregularly. Blood
pressure rises. Patients sweat easily, feel nervous, sleep poorly.
They lose weight without trying, become depressed and confused,
develop vision problems or bulging eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Either condition sometimes enlarges the thyroid, so the American
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends checking your
neck.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to feel a bump in your neck to have a thyroid
problem, stresses Dr. Terry Davies of New York's Mount Sinai School
of Medicine, editor of the journal Thyroid and a proponent of
better TSH testing.
</P>
<P>
   Overt thyroid disease raises people's risk of heart disease,
bone-thinning osteoporosis and infertility. The call for more
testing comes amid concern that mild, even asymptomatic, thyroid
failure could be risky.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway wrote a recent study in the Archives of Internal
Medicine that gave TSH tests to 25,000 people attending health
fairs in Colorado. Based on those results, he estimated some 13
million people nationwide may have undiagnosed thyroid disease,
mostly hypothyroidism.
</P>
<P>
   While thyroid failure is considered mainly a problem for older
women -- symptoms often are confused with menopause -- Ridgway found
the risk actually starts to rise in a woman's mid-30s, and that
older men have thyroid problems more often than suspected, too.
</P>
<P>
   Endocrinologists last year began pushing thyroid tests for
pregnant women, because a mother's underactive thyroid may impair
fetal brain development. One study estimated one in 50 women has
hypothyroidism during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, endocrinologists say new mothers suffering
postpartum depression need testing to see if thyroid failure is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway's other finding: Even mild thyroid failure caused
cholesterol to start rising. That supports a recent Dutch study
that concluded mild thyroid disease may be associated with heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A simple test to detect levels of ''thyroid stimulating
hormone,'' or TSH, in the bloodstream diagnoses thyroid disease.
The same blood sample used for cholesterol or any other routine
health test can be checked for TSH.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid problems are easily treated, with a daily pill or, for
hyperthyroidism, sometimes removing the gland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adults, on their annual physical exam, would benefit from a
TSH test,'' Ridgway advised. ''Particularly women over the age of
35 and anybody over the age of 50 should be screened.''
</P>
<P>
   The AACE will hold a symposium in May to encourage testing of
more women who are pregnant or trying to conceive.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare only pays for older Americans' TSH tests if they have
thyroid symptoms, something specialists want changed -- but Davies
and Ridgway stressed the test is cheap, often less than $25.

<HEADLINE> McCain backs Giuliani but says Clinton would be Senate 'star'  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- He's certainly not endorsing her, but Arizona
Sen. John McCain on Monday predicted that if Hillary Rodham Clinton
were elected to the Senate, she'd be a ''star'' in the tradition of
Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time in history a first lady has run,''
McCain told students at Columbia University. ''She would be a star
of the quality that has not been seen in the Senate since Bobby
Kennedy was elected senator from the state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us believe that in a scenario if (Vice President Al)
Gore lost and she is elected to the Senate, she'd be running for
the president of the United States,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that if elected she will serve her full term
and that she is not interested in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify his remarks about Clinton, McCain said, ''I
believe she'd be very liberal and I don't believe she'd be good for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, McCain campaigned in Manhattan for Clinton's
Republican rival for the Senate seat, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   He told the students Giuliani would bring ''credentials to the
Senate that are much needed and very sadly lacking. Giuliani
understands the challenges of a major city'' on issues like crime
and transportation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also made a joking reference to his and Giuliani's
reputations for belligerence, saying: ''I'm sure he and I would be
vying for Miss Congeniality.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the Clinton-Giuliani campaign would be ''the most
watched race'' in the country. ''In some respects it will
overshadow the presidential campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a student about Giuliani's handling of the police
killing of an unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond, McCain said:
''I believe Mayor Giuliani will be committed to reconciliation and
harmony here in the city. In your view and others, he probably has
not done well enough because I have heard similar comments to
yours. But I hope he will in the future repair that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also lauded Giuliani for turning the city around.
''When I came to the city 10 years ago I couldn't walk in the
street,'' he said. ''I couldn't go into Central Park. I couldn't
even ride in a cab without fear of somebody jerking open the door
and yanking me out.'' He said he was certain New York voters would
''give Giuliani credit for a dramatic and profound change which
nobody believed was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's visit to Columbia is part of a tour he's making to
campuses nationwide to counter political apathy among young people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stay involved!'' he urged the students. ''Hope's on the way.
You are the future of the country. Somewhere in this room are a
couple of senators and possibly a president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his failed presidential campaign was continuing as a
''crusade'' for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani endorsed Bush for president but maintained his
friendship with McCain.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Audra McDonald  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- She is a talented soprano whose name graces
marquees across the country, filling theaters with audiences eager
to hear her versions of old-time standards and new cutting-edge
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Audra McDonald is a diva.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think all singers are divas and that is definitely not
the case with me. I am so normal and boring,'' said McDonald.
''Your girl-next-door -- that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Tony Award winner packs and unpacks her own
suitcases, graciously thanks passers-by for their compliments, and
even picks up after her German shepherd-Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   But don't offer her any cheese.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at a Manhattan coffee shop, McDonald orders
a chicken salad without its accompanying cheese and double-checks
with the waitress to make sure the dressing is cheese-free.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to do cheese a lot, but it started to affect my voice,
so I stopped,'' McDonald explained. ''It's like chocolate, and I'll
cheat, but I can't do it when I'm working.''
</P>
<P>
   She also avoids talking on the phone and drinking alcohol when
she is preparing for shows and concerts. But doing Pilates and yoga
is good for her body, soul and voice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, 29, graduated from The Juilliard School for the
performing arts in 1993. She has built a resume of high-profile
Broadway roles, including ''Ragtime,'' ''Carousel'' and ''Marie
Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   She will perform in Atlanta, Boston and Washington, D.C., on the
second leg of her spring concert tour (April 25-May 14). She will
also appear in ''Sweeney Todd'' with the New York Philharmonic (May
1-7).
</P>
<P>
   In a complete change of pace, McDonald has the role of a
criminal psychologist in two upcoming episodes of NBC's ''Law and
Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic, non-singing role is ''a chance for me to stretch
and flex other muscles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald appeared in ABC's ''Annie'' and in the CBS movie
''Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' Both
programs were honored with Peabody awards for broadcast or cable
excellence this year.
</P>
<P>
   Her second solo CD, ''How Glory Goes'' (Nonesuch Records), was
released in February.
</P>
<P>
   1. Since you have an affinity with old-fashioned musicals, do
you think you were born a few decades too late?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald: Musicals were as popular, if not more popular, in the
1940s as action movies are now. Judy Garland was also in the Top 40
in the '40s. No such thing now, so in some ways, I think I was born
late. But sometimes I think that because of my color, I wouldn't
have the opportunities that I have now if I were born in the '40s,
so in some ways it's a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   2. Is there a role you'd really like to tackle?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald: There are certain revivals I would like to do. I'm
sort of on this kick that I'd like to do Eliza from 'My Fair Lady,'
and once I'm ready, I'd like to do Shakespeare. But I'd really,
really have to study up for that. And Bess of 'Porgy and Bess.'
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you have a dream place where you would really like to
perform?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald: (laughing) I want to do a concert in Bali. My music
director and I were joking that we need to get the Honolulu Opera
to sponsor our next concert. And Australia ... I'm really curious
about Australia.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you think musical talent is inherited?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald: I think that anyone can develop a musical talent. You
can learn to play the piano. ... I think with singing, it helps to
be born with some ability to sing, but any talent can be developed
or nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   5. When did you know that you had that natural ability?
</P>
<P>
   McDonald: I would sing really loud when I was a kid in church.
My parents figured out then that I could sing.

<HEADLINE> Phyllis Diller: I'm the Bionic Woman  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A year after it stopped not once but three
times, Phyllis Diller's heart is beating with the help of a
pacemaker planted in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I died three times. The heart actually stopped,'' Diller said
in an interview. ''I was in intensive care and it stopped and
stopped and stopped. The nurse had to give me mouth-to-mouth. I'm
OK now. I'm flaming, raging. I had that laser eye surgery and I
have a new hip. I'm the bionic woman!''
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever worry that she might die?
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't now. I have this damn pacemaker,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   The comic with the outrageous laugh doesn't intend to retire
just because she's approaching 83 and has faced down death. Her
five-day appearance at the Stardust Resort and Casino in Las Vegas
celebrates Diller's 45 years in show business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kicking up my heels. I'm back. I'm working my tail off,''
said Diller, who punctuates interviews with her trademark cackle --
''Aack! Aack! Aack! Aack!''
</P>
<P>
   Comedy has changed since Diller began working in nightspots
nearly a half-century ago. In those days, she talked about
marriage, the kids, the dog and domestic life.
</P>
<P>
   Female comics now seem to focus on vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like that. They get too clinical. If it's slimy, I
can't take it,'' she said. ''The ones I admire are clean, like Rita
Rudner, and some of the male comics like Tim Allen and Jerry
Seinfeld. Those are ones that will end up with their own shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, comedian Jerry Lewis criticized female comics, saying
the only ones he likes are Diller, Whoopi Goldberg and Elayne
Boosler.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he said was female comedians were baby-making machines,''
Diller said. ''He's not an easy person, you know. He's always on
the edge. That was very nice, and I appreciated it, but there are
some very funny ladies out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Diller just sit back and relax?
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, I can't stand it. How awful that would be. It would be
like looking at an old piece of machinery just sitting there. I
love being onstage. To hear those laughs. By now, with my material,
well, I really know what I'm doing. And I've got a built-in
audience. I walk out there and they know who I am and what I'm
doing. I'm the hairless wonder!
</P>
<P>
   ''Aack! Aack! Aack! Aack!''
</P>
<P>
   She passed the California driver's test recently -- but it wasn't
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a terrible time getting my license. They really look you
over after you turn 80, you know. When I couldn't see the eye
chart, that bothered them,'' she laughed. Laser eye surgery --
''where they put in a lens'' -- cured that.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-2-inch comic was a late bloomer in show business.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IRS Chief Lobbies for More Money  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service chief told
lawmakers Monday the tax agency needs a budget increase of nearly
10 percent to halt a steep decline in audits and continue
modernizing ancient IRS computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to both do the modernization and enforce the tax
law,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told a House Government
Reform subcommittee. ''We have half the number of audits we had
three years ago. We're really risking the entire tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS commissioner's appearance came one week before this
year's April 17 income tax filing deadline, a week the
Republican-led Congress traditionally use for symbol and substance.
This year will see a symbolic vote on scrapping the tax code and
serious consideration of a 10-year, $248 billion income tax cut for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is asking Congress for about $8.8 billion in fiscal 2001
-- an increase of $769 million over last year's budget. Some of it
is meant to hire almost 2,000 more people to beef up enforcement of
tax laws and improve service to taxpayers. The agency also wants
$119 million to continue the long-term task of replacing its
1960s-era main computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Without endorsing the budget request, Rep. Stephen Horn, the
subcommittee chairman, said lawmakers are concerned that
taxpayer-friendly reforms enacted in 1998 -- coupled with a reduced
IRS work force -- has contributed to a decline in enforcement. Horn,
R-Calif., said taxpayers now owe $231 billion in overdue taxes and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people are now concerned that the agency has become so
user-friendly that it isn't collecting enough of the tax money it
is owed,'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the IRS will collect a lot: Rossotti said net tax
collections should top $1.6 trillion this year. About 127 million
individual tax returns will be filed this year; as of April 2, the
agency had received about 70.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans rush to finish their returns, Republicans in
Congress plan to keep focused on cutting taxes and tax reform, two
of their signature issues. Highlights include:
</P>
<P>
   --Votes in the Senate on legislation cutting income taxes for
millions of married couples, including the 25 million who now pay
more than they would if single. The bill also would permanently
ensure that taxpayers could claim personal credits such as the
$500-a-child tax credit without running afoul of the complex
alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   --Another Senate vote on whether to debate a bill pushed by
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that would roll back 4.3 cents
of the federal per-gallon gas tax through the rest of the year. The
bill, which faces long odds, would suspend the entire 18.4-cent tax
if average prices topped $2 a gallon at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   --House consideration of legislation costing $2.1 billion over
five years that would expand taxpayer rights and give people new
breaks on IRS penalties and interest. The House also plans symbolic
votes on measures that would sunset the tax code in five years and
a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of
Congress to enact most tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   --Three days of hearings at the House Ways and Means Committee on
alternatives to the income tax, including a flat tax and a national
sales tax. The panel's chairman, Texas Republican Bill Archer, has
long advocated scrapping the income tax but is retiring before such
a major change could become law.
</P>
<P>
   --Senate Commerce Committee consideration of a bill to extend a
moratorium on new Internet taxes by five years, sponsored by the
panel's chairman, Arizona Republican John McCain. A federal
commission chaired by Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va., also will formally
present its majority report recommending that extension, as well as
repeal of the 3 percent telephone tax and a permanent ban on
Internet access taxes.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 162.50; Dow Up 110.76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with blue-chip
shares pulling the Dow Jones industrials higher and technology
shares slumping as investors wondered whether upcoming
first-quarter earnings reports will justify the high prices of tech
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 110.76 at
11,222.24. Financial shares led the advance after a Merrill Lynch
strategist recommended clients move some money from technology
stocks into financials. American Express rose 3 11/16 to 142} and
J.P. Morgan rose 4 3/16 to 134 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 162.50 at 4,283.95, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 2.75 to 1,513.60.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, still vulnerable after last week's wild
gyrations, were mixed. Microsoft fell 2} to 86 5/16, and Applied
Materials lost 4] to 110{ on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yahoo! lost 5 23/64 to 145 49/64 and BroadVision fell 8
11/16 to 47].
</P>
<P>
   Investors are waiting to see whether earnings reports for the
recently ended first quarter will show the rapid growth that
convinced many people to bid technology stocks to unprecedented
levels earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chip maker Motorola was scheduled to report earnings today, with
Advanced Micro Devices and Rambus to follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those stocks were mixed today. Advanced Micro Devices led the
group, rising } to 74~.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ''first-quarter earnings should be good and include
some positive surprises,'' said Gail Dudack, chief investment
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York. She said the biggest
surprises -- companies that easily exceed analysts' published
forecasts -- should come from the old-line energy and utility
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A similar vote of confidence came from Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch. McCabe told clients today they
should reduce their exposure to technology stocks in favor of
energy, financial and consumer issues.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont rose 3| to 58| and 3M rose 1 11/16 to 93 5/16, helping
pull the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris fell 1 7/16 to 21{. On Friday, a Florida jury
ruled that the company, along with other large cigarette makers,
must pay $6.9 million in compensatory damages to sick smokers.
Philip Morris has vowed to fight any punitive damages in the next
phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 571.16 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 13.63 to
529.36.

<HEADLINE> Family accuses Bronx cops of executing son  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bronx district attorney's office has
withheld evidence that police shot an unarmed man in the head at
point-blank range while he lay face down and helpless in a
stairwell, the victim's family claimed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They executed him,'' Juanita Young, mother of Malcolm
Ferguson, said at a news conference. ''Only they know the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, 23 -- labeled a ''serious criminal'' by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani -- was killed March 1 during a confrontation with narcotics
officers in a Bronx apartment building. His family demanded
District Attorney Robert Johnson make public the results of an
investigation it said will back allegations he was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed at the D.A.'s office for stonewalling here,''
said James Ferguson, the victim's father. ''I'm also disappointed
at the character assassination of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Johnson, Steven Reed, said the investigation is
ongoing. He refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The family -- which is planning a wrongful death lawsuit against
the city -- contended that a private forensics expert and
prosecutors had reached the same conclusion: that Ferguson was
killed by a shot fired from a gun pressed to his head. Citing the
controversial police slayings of Patrick Dorismond in March and
Amadou Diallo in February 1999, family attorney Andrew Miller also
charged the killing fits a deadly pattern of abuse against
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ferguson case, police ''were acting on the suspicion that
if several black men are congregating together, something bad must
be going on,'' he said. ''Clearly, these intrusive searches
targeting young black men must come to an end before another
tragedy occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say Ferguson, a parolee who was carrying heroin, was
killed after he and other drug suspects were stopped by members of
a plainclothes narcotics unit. When he broke away and tried to
flee, Officer Louis Rivera caught him in the stairwell; a struggle
ensued and the officer's 9 mm Smith &AMP; Wesson discharged once,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the shooting, authorities noted Ferguson was a
convicted drug dealer with at least nine prior arrests on his
record.

<HEADLINE> Lucas Goes Digital for Next Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Lucas is going digital to shoot much
of the next chapter of his ''Star Wars'' saga.
</P>
<P>
   After pioneering digital projection in movie theaters with
''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' last year, Lucas said
most of the live-action scenes for ''Episode II'' will be shot
using six digital, high-definition camcorders instead of film
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas made the decision after trial runs with a prototype camera
made by Sony and Panavision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tests have convinced me that the familiar look and feel of
motion picture film are fully present,'' Lucas said Sunday in a
message on his official ''Star Wars'' Web site. ''The picture
quality between the two is indistinguishable on the large screen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Episode II'' begins shooting in June in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Opening statements in trial of former top Wall Street executive  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An X-rated movie star was absent from court
Monday as a prosecutor opened the government's case by telling
jurors a former top Wall Street executive shared secret stock tips
with her during an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant U.S. attorney, Alex Young K. Oh, described Kathryn
Gannon only as a ''28-year-old blonde, an attractive woman who was
also a dancer and model'' and sometimes performed under the stage
name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking the extradition of Gannon from
Canada, of which she is a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on her resume were ordered by U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood, who rejected government arguments that her career
explained why James McDermott Jr. wanted to impress her with his
stock-knowledge prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of McDermott, the former chief executive officer at
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, sat behind him in court as Oh accused the
$4 million a year executive of living a dual life between 1997 and
1999 by engaging in the affair while seeming ''to be the master of
his universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh said McDermott supplemented Gannon's annual income of between
$50,000 and $100,000 with $80,000 in checks along with secret
information about six companies that allowed her to make large
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon then allegedly gave inside information to another man
with whom she was having an affair, Anthony P. Pomponio, who made
trades as well. Gannon and Pomponio made $170,000 on the illegal
stock trades over eight months, Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   After several references to the affairs, Oh told the jury she
was ''not bringing up the extramarital affairs to humiliate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Muller, a lawyer for McDermott, told the jury in his
opening statement that the charges against his client were false
while acknowledging the affair which he said began in 1996 and has
''humiliated him over time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is that relationship that has brought him to this courtroom
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client's innocence would be clear if the jury
scrutinized what McDermott said to Gannon and when he said it.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted they would conclude McDermott recommended companies
to Gannon that were well-known merger candidates because 1997 and
1998 were years when bank stocks were undergoing ''merger mania''
after deregulation by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Muller said McDermott made the recommendations to Gannon during
''thousands of opportunities, face to face or on the phone'' before
the stocks joined a list at McDermott's company that must be kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer revealed how close McDermott had become to
Gannon when he said there were more than 500 telephone calls
between them and more than 300 beeper pages in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   It would be absurd to think McDermott would risk his $4
million-a-year job, his 26-year marriage and his relationship with
his two teen-age daughters to feed her inside stock tips that she
made only $15,000 on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer noted that McDermott had enough extra cash that he
wrote her checks totaling nearly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a lawyer for Pomponio, said his client did not
belong in court on criminal charges, especially after he revealed
everything he knew to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
volunteered to help them.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami, Fla., are
all charged with conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Pomponio remain free on bail.

   Fed Tries To Modernize Check System
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today the central bank is trying to modernize its check-processing
system and is testing new electronic systems. He also noted,
however, that even in this Internet age, many people still cling to
paper checks for privacy considerations and also because of ''a
deep psychological connection between money and tangible wealth.''
Americans write some 68 billion checks a year, and Greenspan said
the number is expected to increase. He remarks were transmitted by
satellite to a meeting in Los Angeles of the National Automated
Clearinghouse Association, a financial industry consortium. He said
'' ... whatever innovations develop, the check will likely be with
us for many years.''

contractor have fallen behind rival Boeing Co. machinists, members
of Local 776 of the International Association of Machinists voted
1,392 to 275 on Sunday to go on strike. Their three-year contract

   Bumpy Road Slows Digital TV Rollout

   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The road to digital TV is filled with potholes
and little agreement on who is responsible for fixing them. TV
makers say broadcasters must create more content in the super-sharp
format, known as high-definition, to spur consumers to buy digital
sets. Broadcasters, meeting here this week for their annual
convention, say manufacturers must develop better digital TVs and
make them compatible with cable boxes. And both industries fear
that talk by some about changing digital standards could cause the
whole project to unravel. ''This is an evolution. It's not going to
happen overnight ...,'' warned Dick Wiley, a former Federal
Communications Commission chairman who headed a nine-year
government panel on digital TV.

Japan's Trade Ministry will contribute about two-thirds of the
$3.77 million to $4.71 million it will cost to test
fuel-cell-powered vehicles, said Keiichi Yumoto, an official in the
ministry's Natural Resources and Energy Agency. Yumoto said the aim
of the three-year project is to help decide which fuels are most
appropriate for use in Japan. fuels to be tested include methanol
and hydrogen, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 177.43; Dow Up 106.73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with blue-chip
shares pulling the Dow Jones industrials higher and technology
shares slumping as investors wondered whether upcoming
first-quarter earnings reports will justify the high prices of tech
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
was up 106.73 at 11,218.21. Financial shares led the advance after
a Merrill Lynch strategist recommended clients move some money from
technology stocks into financials. American Express rose 3 15/16 to
143 and J.P. Morgan rose 4 5/16 to 134 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 177.43 at 4,269.02, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 3.81 to 1,512.54.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, still vulnerable after last week's wild
gyrations, were mixed. Microsoft fell 2 7/16 to 86|, and Applied
Materials lost 8] to 106{ on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yahoo! lost 6[ to 145 and BroadVision fell 8 9/16 to 47{.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are waiting to see whether earnings reports for the
recently ended first quarter will show the rapid growth that
convinced many people to bid technology stocks to unprecedented
levels earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chip maker Motorola was scheduled to report earnings today, with
Advanced Micro Devices and Rambus to follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those stocks turned lower today after early gains.
Motorola fell 1 7/16 to 151 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ''first-quarter earnings should be good and include
some positive surprises,'' said Gail Dudack, chief investment
strategist at Warburg Dillon Read in New York. She said the biggest
surprises -- companies that easily exceed analysts' published
forecasts -- should come from the old-line energy and utility
industries.
</P>
<P>
   A similar vote of confidence came from Richard McCabe, chief
market analyst at Merrill Lynch. McCabe told clients today they
should reduce their exposure to technology stocks in favor of
energy, financial and consumer issues.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont rose 3 11/16 to 58 11/16 and 3M rose 1\ to 92~, helping
pull the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris fell 1 3/16 to 21}. On Friday, a Florida jury
ruled that the company, along with other large cigarette makers,
must pay $6.9 million in compensatory damages to sick smokers.
Philip Morris has vowed to fight any punitive damages in the next
phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 670.56 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 14.47 to
528.54.

<HEADLINE> Rates Fall at Treasury Bill Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $8.5 billion in three-month bills
at a discount rate of 5.680 percent, down from 5.710 percent last
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a
rate of 5.855 percent, down from 5.900 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the lowest since Feb. 28 when the bills
sold for 5.670 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since
March 6 when the rate was 5.825.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.844 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,856.40 and 6.117 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,704.00
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 6.17
percent last week from 6.30 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Depressed Catskills sees casino as its pot of gold  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) -- Gone for good are the days of the
big-time comics and crooners, but a casino could bring back
something the depressed Borscht Belt hasn't seen in decades: crowds
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs last week gave the St.
Regis Mohawk tribe permission to build a casino near an old race
track in the Catskill Mountains. It's now up to Gov. George Pataki
to decide whether to transfer 30 acres of land at the Monticello
Raceway to the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It better be a reality,'' said Elaine Streisfeld. ''If Pataki
doesn't give his signature to get the casino here, an atom bomb
might as well be dropped on Sullivan County. It won't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisfeld bought the Colonial Park Country Club when she moved
here from Brooklyn in 1945. Soon after she opened a trinket shop on
Monticello's Broadway, 90 miles northwest of New York City. It's
still in business, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ''Broadway in the summer, well, you couldn't find a space on the
sidewalk to walk on,'' she recalled. ''Stores stayed opened after
11 o'clock and business was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Streisfeld said she plans to pack up her tchotchkes and close
her store as soon as she can, even though a casino's pot of gold
may be closer to reality. She said it's just not worth trying to
hang on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just heartbreaking,'' said Cathleen Crumley-Doherty, 27,
who has worked for Streisfeld since high school. ''It's like this
county is cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumley-Doherty's family has lived in Sullivan County since the
1800s and has watched the area turn from beautiful farmlands and
orchards to a booming Jewish resort area. The boom went bust in
recent decades because better highways and air travel, and
gambling's spread to Atlantic City and elsewhere, lured away
vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the region's main roads, Route 52, is dotted with blank
or faded billboards, rotting, abandoned bungalow colonies and old
resorts and hotels now home to Hasidic Jews, Buddhists and Eastern
Ashrams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here because my roots are very important to me, but out of
Monticello High School's class of 1990, there are three of us left
living here,'' Crumley-Doherty said. She estimates that she
graduated with 200.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan County was once home to hundreds of hotels and over
1,000 bungalows, according to Streisfeld's husband, Stanley, who
was often given the job of picking up bands in New York City and
bringing them up to Monticello's hotels because he had a big 1953
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ''There had to be 1 million extra people here in the summer, and
now, there's two hotels standing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get the casino, the Concord could reopen and, oh, it
could be good again,'' Stanley Streisfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord, one of the Catskills' biggest and classiest hotels,
closed in November 1998. In March, Louis Cappelli, a Westchester
developer and big time Republican contributor who bought the
Concord and Grossingers, said he has plans to build a $500 million
year-round resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Concord opens and the casino's here, people will have
to drive down Broadway and they'll stop for a gift or an ice cream
like before,'' Mrs. Streisfeld said. ''Before, walking down
Broadway was a fun, exciting night out.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by the Oneida Indian Nation five years ago to put a
casino at the racetrack fell apart in the development stage. The
current proposal has been under review by the federal government
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Jaquie Leventoff, president of the Sullivan County Chamber of
Commerce, said it is the closet the county has come to getting a
Catskills casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cautiously optimistic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks want to build a 159,000-square foot complex with
table games, video lottery terminals, poker games and bingo.
Estimates are that 9 million people would visit the casino
annually, generating at least $500 million in yearly revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The project also would bring 3,000 new jobs and $80 million in
annual sales and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has told us time and time again that if it gets
to his desk, and the feds approve it, then he would approve it,''
Leventoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor was reviewing
the federal decision and gave no timetable on a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tribal council is quite confident'' of the governor's
approval, said Rowena General, spokeswoman for the St. Regis Mohawk
Tribe. ''All indications have been that he's supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventoff said that without gambling, Sullivan County will never
be on a level playing field with other resorts, such as Atlantic
City and Connecticut's Foxwoods Resort Casino, owned by the
Mashantucket Pequot Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hotels are competing for conventions with Atlantic City
and Foxwoods because of the gambling,'' Leventoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a New York state association of specialty advertising
and gift dealers -- a group that sells items with New York state
themes -- used to meet annually at the Concord and now holds its
convention in Atlantic City, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A New York state convention that's held in New Jersey. Figure
that out,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares slumped Monday, dragging down
the Nasdaq composite index as investors wondered whether
first-quarter earnings reports will justify their high prices. The
Dow industrials gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq, which remains vulnerable after
last week's steep swings, was down 211.79, or 4.8 percent, at
4,234.66 at late afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average was up
68.56 at 11,180.04.

<HEADLINE> Fed Tries To Modernize Check System  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, recognizing that
many Americans still cling to paper checks in the electronic age,
said Monday that the Federal Reserve is moving to modernize its
check processing system and is testing new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted in a speech to an industry group that, even in
the age of the Internet, many people still prefer paper checks
because of privacy concerns and ''a deep psychological connection
between money and tangible wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans write some 68 billion checks a year, and Greenspan
said the number is expected to increase. At the same time, industry
experiments are taking place with technologies such as electronic
money that don't require bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The average consumer is exceptionally conservative and
traditional when it comes to money, which has a profoundly
important role in day-to-day living,'' Greenspan said in his
address transmitted by satellite to a meeting in Los Angeles of the
National Automated Clearinghouse Association, a financial industry
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tampering with money has always had profoundly political
implications,'' Greenspan told the group. ''It took many
generations for people to feel comfortable accepting paper in lieu
of gold or silver. It is taking almost as long to convince them
that holding money and making payments in ephemeral electronic form
is as secure as using paper.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Greenspan said, there is the paradox of the
nation's systems for handling big payments, banking records and
securities transactions being electronic while consumer payments
still are made by currency and checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we look forward, the Federal Reserve recognizes that
whatever innovations develop, the check will likely be with us for
many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the central bank is testing new systems for electronic
presenting of checks, which include capturing and storing
electronic images of checks and allowing banks to make payment
decisions in real time by getting access to the images over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary pilot project in Montana, started last spring,
allows banks to use electronic pictures of checks so they don't
have to be physically carted from one location to another -- an
effort that could bring faster check clearing and fraud detection.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also is working to improve the efficiency of its check
clearing services, Greenspan said. The central bank, which has 43
check-processing offices across the country, also began a
nationwide computer modernization project last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be a mistake for the government to step in and
impose standards or regulations for electronic payments on the
banking industry, since ''only consumers and merchants will
ultimately determine what new products are successful in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Government intervention ''could really put a damper on new
technologies and innovations,'' he said. ''Consumers are ultimately
going to drive this.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A late erosion of technology and telecom gains
left European stocks mixed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, was up 0.53 points at
5,282.3 at 1600 GMT. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was up 22.7
points at 5,282.3.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell
4.3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 392.89, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50
Index fell 4.3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,042.5.
</P>
<P>
   The poor opening of the Nasdaq market in New York pulled down
gains in technology and telecom stocks. With a European Central
Bank interest rate decision and key U.S. data due later this week,
many analysts believe European investors are being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 36.5 points to 6,533.4. After
Nasdaq's early fall, technology stocks joined wide-based old
economy losses to drag the index down.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 5.25 points to 7,516 as
technology and telecom gains diminished in late trading. Deutsche
Telekom rose after reports that the flotation of its internet arm,
T-Online, was already oversubscribed. BMW also rose, after denying
weekend press claims the Quandt family, the main shareholder, was
on the verge of selling its stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris CAC-40 Index rose 56.86 points, or 0.9 percent, to
6,364.9. Its earlier tech and telecom gains were diluted after
Nasdaq's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's MIBtel Index finished 30 points down at 31405 after a
strong tech-based open as traders worried over Nasdaq's fall.
</P>

   Amsterdam's AEX Index closed up 0.69 points, or 0.1 percent at
672.

<HEADLINE> Cornell volunteers spend month sampling extraterrestrial cuisine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) --It took an out-of-this-world menu to make
Elizabeth Babcock Woodring pass up a taste of her wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   Woodring was among 16 volunteers at Cornell University who dined
exclusively on space food for 30 days as part of NASA-funded
project to develop extraterrestrial cuisine for future astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest part was not being able to eat what we wanted when
we wanted, like late at night,'' said Woodring, a laboratory
technician in plant science at Cornell who got married during the
study and had to freeze a piece of her wedding cake to eat later.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, the food was delicious, and I'm trying to make my
diet more like theirs,'' Woodring said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were under many constraints as they tried to develop
a diet for space travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The space food diet consisted primarily of vegan foods, no meat
or dairy products. The dishes, all previously tested in weekly
taste panels, were plant-based foods that had to be tasty,
nutritious and economical, said Jean Hunter, an associate professor
of agricultural and biological engineering who is heading the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The food also had to be low in salt -- because sodium from
recycled urine in a space colony would be bad for crops. Low in
iron -- for space adaptation. Not labor intensive -- astronauts' time
is at a premium. And sparing in their use of any ingredients
difficult to produce in a space colony.
</P>
<P>
   The menu also had to be derived from a very limited list of
crops, mainly wheat, rice, soybeans and other vegetables that can
be grown hydroponically in artificially lighted,
temperature-controlled space farms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fare for a typical day might include sweet potato pancakes and
scrambled tofu for breakfast, lentil loaf sandwiches or seitan
tacos for lunch, and carrot drumsticks and tabouli salad for dinner
with chocolate soy candy for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to find out if our space foods wear well and
maintain their appeal if consumed as a complete diet for 30 days,''
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, researchers analyzed acceptability ratings from the
participants and food consumption. Additionally, researchers
studied the physical and psychological side effects of the
low-salt, high-fiber diet by tracking body weight and daily
measures of health, well-being and mood, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants lost between 3 and 7 pounds on the monthlong diet,
probably because of its low sodium content, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Findings from the space-food diet study not only will help NASA
plan on how best to feed an extended space mission team but could
better inform the health care industry, said David Levitsky, a
nutritional sciences professor at Cornell who is collaborating in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have developed about 250 recipes ready for
space, he said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Grain Down on Crop Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures slumped Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid a spate of wet weather and generally
improved conditions for crops.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices fell more than 2 percent as a combination of
factors led to a big selloff. A weekend cold snap didn't produce
the crop damage that some had feared, soil moisture is steadily
improving, and investors were jockeying for position ahead of the
weekly supply-and-demand report due out Tuesday by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline was considered technically driven.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans tumbled after weekend showers in the Midwest provided
much-needed soil moisture for the eastern soybean belt. Additional
pressure came from forecasts for more showers Tuesday and again
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices also were lower because of the weekend rains.
</P>
<P>
   Recent precipitation has dissipated some of the concern that the
nation's leading crops could be badly hurt by the dry conditions
that have been prevalent in much of the Midwest since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery fell 6 cents to $2.65 a bushel; May corn
fell 2\ cents to $2.27 a bushel; July oats were unchanged at $1.19}
a bushel; May soybeans fell 6} cents to $5.32 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .02 cent to 69.12 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .50 cent to 84.50 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .40 cent to 74.40 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell the
limit 3 cents to 93.42 cents a pound.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares slumped today, pulling the
Nasdaq composite index down more than 250 points and proving that
the nervousness and volatility that shook Wall Street last week has
not left the market. Blue-chip stocks rose, however, as investors
sought their more stable and predictable returns.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite
index was down 258.27 at 4,188.18, its second largest point drop
ever. The increasingly volatile index has recorded nine of its 10
worst point drops since the start of the year, as well as nine of
its 10 biggest point gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 106.73 at 11,186.56.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Seeks E. German Secret Files  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl has asked to see the
files the East German spy agency kept on him, the office keeping
the archive said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The files compiled by the Stasi on Kohl and other Christian
Democratic officials have become the latest twist in the party's
financing scandal, with Kohl demanding that his files not be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal plaguing Kohl's Christian Democrats exploded after
he admitted accepting up to $1 million in donations from sources he
has refused to name. Some have speculated that the answer may be in
the files kept by the communist Stasi.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's lawyers have given the agency in charge of the files an
April 14 deadline to declare whether they will make the files
available, and if so, have threatened to take legal measures to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the agency keeping the files, however, has said the
law allows for publication of files kept on historical figures --
except for information relating to intimate life or health.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Monday report in the Tagesspiegel newspaper, the
Stasi files on Kohl stretch back to 1975 when he was governor of
Rhineland-Palatinate state. Later the Stasi even monitored
telephone calls from his official residence, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Kohl became chancellor in 1982, the Stasi compiled
up to 30 pages of files a week, the newspaper said. Some 30 of
Kohl's closest aides were also spied upon, including his office
manager Juliane Weber, with the Stasi concentrating on facts of an
internal and compromising nature.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman from the agency keeping the files said research of
the contents of Stasi telephone eavesdropping records was
incomplete, and that the files themselves were piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament investigators have said they can't use the files as
evidence because they were illegally obtained. However, some have
said they could be used to spark questions to witnesses. Kohl is
scheduled to testify in late June.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Chief Seeks To Seal Deal  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Viacom hopes to complete its merger with CBS
this month without having to shed the UPN network and will continue
to push for greater relaxation of other limits on media ownership,
the company's chief said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The broadcast industry is very, very big,'' Viacom Chairman
Sumner Redstone said. ''It's an enormous business. We have
tremendous competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal awaits approval by the Justice Department and the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wrinkles the companies have been trying to iron out
is an FCC rule that forbids a company from owning two or more
networks in certain combinations. The combination of CBS and Viacom
-- which owns UPN -- would run afoul of that restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is currently evaluating the dual network ban and
other media ownership regulations as part of a mandated review.
Alternately, the companies could get a waiver to keep UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone said that keeping the fledgling network in the
Viacom-CBS fold is key for its survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no public service argument that could be made that
would warrant the death of UPN, which is just what would happen if
we don't get it,'' Redstone said. He said he hopes and expects they
will be able to keep UPN. ''If we keep it, it will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another regulation that prohibits one company from owning
stations that reach more than 35 percent of U.S. households is
outdated and doesn't reflect the changes in the industry, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to fight very hard for relief from the caps
because they just don't make any sense in the world in which we
live today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone thinks there is support in Washington for easing the
cap, but said he doesn't anticipate the rule will be changed before
Viacom closes its deal with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also is looking at whether to modify or keep as is the
national ownership cap as part of its media review.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote address to the industry group, Redstone reassured
broadcasters that they have the most valuable assets -- content and
brand name -- to enable them to succeed in a period of rapid change
in the media market.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a new media world, the advantage belongs to broadcasters,''
Redstone told the group. ''When it comes to technology, the
opportunities far exceed the threat ... because the content is and
will remain the driving force.''
</P>
<P>
   That same theme was echoed by NAB president Edward Fritts, who
told his membership that broadcasters' ties to the community and
audience share give them a huge strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   While high-tech companies have investors with money, ''they
don't have the eyes and ears that broadcasters can deliver,'' said
Fritts. ''What broadcasters must realize is that we what we deliver
is ever more important than how we deliver it.''

<HEADLINE> EU Toughens Myanmar Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- European Union foreign ministers on Monday
toughened sanctions against Myanmar, saying the country's military
government has intensified repression of civil and political
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the EU banned visits by Myanmar officials, withdrew
trade privileges and imposed an arms embargo on the nation, also
known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers on Monday added a ban on equipment ''that
might be used for repression'' and agreed to freeze funds held
abroad by members of Myanmar's military regime.
</P>
<P>
   The visa ban on traveling officials also was toughened by
listing specifically those members in Myanmar's military regime to
whom it applied, the ministers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministers ''reaffirmed the importance'' for good
relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- a
regional grouping that includes Myanmar -- and proposed a
ministerial meeting with ASEAN nations later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, high-level EU-ASEAN meetings have been
canceled because the ASEAN side refused to drop Myanmar from its
ranks to please the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, the EU ministers deplored ''the continuing
and intensified repression of civil and political rights (in
Myanmar) as well as the harsh conditions hindering the people's
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They again urged Myanmar s leaders ''to respect human rights,
restore democracy and engage in a dialogue with the opposition that
could lead to national reconciliation in a united and democratic
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU reviews its sanctions against Myanmar every six months.
The measures are designed to punish Myanmar military leaders for
not turning over power to a democratically elected government.

<HEADLINE> Gov't: Traffickers Behind Protests  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- The government accused cocaine
traffickers Monday of organizing weeklong demonstrations in Bolivia
by farmers and workers protesting rising prices and unemployment in
South America's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which have virtually shut down Cochabamba,
Bolivia's third largest city, continued Monday despite a security
crackdown that has left six dead and a ''state of siege'' decree
giving police a freer rein.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Ronald MacLean claimed the demonstrations
were led by drug traffickers trying to stop a government program to
eradicate production of coca leaf, used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ''These protests are a conspiracy financed by cocaine
trafficking looking for pretexts to carry out subversive
activities,'' MacLean said. ''It is impossible for so many farmers
to spontaneously move on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean said President Hugo Banzer is worried because
''political groups and traffickers are instigating farmers to
confront the army.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizers of the protests is Evo Morales, leader of
the country's coca leaf producers, who strongly oppose the
government's campaign to replace coca leaf crops with others, such
as cotton and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of coca leaf production has deprived thousands
of peasants of their sole income.
</P>
<P>
   The marches began April 3 in Cochabamba, a city of 500,000
located 350 miles east of La Paz. It has since been paralyzed and
isolated by road blocks, marches and clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochabamba protests were prompted by a 20 percent increase
in city water rates, and demonstrations quickly spread to other
cities with thousands protesting unemployment and economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A ''state of siege'' decree passed Saturday suspended many
constitutional guarantees, allowing police to detain protest
leaders without a warrant, restricting travel and political
activity and establishing a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   Six people have been killed and scores wounded in clashes around
the country as the government sent thousands of army soldiers into
city streets and urban roads to try put down the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of farmers and city dwellers continued marches
and rallies Monday. Protesters manned roadblocks near the Andean
towns of Achacachi and Batallas, where one army officer and two
farmers were killed and dozens injured on Sunday. The army cleared
the block in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are protesting because of higher gasoline and
transportation prices and a law that will charge us for the use of
water,'' said Felix Santos, a farmers' leader.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at rural public schools went on strike Monday demanding
salary increases and the end of the state of siege. Students fought
running skirmishes with police in La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of more than half of the country's coca leaf
production has left thousands of Quechua and Aymara Indian farmers
without a livelihood and depressed the economy in regions including
Cochabamba, where cocaine trafficking once thrived.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Go To Havana For Summit  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Dozens of leaders from the world's poor countries
began gathering Monday in Cuba to forge a common position demanding
a greater share of the world's power and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The first summit of the 133-nation ''Group of 77'' is expected
to call for debt relief, greater global attention to the needs of
the poor and possible structural changes in the United Nations
during its formal sessions on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process of globalization that we have witnessed in recent
years has exacerbated problems (of poor countries),'' said Arthur
Mbanefo of Nigeria, president of the Group of 77, during a weekend
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said the summit would aim to ''redefine North-South relations
with a view to assure that the South plays an active role in the
design of the world commercial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit ''is unmistakable proof that our countries want our
voice to be heard, that the interest of our countries, which are
the majority, be taken into account,'' said Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque told a news conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and summit officials estimated that more than 60 heads of
state or government would appear, along with scores of foreign
ministers and other senior officials. By Monday, 122 member
countries had sent delegations, as had 34 nonmember countries and
35 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Havana on Monday were Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong. Also expected
were U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and leaders of Indonesia,
South Africa, Cambodia, Venezuela and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi also might attend.
</P>
<P>
   The G-77 was created in 1964 by 77 developing nations and has
grown to 133 members as new countries have emerged with the end of
the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Perez Roque said, the gap between the richest
and poorest 20 percent of the world's people has grown from 30-1 to
82-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''How was this possible, that in these more than three decades
of development respectful of science and technology, of the
expansion of world commerce, the expansion of communications ...
that there is more poverty, more exclusion, that the breach between
the richest, which are the minority, and the poorest has expanded
dramatically?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the G-77 countries represent 80 percent of the earth's
population.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban minister said that nations of the South want a
dialogue with the North, ''but a serious discussion, without
impositions, between equals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting will, with all seriousness, proclaim the point of
view of the countries of the South that a reconsideration of the
current rules of the game is necessary. The current situation is
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   He said the resolutions could form the basis for a common front
at a ''Millennium Summit'' of world leaders at the United Nations
in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, N.J. (AP) -- The head of safety for Spirit Airlines
defended the company Monday following back-to-back incidents in
which jets were forced to return to Atlantic City International
Airport after takeoff because of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disturbed, as we always are when we have any kind of
problem. However, the crews handled them both very professionally.
We're happy with that. Nobody was hurt,'' said Robert Moreland,
vice president of safety for the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,-based
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   He said no passenger has ever been injured on a Spirit flight.
The discount carrier, which flies to resorts in South Carolina and
Florida, began flying in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Flight 303 to Orlando turned around within 20 minutes
of its departure when passengers and crew reported smelling smoke.
The DC-9 aircraft, with 109 people aboard, landed safely and no
fire was detected. Four hours later, the passengers boarded another
Spirit plane and made the flight to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   A bearing problem in the plane's air-recycling unit caused the
unit to overheat, emitting the burning smell, according to Moreland
and Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Flight 541 to Myrtle Beach, S.C., suffered the
failure of its primary engine as it lifted off from Atlantic City
International.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers reported hearing an explosion. ''At first, I assumed
it was the landing gear lifting up,'' Jeff West, 36, of Edgewater
Park, told The Press of Atlantic City. ''But then I knew that
wasn't it. I turned to my buddy and said, 'That's a noise I never
heard before.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane, with 148 people aboard, returned to the airport on
the strength of the second engine within 20 minutes and landed
without incident. But the engine problem apparently sparked a brush
fire near the runway as it took off. It was extinguished, said
Peter Hartt, a spokesman for the South Jersey Transportation
Authority, which operates the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident, a turbine lost one or more blades, knocking it
out of balance and forcing the pilot to shut it down, Moreland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salac said the FAA would look into the second incident to
determine whether there was some ''systemic'' problem with thet
Pratt Whitney JT8D-217 engine.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the FAA was treating the incidents as unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a coincidence that they happened one day after the next.
If you look at one incident and the other, they're not related at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirit gave passengers on the Friday flight vouchers for a free
round-trip anywhere in the airline's system, Moreland said. Those
on board the second returned flight got a $100 coupon for use
against a future flight, he said.

<HEADLINE> 24-Hour Pubs Proposed in Britain  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Hoping to cut down on binge drinking and pub
brawls, the British government proposed a novel idea Monday: Allow
bars to stay open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapping the mandatory 11 p.m. closing time was the centerpiece
of plans to liberalize and streamline licensing laws that were
inspired by fears of munitions workers getting drunk during World
War I.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fixed closing times encourage binge drinking around last
orders,'' Home Secretary Jack Straw told the House of Commons.
''The result is lots of people hitting the streets -- and sometimes
each other -- at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the government proposals, released as a discussion paper,
any pub, licensed cafe or restaurant can apply to stay open for 24
hours, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   While some U.S. cities and towns are moving toward earlier bar
closings to combat heavy drinking, in Britain, the bureaucrats,
police and bartenders all believe that longer hours -- allowing for
staggered closing times -- will reduce binge drinking and
alcohol-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   Children will also be allowed into pubs for the first time -- but
only to watch. Eighteen is the minimum legal age for buying
alcoholic drinks in a pub.
</P>
<P>
   Pub owners and many drinkers said cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a step in the right direction toward the repeal of
archaic laws set during wartime,'' said Mary Curnock, director of
the British Institute of Innkeeping which represents 16,500
licensees.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, police and pub keepers expect the 24-hour licenses
to be confined to the centers of London and other big cities, with
the main aim being to stagger closing times between 11 p.m. and 3
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, Ceri Garrett, landlady of the Baron of Beef pub,
has long pressed for change. Rowdy deadline drinkers recently
smashed an ornamental stained glass window at the inn beside the
River Cam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people down several pints just before closing time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As an experiment, bars across Britain were allowed to serve
alcohol around the clock on New Year's Eve and the night passed
peacefully, encouraging Straw's officials to go for a radical
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would affect 140,000 pubs, restaurants, hotels and
nightclubs in England and Wales. Scotland, which has different
drinking laws, already allows pubs in some areas to remain open
until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   British studies suggest that alcohol abuse contributes to 40
percent of violent crime, 78 percent of assaults and 88 percent of
criminal damage cases. A 1993 government survey found that 16
percent of all violent incidents happened in or near pubs or clubs;
a study the previous year found 47 percent of violent incidents
near pubs happen between 11 p.m. and midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which could be law by the summer of 2001, would
bring Britain into line with other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Parisian bars serve alcohol until the early hours, and some
clubs dispense drinks steadily until they close at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In many German cities, bars serve alcohol all night, and so do
some bars in the Spanish capital, Madrid. In Denmark, some pubs and
cafes lay on the liquor until 5 a.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a law passed in 1921-- in response to fears aroused
during World War I -- cut pub opening times from 19 to 10 hours on
weekdays, and five hours on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the government abolished a compulsory weekday afternoon
closure in pubs in England and Wales. But the 11 p.m. closing
remained, except for nightclubs which can serve alcohol up to 3
a.m.

<HEADLINE> Elian, Dad Reunion Taking Form  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Government-appointed psychiatrists met Elian
Gonzalez's Miami relatives today in the first of what Attorney
General Janet Reno called the final steps necessary to reunite the
boy with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family had made clear it was unhappy the psychiatrists
would not evaluate the 6-year-old boy during a meeting at Jackson
Memorial Hospital. They had considered skipping the 1:30 p.m.
meeting, but later indicated they would attend.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., however, the two psychiatrists, one psychologist and
officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service were
still waiting. INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the family of
Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, requested the meeting be
moved to Miami's Mercy Hospital so his ailing daughter,
Marisleysis, could attend and because he did not want to leave her
side.
</P>
<P>
   The agency agreed to the request, she said, and the meeting
began shortly after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Late this afternoon, the family filed their brief in their
appeal of a federal judge's ruling that affirmed the INS decision
to send Elian back to Cuba. They filed the brief a few minutes
before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a state court where the Miami relatives turned for a
last-ditch attempt at keeping Elian made it clear the relatives'
pleas had little legal merit. Circuit Judge Jennifer D. Bailey did
not issue a ruling but ordered the Miami relatives to file a brief
by Tuesday morning showing why she should hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a tone bordering on admonishment, she questioned their
approach to the case, citing their failure even to prove they
delivered a copy of their lawsuit against Juan Miguel Gonzalez to
him. She also said they have shown no evidence the child would be
harmed if returned to his father, and -- in a question punctuated by
underlines -- wondered how any ruling she issued could overrule the
INS decision.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home in Little Havana
said they realized the boy's time in Miami could be coming to an
end. They prayed for divine intervention, hoped for a last-minute
reprieve and promised to keep the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to get hot. Each hour that passes, the situation
becomes more difficult. And it changes by the minute,'' said
retiree Miguel Concheso, 54, a Miami Cuban who was one of about a
dozen people demonstrating at the house this morning. Crowds
typically grow as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators at the house have promised to form a human chain
to prevent the government from taking Elian. Ramon Saul Sanchez,
president of the Cuban-exile Democracy Movement, said he was
''planning to exercise whatever influence we have'' over
demonstrators to assure nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been consistently telling the people that we must
struggle for Elian to have his day in court,'' Sanchez said. ''But
that we must also understand that we have a duty to this community.
We have fought the battle, and what Elian is going to remember is
that these people here did not betray him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said today he planned to go to
Washington to ask Reno for a 30-day transition period to minimize
trauma to Elian. ''I'm going to ask her to be fair and make sure
this process is done gradually, away from the arms and the strong
hands of the Castro security apparatus,'' Carollo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said Reno had
agreed to meet at her office Tuesday with Carollo and Miami-Dade
Mayor Alex Penelas, who said earlier that his police would not help
remove Elian from Lazaro Gonzalez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Reno appointed the two psychiatrists and psychologist to meet
with the family and devise a smooth way to transfer Elian to his
father. The experts met briefly Sunday in Washington with the
father, who came from Havana on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez wanted the meeting moved to Miami's Mercy
Hospital because he considered it important that Marisleysis
Gonzalez, who has become a mother figure to Elian since the boy was
found at sea in November, attend. The government had suggested that
the discussion go on without Marisleysis and offered her a separate
meeting later.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said Marisleysis, who has been hospitalized several
times in recent weeks for exhaustion, was in stable condition today
at Mercy. He said she had left the hospital too early the last time
she was there.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives criticized the government's plan to bring in
psychiatrists without having them evaluate Elian directly. They
said if such an examination was conducted it would conclude that
Elian should not be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public perception is the evaluation is for the best
interest of the child,'' Dr. Carlos Gonzalez, one of the family's
psychiatrists, told reporters outside the house Sunday night. ''In
actuality, it's a consultation for the INS on how to effect the
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said today it was simply devising a way
to keep Elian safe in a potentially volatile environment. ''We
would hope that we would be able to set up something so that Elian
will not have to be carried through a throng of people in Miami,''
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said on CBS' ''The Early
Show.''

<HEADLINE> U.K. To Free Up Car Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British government promised Monday to free up
this country's car market to increased competition after an
official report showed that Britons pay at least 10 percent more
for cars on average than their counterparts in the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Leading car manufacturers have benefited from a ''complex
monopoly situation,'' which has contributed to higher prices and
runs against the public interest, the Competition Commission said
in a long-awaited study released earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report confirms what many people have thought was the case
-- that in Britain we are paying over the odds for new cars,'' said
Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that car prices in Britain were 10-12 percent
higher than elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease retail prices, Byers said he would insist that
manufacturers offer car dealerships the same discounts on bulk
purchases currently given to rental companies and other large
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers' Association, which has led the fight against what
it describes as a ''rip-off'' of car buyers, said it was pleased
that the government was taking action.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticized 17 car companies that together accounted
for 94 percent of new cars registered in Britain last year. Among
them were the British subsidiaries of industry leaders such as
DaimlerChrysler, Volkswagen, Citroen, Renault, Fiat, Ford, Honda
and Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said these companies operated selective and
exclusive distribution systems that contributed to a misleading
environment in which consumers often ended up overpaying for new
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Retail customers typically obtained discounts of 7 percent to 8
percent off the price of a new car in 1997-98, according to the
commission's report. In contrast, the study found that fleet
operators obtained discounts of 17-35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes that Byers proposed were measures to ensure
that car dealers be free to advertise their vehicles at any price
without fear that suppliers might penalize them.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers and dealers have until May 19 to comment on the
planned changes.

<HEADLINE> African Women Targeted in Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Discrimination against women remains the
law of the land in Africa, and generally the law on the books as
well, activists said Monday ahead of a continentwide campaign for
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of possible targets for Africa's women's movement is
daunting: northern Nigeria, which authorizes beating of wives short
of ''grievous injury;'' Ethiopia, which forbids prosecution of
rapists if they marry their victims; and age-old customs across the
continent that put power and property solely in the hands of men.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had a woman taken to court because she sold her cow to
pay school fees for her children while her husband was away -- her
husband's cow,'' said Beth Mugo, a Kenyan member of parliament.
''Convicted, by our own courts! It took all our (women) lawyers to
get her out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign starts Tuesday with lobbying trips to 14 African
embassies whose countries have laws that make women second-class
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based rights group Equality Now, which opened an Africa
office in the Kenyan capital on Monday, is aiding the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign drew some of the handful of women in power in
Africa, including a Ugandan member of Parliament and South Africa's
deputy defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   A key focus of the campaign: Convincing Africans, amid all the
continent's other problems, that it's time to take women's issues
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, even in countries whose leaders say they support
women's rights, said Winnie Byanyima, the Ugandan member of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the president of Uganda, he says he's the bus driver, and
he can't drive the bus so fast (because) the bus will collide if
women keep pushing him,'' Byanyima said. ''We think it's time for
the bus to speed up.''
</P>
<P>
   She spends much of her time trying to make arrangements for
women left homeless by clan-based male inheritance laws. New widows
are thrown off their land by their husband's brothers when he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ''My cousins, my aunties, my neighbors -- it's always
happening,'' Byanyima said.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, like some other countries, have seen some changes: Women
have some seats in Parliament set aside for them by a quota; they
also have a Women's Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reforms we want now are threatening male power. The easier
ones, we have,'' Byanyima said. ''The harder are now here.''

	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A Camden man was in jail Monday, a day after
he was arrested in the fatal stabbing of his brother during an
argument in the basement of their Denfield Street home, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Antone T. Watson, 38, was charged with murder and was being held
in Camden County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Antone Watson stabbed his brother, Vincent, 37, in
the chest with a knife at 1:50 a.m. Sunday. Vincent Watson ran
upstairs to the kitchen to get help from his mother, father and
brother, who were all home at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Watson was pronounced dead at Cooper Hospital-University
Medical Center about two hours later, according to the Camden
County Prosecutor's Office.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Holds Municipal Election  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Most Serbs and Croats backed
nationalist parties, but urban Muslims voted for moderates more
supportive of reconciliation, according to partial results Monday
of weekend municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Social Democrats, who favor working with Serbs
and Croats, won most Muslim-dominated major cities, in 25 percent
of Bosnia's municipalities in the results released by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures also showed the Serb Democratic Party, once
headed by war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic, winning the most
votes in the Serb half of Bosnia and the Croats voting also largely
for nationalists who led them during the 1992-95 war. The Croats
share their area with the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The grip of three nationalist parties is seen as the main
obstacle to its progress in Bosnia, where fighting ended under the
U.S.-brokered Dayton accords of November 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nine Serb municipalities in traditionally hard-line
eastern Bosnia, the Serb Democratic Party was leading in eight. The
runner-up there appeared to be the party of pro-western Prime
Minister Milorad Dodik.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials downplayed continued Serb and Croat support of
the nationalists who helped start the war, emphasizing the gains by
moderates in Muslim regions in the second postwar municipal
elections with a turnout estimated by international observers of 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Miller, the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, spoke of ''a new
age and a new era'' ushered in by the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But former Premier Haris Silajdzic, who heads one of the main
parties in Muslim-controlled areas, spoke of a ''negative result''
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   He said nationalist parties ''have been reaffirmed'' in areas
they control which are the places most of the refugees should
return to but won't.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult to ensure that people return to
municipalities in which the local government will remain for the
next four years in the hands of those parties that expelled them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats won in Sarajevo, the Tuzla area, the
eastern city of Gorazde and in Bihac to the northwest, results
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said although nationalists were the choice of
Bosnian Serbs and Croats, the Social Democrats' success in Muslim
areas creates a momentum for parliamentary and presidential
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite massive foreign investment, Bosnia's unemployment rate
is over 60 percent, and some 1.2 million people cannot return to
their prewar homes mainly because of their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Zlatko Lagumdzija, leader of the Social Democrats was upbeat
about his party's gains in Muslim areas. ''This is the biggest
political turn since (the) Dayton'' accords, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Putin To Meet British Queen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is to meet Queen
Elizabeth II when he visits London next week, a news agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and British sides have agreed in principle that
Putin's itinerary will include a visit to Buckingham Palace on
April 17, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is to meet with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook before meeting the queen, ITAR-Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
   In London, however, 10 Downing St. said the Tass report was
incorrect and that Prime Minister Tony Blair's office could not say
whether Putin would meet the queen. Details of the visit are yet to
be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at the Kremlin would not comment on the report. Queen
Elizabeth, who is distantly related to the Romanov imperial family,
visited Russia in 1994 and met with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin press service said on Monday that Putin will meet
with newly elected Japanese Prime Minster Yoshiro Mori in St.
Petersburg on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Mori became prime minister last Wednesday after his predecessor
Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke and slipped into a coma on April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi had been eager to negotiate a peace treaty with Russia. A
territorial dispute over Russian-controlled islands north of Japan
has blocked the two nations from signing a treaty at the end of
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 258.25; Dow Up 75.08  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares slumped Monday, pulling the
Nasdaq composite index down more than 250 points and proving that
the nervousness and volatility that shook Wall Street last week has
not left the market. Blue-chip stocks rose, however, as investors
sought their more stable and predictable returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite fell 258.25 to 4,188.20, its second largest
point drop ever. The increasingly volatile index has recorded nine
of its 10 worst point drops since the start of the year, as well as
nine of its 10 biggest point gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.08 to 11,186.56.
Financial shares led the advance after a Merrill Lynch strategist
recommended clients move some money from technology stocks into
financials. American Express gained 4[ to 143 3/16 and J.P. Morgan
rose 4 11/16 to 134 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators closed mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 fell 11.89 to 1,504.46.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks fell in a steady spiral as investors wondered
whether upcoming first-quarter earnings reports will justify the
high prices of tech issues. The selloff was a clear indication that
the weakness that gripped the sector last week has not run its
course, said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rebound we saw last Friday was just too quick,'' he said.

   Last week, Dwyer said, many investors hopped back into the

</P>
<P>
   Most of those stocks turned lower Monday after early gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamentals are terrific,'' Dwyer said. ''You can't
debate that. But a lot of that strength is priced into the stock
price already.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Motorola reported results that beat
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, many Wall Street strategists have reminded
clients that the strongest earnings growth this quarter is expected
not from the technology sector, but from the less heralded energy
sector. Oil companies are expected to reap the benefits of a spike
in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, widespread circulation of a research note from
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, helped draw
some investors away from technology and into Old Economy stocks.
McCabe told clients they should reduce their exposure to technology
stocks in favor of energy, financial and consumer issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a sector, I'm certainly not suggesting that tech is all
washed up,'' McCabe said in an interview. ''But now is a very good
time to do some housekeeping and get rid of the stocks that don't
have solid fundamentals. The super-exuberance of last year is
gone.''

<HEADLINE> Megan's mother, Senate president back amendment to put sex offenderdetails online  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Saying courts have restricted the law
bearing her daughter's name, Maureen Kanka joined lawmakers Monday
in calling for a constitutional amendment that would allow the
state to widely expand Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   First proposed by the Whitman administration last month, the
amendment will be introduced into the state Senate on May 4, giving
the Legislature time to pass it so voters can have their say in
November, said Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union.
</P>
<P>
   Although its text does not name the Internet, legislators said
the measure would give them the authority to pass other laws
specifically allowing details about sex offenders to be posted
online. Without the amendment, any measure to broaden the community
notifications allowed by Megan's Law will likely not meet judicial
approval, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt that the constitutional amendment and any
legislation that will follow will enable parents to have better
access to the information that will help them protect their
children,'' Kanka said at a news conference. ''I have no doubt the
parents in the state of New Jersey will support this.''
</P>
<P>
   Every state has some form of sex offender notification law and
roughly half have some access to that information electronically,
DiFrancesco said. Ten states allow law enforcement online access
while 19 have, or plan to have, that information open to the
general public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This amendment will bring our state into the 21st century,''
DiFrancesco said, adding that New Jersey would be the first state
to ''constitutionally guarantee its children protection from sexual
predators.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about who gets on the Internet list and how it will
present the information will be up to individual bills once the
amendment is passed, DiFrancesco said. The Assembly passed its
version of a bill to create an Internet registry last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kanka, now an activist for such public notification, says
parents in other states have learned of the presence of convicted
sex offenders through online registries. But state and federal
courts have so limited New Jersey's version of the law that such
notifications would be outlawed, Kanka said. The law was passed
after Megan Kanka was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a neighbor
with a record of sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just absolutely ridiculous. The original intent of the
law is not there,'' Kanka said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have criticized the amendment, saying it allows
the state to broadcast what courts have said is private information
about offenders. Lawyers also contend that the state amendment will
not protect Megan's Law from a federal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands after nearly six years of court review, Megan's Law
groups convicted sex offenders into three levels, based on the
perceived risk of reoffending that they present.
</P>
<P>
   For those labeled most at risk of committing another crime, the
law allows prosecutors to provide an offender's name, address and
photo to residents living in a carefully defined area. All
offenders are required to register with police once out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a federal court judge threatened to shut down the
notifications, claiming that private information about sex
offenders became widely public. Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.
revised the guidelines to require people who get the notices to
sign promises not to discuss the information.
</P>
<P>
   If the constitutional amendment is passed, that will sway the
federal courts, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The input of the public is very much a factor in a decision by
a federal judge,'' the Senate president said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Gov. Christie Whitman again offered her support
for the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey led the way in protecting its citizens from
potentially dangerous sex offenders when it adopted Megan's Law. It
is now time for us to use the latest technology to provide broader
access to sex offender information so the public can take
appropriate precautions,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Submits Proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- President Stipe Mesic presented an expert
team's proposal Monday on curtailing his authority, which would
still leave him with a key role in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic and Prime Minister Ivica Racan pledged in their election
campaigns earlier this year to reduce the wide-ranging presidential
powers that late President Franjo Tudjman used and abused to
install virtually one-man rule.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cabinet and Mesic appear to disagree on how many of the
president's current powers should be ceded to parliament, raising
tensions between Mesic and Racan.
</P>
<P>
   According to Croatian television, Mesic's team, composed of
former Constitutional Court justices and other legal experts,
suggested that the president remain supreme commander of the army,
participate in creating foreign policy and retain the right to
appoint the chiefs of secret services.
</P>
<P>
   According to the current constitution, the president can also
dissolve parliament, fire the prime minister and issue decrees with
the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet is believed to be drafting its own proposal of
constitutional changes, but its contents have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Once the legal changes are agreed upon, parliament will have to
adopt them with a two-thirds majority.

<HEADLINE> Margin-Debt Concerns Heightened  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Last week's harrowing stock market selloff
confirmed fears that the growing amount of debt held by investors
who borrow money to buy stock -- known as margin investing -- can
exacerbate a free falling market.
</P>
<P>
   But since stocks bounced back as quickly as they fell, little
sentiment exists for new regulations that might prevent another
domino effect of selling should a similar stock plunge occur in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, market analysts hope the attention focused on margin
debt in the wake of the turbulence will alert investors to the
perils of buying stock on credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The definition of speculation is when investors borrow money
to purchase overvalued stocks in the hope and prayer that those
same stocks will become more overvalued,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   If a big drop occurs, as it did last week, margin debt can
''turn a rational decline into something disorderly,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had purchased volatile Internet and other risky
high-technology stocks on margin needed to sell stock last week to
cover so-called margin calls when the stock market began to
plummet, which put additional pressure a sliding market.
</P>
<P>
   Margin debt has soared recently, jumping 50 percent in the last
six months, as investors have borrowed money to speculate on
volatile technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, total margin debt stood at $265.2 billion, up from
$176.4 billion at the end of August; and up from $151.5 billion a
year earlier. In February 1990, the figure stood at just $31.5
billion, according to Ned Davis Research, a Venice, Fla., market
data firm.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have fretted for months that widespread borrowing would
perpetuate a market slide when margin investors sold stock to pay
off their loans during a decline. Those concerns were realized last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the stocks that had gone up the most started going down
the most, those are the ones that triggered the margin calls,''
said Sam Burns, a research analyst at Ned Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Margin calls are issued by lenders, usually a stockbroker, who
want to ensure that the loans they make to investors are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Investors borrow money to buy stock in the hope that the stock
will increase in value. The stock purchased on margin is used as
collateral against the value of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock goes up, the investor can use the profits to pay
back the borrowed money plus interest charged by the lender.
</P>
<P>
   But if the stock price falls, thus lowering the value of the
lender's collateral, the lender can make what's known as a margin
call, which requires the borrower to put up more cash to ensure
that the loan is repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
   Margin calls are usually covered by selling the stock purchased
on margin, a dynamic that helped contribute to last week's sharp --
if brief -- selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scare, neither the New York Stock Exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market have immediate plans to make it harder for
investors to buy stock on credit. And officials at several major
brokerage firms said no further restrictions were planned to curb
margin investing.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board, which regulates margin borrowing,
currently requires investors to have at least $2,000 in a trading
account to buy on margin. In addition, investors are limited to
purchasing $2 of stock for every $1 in their account.
</P>
<P>
   Most major firms, acting independently last year, made it harder
to buy risky technology shares on margin by increasing the amount
of money investors needed to put up in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some are calling for an increase in so-called maintenance
accounts, or the amount of money an investor must keep in an
account to serve as collateral against stock bought on margin.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE and Nasdaq currently require that the portion of the
account held with the investor's own funds be no lower than 25
percent of the total value of the account. If it falls below that,
a margin call occurs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an investor buys $10,000 in stock, with $5,000
cash and $5,000 borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   A margin call could be expected if the value of the stock falls
below $6,666. The investor still owes $5,000, but his cash stake in
the overall portfolio has fallen below $1,666, or below 25 percent
of the total value of the account.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, a spokesman for online firm Datek, said Datek has no
plans to increase maintenance account requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said last week's selloff affected just a small percentage
of investors who have purchased stock on margin. ''Investing in the
markets has certain risks to begin with,'' Dunn said. ''When you
buy on margin, you add to that risk.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals court divided on porch search, sending case to SupremeCourt  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A controversial 1998 drug arrest in a
high-crime neighborhood of Trenton is on its way to the state
Supreme Court to test when police can bother a man sitting on his
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton police arrested Drew Johnson after spotting him stuffing
a bag into a hole on a porch where he was sitting. They found crack
cocaine in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Andrew Smithson threw out the evidence against
Johnson because he said police had no basis to bother and search
him since he was just sitting on his porch. Police were acting on
an anonymous tip that Johnson was dealing drugs but the judge said
they have to see suspicious activity for themselves first before
arresting or searching someone.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court on Monday upheld Smithson's ruling but the
court was divided 2-1. This means Mercer County prosecutor Daniel
Giaquinto has an automatic right to appeal the ruling to the state
Supreme Court, which spokeswoman Emily Hornaday said he will do.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson arrest touched on a tricky area of law when police
base their actions on anonymous tips, which courts have held can be
of limited reliability. Such tips must either be highly specific
about an offense or police must limit their use of the tip to begin
a surveillance, taking no action until they themselves witness
criminal or suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton police on patrol in a high-crime area received a tip
from an unidentified resident on the street that Johnson was
dealing drugs. They spotted Johnson sitting on his porch and
noticed that as Johnson saw them he moved a small bag by his side
to conceal it. The officers approached him, asked him to step away
and one of them retrieved the bag with the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Howard Keskin and Dorothea Wefing in a joint opinion
said, ''There was not enough in what the police saw, without more,
to establish the requisite basis for determining criminal activity
was afoot that would validate their conduct in securing defendant
or engaging in the search they undertook.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where the police only witnessed defendant's presence on the
porch and saw him place an object beside himself, there is no
adequate basis for the action they took,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Isaiah Steinberg in his dissent said the officer who
found the drugs ''believed defendant was attempting to conceal
narcotics, which was a reasonable assumption based on the totality
of the circumstances then known to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a divided state Supreme Court threw out a drug
conviction in Elizabeth when it found police acting on a tip from
an informant had failed to ascertain for themselves that criminal
activity was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Independent corroboration is necessary to ratify the
informant's veracity and the truthfulness of the tip,'' the court
majority said. But the vote was close with the court divided 4-3.
Chief Justice Deborah Poritz dissented, and two of the justices in
that four-vote majority, Alan Handler and Stewart Pollock, have
since retired.

<HEADLINE> Washington Post, AP Win Pulitzers  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Washington Post won three Pulitzer Prizes on
Monday, including the public service award for the second year in a
row. The Wall Street Journal took two honors, and The Associated
Press won for investigative reporting on the killing of civilians
by U.S. troops at the start of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's two daily newspapers each won a Pulitzer for their
coverage of the massacre at Columbine High School, which has come
to symbolize America's gun-violence epidemic. The staff of The
Denver Post won for breaking news reporting and the Denver Rocky
Mountain News photo staff won the spot news photography award.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Guzy, Michael Williamson and Lucian Perkins of The
Washington Post won the feature photography award for covering the
plight of the Kosovo refugees. The winning images included a
heartbreaking picture of a little boy being untangled from a barbed
wire fence he was trying to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post reporters won two other Pulitzers: in public
service for stories exposing neglect and abuse in local group homes
for the mentally retarded, and in the criticism category for Henry
Allen's writing about photography.
</P>
<P>
   The public service prize marks the first time in the history of
the award dating to 1918 that any paper has won that category twice
running. Last year the Post won for a series on reckless gunplay by
poorly trained police that showed that officers in the nation's
capital had shot and killed more people per capita in the 1990s
than any other large American police force.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winning stories forced officials to acknowledge the
conditions in the group homes and begin reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll think of it as a day The Washington Post set a small
stone down in the dirt of an unmarked grave,'' said reporter
Katherine Boo, the lead reporter on the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's two prizes came for national reporting
on U.S. defense spending and military deployment in the post-Cold
War era and for commentary for Paul Gigot's columns on politics and
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank President Clinton for doing so much for the
cause of political journalism,'' Gigot said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press won for uncovering the alleged killing by
U.S. troops of hundreds of civilians in the South Korean village of
No Gun Ri. In interviews with veterans and survivors, AP Special
Correspondent Charles J. Hanley, reporters Martha Mendoza and
Sang-hun Choe confirmed accounts of the mass shooting, which dates
to 1950, the first year of the Korean War. AP investigative
researcher Randy Herschaft collaborated on the project by combing
U.S. military archives for supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a tough, important story that required detective work
across 50 years and 10,000 miles,'' said AP's managing editor,
Jonathan Wolman. ''The reporters touched every base on two
continents and they share this achievement with our documents
specialist, Randy Herschaft, who pored through untold reams of
paper at the National Archives and the military centers.''
</P>
<P>
   The four AP staffers said in a statement: ''We feel the greater
tributes today belong to the U.S. Army veterans, men of conscience,
who helped us, and most of all to the Korean survivors who would
not let their quest for truth die.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice won the international reporting prize for Mark
Schoofs' series on the AIDS crisis in Africa. The paper, an
alternative weekly that's distributed free in Manhattan and has won
two previous Pulitzers, is best known for cutting-edge coverage of
the arts and local issues like police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean, look, it's the Village Voice, and it won for
international affairs,'' said Schoofs, who got malaria while
reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   The award for explanatory reporting went to Eric Newhouse of the
Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune for stories on alcohol abuse and the
problems it causes locally from cradle to grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see all the manifestations of it in crime and accident
reports, hospitals, domestic abuse,'' Newhouse said. ''It seemed to
us important to tie together all of these aspects and show our
readers how significant this problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Great Falls paper's first Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   George Dohrmann of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press won for
beat reporting for stories about academic fraud in the University
of Minnesota men's basketball program. The paper persisted in
running the stories despite negative reaction from readers.
</P>
<P>
   The award for feature writing went to the Los Angeles Times for
J.R. Moehringer's portrait of Gee's Bend, an isolated Alabama river
community populated by descendants of slaves. Moehringer looked at
how the community would be changed by a proposed ferry to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The award for editorial writing went to John C. Bersia of The
Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel for his editorials against predatory
lending practices in the state. Joel Pett of the Lexington (Ky.)
Herald-Leader won for editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer drama award was won by Donald Margulies for his
off-Broadway play ''Dinner With Friends.'' The music award went to
composer Lewis Spratlan for ''Life is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts:
Act Two, Concert Version.'' C.K. Williams won for poetry for
''Repair.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Kennedy won the history prize for his account of
America from the Great Depression through World War II, ''Freedom
from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45.''
Stacy Schiff won the biography prize for ''Vera (Mrs. Vladimir
Nabokov).'' The general nonfiction prize went to John W. Dower for
''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II.'' The
fiction prize went to ''Interpreter of Maladies'' a collection of
short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner receives $5,000, except for the public service
award, which earns the winning paper a gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Bloodshed Predicted in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's attorney general ruled out
using police to oust black squatters from hundreds of white-owned
farms, saying Monday that doing so ''would be a match that would
ignite the country into a bloody conflagration.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more families fled their farms during the weekend. It was
the first time since the farm takeovers began in late February that
white farmers have moved into friends' homes in towns after being
confronted by squatters armed with axes, clubs, spears and guns.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer, Alex van Leenhoff, wept as he told neighbors that he
has no future in Zimbabwe after armed squatters forced him to sign
a paper saying he was giving them his nearly 1,000-acre tobacco
farm in Karoi, 125 miles northwest of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   In the 900 other occupied farms across the country, squatters
were usually encamped outside buildings, uneasily coexisting with
the farmers and their workers.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange in the High Court on Monday, an attorney for the
farmers accused President Robert Mugabe's administration of
ignoring the rights of white farmers, who own about a third of the
productive land in this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
   ''White people in this country are not entitled to the
protection of the law,'' said attorney Adrian de Bourbon, his voice
quavering. De Bourbon, who is white, said Mugabe's administration
has abandoned the rule of law by failing to heed court orders to
evict the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Patrick Chinamasa called the farm occupations a
just fight against unfair laws that allow some people to own more
land than others, and compared the takeovers to South Africa's
struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   De Bourbon dismissed the comparison, saying: ''We are not
talking about apartheid or an illegitimate government, but abuse by
the state of the supreme law of Zimbabwe: the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bourbon, who represents the 4,000 members of the Commercial
Farmers Union, whose membership is mostly white, asked Judge Moses
Chinenga to order the government to evict farm squatters. He is to
rule Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A March 17 court order instructing the government to evict the
squatters was ignored. And the attorney general indicated the
government has no plans to move against the squatters now.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, the land issue cannot be resolved by
court orders,'' Chinamasa said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in
1980, is allowing the land seizures to increase his waning support
among black voters ahead of parliamentary elections expected in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Chinamasa has said the nation's 20,000-member police force had
neither the manpower nor equipment to end the occupations of more
than 900 farms, and that the government would not deploy troops to
assist the police.

   He described the occupations as ''minor transgressions of
trespass'' laws and said the squatters, led by men claiming to be
veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war, would fight for the land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any successful operation would trigger a violent reaction
countrywide... It would be a match that would ignite the country
into a bloody conflagration,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several farmers were forced to sign over land to
occupiers who threatened them while police looked on, leaders of
the farmers said.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' union has urged white landowners to not retaliate
with physically or with firearms. There were more than 50 cases of
violence on members' farms in the past week, and intimidation and
death threats by squatters against farm workers were widespread,
the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said Friday that squatters would not be forced to
withdraw and that his government would fight farmers who resisted
the confiscation of farms, either by squatters or under a law
passed Thursday empowering his government to nationalize land
without paying compensation.

<HEADLINE> Gambian Police Kill 9 at Clash  </HEADLINE>
By DEMBA JAWO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJUL, Gambia (AP) -- Police opened fire on a student
demonstration Monday, killing at least nine people, including a
journalist in this West African city.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambia Students Union was denied a permit for the march
organized in protest against the recent death of a high school
student, who was allegedly tortured by security force members, and
the reported rape of a 13-year-old girl by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   When students gathered at the gate of the Gambia Technical
Training Institute to march to the city center, police ordered them
to disperse, then opened fire with tear gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The students scattered, but later regrouped, setting up
barricades with burning tires and throwing stones at the police.
Government buildings were attacked, a police station set on fire
and stores looted as unemployed youths joined in the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Police apparently used live ammunition to restore order, killing
at least eight students, morgue officials said. Many more were
injured, though hospital staff did not have exact figures.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Barrow, an International Committee of the Red Cross
volunteer and journalist with the private Sud FM radio station, was
hit by a stray bullet while trying to help injured students at Red
Cross headquarters, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a criminal act which should not go unpunished,'' said
human rights activist Ebrima Jallow.
</P>
<P>
   The government blamed student leaders for the rioting in a
statement issued Monday afternoon, and ordered the immediate
closure of all schools until further notice. Dozens of students
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Calm prevailed Monday night, as police and soldiers maintained a
heavy presence in the city's largely deserted streets.
</P>
<P>
   President Yahya Jammeh's government regularly harasses and
arrests opponents, including journalists and politicians. Jammeh
seized power in July 1994 and was elected to office two years later
in voting that was widely questioned by international observers and
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gambia, a sliver of a nation that follows along a river of the
same name, is surrounded by Senegal on Africa's western edge.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Barak Bleak on Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a call from President Clinton
amid faltering U.S. peace moves, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is making a hurried visit to Washington to plan for an orderly
retreat from Lebanon and for more territorial concessions to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Due to arrive at 3 a.m. Tuesday, Barak was to spend only 19
hours in the capital talking, in succession at Blair House, to
senior U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and presidential security adviser Sandy Berger. He then
will cross Pennsylvania Avenue for an hour with Clinton at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy shift rooted in reality, the administration is
beginning to cooperate with Israel on arranging a withdrawal of
Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by a friendly Lebanese militia, the troops have
shielded villages in northern Israel from rocket attack by
Hezbollah guerrillas backed by Iran and Syria. The United States
was unable to negotiate an agreement to curb increasingly deadly
guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers, however, and Barak, mindful
of the toll's impact on the Israeli public, has decided to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel had hoped the retreat could be part
of an overall agreement with Syria and Lebanon, one that presumably
would have guaranteed the border's safety.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S.-hosted talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke down in
mid-January, and the Clinton administration decided only recently
to go along with and to facilitate a unilateral Israeli retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is unlikely to have good news for Barak on the Syrian
front Tuesday. The president was unable to resume the sidetracked
negotiations in a head-to-head meeting with Syrian President Hafez
Assad in Geneva last month.
</P>
<P>
   And, Albright said Monday, ''there is not much give'' in
subsequent Syrian communciations. ''But I do think it's important
they've responded,'' she told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, State Department spokesman James p. Rubin said ''we
have not heard anything... that we believe could address seriously
the remaining gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barak has offered to relinquish virtually all of another
strategic buffer area, the Golan Heights, he is trying to hold on
to some patches of land to protect the Sea of Galilee, Israel's
precious water reserve. But Assad wants all land Syria lost to
Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Embassy spokesman Mark Regev said ''we have not
closed the door, but obviously we are not optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian front is more promising for results. Negotiators
for Israel and the Palestine Authority are meeting in Bolling Air
Force Base in southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israel already ceded 40 percent of the West Bank and all of Gaza
to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Another chunk of land is
to be given up in June.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Syria's Assad, Arafat wants more -- virtually all of
the West Bank and part of Jerusalem for a state and a capital.
</P>
<P>
   And after Barak met on his way to Washington with President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa,
told reporters: ''The obstacles today are indeed serious.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Arafat said Barak was wasting time and called the
prime minister ''the leader of the extremists'' in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has endorsed Palestinian ''aspirations'' and never
implemented a promise in his 1992 presidential campaign to
recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has a tight schedule. Chinese President Jiang Zemin is due
to begin Wednesday a first-ever visit by a Chinese head of state to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Israel and mammoth China established diplomatic relations
only eight years ago, but Israel's advanced technology is
attractive to Beijing and ties are developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for instance, plans to go ahead with a plan to mount an
advanced radar system on a Russian-made cargo airplane and sell it
to China despite an appeal from the Pentagon to cancel delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen tried to talk Israel out of the
contract, and Clinton or Berger might have a stab at it as well.
But Israel is not using U.S. equipment and has defended the
project.

<HEADLINE> American GI Person of the Century  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Monday declared the American GI
the ''person of the century,'' saying American soldiers, sailors,
airmen and Marines had led the struggle for freedom and democracy
from World War I to the NATO efforts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, introduced by Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C. passed
397-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more than fitting that the Congress of the United States
recognize our nation's men and women in uniform for their
contributions,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, top Democrat on
the Armed Service Committee. ''The American GI changed the course
of world history in helping defeat fascism and communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a region of the world whose people have not
benefited from the presence of the American GIs in the 20th
century,'' said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who served in the Army during the Vietnam War, also
sponsored a resolution, passed 399-0, honoring members of the Armed
Forces and federal civilians who served in Vietnam during America's
1961-1975 involvement in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, marking the 25th anniversary of America's
withdrawal from Vietnam, urges the nation to recognize the service
and sacrifice of the 3 million American military personnel who were
stationed in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This recognition is needed, said Rep. Steven Kuykendall,
R-Calif., a Marine during the Vietnam war, because ''our veterans
became an easy target for those who questioned our participation in
Vietnam and as a country we turned our back on them.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Leaders Negotiate Sale To China  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD ISRAEL AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- Israeli and U.S. officials
are negotiating the terms of an Israeli sale of military technology
to China that the United States has opposed, a senior Israeli
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking aboard a plane carrying Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to a meeting with President Clinton, acknowledged that
the Israeli sale of planes equipped with the PHALCON radar system
would be on the agenda as the Israeli technology is apparently
based in part on U.S. research.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked Barak to stop the sale of the planes
that some say could undermine stability in Asia and pose a threat
to Taiwan, a U.S. ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are talks on a professional level,'' between U.S. and
Israeli officials, said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ''We are not worried about U.S. pressure but we
understand U.S. sensitivities. The problem will work itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Barak has resisted U.S. pressure. Last week, he told
visiting Defense Secretary William Cohen that Israel was required
by contract to go through with the sale of the first
PHALCON-equipped plane, though he left open the possibility of
coordinating future deals with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Israel army radio reported Monday that Barak would propose a
compromise to Clinton. Under the plan, Israel would go ahead with
the sale of the first plane, an Ilyushin-50, but would indefinitely
postpone the sale of other aircraft, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report, Barak's office said in a statement:
''The issue will be discussed by officials from both sides, but a
decision on the matter has not yet been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is meeting Clinton principally to discuss ways of spurring
forward the sputtering Mideast peace process. He returns Wednesday
to greet Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Jerusalem who is coming
on a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the speaker of the Chinese parliament, Li
Peng, and Chinese Defense Minister Chi Hoatian have visited Israel.
Chi visited Israel Aircraft Industries, which is equipping the
Ilyushin plane with the PHALCON system.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with China poses a dilemma for Barak. On the one hand,
China is a lucrative market for Israel's struggling arms industry.
On the other hand, Israel is wary of alienating its most important
ally, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The respected Haaretz daily wrote in an editorial Monday that
Israel must not jeopardize its special relationship with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli interest is to maintain commercial relations with
China -- including military exports -- as long as such trade does not
harm American support for much more critical issues: the peace
process and compensation for the evacuation of territories that
results from that process,'' Haaretz wrote.

<HEADLINE> UN Opens Crime Conference in Vienna  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- From forced labor and prostitution to
smuggling drugs and arms, transnational crime is threatening
legitimate businesses and the stability of entire nations, U.N.
Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the 10th U.N. Conference on the Prevention of
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Frechette said it was more
important than ever to bring together governments, professional
crime fighters and other key players because of criminal
opportunities created by globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''If criminals are going global, those fighting them must also
launch a global effort and create effective networks of technical,
legal and judicial cooperation, or they will always be one step
behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frechette said the Vienna congress and treaties like the U.N.
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which delegates
will be focusing on during the week, ''are definitely steps in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   While globalization has had many positive effects, she said,
some people ''have jumped on the bandwagon of globalization to
create transnational criminal networks, and so to boost profits
from a wide range of illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To them, opening borders means it is easier to traffic in
women and children for forced labor and prostitution, to smuggle
drugs and arms, and to escape justice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Arlacchi, head of the U.N. Office for Drug Control and
Crime Prevention, said money-launderers in particular had managed
to take advantage of the digital revolution to hide their
ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money-laundering is by no means a new form of crime, but it
now thrives in a world of electronic banking,'' he said. ''Dirty
money should find no shelter anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The congress attended by some 2,000 government officials and
experts ends next Monday.

   PARIS (AP) -- The venerated Academie Francaise is on the warpath
again, this time deploring the decline of literature studies in
French high schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the watchdog of French language and culture released
a statement railing against a trend it says is on the verge of
wiping out literary appreciation in the land of Victor Hugo and
Moliere.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, the ancient languages were asphyxiated. One had
forgotten that they help to learn French. Today, language and
literature itself seem to have become the enemies we must
destroy,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of literature courses over the past two decades ''is
on the verge of completely eliminating knowledge and appreciation
of literature,'' the 40 members of the Academie, known as the
Immortals, said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Academie Francaise was founded by Cardinal Richelieu, Louis
XIII's influential finance minister, in 1635 not only to ''clean
out the garbage from the mouths of common folk'' but also to rein
in the nation's elite thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the elite body has been a ferocious defender of the
purity of the French language, decrying the creeping introduction
of Franglais, a mixture of French and English, and the invasion of
new English words from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest foray in the defense of literature is addressed to
President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and the
culture and education ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now possible to get as far as (a high school diploma)
without ever having read in full any of our great classics,'' the
sages bemoaned. ''It is to despair of schools to say that in
principal they are unable to initiate children and adults of
different origins into the pleasure of understanding our literary
masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academie said modern education methods were robbing teaching
of all content ''to the point where there no longer exists any
criteria of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ideological egalitarianism reinforces inequalities,'' the
Immortals said, arguing that students who really want to learn take
privileged and selective courses which are only available to richer
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a strange idea of citizenship to want it to be ignorant
of the meditation on man that has been the subject of our
literature during 1,000 years and continues to be today,'' the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Korean Summit Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration welcomed on Monday
a planned first-ever summit between North and South Korea but vowed
to keep U.S. forces on the peninsula whatever the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of getting peace and stability on the Korean
peninsula, this is a necessary step,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to get ahead of ourselves,'' she added. ''We
have to take this one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. troops have been in South Korea for a half-century,
currently 37,000 of them, and they are backed by mine fields
intended to stop authoritarian North Korea from attacking
U.S.-backed South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our standpoint, our deployment of forces and troops and
equipment in South Korea was justified by the historical situation
there,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ''That
remains our view.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not aware of any changes in those plans,'' the U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also voiced concern about North Korea's export of missiles
and missile technology, and said the United States planned further
talks with Pyongyang on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton praised the announced summit
between the leaders of North Korea and South Korea as ''testimony
in the wisdom and long-term vision'' of South Korean President Kim
Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement, congratulated Kim and the North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il for scheduling the first face-to-face meeting
since the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''Direct dialogue between the two Koreas is something we have
long advocated and is fundamental to solving the problems of the
Korean peninsula,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the scheduling of a meeting in June was important
and ''we are very pleased this is going to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rubin said a direct dialogue is ''central to the achievement
of peace and stability'' on the peninsula. He said South Korea's
engagement policy and a Japanese meeting with North Korea helped
open the door to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also said Michael Sheehan, the director of the State
Department's counter-terrorism office, had outlined for North
Korean officials what they must do to win removal from a list of
terrorism-supporting states.
</P>
<P>
   Among the requirements is a declaration that North Korea no
longer promotes terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the impoverished country is ineligible for
virtually all U.S. assistance so long as it is branded a terrorism
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin called the summit ''a history-making event,'' but said
''whether it will achieve history-making results is something that
I don't care to speculate on two months in advance.''

<HEADLINE> Florio campaign rips Corzine over Sudan investments  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The attacks became international Monday in
the Democratic primary campaign for U.S. Senate as former Gov. Jim
Florio's campaign accused opponent Jon Corzine of profiting on
slavery and civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Corzine is a beneficiary of slave oil, slave money, blood
money'' because of his role at Goldman Sachs when the investment
firm financed an oil venture in Sudan. The U.S. State Department
has condemned the Islamic government for its ties to terrorism, its
conduct of a civil war and its inaction on famine.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign refuted the charge in a news statement,
claiming that the financing of Talisman Energy of Canada provided
no direct benefit to the government of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign also issued a counterpunch, saying that
when Florio was a senior partner at the Mudge Rose law firm, it
represented the Philippine government and a trade association in
Columbia, two nations the Corzine campaign linked with child labor
and anti-union violence.
</P>
<P>
   Florio campaign aide Walter Fields did not deny the claims of
the Corzine campaign and said he had no specific response to it. He
said only that Florio invites scrutiny of his record against
Corzine's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will leave it up to the voters to decide which candidate is
more qualified and more able and better prepared to serve their
interests,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999. He
left the firm with a fortune estimated at $300 million, including
millions of shares in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Florio became a senior partner at Mudge Rose after losing in
1993 to Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said the attacks are justified because Corzine has made
an issue of his career at Goldman Sachs in helping the economy. He
said Talisman Energy has propped up the Sudanese government and was
the lynchpin of oil development there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a real contradiction in the public face of Jon Corzine
and the private face of Jon Corzine, first during his tenure at
Goldman Sachs and now as one the largest shareholders of that
company,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are going to ask the people of New Jersey to judge you
on your record at Goldman Sachs, if you are going to take credit
for creating jobs, then we want to talk about the entire record,
and this is part of the record,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Sudan in
1996 amid growing anti-U.S. sentiment and the Islamic government's
war against factions in the southern part of the desert nation.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey recently joined the list of states that have
withdrawn investments from Talisman Energy.
</P>
<P>
   In February, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
issued her most recent condemnation of Sudan, accusing its military
of a Feb. 8 bombing attack that killed 14 children at a Catholic
school in the Nuba Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine campaign in a news statement said the Goldman Sachs
deal to help finance Talisman Energy ''established a firewall to
make sure the proceeds from both transactions were not used for
anything related to the Sudan ... and was not used, and will not be
used, to fund the Sudan or any Sudanese entity.''

<HEADLINE> Pulitzer Prize Winners in Brief  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The 2000 Pulitzer Prizes for Arts:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRAMA
</P>
<P>
   Donald Margulies, ''Dinner With Friends''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Margulies, winner of the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for drama
for ''Dinner With Friends,'' has had a successful career
off-Broadway with many of those plays first done in nonprofit
theaters in New York and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinner With Friends'' tells the story of a seemingly happy
couple who question their relationship after their best friends
decide to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ''The play emerged out of a particular time in my life, a
mid-life reflection, on the pains of fidelity, friendship and
sexual passion,'' he said Monday. It has been running at the
Variety Arts Theater off-Broadway since November.
</P>
<P>
   His other plays include ''Collected Stories,'' ''Sight Unseen,''
''The Loman Family Picnic,'' ''What's Wrong With This Picture?' and
''Found a Peanut.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies, born Sept. 2, 1952, in Brooklyn, N.Y., graduated from
the State University of New York-Purchase with a degree in visual
arts. He lives in New Haven, Conn., and teaches playwriting at the
Yale School of Drama.
</P>
<P>
   FICTION
</P>
<P>
   Jhumpa Lahiri, ''Interpreter of Maladies''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors make Jhumpa Lahiri an unlikely winner of the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction: She's young (32), a first-time author
and a writer of short stories. But the New York City resident was
still honored Monday for her collection ''Interpreter of
Maladies,'' beating out National Book Award winner Ha Jin and past
Pulitzer winner Annie Proulx.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiri is a London native who grew up in Rhode Island and
majored in English at Barnard College. She's been writing since
childhood and has had an especially happy relationship with The New
Yorker, which has published her stories, named her one of the best
young American writers and gave her an award for best debut book.
Lahiri also recently won the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The nine stories in ''Interpreter of Maladies'' are set in both
India and the United States and center on people with Indian
backgrounds. The book, published as a paperback, has sold more than
40,000 copies, a high number for a collection of stories.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Spratlan, ''Life Is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts: Act Two,
Concert Version''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Spratlan, born Sept. 5, 1940, in Miami, has written for
orchestra, voice and piano, voice and instruments, chamber works,
choral pieces, ballet scores and one opera, ''Life Is a Dream,''
which won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for music.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 17th-century play by Pedro Calderon, it was
commissioned in the mid-1970s by the New Haven Opera Theater, which
went out of business before Spratlan finished it. The opera has
never been produced.
</P>
<P>
   The composer used a commission for the Boston new music group,
Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble, to prepare Act 2 of his opera for
performance in concert. It was performed twice in January.
</P>
<P>
   Spratlan hopes winning the Pulitzer will put a new spotlight on
''Life Is a Dream'' so that an opera company will produce it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to have the honor but that would be the real
significance of this prize,'' Spratlan said.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at Yale University, under Mel Powell and Gunther
Schuller. Spratlan taught at Penn State University before joining
the faculty of Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he was made
professor in 1980.
</P>
<P>

second book.
</P>
<P>
   A former senior editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster, Schiff was educated
at Phillips Academy and Williams College in Massachusetts.
''Saint-Exupery: A Biography,'' her first effort, was a Pulitzer
Prize finalist in 1995.
</P>

between Vera Nabokov and her husband, Vladimir, the celebrated
author of ''Lolita'' and ''Pale Fire.'' The book was published last
April by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who has written for The New Yorker, The Times Literary
Supplement and The New York Times Book Review, lives in New York
City and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   POETRY
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kenneth Williams, ''Repair''

<HEADLINE> Pulitzers for coverage of Columbine, Kosovo and No Gun Ri  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Columbine. Kosovo. No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   All these place-names have come to symbolize tragedy caused by
human violence, and all were the subjects of reportage or
photographs that won Pulitzer Prizes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press won in investigative reporting for
uncovering the alleged killing by U.S. troops of hundreds of
civilians in the South Korean village of No Gun Ri. In interviews
with veterans and survivors, AP Special Correspondent Charles J.
Hanley, reporters Martha Mendoza and Sang-hun Choe confirmed
accounts of the mass shooting, which dates to 1950, the first year
of the Korean War. AP investigative researcher Randy Herschaft
collaborated on the project by combing U.S. military archives for
supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the greater tributes today belong to the U.S. Army
veterans, men of conscience, who helped us, and most of all to the
Korean survivors who would not let their quest for truth die,'' the
four AP staffers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's two newspapers each won a Pulitzer for their coverage
of the massacre at Columbine High School, which has come to
symbolize America's gun-violence epidemic. The staff of The Denver
Post won for breaking news reporting and the Denver Rocky Mountain
News photo staff won the spot news photography award.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Guzy, Michael Williamson and Lucian Perkins of The
Washington Post won the feature photography award for covering the
plight of the Kosovo refugees. The winning images included a
heartbreaking picture of a little boy being untangled from a barbed
wire fence he was trying to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post reporters won two other Pulitzers: in public
service for stories exposing neglect and abuse in local group homes
for the mentally retarded, and in the criticism category for Henry
Allen's writing about photography.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post also won for public service last year, and
it was the first time in the history of the award dating to 1918
that any paper has won that category twice running.
</P>
<P>
   The winning public service stories, notably by Katherine Boo,
forced officials to acknowledge the conditions and begin reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll think of it as a day The Washington Post set a small
stone down in the dirt of an unmarked grave,'' Boo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal won in two categories, for national
reporting on U.S. defense spending and military deployment in the
post-Cold War era, and for commentary for Paul Gigot's columns on
politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank President Clinton for doing so much for the
cause of political journalism,'' Gigot said.
</P>
<P>
   The Village Voice won the international reporting prize for Mark
Schoofs' series on the AIDS crisis in Africa. The paper, an
alternative weekly distributed free in Manhattan and has won two
previous Pulitzers, is best known for cutting-edge coverage of the
arts and local issues like police brutality. ''I mean, look, it's
the Village Voice, and it won for international affairs!'' said
Schoofs, who got malaria while reporting the story.
</P>
<P>
   The award for explanatory reporting went to Eric Newhouse of the
Great Falls (Mont.) Tribune for stories on alcohol abuse and the
problems it causes locally from cradle to grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see all the manifestations of it in crime and accident
reports, hospitals, domestic abuse,'' Newhouse said. ''It seemed to
us important to tie together all of these aspects and show our
readers how significant this problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Great Falls paper's first Pulitzer ever. Although
Newhouse was the principal writer, the project involved work by
others from the staff of 38 people. ''This award is not to me; it's
to the entire newspaper,'' Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   George Dohrmann of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press won for
beat reporting for stories about academic fraud in the University
of Minnesota men's basketball program. The paper persisted in
running the stories despite negative reaction from readers.
</P>
<P>
   The award for feature writing went to the Los Angeles Times for
J.R. Moehringer's portrait of Gee's Bend, an isolated Alabama river
community populated by descendants of slaves. Moehringer looked at
how the community would be changed by a proposed ferry to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The award for editorial writing went to John C. Bersia of The
Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel for his editorials against predatory
lending practices in the state. Joel Pett of the Lexington (Ky.)
Herald-Leader won for editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer drama award was won by Donald Margulies for his
off-Broadway play ''Dinner With Friends.'' The music award went to
composer Lewis Spratlan for ''Life is a Dream, Opera in Three Acts:
Act Two, Concert Version.'' C.K. Williams won for poetry for
''Repair.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Kennedy won the history prize for his account of
America from the Great Depression through World War II, ''Freedom
from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45.''
Stacy Schiff won the biography prize for ''Vera (Mrs. Vladimir
Nabokov).'' The general nonfiction prize went to John W. Dower for
''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II.'' The
fiction prize went to ''Interpreter of Maladies'' a collection of
short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri.
</P>
<P>
   Each winning entry receives $5,000, except for the public
service award, which earns the winning paper a gold medal.

<HEADLINE> McCain Supporters Remaining Loyal  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. (AP) -- Cast adrift by John McCain's failed
candidacy, many of his supporters say they're unenthusiastic about
the remaining presidential candidates and in no hurry to side with
somebody new.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews from Missouri to New Jersey, McCain backers said
they admired his Vietnam War record and his promise to scrub the
political system.
</P>
<P>
   Many knew little else about the Arizona senator, but that hardly
mattered. He has become, in a sense, a political mirage dancing in
the eyes of voters thirsting for alternatives after the primaries
narrowed their major-party choices to Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't listen to Gore; he's too boring. I can't vote for
Bush; he's too shifty-eyed,'' said Karen Morley, a hospital
administrator eating lunch at a diner in the Detroit suburb of St.
Clair Shores. ''McCain has got to be better, but I'll probably end
up settling for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked McCain. He came across as honest and down to earth,''
said Clay Johnson of Joliet, Ill. ''I'm looking for that same trait
in the ones who are left.''
</P>
<P>
   After he left the race with seven primary victories, McCain's
supporters became a major target of both Gore and Bush. Mostly
independent-minded voters, McCain backers could be pivotal in what
is expected to be a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example:
</P>
<P>
   --A month after quitting, the Arizona senator scored about
one-fifth of the GOP primary vote in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
two key general election states.
</P>
<P>
   --McCain was favored more than Gore and Bush by voters who
describe themselves as uncommitted in a hypothetical matchup of
congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   --McCain still gets major news coverage, as when he campaigned
over the weekend for Rudolph Giuliani in the New York Senate race
and said in a speech at Columbia University on Monday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton would be a star in the Senate but is just too
liberal. Candidates nationwide are clamoring for his help this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months before the election, The Associated Press
interviewed self-described McCain backers in five states that
analysts say could determine the election: Illinois, Michigan,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Schumacher, 25, of St. Clair Shores was sitting on the ledge
of a cement planter outside a mall in Macomb County, a swath of
blue-collar Detroit suburbs that swing between Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates. She had purple-tinted
sunglasses, fingernails painted in 10 different shades and a
coffin-shaped purse.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was an original like me, I think,'' she said of McCain.
''He seemed to be his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain voters say they plan to take their time deciding on a
candidate. And many urged him to withhold his endorsement of the
fellow Republican Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would look like he's falling into the political scene,''
said Mike Wescott, 31, co-owner of the Goal Line bar in East
Stroudsburg, Pa. The bar is dimly lit, but every now and then a
customer walks in, bathing customers in sunlight and fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather see him work in the Senate and campaign for
other Republicans rather than standing there shaking hands with
Bush,'' Wescott said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the sentiment, McCain and Bush are tiptoeing toward a
reconciliation after their primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   A few self-described McCain supporters said they backed Ross
Perot or other third-party candidates in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Glenn, 42, a southern California sand sculptor, said McCain
''had a few glitches'' but won his support by promising to reform
campaign laws. Glenn's latest creation is a 10-foot tall Hollywood
scene -- movie star busts and film reels carved from wet sand piled
inside the Macomb County mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, I'll have to vote for the Reform Party or
otherwise throw away my vote,'' said Glenn, who has voted for
consumer advocate Ralph Nader in the past and may do so again. Few
voters mentioned Pat Buchanan, the former GOP candidate running for
the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic strategists are trying to determine
how to appeal to McCain voters, many of whom don't have a firm grip
on why they supported the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The excitement that John generated was related mostly to the
man he is, rather than any particular issue, so there are a lot of
disappointed people,'' said Republican Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Texas governor to take a page from McCain's
playbook and ''submit for America's consideration his own version
of campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler and New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman,
both Republicans and Bush supporters, said McCain voters are
opposed to the establishment and therefore aren't likely to side
with the vice president. ''They certainly don't embrace what we
have now'' in Washington, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Keller, 63, of Old Bridge, N.J., said she had had hoped
to vote for McCain because ''he was refreshing. He was something
different. He has ideas. The other guys are a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked her opinion of McCain's tax-cut plan, she replied, ''I
don't know what he had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   His opposition to abortion? ''I don't think I like him on
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What of his plans for Social Security? ''He didn't have a chance
to tell us about himself,'' she replied. A bag of doughnuts in
hand, she reached for the door of a bakery and said, ''Maybe that's
what we liked about him.''

<HEADLINE> Machinists Prepare for Strike  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Seeking reassurances about job security
and cost-of-living increases, about 2,500 machinists went on strike
Monday against Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co.
</P>
<P>
   The union rejected the company's latest offer Sunday and voted
to strike. Their three-year contract expired at midnight. No new
talks have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lane, president of Local 776 of the International
Association of Machinists, said the company's proposal included a
10 percent pay raise over three years and made changes in insurance
benefits but didn't address the union's concerns about job
security, cost-of-living adjustments and equality with plants doing
the same work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to stop the bleeding primarily, and the
company's offer puts us farther behind after three years than we
currently are,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is Lockheed's primary manufacturer of F-16 fighter
jets. The company planned to resume some stages of production
Tuesday, using non-union workers to complete production tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the negotiations, we did a survey of our salaried work
force to determine what skills they had that would be useful in
production,'' Joe Stout, the company's spokesman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stout said 200 to 300 salaried employees were identified as
having some production skills. He said the company expects to
deliver four F-16 fighter jets on time in April, even if the strike
continues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its work on the F-16, the Fort Worth operation is
the only Lockheed plant that produces part of the fuselage for the
F-22 fighter and parts for the Japanese F-2 fighter, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has made several major sales during the past two years,
most notably 80 planes to the United Arab Emirates, 50 each to
Israel and Greece, and 24 to Egypt. It is a finalist for several
other contracts, including sales to Norway and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has about 11,000 workers at the Fort Worth
plant. It took some of the non-striking employees more than two
hours to get into the gates Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said only five union members crossed the picket line and
reported to work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Chao, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, said the
impact of the strike depends on how long it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it lasts only three to four weeks they should be able to
get back on track in relatively short order. You shouldn't see it
show up in numbers,'' Chao said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, the union president, said the duration of the strike is in
the company's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the company wants to get right and get fair, we can settle
this today,'' he said. ''If they don't, I'm predicting that it is
going to be a fairly long strike. It could go into months.''
</P>
<P>
   The walkout is the third in the history of the 59-year-old
plant. Strikes also occurred in 1946 and 1984, with the last
walkout lasting two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed shares were up 6\ cents Monday at $21.12{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Can Be Extradited to Canada  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A court allowed on Monday the extradition of an
Israeli soldier to Canada to face murder charges, the first test of
a new law permitting Israeli citizens to be handed over for trial
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Daniel Weiz planned to appeal the decision to the
Supreme Court, but the 19-year-old soldier appeared willing to go
on trial in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter where I stand trial, I'll be found
innocent,'' Weiz told The Associated Press as he was led from the
courtroom in handcuffs and leg chains.
</P>
<P>
   Weiz is charged with second degree murder in the November
killing of Dimitri Baranovski, 15, in a Toronto park during a
scuffle over money and a pack of cigarettes. Two other teen-agers
are in custody in Canada, facing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Weiz has admitted that he was in the park but denied kicking and
stomping Baranovski to death. Weiz, who was in Toronto visiting his
father at the time, lives with his mother in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now Weiz has resisted returning to Canada for trial,
saying Israel is his home, and he wants to rejoin his army unit.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-page decision, Jerusalem District Court Judge Zvi
Cohen ruled there is enough evidence to warrant a trial, though
some of it is contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Nitzana Darshan-Leitner said she would appeal,
arguing that the evidence against Weiz is false and that he is
being framed by the other teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Irit Kohn replied that this is for the Canadian
courts to decide. Israel's judges need only consider whether there
is sufficient evidence and whether it was gathered properly, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Ronen, president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, welcomed
the ruling. He said it shows that Israel is not ''a refuge for
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Israel's new extradition law, an Israeli citizen can be
extradited for trial abroad if there is a promise that the citizen
would be returned to Israel to serve a sentence if convicted.
Canada has said it would agree to send Weiz back, if he was
convicted, and Cohen ruled that it was an adequate pledge.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first test of the law, which was amended last year
after Israel was embarrassed by the case of Maryland teen-ager
Samuel Sheinbein. He was charged with murder in Maryland but fled
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that Sheinbein was a citizen through his
father, though he never lived in Israel, and citizens could not be
extradited.
</P>
<P>
   After a plea bargain, Sheinbein is serving a 24-year sentence.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Addresses Taliban Women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The outside world cannot tolerate the mistreatment
of women by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia and must force it
to improve the situation, a U.N. investigator told the world
organization's main rights body Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. expert on violence against women
who visited the country last September, said any improvements fall
far short of what is needed for the Islamic army's government to be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community cannot tolerate the situation in
Afghanistan,'' the Sri Lankan expert told the 53-nation U.N. Human
Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''No regime anywhere in the world that treats women the Taliban
way should be allowed access to the community of nations,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many U.N. personnel on the ground cautioned me against being
too harsh, saying that things were gradually improving,'' said
Coomaraswamy, citing laws that allow girls aged 6-10 to attend
mosque schools, widows to tend fields and Red Cross hospitals to
treat women.
</P>
<P>
   But ''these are paltry, incremental changes and the agencies on
the ground are missing the wood for the trees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coomaraswamy attacked the Taliban's ministry of vice and virtue
for issuing ''the most inhuman edicts against women.''
</P>
<P>
   The department has authored edicts that ban women from working
or going to school, forced them to wear the all-encompassing burqa
and ordered people to paint first-floor windows black so passers by
could not see women inside.
</P>
<P>
   It also issued edicts saying women should travel outside their
home only when accompanied by a close male relative. Ministry
employees roam the streets of the capital, Kabul, looking for women
violating the edicts. Violators are publicly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though I do not advocate the cutting of humanitarian aid,
there is no doubt in my mind that all other mechanisms ... should
be used to stop what in feminist language would be called
large-scale, systematic femicide,'' Coomaraswamy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this is anything to do with Islam,'' but more
with tribal codes, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan. Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only countries to
recognize their government.

<HEADLINE> Ticket Arrest Prompts Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A day before the Boston Red Sox home opener, a
federal judge Monday ordered police not to arrest people who are
selling tickets outside Fenway Park at or below face value.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro ruled in the case of Gary A.
Lainer, a veterinarian who sued police. Lainer said he was trying
to resell an $18 ticket he had for face value last year when he was
arrested and manhandled by Boston officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means that ordinary citizens ... should be able to resell
tickets at face value or less without worrying about being arrested
by the police,'' said Bob Mendillo, Lainer's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Tauro granted Lainer's request for a preliminary injunction.
Mendillo said Lainer's lawsuit against the police and the city
would continue, with Lainer seeking to get class-action status and
seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they would comply with the decision while
considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, department officials also said they would
continue to arrest scalpers ''when the officer has probable cause
to believe that the suspect has attempted to unlawfully inflate the
ticket price.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Coverage Wins Pulitzers  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- There were a few cheers but mostly there were hugs
and tears in the newsrooms of Denver's two newspapers Monday as
their staffs were named Pulitzer Prize winners for their coverage
of the Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   At the Denver Rocky Mountain News, staff members held a moment
of silence for the victims who died when two students opened fire
in the school April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the hardest things about today is that 15 people died.
And it's just part of our jobs that all we can do is cover it,''
said John Temple, the newspaper's editor and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mountain News won the Pulitzer Prize in the breaking
news photography category for pictures taken after the attack. The
Denver Post won for breaking news reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four reporters, eight photographers and five artists --
nearly the entire Post staff -- were on the story the first day, and
many of the details they collected in the hours after the attack
came to figure prominently in the investigation of the deadliest
school shooting in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest prize in journalism, but because it's for
covering one of the most unimaginable tragedies, it's a shame,''
said Jeanette Chavez, the Post's managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   About three dozen journalists huddled around a speaker phone in
the Post newsroom to listen to the announcements, erupting in a
brief cheer when the newspaper's name was read. Gerald Grilly,
president and publisher, said the tragedy had taken an emotional
toll on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that you have to be recognized for a tragedy like
Columbine,'' Grilly said. ''But it shows you the role of newspapers
in getting information out to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subdued Rocky Mountain News newsroom, Photography Director
Janet Reeves said it was difficult to win an award for the
Columbine photographs, but it was an important milestone for
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's our job to tell the story the best way we can. I
hope the work we did helped explain to the world what happened here
and what they lost,'' said Reeves, who began her career as a photo
technician at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Ken Papaleo, who has worked for the paper for 20
years, recalled having to use auto focus to take photographs during
the funeral of slain student Matt Kechter because he was crying
during the service.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the newsroom, he said he was grateful that
editors respected his wish not to use some of the intimate images
he had captured of Kechter's grieving parents.
</P>
<P>
   Both newspapers plan to donate their $5,000 prizes to the HOPE
fund, which was established to rebuild Columbine's library, where
10 of the victims and the two gunmen died. The Post plans to donate
an additional $5,000 to the fund to match the prize.

<HEADLINE> Israel Pressing For Accounting of Jews  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Israel pressed Argentina on
Monday to investigate the disappearances of thousands of Jews
during the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Nawaf Massalha said he raised
the issue in talks here with Argentine President Fernando De la Rua
and would discuss it further in meetings with officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our government thinks that, as a country, we should press to
know what happened to them,'' Massalha told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 leftists and dissidents vanished after being
detained by the military junta's security forces, according to an
Argentine government report. Human rights groups say the figure is
closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who vanished, up to 2,000 were Jewish, Israel-based
Jewish groups say. Groups in Argentina estimate the number to be
approximately 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the disappeared say Jewish dissidents were regularly
singled out for especially cruel treatment during Argentina's
''dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Argentina's top junta leaders were sentenced to life in
prison after public trials found them guilty of human rights
abuses. De la Rua's predecessor, Carlos Menem, pardoned the top
junta leaders five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is home to some 300,000 Jews, the second largest
community in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Reporter Wins Pulitzer  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- As reporters at the Saint Paul Pioneer
Press were dousing Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter George Dohrmann
in champagne to celebrate his award Monday, the university where he
uncovered academic fraud in the men's basketball program was
imposing more sanctions on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dohrmann, 27, the lead reporter on the newspaper's series about
questionable practices in the University of Minnesota program,
wiped tears from his eyes as his colleagues broke into ''For he's a
jolly good fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''From when this first began, everybody was so good. When I
pitched the story, I was 25. They trusted me and just said 'go for
it.','' Dohrmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Dohrmann and his colleagues reported that a tutor did work for
student-athletes, athletes earned credits from classes they never
knew about, faculty were bullied by the basketball program staff
and the head coach told players to lie about the scope of the
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   The university spent seven months investigating before releasing
a 1,000-page report that concluded 34 of 50 allegations were true.
Twenty-eight of those involved at least one violation of National
Collegiate Athletic Association rules during nearly a decade when
Clem Haskins coached the team.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the school announced it will eliminate six
scholarships over four academic years; reduce official visits from
12 to eight for the next three academic years; reduce the number of
in-person recruiting contacts for prospective players; and cut the
number of coaches allowed to evaluate players off-campus during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The school also will return to the NCAA 90 percent of the money
it received from the Big Ten Conference from participating in the
1993-94, 1994-95 and 1996-97 NCAA basketball tournaments with
ineligible players.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the university had banned the team from postseason play
for one year and put itself on NCAA probation for an unspecified
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is still considering what sanctions to levy against the
university, which spent nearly $1.9 million on the basketball
probe.

<HEADLINE> Bush Edges Ahead of Gore in Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has pulled slightly
ahead of Vice President Al Gore in a new poll on the presidential
campaign released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the likely Republican nominee, had 50 percent support in
the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, compared to 41 percent for Gore, the
Democrats' likely choice.
</P>
<P>
   Eight percent had no opinion and 1 percent chose the category
''other.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 502 likely voters was taken April 7-9 and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier poll taken March 30-April 2 had Bush and Gore in a
statistical tie, with 46 percent support for the Texas governor and
45 percent support for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll on Saturday also showed the two in a
neck-and-neck race.
</P>
<P>
   In a hypothetical race with commentator Pat Buchanan as the
nominee of the Reform Party, Buchanan takes a tiny slice of voters
from Bush, who drops to 48 percent with Gore at 42 percent and
Buchanan with 4 percent support, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that a growing share of voters believe
Gore did not do anything illegal or unethical in his fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   About four in 10, or 41 percent, said Gore has not done anything
''seriously wrong.'' About one in four, or 27 percent, said he has
done ''something unethical, but not illegal,'' and 12 percent said
he has done ''something illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, the last time this question was asked, 33
percent said Gore hadn't done anything seriously wrong, 32 percent
said he did ''something unethical, but not illegal,'' and 21
percent said he had done ''something illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   On other subjects, the poll found:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sixty percent saying that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez should be
returned to Cuba to live with his father, and 31 percent saying the
boy should remain in the United States. The results are similar to
a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   -- Americans divided on the Microsoft case, in which a federal
judge said the computer software maker had engaged in
anticompetitive practices. Four in 10, or 41 percent, said they
side more with the judge, while about the same number, or 39
percent, side with Microsoft. Sixteen percent had no opinion and 4
percent were impartial.
</P>
<P>
   -- Response to the census should be high, at least if people are
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found 82 percent saying they returned the completed
form, while 14 percent said they planned to fill it out or already
have done so but hadn't returned it. According to the Census
Bureau, only about six in 10 Americans have returned their forms.
(This question was asked of 923 people who said they have received
census forms, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.)

   In the southern city of Nis on Monday night, more than 10,000

Novine newspaper, which was ordered last week to pay the equivalent
of $35,000 in a suit filed by the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Bandits,'' shouted the flag-waving crowd, demanding the
resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic and his neo-Communist
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Serbia's main opposition parties were at the
rally and condemned growing government pressure on independent
media and pledged unity ahead of municipal and federal elections in
the country, which are due by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the demonstration, Aleksandar Krstic, an official in the Nis
opposition-run municipal government, called on people to resist
government pressure and defend the newspaper in case government
officials arrive to confiscate equipment and other property for
nonpayment of the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the chief of Studio B, Dragan Kojadinovic said
his station will not pay the fine stemming from a third libel suit
by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We no longer want to take part in this judicial circus,'' said
Kojadinovic, referring to repeated fines against his station. ''The
government can now do whatever they want, but we will defend our
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio B, which is run by the opposition municipal government in
the capital Belgrade, has been fined several times this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a much criticized Serbian law, the media can be
sued and fined for carrying statements critical of the government.
Dozens of media have been fined in the past several months. But
Studio B's refusal to pay could lead to the confiscation of the
station's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Police Maj. Branko Djuric sued Studio B after the TV station
carried a statement by an opposition party alleging that the police
official was involved in an assassination attempt against the
party's leader, Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Serbia's minister of culture, Zeljko Simic,
filed a suit against the independent Vreme weekly for statements
published in an interview carried by the paper. Beta news agency
said that the court summons was plastered Monday evening on the
door of the Vreme offices in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The trial against Vreme will be held on Tuesday, Beta said.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Worker Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A veteran U.S. immigration officer was found
guilty Monday of smuggling marijuana and undocumented immigrants
into the United States by allowing vehicles to pass through his
inspection lane.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury deliberated for about two days before
announcing its verdict against Richard Lawrence Pineda, a senior
inspector now on administrative leave from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda was found guilty on 12 counts, including smuggling and
conspiracy but was found innocent of taking money for the cursory
inspections. He faces 10 years to life in prison at his sentencing
June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors characterized Pineda as a corrupt inspector who
betrayed the United States when he allowed 25 illegal immigrants in
six cars and 3,550 pounds of marijuana in four carloads to pass
through his lane at the San Ysidro Port of Entry over a 12-month
period.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office claimed Pineda earned at least
$350,000 in bribes, but there was no evidence of any large bank
deposits or large purchases to substantiate the charge.
</P>
<P>
   His defense lawyer argued that Pineda was inefficient and that
smugglers watching the busy port of entry that handles a total of
about 44,000 cars a day noticed his sloppy inspections and
deliberately sent vehicles to his lane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe he got set up and used and got taken advantage of
by a very sophisticated drug- and alien-smuggling organization,''
said his lawyer, Mark Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Annual airline quality survey finds things getting worse  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The airlines spent a lot of time last year
promising things would get better for their customers, but a new
study suggests just the opposite occurred: Consumer complaints more
than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see that consumers are just fed up, fed up with poor
service,'' Brent Bowen of the University of Nebraska at Omaha said
in announcing the survey results Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints were up 130 percent from 1998 to 1999, said
Dean Headley of Wichita State University. They rose from 1.08
complaints per 100,000 passengers in 1998 to 2.48 per 100,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Headley noted that improved Internet access made it easier to
file complaints, but said that could not account for such a large
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report, based on data collected by the Department of
Transportation, scores the air carriers on on-time performance,
baggage handling, consumer complaints and denied boardings.
</P>
<P>
   It found an overall decline in airline quality last year, with
only baggage handling showing a slight improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines instituted a consumer bill of rights in December,
after a year of pressure from Congress to improve service. A report
to Congress by the Transportation Department's inspector general on
how they are doing is scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who pressed for legislation last year,
said that if the upcoming report ''shows anything resembling what
this study shows, I think we can get a real passenger bill of
rights through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The report demonstrates that the airlines are not following
through on the voluntary program,'' he said. ''They, of course,
claim that it's early and they have just begun it ... but this is
an industry that again and again finds reasons to give passenger
service short shrift.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Cronan of the Air Transport Association, which represents
the major airlines, noted that the airlines' voluntary ''customer
first'' plan was not put into effect until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really would like to see the results next year when the
plan has been in place for a full year. We really do believe that
things will be better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines ranked best overall, as it did in 1997. In
1998, the top spot went to USAirways, which fell to No. 6 in the
new report.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Continental finished second, followed by Delta,
Northwest and Alaska Airlines. American was No. 7, followed by
America West, TWA and United.
</P>
<P>
   The report's only good news involved baggage handling. The study
found that the industry mishandled 5.08 bags per 1,000 passengers
in 1999, down from 5.16 per 1,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there was a drop in the portion of flights
that arrived within 15 minutes of schedule. On-time performance
slipped from 77.2 percent to 76.1 percent and denied boardings was
virtually stable, edging from 0.87 per 10,000 passengers to 0.88.
</P>
<P>
   The study was particularly critical of airlines for instituting
what they called a series of anti-consumer rules designed to
increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
   These include tighter limits on carry-on bags, bans on carry-on
food, not allowing a consumer to take an earlier connection when a
seat is available and raising fees to change tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Soon, consumers will become driven by price and schedule only
and regard airline loyalty as having no tangible value,'' the
authors concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation, which independently reports on
airline performance, found similar problems through February.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers registered 1,999 complaints about the 10 largest
carriers in February, slightly down from January but nearly double
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It found that 74.8 percent of flights arrived on time in
February -- also slightly better than in January but not as good as
78.9 percent in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines had a mishandled baggage rate of 4.81 reports per
1,000 passengers in February, an improvement from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Headley acknowledged the new passenger bill of rights instituted
by airlines late last year and allowed that change does take time.
But, he argued, the steps promised by the airlines were things they
should have been doing already.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers pledged to be more forthright with passengers all
the way through their travel experience. They promised to volunteer
the lowest airfares or cheaper travel options when people call for
reservations and to give passengers at least 24 hours to cancel
ticket purchases.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would update passengers at 15- to 20-minute
intervals when there are delays.

<HEADLINE> EU, Russia Working on Relationship  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- The European Union and Russia said Monday they
made a start in improving their shaky relationship on issues across
the board, including economic relations and Russia's war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters after a
two-hour meeting with his 15 EU counterparts that ''we are not
avoiding a dialogue'' about Chechnya. He said Moscow was eager to
''find a political settlement of this issue. We are not slamming
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   He said both sides ''reaffirmed our mutual desire to develop a
strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   EU officials spoke in similar terms and said the election of
Vladimir Putin as Russian president has injected new stability in
EU-Russian relations that bodes well for a planned May 17 EU-Russia
summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to step up the fight against organized
crime. EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten said Moscow
also pledged to respect international property rights, bringing it
''in line with its future obligations under the World Trade
Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   On Chechnya, Ivanov gave no details of a political settlement
plan Putin mentioned at a meeting in Moscow last week with senior
EU officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ivanov said the plan envisioned an eventual political
settlement with Chechen leaders who do not ''put forward
unacceptable conditions and who recognize the territorial integrity
of the Russian federation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has consistently rejected demands to end the fighting,
saying the Chechen rebels are terrorists. European critics say
Russian troops indiscriminately kill civilians and execute and
torture Chechen rebels, allegations Russia denies.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner, whose country
holds the presidency of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, is to go to Moscow and the Caucasus this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the meeting with Ivanov, the EU ministers issued a
statement praising Putin for his stated desire to seek ''a
strategic partnership'' but insisted that can only happen on the
basis of ''an open and frank dialogue'' on such issues as Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said the EU ministers
agreed not to paint Russia into a corner over Chechnya, yet would
not drop demands for a negotiated end to the war and access for
human rights and humanitarian relief groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said while Russia ''must understand we are serious in
our concern about democracy and human rights in Chechnya, we have
to work together to enable Russia to make a new start.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly
lifted Russia's voting rights and asked for a full suspension of
Russia from the council unless peace talks begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began seeking closer ties with the EU at the bloc's
December summit in Helsinki, Finland. It floated proposals for
Russian-EU cooperation on a number of strategic issues, including
military cooperation with European defense structures that Russia
hopes could be an alternative to NATO.

Firefighters Battle Toronto Blaze
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Firefighters were battling a blaze in a factory
Sunday in the city's east end that sent clouds of black smoke so
high they could be seen from across Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from 20 to 30 fire trucks were trying the control the
blaze which broke out about 4 p.m. in the industrial plant which
borders on a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   Police Supt. Jim Bamford said there were chemicals in the U.S.E.
Hickson plant but it was not known what kind and whether they were
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no dangers to the residents,'' said Bamford.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans to evacuate the area, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kirkpatrick, 23, who lives on the Lake Ontario shore
between St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-Lake, said he noticed the
smoke about 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I watched there appeared to be almost explosions as plumes
of smoke shot into the sky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:30 p.m., he said, black smoke spread from Toronto eastward
along the skyline for several kilometers

Spring Snow Slows Traffic
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Quebecers put their snow shovels to work again
on the weekend as a spring storm hit the province.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of traffic accidents were reported on provincial
highways, causing at least one death, as snow sharply cut
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit at a time when the city had only limited
snow-removal resources available, said Christiane Bolduc, a city
official.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our contracts with private firms ended March 31,'' she said.
''So all operations are being done by city employees and city
crews.''

Canadian Alliance: Stick To Party Scripts
</P>
<P>
   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) -- Canadian Alliance leadership
candidates stuck to the party script on taxes and government
reform, but questions of God and moral values split them down the
middle during the party's first leadership forum here.
</P>
<P>
   The declared candidates for the leadership race are former
Reform party leader Preston Manning, Alberta MLA Stockwell Day,
Toronto lawyer Joe Peschisolido and British Columbia MP Keith
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The place of God in government and schools was the first
question to the four candidates from the audience of about 500.
</P>
<P>
   God ''may have an idea where Svend Robinson should go,'' Day
said Saturday as he joked about NDP MP Robinson's petition to have
God stricken from the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin and Peschisolido, the two dark horses in the Canadian
Alliance leadership race, came down strongly against a
theologically driven government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in a secular world and society,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hallmark of society is to be tolerant of all religions. I
believe strongly in the separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Peschisolido said he doesn't believe in imposing one's morals.

<HEADLINE> Bush Begins Committee Takeover  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, began taking control of the
Republican National Committee on Monday by naming a former state
party chairman to a top RNC post.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer will be chairman of the RNC Victory 2000 campaign,
RNC chairman Jim Nicholson announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to working closely with him to unify our party,
energize our grassroots organization and deliver the Republican
Party's optimistic and hopeful message for our country's future,''
Nicholson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer chaired the Texas GOP from 1988 to 1994, helping it
reverse years of Democratic rule. He was a senior adviser in the
failed 1996 presidential campaign of Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials noted that Meyer is close to Arizona
Sen. John McCain, a vanquished Bush rival whose endorsement is
being sought by the nominee-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also moved his campaign political director, Maria Cino, to
the RNC, where she will be a deputy for political and congressional
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Johnson Phillips, one of Bush's original Texas
fund-raisers, will be deputy chairman for operations at the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had considered naming one of his oldest friends and
fund-raisers, Don Evans, to the top post but decided to keep him in
Texas, where he is a valuable senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's likely general election rival, Vice President Al Gore,
already has many allies at the Democratic National Committee but is
expected to bolster his presence by moving political operative
Michael Whouley to the party.
</P>
<P>
   It is traditional for nominees to shift staff to their parties,
both to reduce campaign costs and to oversee the political
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, considered a moderate Republican, did not seek a fourth
term as Texas GOP chairman after it became clear that social
conservatives had enough votes to topple him. Bush's communications
director, Karen Hughes, got her start in politics by working for
Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was making the announcements in a conference call Monday
with RNC members.

<HEADLINE> Iran Returns More Iraqi POWs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iran on Monday returned 500 Iraqi prisoners
of war held since its 1980-88 war with its Arab neighbor, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   They were the third batch of 500 POWs to be handed over by Iran
to Iraq on three consecutive days. A fourth and final batch will be
freed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marks of torture and suffering were clear on the faces and
bodies of the returned heroes,'' said the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of families have spent the last three days at the
border point of Munthriya hoping that their loved ones will be
among those returning. No lists of names were released in advance
for the returning POWs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says it does not hold anymore Iranian POWs, a claim denied
by Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture by Iran is unlikely to bring the former foes any
closer. Only last week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a
Cabinet meeting, branded Iran's rulers ''a clique of brutal
monsters'' for what he said were atrocities against Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The means of oppression and torture they used are not even
matched by those of the Nazis,'' Saddam said. Iran denies
accusations of mistreatment of POWs.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran-Iraq war ended with a U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988
but the two countries never signed a peace treaty and their
relations remain tense.

<HEADLINE> Police Wait To Recover Marine Bodies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   said Lt. Mark Carter.
</P>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Military investigators prepared Monday to
begin removing the remains of 19 Marines from the charred wreckage
of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft that crashed and burst into flames
during a training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe, a spokeswoman at the Pentagon Marine
Corps headquarters, said it likely would be well into Tuesday
before all the bodies could be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Military investigators were taking measurements Monday and
reviewing pieces of the Osprey, which takes off and lands like a
helicopter but flies like a plane. They spent much of the day
ensuring that nothing combustible remained among the remnants
scattered at the airport where the Osprey went down Saturday night,
said Lt. Mark Carter, a spokesman for the Yuma air station where
the flight originated.
</P>
<P>
   The crash victims included four crew members from Quantico, Va.,
14 Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and one from Marine Corps
Air Station-Miramar in San Diego County. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Bakkar-Poe said Marine officials remain confident that the
Osprey is safe and hoped to release a preliminary cause of the
crash in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Marine officials said the aircraft did not have a black-box
voice recorder but did carry a flight data recorder, which would
normally record the movement of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed while landing at the Marana Northwest Regional
Airport, about 30 miles northwest of Tucson, during a nighttime
evacuation exercise. The Pentagon said it won't fly the Marine
Corps' four remaining Osprey aircraft immediately, while
investigators try to determine what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The new aircraft, which the Marines are evaluating under
war-type conditions and have been flying only since September, is
expected to replace its aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Bakkar-Poe said the decision not to fly the other four models
was made out of concern for the victims' families and the other
Osprey crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't feel there's a design flaw,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Osprey that crashed had already flown more than 135
hours since it was delivered to the military Jan. 17. The aircraft
had been averaging about 40 hours a month in the air -- about twice
as much as most Marine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines have ordered 360 Ospreys to be delivered by 2014 at
a cost of $44 million each, said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Rob
Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, continue to raise questions about the costs and
safety of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Mercier, whose son Keoki Santos of Grand Ronde, Ore.,
was among the victims, said the 24-year-old had voiced concerns
about flying in the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really, really nervous about the whole thing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a beautiful, high-spirited, true Marine. He didn't want
to just go into the service for four years. He enlisted to be a
career man,'' Mercier said. ''And they killed him. They wanted him
to be a guinea pig for these new airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of another victim, Staff Sgt. William Bryan Nelson,
said his son considered the plane ''experimental'' and that it
frequently encountered mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me it was so fragile,'' said William D. Nelson, whose
son was among the crew members. ''He didn't think it was very ready
to fly yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps lists two other crashes during the Osprey's
development: a 1991 Delaware accident blamed on gyro wiring
problems, and a 1992 Virginia crash that killed all seven people on
board after an engine caught fire.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elden Campbell's 18-foot turnaround jumper
over Juwan Howard as time expired capped a wild finish and lifted
the Charlotte Hornets over the Washington Wizards 107-105 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones scored 26 points and David Wesley had 21 for the
Hornets, who swept the three-game season series from the Wizards.
Charlotte has won two straight games and nine of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond had 21 points and reserve Richard Hamilton 19 for
the Wizards, who had won 8 of their last 11.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 103 when Hamilton missed a pair of free
throws with 59.6 seconds left. Charlotte missed two shots on the
ensuing possession, but gained two clock resets before Anthony
Mason hit a 10-footer with 2.8 seconds left for a 105-103 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mason finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Derrick Coleman, who had 16 points and 16 rebounds,
fouled Washington's Mitch Richmond on the ensuing in-bounds play
and Richmond hit both free throws, tying the game at 105 and
setting up Campbell's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitney had 14 points and 10 assists for the Wizards, but
spent much of the fourth quarter on the bench after drawing his
fifth foul.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte led 30-25 lead after one quarter and 55-49 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney's 3-pointer, in the midst of a 10-2 spurt, gave
Washington its first lead with 8:24 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's short baseline jumper restored Charlotte's lead at
72-71 with 2:20 remaining in the third. After Jones' fadeaway shot
from the left corner gave the Hornets an 83-79 lead 2:08 into the
fourth quarter, Washington went on a 10-2 run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Whitney was bumped hard by Jones near the Wizards'
bench midway through the first period, he spun around and landed in
a chair just in time for the game's first television timeout. ...
The Wizards are 5-5 when Whitney starts. .. Charlotte is 26-19
lifetime against Washington.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Owner: No Ticket Price Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Jazz owner Larry H. Miller said
Monday that ticket prices won't increase for the 2000-01 regular
season, the first time the team hasn't raised prices since moving
to the Delta Center in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very loyal fan base, both as season ticket-holders
and as individual ticket buyers,'' Miller said in a release. ''We
hope this move will acknowledge our appreciation of their
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a Jazz ticket is $50, which the team said
ranks in the middle of the NBA's 29 teams. Ticket prices range from
$10 to $82.50, excluding the arena's VIP sections.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Ordered To Be Sent Home  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hundreds of illegal immigrants in nine
Western states who have completed prison terms for crimes in this
country must be freed until the United States can persuade their
homelands to take them back, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-0 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected
immigration officials' argument that federal law authorizes
indefinite -- potentially lifelong -- jailing of illegal immigrants
whose native countries have no repatriation agreement with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which conflicts with decisions of two other appeals
courts, will probably be appealed, said Bill Strassberger, a
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our priority is to keep the community safe, and no one will be
released if they are deemed a threat to public safety,''
Strassberger said.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the aliens must be released 90 days after a final
deportation order and allowed to remain free under INS supervision
until their home country reaches an agreement with the United
States to accept deportees.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they have to face going back to their home country, it
would be a horrible injustice and a tragedy to require lockup for
five or 10 years,'' said Jay Stansell, an assistant federal public
defender in Seattle, where the case originated.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal law required deportation of noncitizens who
committed any of a wide range of felonies, including most types of
drug crimes. After completing their prison terms, they were to be
transferred to INS custody and deported within 90 days of a final
removal order.
</P>
<P>
   The law said immigrants whose home countries refused to accept
them ''may be detained beyond the removal period.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS contended the law allowed indefinite detention of
immigrants it considered dangerous, but the court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Without clear authorizing language, ''courts should ordinarily
not assume that Congress intended a result as harsh and
constitutionally dubious as indefinite detention,'' Judge Stephen
Reinhardt wrote in the court's opinion. He also noted that
international law condemns ''prolonged and arbitrary detention.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies to immigrants from Cambodia, Vietnam and
Laos, none of which has a repatriation agreement with the United
States. It also covers some Cubans and some immigrants from the
former Soviet Union who cannot be deported to their newly
independent homelands for various reasons, Stansell said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer said the government has estimated that 400 to
500 immigrants would be affected in the nine states covered by the
9th Circuit, the largest of the federal appellate circuits. The INS
said a year ago that there were 3,500 such prisoners nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in the case of Kim Ho Ma, a Cambodian refugee
who came to the United States with his family at age 2 and was
convicted of manslaughter in a Seattle drive-by shooting 15 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   He served just over two years in state prison and spent nearly
three more years in the custody of the INS, which could not deport
him to Cambodia because of the lack of a repatriation agreement but
said he was still dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik ordered Ma released last
September, saying indefinite detention without charges was
unconstitutional. The appeals court sidestepped the constitutional
issue by finding that federal law did not authorize indefinite
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Ma was arrested recently in nearby Kent, Wash., for
investigation of misdemeanor assault. He was released on $1,000
bond in that case, but federal authorities will ask Lasnik to
return him to INS custody April 19 for violating the terms of his
release, said Harold Malkin, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's
office.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Franchisees Seek Break  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Burger King Corp. has rejected an offer
from its U.S. franchisees to purchase the brand from the hamburger
chain's parent company, Diageo PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King, based in Miami, disclosed the offer from the
National Franchisee Association in a brief news release Monday, but
did not provide details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diageo has responded firmly to the NFA that the Burger King
brand is not for sale to any entity,'' the statement said. ''The
Burger King brand has been growing and presents a tremendous growth
opportunity both in North America as well as internationally.
Diageo has been investing heavily and will continue to do so to
grow the Burger King brand.''
</P>
<P>
   A message left at NFA's Miami office was not immediately
returned late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NFA has hired specialists to assist in formulating ''a plan
attractive to Diageo that provides for the sale of Burger King,''
according to memos distributed to franchisees at the annual Burger
King franchisee convention in Orlando, Dow Jones Newswires reported
Monday. It said copies of the memos were made available to the news
service.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists team includes the Wall Street law firm of Weil
Gotshal &AMP; Manges, public relations specialists Hill &AMP; Knowlton and
Arthur Andersen LLP as merger and acquisition consultants, the Dow
Jones report said.
</P>
<P>
   The franchisees hope to gain independence from Diageo, allowing
Burger King to possibly become a freestanding company.
</P>
<P>
   The offer boldly demonstrates the widening split between the
parent company and franchisees, who have complained of slim profit
margins, ineffective marketing campaigns and lack of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 26 letter to the company that was obtained by Dow
Jones, franchisee association president Steven M. Lewis alluded to
''the weakened state of the Burger King brand and inadequate
franchisee support by Burger King Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Burger King apparently plans to increase royalty rates
from 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent and the franchise fee from $40,000
to $50,000, both as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo is primarily a liquor and beer company whose brands
include Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker Scotch, Pillsbury baked
goods, Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King is the world's second-largest hamburger chain,
behind McDonald's Corp., with some 10,850 Burger King restaurants
worldwide, most of them franchised.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo has owned Burger King since 1988. That was when its
predecessor company, Grand Metropolitan PLC, acquired the fast-food
operation as part of its purchase of Pillsbury Co.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King had 1999 sales of $1.4 billion, while parent Diageo
had sales of $18.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal Misses Second Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer
and second-leading rebounder, sat out the Los Angeles Lakers' game
against the Seattle SuperSonics on Monday night because of a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the shootaround today, he said it still bothers him,''
Lakers coach Phil Jackson said, adding he wasn't concerned about
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, averaging 29.5 points and 13.6 rebounds, arrived at
Staples Center nearly 90 minutes before tipoff, and refused to
speak with reporters before entering the trainer's room for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly later, he issued a statement saying, ''(Trainer Gary)
Vitti's doing a great job. The ankle's making progress, and it
feels better. I hope to play Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers play their next game that night against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a virtual lock for his first Most Valuable Player award,
sprained his ankle in the first half of last Wednesday night's
111-104 victory at Golden State, but continued to play and scored
49 points.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle began bothering him the following day; X-rays were
taken Friday that showed no damage, and he watched from the bench
Saturday night as the Lakers lost 98-80 to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   That loss snapped an 11-game winning streak, and was just the
second in 32 games for the Lakers, who have already clinched
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The game with Seattle was a possible first-round playoff
matchup, since the Sonics entered the game in eighth place in the
Western Conference. The playoffs start April 22.
</P>
<P>
   After facing Sacramento, the Lakers play Minnesota on Sunday in
their final home game, and complete the season with games at Dallas
on April 18 and San Antonio the following night.

<HEADLINE> Celtics 99, Hawks 94  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Antoine Walker scored 26 of his 34 points in the
second half, including a 3-pointer with 25 seconds left to cap a
game-ending 11-0 Boston rally, as the Celtics beat the Atlanta
Hawks 99-94 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win snapped Boston's 10 game-losing skid, its longest since
1997. The Celtics' last victory was March 18 against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson was the only other Boston player in double
figures, with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jackson paced the Hawks, losers of seven in a row, with 27
points and 10 rebounds. Atlanta hasn't won on the road since Feb.
25 at Seattle, a 12-game drought.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's basket with 3:02 left gave the Hawks a 94-88 lead, but
Atlanta didn't score again.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce's three-point play cut it to 94-91 before Anderson's
twisting layup sliced it to one with 1:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Walker tied it by hitting the second of two free throws
with 1:38 left, he made his game-winner from the left corner as the
shot clock was winding down. Anderson added two free throws with
11.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had opened its biggest lead of the game, 52-44, on
LaPhonso Ellis' basket 55 seconds into the third quarter. Walker
then broke free for 20 of his points during a 28-16 run that gave
Boston a 72-68 advantage after three.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks shot 67 percent in the opening quarter to take a 25-18
lead and led 49-44 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Hawks lost their previous six games by an average
margin of 21.2 points. ... Red Sox outfielders Troy O'Leary and
Darren Lewis and lefthander Pete Schourek sat behind former Celtic
great Bob Cousy at center court. ... A fan behind the Celtics'
bench held up a sign saying: ''The Celtics next trade, (Rick)
Pitino.'' ... The attendance was officially announced as 15,006,
but the 18,624-capacity arena was half-empty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Vince Carter's first career triple-double helped
the Toronto Raptors inch closer to their first playoff berth with a
112-103 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carter went 13-of-19 from the field and scored 31 points, had 11
rebounds and added a career-high 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto (43-34) moved within one win or one Milwaukee loss of
clinching a postseason spot. The Bucks hosted Orlando on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady had 27 points, a career-high nine assists and six
blocks as the Raptors ended a four-game home losing streak by
beating Cleveland for the fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis had 14 points and four blocks, while Charles
Oakley added 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp had 22 points for Cleveland, Bob Sura had 19, and
Lamond Murray 16.
</P>
<P>
   Carter gave the Raptors, guaranteed of their first winning
season since joining the league five seasons ago, a 21-18 lead on a
3-pointer 7:25 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Davis' shot bounced off the rim and Carter came
out of nowhere to slam the rebound home. With the quarter winding
down, Carter dunked over Andrew DeClercq to make it 30-24 and 40
seconds later he set up McGrady for a slam.
</P>
<P>
   Carter completed another highlight-reel move two minutes into
the second quarter when he hit a one-handed alley-oop off a Muggsy
Bogues inbounds pass. The two hooked up for a similar play in the
third quarter to make it a 69-50 game.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady, meanwhile, did a bit of everything at both ends,
swatting away balls, causing a turnovers and driving to the basket.
He went to the free-line 13 times, making 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs, down by as much as 24 points in the third quarter,
made a small charge in the fourth on a pair of Kemp dunks that
closed the gap to 98-93 with 4:28 left, but the Raptors responded
with six straight points.Notes: Doug Christie, not in uniform the previous two games with a
sore right ankle and pulled groin, dressed but did not play. ...
After getting fouled on a drive to the basket, McGrady tossed the
ball at Mark Bryant, earning a technical. ... Davis injured his
right leg in the first quarter but returned in the third. ... The
Cavs, already eliminated from the playoffs, had won two straight on
the road. ... The Raptors moved a half-game behind idle Charlotte
for fifth place.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Imposes More Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- University of Minnesota President Mark Yudof
imposed more sanctions Monday on its men's basketball program for
the academic cheating scandal uncovered last year.
</P>
<P>
   The university already had banned the team from postseason play
for one year and put itself on NCAA probation for an unspecified
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The school will eliminate six scholarships over four academic
years; reduce official visits from 12 to eight for the next three
academic years; reduce the number of days recruiters can watch a
prospective player practice or play from five to four; and cut the
number of coaches allowed to evaluate off-campus during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The school also will return to the NCAA 90 percent of the
estimated $350,000 it received from the Big Ten Conference from
participating in the 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1996-97 NCAA tournaments
with ineligible players, Yudof said. The money will come from the
athletic department, according to vice president for administration
Tonya Moten Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''While no one likes imposing penalties on people who were in no
way involved in academic misconduct, it is with their best interest
foremost in our minds that we take this action today,'' Yudof said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imposing these sanctions gets the clock ticking, allowing the
program to emerge from the penalty phase as quickly as possible,
and gives our players and recruits clear information about the
future of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''These sanctions are meaningful and appropriate, further
demonstrating to the NCAA that the University of Minnesota is
serious about responding to the findings of our investigation,''
Yudof said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions come before Wednesday's letter of intent signing
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof said he imposed the sanctions at the recommendations of
Moten Brown, interim men's athletics director Tom Moe and
basketball coach Dan Monson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been very, very harsh on ourselves. This was an
appropriate response,'' Moe said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This actually does help (recruiting), as odd as it sounds,''
Monson said. ''The worst punishment our basketball program could
have is the unknown, because other schools can take the unknown and
use it to great advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were announced just as Saint Paul Pioneer Press
reporter George Dohrmann was named a Pulitzer Prize winner for his
work reporting on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dohrmann and his team reported that a tutor did work for student
athletes, athletes earned credits from classes they never knew
about, faculty were bullied by the basketball program staff and
head coach Clem Haskins told players to lie about the scope of the
cheating. The school later bought out Haskins' contract for $1.5
million. Haskins denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should encourage the NCAA to look away from additional
penalties,'' said Moten Brown, who was charged with controlling
oversight of athletics in the wake of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel this sends a strong message,'' she said. ''We do not
want to see another ban on postseason play. We're saying, 'We're
willing to take these lumps, but leave the kids alone.'''

<HEADLINE> Parents Talk Drugs More With Kids  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More parents are speaking frankly with their
children about drugs, but many of them fear -- incorrectly -- that
the message is not getting through, according to a study by the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 12th survey, released Monday, found that 57 percent
of parents said they have spoken with their children at least four
times in the past year about drug use. Sixty-four percent said they
have ''thoroughly'' covered the topic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, just 44 percent of parents said they had spoken with
their children at least four times. In the same year, 52 percent of
parents felt they had ''thoroughly'' covered the topic with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey also found that one out of three parents
believes ''what I say will have little influence on whether my
child tries marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With teen-agers, many things go in one ear and out the
other,'' said Richard D. Bonnette, president and chief executive of
the partnership. ''But what parents are saying about drugs appears
to be sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by the partnership indicated that teen-age
approval of marijuana and other drugs was declining.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study also found that 75 percent of parents believe
''most people will try marijuana sometime'' -- an increase from 65
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that most often a child's mother was
responsible for drug education. Eighty-one percent of the mothers
surveyed said they spoke with their children about drugs; for
fathers, the figure was 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While 57 percent of the parents acknowledged having smoked
marijuana, they said there is no hypocrisy in warning their kids to
avoid drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, launched in 1987, is a
nonprofit coalition of communications industry professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Its latest survey questioned 800 parents. The margin of error
was plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Indians: Season is Sold Out Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians declared the 2000 season
at Jacobs Field sold out Monday night, four days before the team's
home opener against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have sold out 373 straight home games, the longest
streak in the majors. The season attendance last year was
3,468,456, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Season tickets are capped at about 25,000. The Indians placed
800,000 individual game tickets on sale Dec. 3 and ran that sale
until Dec. 24. A secondary sale began Feb. 26 for tickets not sold
in December plus about 175,000 tickets for auxiliary bleachers and
standing room.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland streak dates to June 12, 1995. Jacobs Field opened
in 1994. Its capacity is 43,368.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Baseball Notes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Twins-Royals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: During Ron Coomer's at-bat in the fourth, a fan in
the upper deck had an embarrassing moment. Coomer flared a foul
ball into the stands and when the fan lunged for the ball, his red
jacket fell off and went sailing into the crowd below. While people
laughed and applauded, ushers retrieved the jacket and returned it
to him. ... Jacque Jones, whose two-run homer tied it 5-5, tried to
be philosophical about the loss, saying, ''That's baseball. It's
going to happen again. Maybe next time it will happen to the other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Jumbotron behind left field was not working due
to technical problems. A team official said the needed part was not
available in Kansas City and had to be ordered from out of state.
The Royals put in a rush order, hoping to get the Jumbotron working
in time for Cal Ripken Jr.'s drive toward 3,000 hits, which resumes
when the Orioles visit Tuesday and Wednesday. Ripken, who's six
hits away, also marked two other career milestones in Kansas City.
On Aug. 10, 1981 he made his major league debut in Royals Stadium,
and in 1996 he played in his 2,216th consecutive game, breaking
Sachio Kinugasa's world major league record.
Indians-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: In the midst of a season-high offensive performance
by the Indians, Jim Thome had a tough night at the plate Sunday.
While the Indians completed a three-game sweep by defeating Tampa
Bay 17-4, Thome struck out five times, tying a club and major
league record. The only other Indians players to fan five times in
a game were Larry Doby on April 25, 1948, and Rick Manning on May
15, 1977. Thome became the 37th major leaguer to strike out five
times in a game and the first since Scott Rolen last Aug. 23. ...
The Indians have been second best in a manner of speaking. Heading
into Monday night's game at Oakland, the Indians had outscored
opponents 23-4 in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 2B Randy Velarde, who began the season on the 15-day DL
with a strained left knee, had his first light workout Monday.
Velarde did some light jogging, hit about 40 baseballs off a tee
and played catch. There's still no word on when he'll return. ...
In the meantime, Oakland manager Art Howe said. In the meantime,
Howe said the A's have been happy with rookie Frank Menechino's
play in Velarde's absence. Menechino has fielded well and was
batting .211 before Monday night, with two homers and four RBIs.
... The A's patience at the plate is showing up again. Oakland drew
a season-high 10 walks in a 14-2 victory over the White Sox on
Sunday and were tied for the league lead with 31 walks before
Monday's games. Last year, the A's led the majors with an Oakland
team-record 770 walks. Last season's walks total also was the
fifth-most in major league history.
Blue Jays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays were 9-3 against the Angels last season,
winning all six of their games in Toronto. ... Blue Jays manger Jim
Fregosi recently was selected to the Angels' all-time team as both
the manager and shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Benji Gil started in place of Gary DiSarcina at SS for
the second straight game. DiSarcina bruised his left thumb Saturday
making a diving catch and is listed as day to day. ... Mo Vaughn,
who donated money to benefit the University of Irvine Medical
Center for every RBI he had last season, will be honored by having
a play center named after him this week, the Mo Vaughn Child Life
Playroom.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Marlins-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Preston Wilson extended his hitting streak to eight
games with a third-inning single. Wilson hit just .192 in spring
training. ... Manager John Boles moved former All-Star shortstop
Alex Gonzalez up from eighth to seventh in the batting order.
Gonzalez was banished to the end of the order because of
continually lackadaisical play, including his failure to field an
important grounder in Florida's Saturday loss to Colorado. ...
Marlins owner John Henry was expected to meet with baseball
commissioner Bud Selig in Milwaukee about Florida's ongoing quest
for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Brewers play-by-play broadcaster and Wisconsin
man-about-town Bob Uecker rode onto the field on a Harley and threw
out the first pitch in the final home opener at County Stadium. ...
The opening day festivities also included a giant American flag
unfurled in the outfield and a flyover by two F-16 jets from the
115th fighter wing in Madison. ... Manager Davey Lopes, third
baseman Jose Hernandez, catcher Henry Blanco and starting pitcher
Jimmy Haynes all made their home debuts with the Brewers. Lopes
received a warm ovation from the large opening-day crowd. ... Lopes
had trouble finding his way to County Stadium for the club's home
opener. ''I thought I was going the wrong way down Bluemound
Road,'' Lopes admitted. ''I said, 'Where's the stadium?' I was
getting ready to go into a gas station and ask where County Stadium
is. I kind of started doubting myself there for a minute.''
Braves-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Andres Galarraga, who hit a two-run homer Monday,
credits Don Baylor, his manager in Colorado, with reviving his
career. Galarraga won the NL Silver Slugger Award in 1988 and hit
20 home runs in 1988, '89 and '90. But by 1991, his average had
dropped to .219 and he hit only nine homers. He signed with the
expansion Rockies in 1993, and hit .370 his first season in
Colorado. ''I can say he was like a father,'' Galarraga said of
Baylor, whom he greeted with a hug before the game. ''He helped me
to turn my career around, both with hitting and the mental part of
the game.'' ... Kerry Ligtenberg gave up his first run of the
season on Shane Andrew's three-run, game-tying homer. Ligtenberg,
who missed all of last season after a ligament was replaced in his
right elbow, had given up just one hit in his first two games. ...
Chipper Jones has had at least one hit in each of Atlanta's first
seven games. He was 1-for-4 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs optioned RHP Matt Karchner to Triple-A Iowa
after the game and recalled RHP Ruben Quevedo. ... Thanks to the
55,000 who attended the Cubs ''home'' game in Japan, Chicago's home
attendance is already at 93,655 after two games. ... Rookie LHP
Scott Downs earned himself another start Friday after Sunday's
outing in Cincinnati. In his major league debut, Downs gave up
three runs on five hits in 6 1-3 innings against the Reds. ''I
thought he pitched excellent ball,'' manager Don Baylor said.
''Under the pressureof having all your family there, your first
major league game, he handled the pressure well.'' ... The Cubs
honored 1990s hits leader Mark Grace before the game. He was
presented with a flag that will fly above the field and his mother,
Sharon, threw out the first pitch. ''She's got a pretty good arm,
doesn't she?'' Grace said. ''I told her whatever you do, don't
bounce it.''
Reds-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO--The Rockies, who have led the majors in attendance in
each of their seven seasons, drew 48,094. It was a club record for
opening day at Coors Field, and the 50,427 total tickets
distributed set a regular-season record. ... After the game, the
Rockies placed LF Jeffrey Hammonds on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to April 4, because of a strained right hamstring.
Taking Hammonds' place on the roster will be right-handed reliever
Rick Croushore, who will be recalled from Triple-A Colorado
Springs. ... Cirillo has five hits this season, all doubles. ...
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: 2B Pokey Reese, hit by a pitch on the left elbow,
left in the fifth inning with a bruise. ... The Reds signed LHP
Norm Charlton to a minor league contract. Charlton, who pitched for
the club from 1988-92, will report Wednesday to Triple-A
Louisville. ... Ochoa pulled his right hamstring in the ninth
inning. After hitting a dribbler, he injured himself running to
first, but Lee's throw was wild and Ochoa limped safely to first.
Diamondbacks-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks went from 3-9 against the Padres in
their expansion season of 1998 to 11-2 last year, including winning
5 of 6 in San Diego. ... Randy Johnson won't pitch this series, but
he might wish he did. Although the Padres beat him twice during the
1998 playoffs while he was with Houston, Johnson is 3-0 with a 1.91
ERA in four regular-season appearances against San Diego. ...
Former Padres CF Steve Finley, booed last year during his first
appearance back in San Diego, was cheered this time when the
Diamondbacks were introduced before the game.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Ray, Bob and Bret Boone, from the first family to
have three generations of major leaguers, each threw out a
ceremonial first pitch. Bret Boone, the Padres' new second baseman,
was obtained in a December trade with Atlanta. His father and
grandfather both went to high school in San Diego. ... Former
public address announcer Bruce Binkowski, who didn't miss a game in
his 14 years at the mike, was honored during pre-game ceremonies.
He chose to step down to concentrate on his duties with the Holiday
Bowl. He will be promoted to executive director following this
year's Holiday Bowl. ... Manager Bruce Bochy expects CF Ruben
Rivera (ankle) back in the lineup Tuesday. ... Randy Myers, who
hasn't thrown a pitch since the 1998 World Series, was booed when
his name was called during the Padres' introductions. Myers, on the
disabled list following shoulder surgery last year, didn't run onto
the field.
Mets-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies began a string of 14 straight games
against the NL East with Monday's home opener against the Mets. . .
Robin Roberts and Tug McGraw threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
. . Mickey Morandini, a fan favorite in Philly before getting
traded to the Cubs in December 1997, received a rousing ovation
upon his introduction. . . With Tuesday's off day, Phillies manager
Terry Francona is considering skipping No. 5 starter Chris Brock in
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Rickey Henderson, who said on Sunday he will not
speak to the media for a month, exchanged words during batting
practice with a heckler standing near the Phillies' dugout. . .
General manager Steve Phillips said he's not concerned with Todd
Zeile's slow start. ''People didn't think John Olerud would be able
to handle New York and he did as good a job as anybody,'' Phillips
said. . . Mike Piazza, a native of nearby Norristown, was besieged
by interview requests during pregame.
Cardinals-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The vintage locomotive that runs constantly in
pregame across a track atop a left field wall took the wise choice
and remained hidden during Cardinals' batting practice. Mark
McGwire sent four balls over the wall in left-center field and Eric
Davis sent two beyond the fence onto Crawford Street behind the
stadium. The train resumed its schedule after Cardinals BP. ...
Manager Tony La Russa likes the Cardinals' early surge but he's not
getting too excited. ''We have established a little something but
it's only the first week,'' La Russa said. ''We think we have a
chance to have a good ball club but that's as much as you can say
right now. The Astros feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: General manager Gerry Hunsicker didn't like what he saw
in the Astros clubhouse prior to Monday night's game: Three of his
stars, Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Ken Caminiti, were all on the
trainer's table. ''They were all curled up in the corner,''
Hunsicker said. Caminiti is out probably until Friday with a
hamstring pull. Bagwell and Biggio have a virus but started. ...
Daryle Ward went 0-for-4 Sunday and failed to get a run home in the
eighth that would have tied the game. Instead of giving his young
outfielder a rest, manager Larry Dierker started him in the cleanup
position against the Cardinals. ''Sometimes, you need to put a guy
right back out there, and without Caminiti in the lineup, we wanted
another left-handed bat in the lineup,'' Dierker said.

<HEADLINE> Police Set To Remove Marine Bodies  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARANA, Ariz. (AP) -- Military investigators prepared to begin
removing the remains of 19 Marines Tuesday from the charred
wreckage of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft that crashed and burst into
flames during a training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the bodies is expected to take several days, and DNA
testing may be necessary to identify the victims, said Marine Lt.
Mark Carter, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma,
where the flight originated.
</P>
<P>
   The crash victims included four crew members from Quantico, Va.,
14 Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and one from Marine Corps
Air Station-Miramar in San Diego County. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Military investigators spent Monday taking measurements and
reviewing pieces of the Osprey, which takes off and lands like a
helicopter but flies like a plane. They also were ensuring that
nothing combustible remained among the aircraft's remnants
scattered across the airport where the Osprey went down Saturday
night, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe, a spokeswoman at the Pentagon Marine
Corps headquarters, said Marine officials remained confident that
the Osprey is safe and hoped to release a preliminary cause of the
crash in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Marine officials said the aircraft did not have a black-box
voice recorder but did carry a flight data recorder, which would
normally record the movement of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed while landing at the Marana Northwest Regional
Airport, about 30 miles northwest of Tucson, during a nighttime
evacuation exercise. The Pentagon said it won't fly the Marine
Corps' four remaining Osprey aircraft immediately, while
investigators try to determine what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The new aircraft, which the Marines are evaluating under
war-type conditions and have been flying only since September, is
expected to replace the corps' aging fleet of CH-46 Sea Knight
helicopters. The Marines have ordered 360 Ospreys to be delivered
by 2014 at a cost of $44 million each, said Pentagon spokesman
Capt. Rob Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   Bakkar-Poe said the decision not to fly the other four Ospreys
was made out of concern for the victims' families and the other
Osprey crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't feel there's a design flaw,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Osprey that crashed had already flown more than 135
hours since it was delivered to the military Jan. 17. The aircraft
had been averaging about 40 hours a month in the air -- about twice
as much as most Marine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Mercier, whose son Keoki Santos of Grand Ronde, Ore.,
was among the victims, said the 24-year-old had voiced concerns
about flying in the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really, really nervous about the whole thing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a beautiful, high-spirited, true Marine. He didn't want
to just go into the service for four years. He enlisted to be a
career man,'' Mercier said. ''And they killed him. They wanted him
to be a guinea pig for these new airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of another victim, Staff Sgt. William Bryan Nelson,
said his son considered the plane ''experimental'' and that it
frequently encountered mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me it was so fragile,'' said William D. Nelson, whose
son was among the crew members. ''He didn't think it was very ready
to fly yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps lists two other crashes during the Osprey's
development: a 1991 Delaware accident blamed on gyro wiring
problems, and a 1992 Virginia crash that killed all seven people on
board after an engine caught fire.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 104, Magic 87  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen couldn't be guarded, Sam Cassell
couldn't be silenced and the Milwaukee Bucks finally looked like a
playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Allen scored 33 points, and Cassell added 18 points and eight
assists as the energized Bucks beat the Magic 104-87 Monday night,
moving Milwaukee one game behind Orlando for the Eastern
Conference's final postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-place Bucks and eighth-place Magic both have five
games left. The teams meet again in Orlando next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, who guaranteed the Bucks would win, verbally goaded the
Magic all night in an intense, emotional game for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee (38-39) is right behind Orlando (39-38) after being
three games out of the playoff picture a week ago. The victory also
was Milwaukee's third straight against the Magic this season,
giving the Bucks the tiebreaker edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks, who won for the sixth time in eight games, played
with an intensity they have shown only rarely this season, throwing
down dunks, making scintillating passes and playing solid defense.
Orlando, which had 13 turnovers in the first three quarters, fell
behind by 23 points in the third quarter before making a late
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic trimmed Milwaukee's lead to 13 points several times in
the fourth quarter, but Allen and Tim Thomas hit big shots as the
Bucks pulled away to the delight of a small but vocal Bradley
Center crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer had 14 points -- but only two after halftime -- to lead
the Magic, who lost for just the second time in 10 games. Darrell
Armstrong had 13 points while shooting 5-of-15. Orlando didn't hit
a 3-pointer until nine minutes were left in the game, and the Magic
shot 35 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared on several occasions. Cassell and referee Bennett
Salvatore engaged in a shouting match, and both coaches worked
their sidelines and the officials aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   John Amaechi and Ervin Johnson exchanged angry words in the
third quarter, and Ben Wallace and Scott Williams also challenged
each other moments later. Cassell, Williams and Thomas, who shoved
Pat Garrity after the two became tangled under the basket, all
received technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The highly contentious atmosphere seemed to bring out the best
in Milwaukee. The Bucks shot 54 percent in the first half and had
seven players with at least seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando closes the season with games against Boston, New Jersey,
Miami and Toronto in addition to the final meeting with Milwaukee.
The Bucks have Cleveland, Charlotte and two games with Washington
on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Even the biggest game of the Bucks' season couldn't draw a
big crowd to the Bradley Center. The upper deck was two-thirds
empty at game time. ... Milwaukee native Rick Majerus watched the
game from courtside, and the Utah coach had difficulty deciding who
to root for. A former Bucks assistant coach and friend of George
Karl, Majerus also coached Orlando coach Doc Rivers while the two
were at Marquette in the late 1970s, and coached Magic center
Michael Doleac at Utah. ... Karl protested an illegal defense call
by referee Jim Clark in the first quarter, saying, ''Why'd you call
it so quick, Jimmy?'' Clark replied, ''That's my job.''

<HEADLINE> Hospital Workers Charged in Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Three workers at a state hospital have
been charged with murder in the death of a patient who was
restrained after punching a hospital worker in the face, Attorney
General Mike Moore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from the death of a 24-year-old patient
Saturday in a part of the hospital where violent, aggressive male
patients are housed. According to Mississippi State Hospital, the
patient was restrained for his own safety and then died after
choking on his own vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said an autopsy performed on Kincharlsa Anderson led
investigators to believe the death was intentional. Moore did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital workers Curtis Branch, 23, Robert Thompson, 36, and
Jeffrey Sutton, 28, were arrested Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital director Bo Chastain called Anderson's death an
unfortunate event and said an internal investigation was underway.
He said the three workers were placed on administrative leave after
Anderson's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our employees at Mississippi State Hospital are very dedicated
to the tradition of safe care to our patients,'' Chastain said.
</P>
<P>
   The state hospital, just east of Jackson, has had a series of
patient-on-staff attacks the past several weeks. Three patients
have been charged in the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign QB Jeff George  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins purchased an expensive
insurance policy Monday, reaching an agreement with free agent
quarterback Jeff George on a four-year, $18.25 million contract to
back up Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeff was caught up in the idea of being with a Super Bowl
team,'' agent Leigh Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said a formal announcement would be made at Redskin
Park on Tuesday. Redskins director of player personnel Vinny
Cerrato did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the overall amount of money is astounding for a backup
quarterback, the contract is structured so that the Redskins and
George could easily sever ties after two years without a major dent
in the salary cap. If George is the starter by then, he would be
paid a handsome starter's salary -- $6 million per year over the
last two years of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   George began last season as the backup to Randall Cunningham in
Minnesota, but won the job after Cunningham struggled and went 9-3
as a starter. But the Vikings did not re-sign George, opting
instead to go with second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper and
Bubby Brister after failing to convince Dan Marino not to retire.
</P>
<P>
   During his negotiations with Redskins owner Dan Snyder,
Steinberg used one of his other clients, Neil O'Donnell, as a
bargaining tool. O'Donnell went 4-1 for Super Bowl-bound Tennessee
last season after Steve McNair had back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a team that wants to go to the Super Bowl, we noted in our
discussions that Neil O'Donnell played a critical role for the
Titans,'' Steinberg said. ''If Neil O'Donnell's not there, they
don't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the agreement was concluded after talks Monday
evening with Snyder, who made it clear there will be no quarterback
controversy going into camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brad Johnson is the starter, but Jeff George is probably the
most amazing backup that is possible,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract includes a $2 million signing bonus. George will
earn at least $500,000 the first year, but could get another $1
million if he gets enough playing time to meet certain incentives.
The base salaries for the following years are $3.75 million, $6
million and $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is reminiscent of the Redskins signing of Jeff
Hostetler in 1997. Hostetler was told he would be the backup, but
he openly questioned why he wasn't given a shot when Gus Frerotte
was struggling. Hostetler and the Redskins parted bitterly after
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   George's initial thought appears to be that second-string is OK
if the team is championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted to join the team with an incredible opportunity
to make a run for the Super Bowl,'' George said in a statement
released through Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   George, 32, a 10-year veteran, was the first pick in the 1990
draft and has played with Indianapolis, Atlanta, Oakland and last
year at Minnesota, where he started 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said it was the Vikings selection of Brister that
''heated up the talks with the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Snyder first floated the idea of wanting George
at the NFL owners meeting a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daniel Snyder was a tremendously compelling salesman,'' he
said. ''He sort of put on a full court press.''
</P>
<P>
   George's signing continues a whirlwind Redskins offseason. Bruce
Smith and Mark Carrier were signed during the first week of free
agency, and Deion Sanders may join the team if the Cowboys cut him
in June, as expected. Washington also has the second and third
picks in this weekend's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dan Snyder reminds me of the early days of (Cowboys owner)
Jerry Jones, people who come in a with a fixed point of view and
want to succeed very quickly,'' Steinberg said.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 102, Pistons 100  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves lost their cool,
their coach and their cushy lead Monday night, but recovered to
defeat the Detroit Pistons 102-100 on Kevin Garnett's
buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, who scored 25 points, sank a 10-foot jumper at the
horn, then ran around the court with his arms out like a little kid
pretending he was an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon added 16 points for Minnesota, which tied its
franchise single-season record with its 26th victory at Target
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill scored 36 points and was 17-of-18 from the foul line,
including the go-ahead free throws after Flip Saunders was ejected
in the third quarter for clashing with the officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, playing on a tender left ankle, dunked with 16 seconds
left to pull the Pistons to 99-98. After Wally Szczerbiak hit one
of two free throws a second later, Hill drove the lane to tie it at
100 with six seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves called timeout at 2.4 seconds, and Sam Mitchell
inbounded the ball to Garnett, who was closely guarded by three
players as he stepped into the lane and let loose a 10-foot floater
that fluttered the net at the horn.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured 60 fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was so frustrated with the officiating that he tossed
his suit coat into the seats, ran onto the court and went into a
profanity-filled tirade in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Official Scott Foster gave him a technical, then tossed him when
the usually mild-mannered Saunders continued his harangue.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was upset with the officiating all game. His final
outburst came when Radoslav Nesterovic collided heavily with Jerry
Stackhouse and then Grant Hill but no foul was called.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the third time Saunders has been ejected in his
four-year NBA coaching career, but the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill sank both technical foul shots, giving Detroit its first
lead, at 61-59.
</P>
<P>
   After Hill hit back-to-back jumpers over Szczerbiak to give the
Pistons an 84-75 lead, assistant coach Jerry Sichting sent in Malik
Sealy to guard Hill and the Wolves responded with an 18-2 run, led
by Garnett's seven points, after which Christian Laettner was
whistled for a technical.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy got a technical a minute before his coach was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura, who has sparred with officials all season,
was his usual yelling self, but fortunately for the crew his seat
was 10 rows back and not courtside.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned comical with 1:28 left when Brandon charged and
blocked Mills' free throw -- because Joe Smith had picked up his
sixth foul and was still on the court.
</P>
<P>
   After Pistons coach George Irvine got an explanation and Smith
left the court, Mills sank both shots while Brandon continued
laughing.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Saunders was ejected on Dec. 4, 1999, against Dallas and on
March 16, 1998, against Utah. Both of those also were at Target
Center. ... Garnett got kicked on the side of his left knee late in
the third but stayed in.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in 'Scalping' Scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A tree trimmer was charged with ''scalping''
$1.4 million from investors by posing as a financial analyst,
issuing fake press releases touting a small company's stock, then
selling his shares when the price rose.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Sayre, ''masquerading as a financial analyst,''
issued two false news releases, under the name Independent
Financial Reports, promoting the stock of eConnect, the SEC alleged
in a lawsuit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the bogus statements, which were posted on Internet message
boards, Sayre said eConnect was undervalued and projected a
short-term price target of $12 to $25 a share and a one-year target
of $100 to $135 a share, the SEC alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The statements indicated IFR held no shares in eConnect. But
Sayre did own several thousand of those shares through a second
company, Silver Screen Industries, and sold them soon after
interest he had created in the company inflated its shares, the SEC
said.
</P>
<P>
   EConnect's shares, which traded at about $1.40 in February,
soared to about $22 in early March. It was not clear how much Sayre
paid for his shares, but the SEC said realized illegal profits of
$1.4 million from sales of eConnect stock.

<HEADLINE> Actor Larry Linville Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry Linville, best known for his portrayal of
the power-hungry and neurotic Maj. Frank Burns on the CBS
television show ''M A S H,'' died Monday at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Linville suffered from cancer and had a lung removed in 1998
after a malignant tumor was discovered. Longtime manager Barry M.
Greenberg of Los Angeles said Linville was hospitalized Sunday and
died of complications of pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Linville was a native of Ojai, Calif., and had been living in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was wonderfully refreshing and irreverent but always a very
talented and professional guy,'' Greenberg said. ''He took this
cancer thing better than anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Linville was part of a breakout cast that made ''M A S H'' one
of the longest-running shows on television. He starred with Alan
Alda, Gary Burghoff and Wayne Rogers as part of an ensemble that
launched the show in 1972, on the heels of the hit movie of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   The show, at times with comedy, at times with stark political
commentary, detailed life at the 4077th Mobil Army Surgical
Hospital, where Linville was a whiny, military stickler smitten
with the head nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the show's early action revolved around the antics of
tent-mates Burns, Hawkeye Pierce (played by Alda) and Trapper John
McIntyre (Rogers). But the show also took on serious topics of war
and bloodshed, often seemingly more relevant to the Vietnam War
than the conflict in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Linville left ''M A S H'' after the fifth season. He went on to
guest star on numerous television series and had roles in ''Grandpa
Goes to Washington,'' ''Checking In'' and ''Paper Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Linville is survived by his wife, Deborah Linville.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks slipped Tuesday morning, with
high-technology issues pulling down the market. The U.S. dollar was
higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 19.45 points,
or 0.09 percent, to 20,599.61 at the end of the morning session. On
Monday, the average closed up 366.25 points, or 1.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.42 yen in late morning trading, up 0.36
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
106.47 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei started lower, with technology
stocks initially pulling back after sharp losses on the U.S. Nasdaq
market Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But after an initial sell-off, broad buying and a stabilizing
technology sector helped the average recoup some losses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq composite index fell 258.25 to 4,188.20,
its second largest point drop. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 75.08 to 11,186.56 at Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section was down 4.34 points, or 0.25 percent,
to 1,712.40. The TOPIX closed up 39.12 points, or 2.33 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved slightly higher in slow
trading as investors grew cautious ahead of a weekend meeting of
Group of Seven finance officials.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday he will tell G-7
counterparts that Japan's stance on foreign exchange is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have seen for yourselves what we do when we feel that a
rapid strengthening of the yen is problematic,'' Miyazawa said at a
regular news conference, referring to dollar-buying intervention in
currency markets by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the yen's rapid rise against the
greenback could hurt Japan's unstable economic recovery by making
exports more expensive abroad, and cutting into the earnings of
export-led companies.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 -- the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Germany - will
gather in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.39 yen, up from
101.50 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7400 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its price
fell 0.04 point to 101.38.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Census Reaches Minimum Goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 2000 Census has reached its minimum goal
for responses with 61 percent of U.S. households completing and
mailing back their forms as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials have said they hope to reach a national
response rate of 70 percent, reversing a decades-long decline. In
1970, the response rate was 78 percent, but that fell to only 65
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt called the response rate
encouraging, but said they still had a long way to go to reach a
complete count.
</P>
<P>
   ''Census 2000 will succeed only if people cooperate fully,'' he
said
</P>
<P>
   A $168 million advertising campaign has been encouraging
Americans to return the 115 million questionnaires that were mailed
out early last month.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the Census Bureau will begin sending workers to
visit households that have not returned their census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 7 percent of the nation's jurisdictions have met or
exceeded their target response rate.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 8, Astros 7  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mark McGwire homered for the third straight game,
and Edgar Renteria and Ray Lankford hit consecutive homers off Jose
Lima, leading the St. Louis Cardinals over the Houston Astros 8-7
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, tied with Arizona for the best record in the major
leagues at 6-1, has 20 homers, most in the big leagues. In Enron
Field's fourth game, the teams combined for eight home runs, two
more than the previous record for a major league game in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire homered in his 35th major league ballpark, one shy of
the record held by Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff. McGwire has 525 career
homers and needs nine to tie Jimmie Foxx for ninth on the career
list.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (1-1), a frequent victim of the long ball, allowed his
first three homers of the year after giving up 34 in 1998 and 30
last season.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew hit his fourth of the season, a two-run drive off Jose
Cabrera in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward homered twice for Houston, and Craig Biggio and
Richard Hidalgo also connected.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds went 4-for-4 for the Cardinals. The game drew
36,324, about 6,000 short of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hengten (2-0) allowed three runs and four hits in six
innings, and Dave Veres got three outs for his second save. With
the potential tying run on first and two outs in the ninth,
pinch-runner Glen Barker was throwing out trying to steal second by
catcher Mike Matheny.
</P>
<P>
   Lima gave up five runs and eight hits in seven innings, striking
out eight.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis led 8-3 in the eighth, but Houston closed when Jeff
Bagwell hit a two-run double off Heathcliff Slocumb and Ward
followed with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Ward hit a solo homer in the second, but St. Louis made it 5-1
in the third on Renteria's two-run homer and Lankford's shot, both
over the short left-field porch.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio homered in the sixth and Hidalgo connected in the
seventh, chasing Hentgen and making it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Paquette hit an RBI triple in the eighth off Cabrera.
Drew's homer gave him four long balls among his five hits this
year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bagwell, who entered hitting .200 in the first six games,
shaved off most of the lengthy goatee that had been the talk and
photo-op of spring training. It didn't help much. He went 2-for-4.
... Hentgen boosted his career road record to 59-23. ... The
Cardinals have hit consecutive homers three times this season. ...
Previously, the record for home runs at Houston was six, which
occurred five times, most recently last Aug. 9 in a game involving
the New York Mets.
