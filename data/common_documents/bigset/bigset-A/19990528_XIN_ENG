<HEADLINE> Ultraviolet Light May Cure Sick Building Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sick building syndrome may be
treated by installing ultraviolet lights in ventilation systems,
researchers in Canada have suggested.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that the so-called sick building
syndrome, with symptoms like headaches, fatigue, difficulties in
concentrating and respiratory problems, occurs in 20 to 30 percent
of office workers.
</P>
<P>
A pilot study by McGill University, Canada, showed that the
health of office workers improved after ultraviolet lights were
installed in the ventilation systems serving three floors of an
office building in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
In total, 113 management employees worked on these floors, of
which over 80 percent were non-smokers. The lights were switched
on and off for a total of four alternating blocks of three weeks
each.
</P>
<P>
The levels of airborne bacterial and fungal organisms remained
the same throughout the study, but were virtually eliminated from
the surfaces of the ventilation system within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The employees reported fewer symptoms when the ultraviolet
lights were operating and took less sick leave. They were aware
that the lights had been installed, but could not tell when they
had been switched on or off.
</P>
<P>
Employees are not directly exposed to the UV rays, so the
system is safe, and is relatively cheap, the researchers reported
in the latest issue of Occupational And Environmental Medicine, a
British medical journal.

<HEADLINE> Sudan-Egypt Ties to Return to Normal: Sudanese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail said on Thursday the Sudanese-Egyptian relations are
"strategic and important."
</P>
<P>
Ismail made the remarks in an interview with the Cairo-based
Voice of Arab radio over telephone from Algiers, Algeria, where he
is on a visit.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum-Cairo ties "are strategic and important" both for
the interests of the two countries and the Arab national security
as well as stability in Africa, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister expressed his country's
confidence that the ties between the two neighbors will be
restored to normal.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese relations became tense in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding the assassination attempt
on President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants who
attempt to topple the secular Egyptian government and install a
strict Islamic rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sudan denied both charges. And the two countries have been
stepping up efforts to improve the ties in the recent two years.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said his recent meeting with his Egyptian counterpart
Amr Moussa on Saturday in Cairo was aimed at improving the
bilateral ties, adding that the two sides will soon hold talks on
security issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will discuss the strengthening
of European defense during their summit in Toulouse, southern
France, on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said on
Thursday that France and Germany will make new proposals on
European defense issues to their European Union (EU) partners at
the next EU summit to be held in Cologne, Germany, in early June.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Schroeder will also talk about the newest
development of the conflict over Kosovo, the reform of EU
institutions and the establishment of an office within EU for
foreign policy and security issues.
</P>
<P>
"The Toulouse summit should allow France and Germany to make
proposals to their partners at the Council (summit) of Cologne,"
said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"After the single currency euro, European defense should be the
next great ambition of the European Union," she added.
</P>
<P>
She denied that France is isolated among its EU partners in
calling for the construction of a European defense system, with
most other European countries being satisfied with the role being
played by NATO in European defense.
</P>
<P>
"There have been major development, with the nearing of
position between France and Britain (over European defense) and
the pursuit and intensification of Franco-German dialogue," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Capital Cities' Union Meets in Maputo to Seek Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The 15th congress of the union of
Portuguese-speaking Asian and African capital cities opened here
Thursday to discuss ways of winning more financial aid from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Leonardo SImao, Mozambican
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, urged members of the
union to strengthen cooperation to help solve the problems their
cities are facing.
</P>
<P>
Simao listed their problems as the lack of funds, the
deterioration of environment, the destruction of infrastructure
facilities, crimes and drug abuse, especially in African cities.
</P>
<P>
The union can play its role in reducing the losses by the
military conflicts in Bissau, capital of Guinea Bissau, a member
of the capital cities' union, Simao said.
</P>
<P>
Joao Soares, Mayor of Lisbon, capital of Portugal, who doubles
as the union's chairman, reiterated the union's support to Bissau,
saying that the union should give more concern to Bissau and
include the aid to Bissau into its agenda for discussions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss the entrance application for the
union from cities like Dili of East Timor, Goa of India and Belem
of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Africa's Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde,
Guinea Bissau, and Sao Tome &AMP; Principe attended the meeting along
with delegations from Europe, Asia and the Americas.

<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
in the red Thursday as Wall Street opened down and the
euro recovered half a cent after plumbing a new depth of
1.0407 U.S. dollars recently.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE 100 proved the most resilient of the main
markets, closing 37 points lower at 6199.5, a fall of 0.6
percent, after late buying sparked a mini rally.
</P>
<P>
The index fell 26.1 points by lunchtime to 6210.7 on
expectation that Wall Street would be unable to keep a
grip on Wednesday's strong gains.
</P>
<P>
But a number of big risers on the FTSE 250 Index saw
the second liners' board put on gains of more than 20
points.
</P>
<P>
Predictions of stronger economic growth for next year
from the Confederation of British Industry failed to help
the blue chips.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt suffered heavy losses as the Xetra Dax dived
almost 2.3 percent at the closed, a fall of 119 points, to
5064.31.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 gave up 50 points to end at
4326.44, a loss of 1.15 percent, as investors ignored a
rise in the influential INSEE business confidence index
for May and a quarterly 0.3 percent rise in GDP, in line
with forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Admits Fresh Fighting on Ethio-Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A fresh military conflict Broke
out on the Ethio-Eritrean border area Tuesday and Wednesday,
Ethiopia said Thursday
</P>
<P>
The office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse
said in a press statement issued here that Eritrean forces
"initiated hostilities" on May 25-26 (Tuesday and Wednesday) in
the western front near the Mereb River and the Ethiopian defense
forces "quickly repelled the attacks".
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia inflicted heavy damage on the Eritrean forces,
killing 865 Eritrean soldiers and wounding 1,600," the statement
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The fresh border crash followed a two-day fighting in the
western front near the Mereb River beginning May 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean side said 380 Ethiopian soldiers were
killed and 975 injured in four days of fighting starting May 22.
</P>
<P>
The border crisis between the two Horn of Africa countries
began on May 6, 1998. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted the
peace plan of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). However,
they have different interpretation on a proposed withdrawal of
Eritrean troops contained in the OAU framework agreement. Ethiopia
 says Eritrea must withdraw from all "occupied territory" while
Eritrea says the withdrawal of troops only applies to the Bademe
region.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout of S. African Special Voters Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Low turnout was reported
during Wednesday's voting by special voters outside South Africa
because of work, business or study commitments, the Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures showed that only 770 votes were cast across
the world.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu was not overly concerned
about the low turnout, saying: "We have never expected an
overwhelming response."
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the figure might have been higher if citizens
traveling abroad had known earlier that they would be able to vote
if they had registered.
</P>
<P>
The concession enabling registered citizens to vote abroad only
came after registration had closed in March.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of foreign special votes so far were cast in
Gaborone, Botswana (194), followed by Mbabane, Swaziland (138).
</P>
<P>
At least in six embassies no special votes were cast, including
those in Spain, Angola, and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The number of special votes in South Africa on Wednesday was
not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said hitches at voting stations on Wednesday included
confusion on the part of presiding officers about the difference
between special votes and declaration votes.
</P>
<P>
Special votes at home are votes by security personnel on
election duty on June 2, IEC officials, and voters who would be
abroad on June 2. Declaration votes are those cast by voters who
could not be able to vote in the district where they had been
registered.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said ballots at stations where illegal voting might have
taken place would be put aside.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with the multi-party liaison committee that all those
ballots would be put in quarantine and only examined after June 2.
It is quite possible that they might not be an issue by that
time."
</P>
<P>
Other problems that cropped up related to communication
problems at some voting stations. Security forces were also not
fully deployed in some high- risk areas.
</P>
<P>
"But we are resolving all those matters," Mchunu said.
</P>
<P>
No problems with the voters' roll were recorded.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu's deputy, Norman du Plessis, said the hijacking of an
IEC vehicle that carried a load of ballot papers on Wednesday was
not a threat to the integrity of the election.
</P>
<P>
The papers were recovered hours later in Soweto near
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Du Plessis said ballot papers needed to have a special stamp on
the reverse side before they were valid. Electoral officers would
attach the stamp to the back of each ballot paper handed to voters
on election day.
</P>
<P>
"We transport the ballot papers and the stamps separately. So
it is of no use to try and steal papers."
</P>
<P>
On electioneering on the eve of election day, Mchunu said
political parties would be allowed to continue campaigning and to
hold public meetings until midnight on June 1.
</P>
<P>
But election advertisements on radio and television would be
prohibited from midnight on May 31 in terms of Independent
Broadcasting Authority regulations.
</P>
<P>
No political activities would be allowed on June 2. "But
distributing pamphlets or using a loud hailer to encourage people
to vote on June 2 will be in order," Mchunu said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Tighten Belts Under New Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians should be ready to "tighten
their belts" under the in-coming civilian administration as the
new government plans to take austerity measures to tackle a public
sector deficit, Vice-President-elect Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
At the presentation of a book on the Nigerian economy held here
Thursday, he said that the public sector deficit was expected to
record more than 300 billion Naira (about 3.16 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that the administration which comes
into office Saturday was, until recently, ignorant of the extent
of the country's economic problem.
</P>
<P>
"Some of us did not know the magnitude of our current economic
problems.. . We now know the economy is in a much serious position
than we thought," Atiku pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ogwuma, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, last week
said foreign reserves had fallen from seven billion dollars to 3.1
billion dollars, and economists estimate that this could fall to
1.5 billion dollars before Saturday's hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preparation is in top gear for Saturday's hand-over
ceremony with final parade rehearsals Thursday at the "Eagle
Square" in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Troops from the armed forces as well as para-military outfits
and school children took part in the rehearsals at the square with
a bullet-proof presidential box.

Fire works, cultural and callisthenic displays are part of the
vigil activities planned for Friday night to usher in the

JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of a crushing

</P>
<P>
"God willing, we will make a comeback," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been roundly blamed for the Likud's dismal
showing in the parliamentary elections in which the ruling party
plummeted from 32 to 19 seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
He had resigned as head of the Likud Party soon after exit
polls forecast his defeat on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aides have said he planned to take a break from
politics in order to write a book and make the rounds on the
U.S. lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said Netanyahu planned to
write a book about his three years in office and had offered to
address business groups, universities, Jewish organizations and
institutes, many in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Political life has a very broad definition. If he lectures
around the world, it is hardly leaving politics," Bar-Illan said.

<P>
Meanwhile, Likud veteran, outgoing Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon was elected as Likud's temporary leader at Thursday's

<P>
CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
has decided to provide a loan of 33 million U.S. dollars to
Egypt's Alexandria National Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to the effect was signed on Thursday by ADB
Chairman of Board of Directors Omer Kabbaj and the Egyptian
company's Chairman Ibrahim Salem Mohamedain, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported. But it did not give the interest rate and
the repayment period of the loan.
</P>
<P>
During its annual meeting which ended here Wednesday, ADB
concluded that it should take part in African infrastructure
ventures, with a focus on the private sector role in development
and economic reform, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the bank will also invest 27 million
dollars to buy 600,000 shares of the company, more than 5 percent
of the company's total capital, Mohamedain said at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Although the amount seems small, the stake is significant as it
will increase the shares held by the private sector from 37 to 42
percent, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian company produces about 1.8 million tons of iron
and steel a year, controls more than 50 percent of the Egyptian
iron and steel market and exports over 20 percent of its annual
products.

makes it almost impossible for him to continue" the peace
mediation.
</P>

"So, the decision of the tribunal is not going to help

we certainly are ready to continue our diplomatic efforts as was
stated by the foreign minister of Russia."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. war crimes tribunal Thursday confirmed in The Hague
that it had indicted Milosevic and four of his top aides for
crimes against humanity, including murder, during the Kosovo
conflict, which broke out in February last year since ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal decision came as the U.S.-led NATO is intensifying
air strikes on Yugoslavia, which began March 24.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a
statement here on the indictment of President Milosevic, saying

the Former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, informed me in person of the
Court's decision to indict President Soloban Milosevic and other
officials of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"The Tribunal was established by the Security Council.
According to its statute, it acts independently. The prosecutor
therefore must go where the evidence leads her," the statement

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada said Thursday that efforts being made to implement the
rural-centered development plan have produced encouraging results
in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the nation on the eve of eighth anniversary
of the demise of former Mariam Mengistu regime, President Negasso
said the implementation of the five-year plan (1995/96-1999/2000)
has enabled Ethiopia to be self-reliant in food.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the president told the
nation that consolidated efforts would be deployed to enable
Ethiopia at all levels to be full beneficiaries of the five-year
strategy of peace, development and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The president said the efforts to cultivate democracy through
the establishment of efficient administration, the police and
judicial bodies have continued.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts should also be exerted to address the problems
encountered in the course of the implementation of the five-year
plan.
</P>
<P>
On the over one-year border crisis with Eritrea, the president
said Ethiopia would continue to reinforce its defense forces to
guarantee national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia would ensure its sovereignty through the use of force
if Asmara does not pull out its invading forces from all occupied
Ethiopian territories," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Mengistu regime was overthrown on May 28, 1991.

<P>
CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah is due to pay
a visit to Egypt on Sunday at the invitation of President Hosni
Mubarak, the Jordanian ambassador in Cairo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's upcoming visit comes within an Arab and European
tour, which will also take him to Algeria, Tunisia and France,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Tarrad al-Fayez as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Egypt, Abdullah is expected to
discuss with Mubarak the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process and ways of advancing the peace process on the basis of
the land-for-peace principle, al-Fayez said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries which have
conceived peace with Israel, play a key role in mediating the
peace talks between the Palestinians and the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king will brief Mubarak on the outcome of his
latest regional tours and his talks with leaders of the United
States and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the Jordanian
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fayez added that Abdullah's visit to Egypt is part of the
continued consultation and exchanges of views between the two
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Egypt summit meeting will also deal with the
bilateral relations and means of further promoting the ties in
various spheres for the interests of the two peoples, he said.

TIRANA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- a South American reporter was
injured in the head in a shooting incident Thursday at the Morina
border crossing in north Albania.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) when the
reporter, whose identity was not given, was monitoring the
situation at the border crossing.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the field hospital of the Italian refugee camp in
Kukes, where he was rushed, said that the reporter was in a
"grave" condition and his life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
The reporter, who is about 30 years old, was expected to be
airlifted to Italy for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been running high along the Albania-Yugoslavia
border ever since NATO started air strikes against Yugoslavia as
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which is seen by Yugoslavia as a
terrorist group, has been taking the advantage of the NATO
bombardment to infiltrate into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the KLA rebels have been engaging in
fierce fightings with Serb soldiers in an attempt to open a new
route to Prizren, a Kosovo city 30 kilometers from the Morina
border crossing.
</P>
<P>
Serb artillery shells were said to land and explode at the
Albanian side of border from time to time when KLA rebels
retreated into border villages in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday morning, two Albanian border policemen were
seriously injured in mine explosions in the border village of
Bardhoc near the Morina crossing.

<HEADLINE> Faulty Gene Linked to Drug Resistance of Ovarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A faulty gene may cause anti-cancer
drug resistance in ovarian cancer patients and stop some women
responding to chemotherapy, British scientists said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery partly explains why at least a third of the
6,000 women in Britain who develop ovarian cancer each year cannot
be successfully treated, Britain's Cancer Research Campaign (CRC)
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The CRC said that research teams in its Glasgow laboratories
have identified a link between defects in particular genes, known
as "mismatch repair' genes (MMR), and resistance to many of the
traditional anti-cancer drugs used in chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The CRC researchers found that when the MMR gene is "switched
off", ovarian and other cancer cells become more resistant to
known anti-cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
Their studies have shown that a drug called "5-azacytidine" can
switch the MMR gene back on and lead to increased anti-cancer drug
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
The new findings, published in the medical journal Oncogene,
could also "provide important leads for other clinically useful
drugs which might reactivate the MMR gene", the CRC said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Labels Spying Claims Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The claims that China stole
nuclear technology from the United States are "totally
groundless," a Chinese diplomat said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in the United States stubbornly cling to a Cold
War mentality, are full of bias and hostility toward China and
have tried in all possible ways to create rumors about China," said
Liu Xiaoming, minister in the Chinese Embassy in the United
States, in an interview with Cspend TV.
</P>
<P>
"Their goal is to spread the theory of "China Threat", the
Chinese diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
A special U.S. House committee headed by Republican lawmaker
Chris Cox issued an 872-page report Tuesday, asserting that China
obtained secret information on seven nuclear warheads and the
neutron bomb in "two decades of espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Liu said China has learned a great lot from the United States
and the United States has also learned much from China through
normal exchanges of scientists between the two countries. "This
conforms to the mutual interests of China and the United States."
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders and Foreign Ministry spokesman have repeatedly
said China has never stolen any nuclear technology from the United
States and never conducted espionage in the country, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. congressmen disclosed that China has only 20 nuclear
missiles while the United States has 6,000 such missiles, Liu
said, adding that China's annual military budget is only 3 percent
of that of the United States. "How can China constitute a threat
to the United States?"
</P>
<P>
Liu also rejected the allegations that China contributed money
to U.S. presidential elections, saying that China has no such a
policy to bribe any elections in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cloned Sheep May Be Ageing Too Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Fresh concerns have been raised over
the safety of cloning with new findings suggesting that Dolly the
sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, may be getting
old faster than normal.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of Dolly's genetic material showed the so-called
telomeres, sequences of DNA which cap the ends of chromosomes,
were shorter in Dolly than in a normal sheep of the same age.
</P>
<P>
Telomeres protect chromosomes from fraying and are believed to
be involved in the ageing process.
</P>
<P>
They are thought to act as a "cellular fuse", bearing the brunt
of chromosomal erosion which is a natural by-product of DNA
replication that occurs when a cell divides.
</P>
<P>
This new discovery means that at genetic level Dolly may be at
least six years older than she should be, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The latest results were published Thursday in the science
journal Nature by PPL Therapeutics and the Roslin Institute in
Edinburgh, Scotland. The group includes members of the original
team involved in producing Dolly nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
After studying both Dolly and two other sheep clones produced
from embryos, the researchers found that all the three cloned
sheep had shortened telomeres.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Dolly's were the shortest, measured 19 units
compared with 24 in a normal sheep of the same age, according to
the report, which said that the effect in Dolly was "significant".
</P>
<P>
Dolly's genetic abnormalities are thought to reflect the age of
the six-year-old adult ewe from which she was cloned, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed that it was too early to say whether Dolly's
telomeres would shorten to the critical point where damage is
caused during her lifetime, because other research suggested they
would not.
</P>
<P>
The scientists believed that the new findings provide another
piece of evidence to make people to shy away from human cloning.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Shoots Down 2 Indian Mig Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday shot down two
Indian Mig jet fighters that "crossed into its territory" along
the disputed Kashmir border.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Information Minister Mushahid Hussain Thursday
confirmed the downing of the Indian jets at a special joint press
conference here which was also attended by Vice Chief of General
Staff Lt. General Anis Bajwa, Director General of Inter-Service
Public Relations Brigadier Rashid Qureshi and Foreign Office
Spokesman Tariq Altaf.
</P>
<P>
The first jet was shot down at 11:15 a.m. local time (0615 GMT)
and the second at 11:35 a.m. local time (0635 GMT), Mushahid said.
</P>
<P>
The two jets, one Mig-21 and the other Mig-27, were targeted by
Pakistani ground fire in the second round of India's air
operations in the Line of Control (LoC) region. India said it
launched the air campaign Wednesday to dislodge Pakistan-backed
militants from the Indian side of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
The first round of Thursday's air operations was carried out in
early morning.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the two fighters fell into the
Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. One pilot was killed and the
other captured, according to Mushahid.
</P>
<P>
India, however, said its air force jets had restricted the
operations to the Indian side only.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press conference, Altaf called on the
international community to impress upon India to observe restraint
along the LoC, saying that "it was India and not Pakistan which
was escalating the situation."
</P>
<P>
"We call upon our friends and the international community to
realize the situation and impress upon India to observe restraint
so that the situation does not get out of hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meaningful international engagement is an absolute necessity,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
India has been continuously refusing to accept any help from
abroad to settle the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistan Armed Forces are ready to defend the territorial
integrity of our motherland at any and every cost," said General
Bajwa at the joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Pakistan Air Force was conducting combat air
patrolling over the Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
On the weapons used to down the Indian fighters, Bajwa said it
is a classified information and cannot be disclosed to the public.
</P>
<P>
"It was a ground fire and the exact nature of the weapon cannot
be disclosed as it is a classified weapon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Pakistan and India has been mounting these days
because of the intense artillery dual that has been going on
uninterrupted for more than two weeks along the LoC in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 soldiers are reported to have been killed along
with scores of civilians on both sides in renewed clashes in the
Kargil and Drass sectors of the LoC which divides the Kashmir
region between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Wednesday blamed India for escalating the conflict
through launching air strikes against Kashmiris and said it would
take "all necessary actions" to defend its positions.

JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Bantwini
Ngcipe, who was killed in a raid on Maseru, capital of Lesotho, by
the former South African Defense Force in 1982, were exhumed at a
Maseru cemetery Thursday for reburial at his home in South Africa,
South African Press Association said.
</P>
<P>
Ngcipe was among 30 members of the African National Congress
(ANC) and 12 Basuto massacred in the raid in Maseru on the night
of December 9, 1982.
</P>
<P>
The family had organized a funeral service in Somerset East,
Eastern Cape, for Sunday to give their son "a decent farewell", a
spokesman for the family, Mandilakhe Dilima, said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the exhumation ceremony, Dilima said the families
of the 1982 massacre victims were barred from attending their
funerals in Maseru by the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
According to African tradition, the remains of Ngcipe would be
transferred home for reburial as a form of "spiritual healing of
the wounds caused by his brutal murder by the SADF", he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngcipe's family had opened the way for families of the other
victims of the massacre to arrange for repatriation of their
remains to South Africa for reburial, said the spokesman.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian special envoy for the
Balkans Viktor Chernomyrdin will fly to Belgrade Friday morning,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who was originally scheduled to travel to the
Yugoslav capital Thursday, is expected to arrive in Belgrade at 10:
00 local time (08:00 GMT), Tass said, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, left here for Bonn Thursday at
the end of another round of talks with Chernomyrdin on the Balkans,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari and Talbott are to meet with German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
There were no words on the result of the latest tripartite
talks on Yugoslavia, but Interfax quoted Finnish diplomats as
saying that the talks continue at the experts' level while the
heads of the delegations were out of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters that all the attempts
to resolve the situation in the Balkans without a dialogue with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were doomed.
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic is the elected president of Yugoslavia, the country
now in trouble. And to resolve the situation that has taken shape
in the Balkans there is only one man to deal with, and that is
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic," Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
He again condemned NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia, which
entered the 65th day Thursday, saying NATO's air campaign "creates
an extremely dangerous precedent for all international relations."
</P>
<P>
"We shall find ourselves in a deadlock if we recognize and
approve the use of force, if we admit that such conflicts as the
one in the Balkans can be resolved only by force," the spokesman
said.

<P>
ATHENS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday criticized the
intention of the International Court of Justice to bring charges
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Milosevic was "a politically unsound move
and Milosevic is being called upon to contribute to a solution of
the Kosovo crisis," the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
quoted Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the U.N. War Crime Tribunal in the Hague,
Netherlands, said that it had indicted Milosevic and four other
senior Serbs for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
As for Greece's stance toward the Yugoslav problem, Reppas said
that Greece regarded the draft peace proposals by seven Western
countries and Russia as "a good basis" for a political solution to
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the crisis, Greece has reportedly opposed
military campaign against Yugoslavia and favored a peaceful
solution to the crisis through political and diplomatic means.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Opposition Party Opposes Conflict in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Party of Social Democracy of
Romania (PDSR), the country's largest opposition party, on
Thursday expressed its strong opposition to the escalating
conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the party said it is against the designed
expansion of the armed conflict in Yugoslavia, through NATO's
engagement of ground troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
The party called for a halt of all hostilities and the
concentration of the efforts on a political solution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The PDSR also urged the United Nations to do its duty and take
firm and responsible action for the fulfillment of its obligations,
saying it is the duty of the U.N. Security Council to adequately
work toward the negotiated settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A sound basis of agreement can be the G8 proposal, and
Yugoslavia and its neighboring countries should be invited to
negotiate the agreements, the party said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, it added, an important role should be played by the
OSCE in applying the Council's decisions.
</P>
<P>
Conditions should be created without delay for all refugees to
safely return to their homes, and for a peaceful coexistence of
all people in Kosovo and all over Yugoslavia, it said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Olara Otunnu, U.N. special
representative for children and armed conflict, Thursday told
reporters that his week-long visit to Colombia is aimed at

</P>
<P>
Otunnu will start his Colombia trip on Sunday, the first
mission to Latin America, and he will return to New York on
Saturday next week.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important mission because the civil war in Colombia
is the longest conflict in Latin America," he said, "Children are
being massively used by all parties in the conflict" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by my presence in the country, to raise the
awareness of the fate of the children" in the country, he said,
another objective is "to explore whatever concrete steps" to
promote the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, "I would like to meet with everybody involved
in the conflict, and to make sure that the issue of the fate of
children will be put in the center of the country," he said. "I
will ask all parties not to recruit any more children" from now
on.
</P>
<P>
The special representative will visit Bogota, Medellin and
Apartado. He will hold talks with the Colombian Government
leadership and also with leaders of the two main guerrilla
movements, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and
the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The special representative, who serves as international
advocate for children affected by armed conflict by promoting
their rights, protection and welfare, has previously undertaken

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Ruling Party Commends National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front said Thursday that the cohesion of
the various nationalities of Ethiopia has been taking deep root
following the demise of the former Mariam Megistu regime in May
1991.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on the eve of the eighth anniversary of
the overthrowal of the former Mengistu regime which falls on
Friday, the Ethiopian ruling party said the new form of unity
Ethiopians forged based on equality and mutual respect has
nurtured the culture of tolerance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said encouraging results have been achieved in
the economic field over the last eight years, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the area of agriculture, the main-stay of the country, crop
output has significantly increased with the introduction of new
farming techniques, it said, adding "our achievements in the
agricultural sector indicate that our agricultural development
strategy is effective enough to realize rapid and sustainable
transformation."
</P>
<P>
"We celebrate the anniversary with renewed commitment to
development and democracy and intensified fight against
aggression," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party also called on the Ethiopian people and army
to carry on with their defense efforts until the sovereignty of
the country is restored in total.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 4.1 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. gross domestic product
(GDP) increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first
three months of the year, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete
source data than were available for the advance estimates issued
last month, the Department said. The increase in the GDP occurred
despite the fact that U.S. trade deficit from January through
March was even worse than originally believed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 6.8 percent increase in consumer spending,
which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, growth
in the first quarter was bolstered by a 10 percent increase in
business investment and a 15.4 percent rise in housing
construction, which has been enjoying boom times because of low
mortgage rates and record high levels of consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The new report said that the major contributors to the
increase in real GDP in the first quarter were personal
consumption expenditures and fixed investment. The contributions
of these components were partially offset by the effects of a
decrease in exports and an increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose just 1.1 percent, only
slightly faster than the modest 0.9 percent gain in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that corporate profits showed a big rebound
in the first three months of the year, increasing at an annual
rate of 31.8 billion dollars after having fallen at a rate of 5.3
billion dollars in wider trade deficit in today's revised figures.
The GDP was reduced from its estimate a month ago by the fact that
businesses were not building up inventories as fast as originally
thought, the Department said.

<HEADLINE> India Calls on NATO to Stop Bombing Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday called upon
the U.S.-led NATO to "immediately end its bombing," and proceed to
political negotiations on the basis of the respect of sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Kamalesh Sharma, Indian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said, "We once again urge NATO to immediately end its
bombing, and turn to a peaceful, negotiated settlement which
respects sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and guarantee peace and security
for all its citizens."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there can be no military solution to this
problem," the Indian ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact remains that NATO's bombing of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, for quite some time now not limited to military
targets, violates the Charter of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has also made infinitely worse the plight of the residents
of Kosovo, on whose behalf it decided to bomb other Yugoslavs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It has devastated the lives and the means of livelihood of the
entire population of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
India, together with China and Russia, has been lashing out at
the NATO unilateral military action against Yugoslavia, a
sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family, and calling
for an immediate end to the ongoing bombing and the beginning of a
political dialogue to seek a diplomatic solution.

<HEADLINE> 51 Percent Africans Live in Severe Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-one percent of the people in
sub- Saharan Africa live below the poverty line of 34 U.S. dollars
per month, the United Nations Information Centre (UNIC) said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNIC said in a statement that four out of every 10 Africans
lived in conditions of absolute poverty and evidence suggested
that poverty on the continent was increasing.
</P>
<P>
"To reduce poverty by half in Africa by the year 2015, gross
domestic product growth of about seven percent annually is needed.
 Africa's 3.3 percent growth rate for 1998 -- its fourth
consecutive year of positive growth -- was the highest among
regions of the world," UNIC said.
</P>
<P>
However, this growth was not distributed evenly across the
continent with growth rates in southern, eastern and western
Africa having declined in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said, of the 4.4 billion people in the developing
world, about a third lay in absolute poverty, with incomes of less
than one U.S. dollar per day.
</P>
<P>
A fifth go hungry every night, almost a third had no access to
clean water, nearly three fifths lacked basic sanitation, a fifth
had no access to modern health services, a quarter did not have
adequate housing and a fifth of the children did not attend school
to grade five, it added.

LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's education sector has been

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has lodged a strong
protest with India against violations of the Line of Control (LoC)
in the disputed area of Kashmir on Thursday morning, the Pakistani
Foreign Office said in a press release issued here.
</P>
<P>
The Indian charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Office
Thursday and Pakistan conveyed to him its grave concern at
repeated violations of the LoC by Indian aircraft, said the press
release.
</P>

Indian aircraft had crossed the LoC on Wednesday and hit with
rockets the area close to the LoC in the Indian sector and they
again intruded into Pakistan territory on Thursday, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
It added that two Indian aircraft were shot down and their
wreckage lies well inside Pakistan territory.
</P>
<P>
The Indian charge d'affaires was told that Pakistan, in the
past few days, had expressed the hope that India would avoid
"provocative military action" and that Pakistan reserved the right
to respond appropriately.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan claimed that these "provocations" have created an
"extremely dangerous" situation in the area and urged India to
avoid any further military escalation which could lead to
"incalculable consequences."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has apprised the United Nations of the dangerous
situation created by India's "reckless actions" across the Line of
Control in Kashmir, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Curb Iron Deficiency by Mandatory Flour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan planned to fortify domestic
flour with iron and folic acid on compulsory basis to cut down the
cases of iron deficiency by one-third by the year 2000, official
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iron deficiency anaemia has constituted a major health problem
to the Jordanian public, affecting mainly preschoolers and women
during pregnancy, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed anaemia prevailed among 35 percent
of pregnant women, 28 percent among mothers of reproductive ages,
15.3 percent among school children and 8.8 percent among infants.
</P>
<P>
Anaemia can cause maternal mortality, stillbirth, low birth
weight and maternal death if the pregnant woman suffers from
other material complications, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
The plan to introduce flour fortification to combat iron
deficiency is part of a national action plan for nutrition in
Jordan, said Osama Badran, an official at the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan entails fortifying local flour with
supplements in the four major flour mills in the capital city of
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Bread made from wheat flour is the most suitable food to
be fortified with iron and folic acid as it is consumed
by nearly 70 percent of the 4.6 million population of the
desert kingdom, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday voiced its support to
the decision by the U.N. war crimes tribunal to indict Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic for ``crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, French President Jacques Chirac said
that the decision by the tribunal is a ``major event which
confirms the legitimacy'' of the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton, both of
them ``expressing the same appreciation'' of the tribunal
decision, according to presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Paris,
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that France will
collaborate with the Hague-based tribunal and will respect its
decisions.
</P>
<P>
He said that France will keep in touch with Russia to pressure
Yugoslavia to accept the five-point conditions for ending the
Kosovo conflict which was presented by Western countries and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
``We will discuss with the Russians and we should obtain from
Belgrade, whatever the authorities of Belgrade should be, the
acceptance of these conditions,'' said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Louise Arbour, the general prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in the Hague, the Netherlands, Thursday confirmed that it
had indicted Milosevic and four of his top aids for crimes against
humanity, including murder, during the Kosovo conflict which broke
out in February 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese American Congressman Introduces Anti-racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- David Wu, the first Chinese
American Congressman in the United States, introduced here
Thursday a resolution recognizing the profound contributions of
Asian Americans to American life and condemning racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The Concurrent Resolution was introduced in the wake of the
release of the Cox report which alleged that China obtained
nuclear secrets through "espionage" in U.S. nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
David Wu, a Democratic Representative from Oregon, expressed his
concerns that the "loyalty and probity" of Americans of Asian
ancestry were brought into question due to "the recent allegations
of espionage and illegal campaign financing".
</P>
<P>
"Americans of Asian ancestry have made profound contributions
to American life, including the arts, our economy, education, the
sciences, technology, politics, and sports," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"As the first American Chinese in the U.S. House of
Representatives, I have a special responsibility to act on
behalf of the Chinese Americans across the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was cosponsored by Republican representative Tom
Campbell and 19 other lawmakers from both U.S. major parties.
</P>
<P>
"Any discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex,
age or religion must not be tolerated. This resolution is an
important step in speaking out against the scourge, and helps in
our effort to ensure equal opportunity for all in our society,"
Congressman Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Neil Abercrombie, a Congressman from Hawaii, said the
resolution will refute anti-Asian bias arising from misguided
reactions to the recent release of the Cox Report.
</P>
<P>
Norm Dicks, a member of the Cox Committee and also cosponsor of
the David Resolution, said in a press release that he was
concerned about the "collateral impact" of the Cox Report on the
Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, I worry that these circumstances could unleash
a negative attitude toward Chinese Americans and toward Asian
Americans in general, which could result in discrimination
against them," Dicks said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Namibian Parliament Rejects Diamond Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A law that would have
challenged the giant De Beers' monopoly in the diamond trade was
rejected Thursday by the Namibian Parliament, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to decriminalize and deregulate the sale of rough
diamonds in this southwest African country was approved last month
by a bipartisan committee.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Deputy Minister of Mines and Energy Jesaya Nyamu said
deregulation would encourage smuggling from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee advocated deregulation as a means of creating new
jobs and encouraging foreign investment, and appeared to have the
support of the Southwest African People's Organization, the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
De Beers currently controls most of the world's trade in uncut
diamonds through the Central Selling Organization in London and
its individual agreements with countries like Namibia, Botswana
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The agreements provide for stiff fines and imprisonment for
selling unpolished or uncut diamonds to anyone but the cartel.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is the world's fifth largest diamond producer,
accounting for about eight percent of the world output. Mining is
a crucial foreign exchange earner for Namibia, which became
independent from South Africa in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Russia -- another major source of diamonds -- and
Namibia signed an agreement to cooperate in diamond mining, a deal
that was seen as a check on De Beers. The two countries were also
reported to be considering joint efforts to cut and market
diamonds.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Mozambique, Tanzania,
Malawi and Zambia meet in Pemba in northern Mozambique Thursday to
discuss regional cooperation on the development of Mtwara
Development corridor.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said in his opening
speech that the success of the development corridor lies in the
joint efforts of the four countries, and urged the private sector
and various walks of the society to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that the development of the corridor, which will
help offer more job opportunities and alleviate poverty, is
another step for the sustainable development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Mtwara is a region in southeastern Tanzania bordering
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The corridor project covers the joint use of water and the
development of agriculture, fishery and mining industry for the
four countries, a Mozambican News Agency report said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 67 million people from the four countries
will benefit from the project.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Charges Against Milosevic "Respectable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua)--Germany Thursday expressed its support
for the charges of war crimes against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic by the international tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, the court in the Netherlands formally
announced to file charges against the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has taken notice of the decision "with great respect",
said Chancelor Gerhard Schroeder after meeting with visiting
European Union (EU) Kosovo mediator, Finnish President Marti
Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder did not say whether he was in favor or against the
decision. But he expressly supported the international tribunal's
work.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air war against Yugoslavia will not be affected by that
decision, said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
" We must strengthen our efforts, totally independent of a
decision by a court," he said in an interview with Germany's ZDF
television.
</P>
<P>
The decision belongs to job of the court, but Germany, which
serves as EU rotating president, supports the decision, said
Bonn's foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will cooperate more closely with the
international tribunal, the ministry said in a Thursday afternoon
statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Schroeder and Fischer stressed Bonn would still negotiate
with Milosevic on Kosovo peace, even with the decision.
</P>
<P>
" To achieve peace I would even shake hands with the devil,
that is the assignment for a foreign minister," said Fischer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farmers Receive 2 Billion Dollars in Disaster Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department
finally agreed to provide 2 billion dollars in long-approved funds
to farmers to help ease their financial hardship, ending an
eight-month delay that drew criticism from Congress.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Thursday that "this
assistance should provide additional, needed relief to farmers
still reeling from recent costly disasters."
</P>
<P>
The money was included in a 6 billion dollars farm bailout
package passed by Congress in October. Parts of the money,
including 2.8 billion dollars in payments to compensate for low
prices, already have gone out to farmers. The Agriculture
Department will begin mailing checks next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The disaster portion was more complicated because it covered
farmers with crop losses over several years before 1998 or losses
only in 1998 -- a provision that took an enormous amount of time
to compile, the Agriculture officials said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be paid 84.9 percent of qualifying single-year or
multiyear losses. No farmer could qualify for both; payments were
made at the higher of the two levels.
</P>
<P>
The average payment is 7,000 dollars while the maximum is
67,920 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said that Texas, which had a bad drought last year,
probably is one of the biggest benefactors, although money is
being disbursed in every state.
</P>
<P>
Other areas likely to get large checks include the Dakotas,
California, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money being paid out, about two-thirds, is for 1998
losses. The rest is for multiyear losses.

<HEADLINE> WB Finances Water, Sanitation Project in Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a credit of 21 million U.S. dollars for the West Bank and
Gaza Southern Area Water and Sanitation Improvement Project in
Palestine to help improve the sufficiency and efficiency of water
and wastewater services quality, quantity, and management.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit the citizens of Bethlehem and Hebron
in the West Bank, the World Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The project builds on the satisfactory implementation
experience of a similar project in Gaza strip. Accordingly, this
project supports the provision of a private sector operator under
a four-year, performance-based management contract which was
procured under International Competitive Bidding," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to improve the efficiency of the water
distribution system through leakage control, network
rehabilitation, and a program of water meter and pipe repairs and
replacements that are expected to reduce the unaccounted-for water
to below 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in operational efficiency through the private
sector management contract operator will also contribute to
increased revenues and reduced operating costs, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The overall project cost is 62.9 million dollars. The
21-million-dollar credit is provided by the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
arm, and will be repayable in 40 years, including a 10-year grace
period. The European Investment Bank is expected to contribute
35.69 million dollars while municipalities and village councils
within Bethlehem and Hebron will contribute the balance of 6.2
million dollars.

BONN, May 27 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Grehard Schroeder said
Thursday he would fully support the negotiating job of European
Union's Kosovo mediator, Finnish President Marti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
" Whatever decision the President has made, will have my
support," he said after meeting with Ahtisaari, who visited
Germany after days of talks in Moscow with Russian envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin and U.S. deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
" Sometimes there are things that have to give way to other
things, such as achieving peace in Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he might fly to Belgrade with Chernomyrdin on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
" We will try to find out, as soon as possible, whether there
are the conditions for a peaceful solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
His talks in Moscow were constructive, Ahtisaari said, adding
that Russia remained engaged in diplomatic deals for a settlement
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has insisted Milosevic still be a negotiating partner
after the international tribunal in The Hague filed charges of war
crimes against him.

<HEADLINE> CSSC Split into Two Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The China State Shipbuilding
Corporation (CSSC) will be split into two groups this year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Shipbuilding Corporation, one of China's two major
shipbuilders under the CSSC, will be under the control of the
first group, based in south China.
</P>
<P>
The Dalian Shipbuilding Corporation, the other major
shipbuilder, will be under the control of the second group, based
in north China.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the restructuring will be beneficial to
the country's shipbuilding industry in adopting a modern
enterprise system and making the best of regional advantages in
the two locations to further improve their competitive power on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
As the world's third-largest shipbuilding country following
Japan and the Republic of Korea, China has seen its shipbuilding
capacity increase rapidly to a current six million tons since the
country initiated its policy of opening-up and reform in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Chinese shipbuilders have seen the results of their
strenuous efforts to sharpen their competitive edge in the world
market, and recently several Greek shipping companies ordered 24
China-made vessels.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the Shanghai Shipping Exchange
Bureau said that shippers from the Middle East also intend to
order five 300,000-ton ships valued at a total of 600 million U.S.
dollars from China.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- India on Friday demanded an
immediate return of an Indian Air Force pilot captured by Pakistan
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan claimed that it shot down two Indian fighter jets in
the disputed Kashmir area Thursday with one pilot killed and one
captured. It said it would treat the captured pilot as a "prisoner
of war."
</P>
<P>
An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said here Friday
that Pakistan's deputy high commissioner, Akbar Zeb, was summoned
to the Foreign Office here, urging him to make his country
immediately return both the killed and captured pilots.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the recent events would hamper the process
of Indo-Pak dialogue, the spokesman said, " On our part, the door
to dialogue will never be closed. We stand by all the agreements
including the Lahore Declaration."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has repeatedly asserted that the
constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir could never be in doubt
and there could be no compromise on the country's territorial
integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan side, however, has maintained that Jammu and
Kashmir is a disputed area.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The 21 economies of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will jointly launch an
investment mart in an attempt to attract global investors back to
the Pacific rim region, South Korea's Trade-Investment Promotion
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first APEC Investment Mart, to be held in Seoul, capital of
South Korea, from June 2 to 5, will bring together close to 4,000
world leaders, economists, officials from international financial
bodies and multinational corporations, the South Korean
organization said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one government-operated pavilions will each detail
investment and business environments in its particular economy and
host meetings to explore specific investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Investors will be able to gather information, question policy
makers, compare tax breaks and incentives as well as negotiate
deals, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
"As the global economy restructures itself at a pace never
before seen, the region that accounts for half the world's
production is moving closer to free and open trade and
investment," South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The event "is an opportunity for investors from around the
globe, offering business leaders a chance to discover new and
exciting possibilities that the APEC region offers," the press
release quoted New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery gaining steam in the Asia-Pacific region,
notably in Thailand and South Korea, global investors are now
considering returning to the area, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
APEC, with a population of more than 2.5 billion, was
established in 1989 to facilitate the growing inter-dependence of
the region's economies.

<P>
Atchara Waiquamdee, the bank's chief economist, said the growth

<P>
Atchara said domestic demand is expected to increase from 2.5
percent to 3 percent due to improvement in the business sentiment
of the public.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Rises 0.5 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income rose 0.5
percent in April while their spending followed on its heels with a
rise of 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The personal income, which includes wages, interest and
government benefits, has grown every month so far this year,
climbing 0.3 percent in March, 0.5 percent in February and 0.6
percent in January, according to the Department's latest report.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, spending has also risen steadily and
even more quickly.
</P>
<P>
That trend dragged the savings rate -- savings as a percentage
of after-tax income -- to a record low of minus 0.7 percent last
month. Savings have now been in negative territory for five of the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
In April, the 0.4 percent overall spending increase was
slightly less than in previous months. Spending had been up 0.5
percent in March, 0.8 percent in February and 0.6 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods, such as washing machines and cars
fell 0.8 percent in April. That was more than offset by a 0.4
percent rise in spending on nondurable products such as food and
fuel, and a 0.7 percent increase in purchases of services.
</P>
<P>
Last month, wages rose 0.6 percent, after increasing 0.2
percent in March. Continuing stock market gains and other profits
also are lining many people's pockets. Interest and dividend
income rose last month, along with rental incomes and business'
owners incomes.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Repeats Call for World Intervention in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday reiterated its
call for an urgent international intervention to defuse the
tension in the Kashmir region sparked by India's "unwarranted" air
strikes in India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Indian army's action in Kashmir will exacerbate the tension in
the region and we expect the international community to take
cognizance of the situation," Information Minister Mushahid
Hussain told a press briefing here on the situation at the Line of
Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Thursday's shooting down of India's two Mig jet
fighters by Pakistan, he said the Indian military establishment
seems to be confused and misleading not only Indian public opinion
but also the authorities in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan invited the international media to see the
wreckage of the Indian planes which fell some 12 kilometers inside
Pakistan's territory.
</P>
<P>
"This has vindicated our position that these planes were
violating our airspace," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said India should de-escalate the situation at the LoC
because "they started the escalation."
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is in their (India's) own interest as well as for
regional peace to de-escalate the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the escalation at the LoC has vindicated
Pakistan's long-standing call for a just solution to the Kashmir
problem.
</P>
<P>
"The peace and security in this region can be ensured only
through a just political settlement of the Kashmir issue which is
a fundamental reality," Hussain stressed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the international community will take note of the
escalation at the LoC.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reiterated Pakistan's willingness for
dialogue to resolve the outstanding dispute. "We have been
committed to dialogue on any and all issues that has to be started
with the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Director General of Inter Services
Public Relations Brig. Rashid Qureshi said an Indian gunship
helicopter crashed Friday inside India-held Kashmir, but he was
not clear if it was shot down by "freedom fighters" or it crashed
due to some technical fault.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi denied the Indian allegation that the helicopter was
shot down by Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says to Review N.Ireland Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government said on
Friday it was keeping the security situation in Northern Ireland
under review following a string of random attacks by Protestant
paramilitary groups on Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said in a statement she
believed the ceasefire was holding but that recent attacks, like
the murdering of well known Catholic lawyer Rosemary Nelson, were
a cause for gravest concern.
</P>
<P>
"I am monitoring the situation closely, and should I judge it
right to act using the powers available to me, I shall not
hesitate to do so," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The last few weeks have seen a series of terrorist style
attacks, involving firearms, explosive devices and petrol bombs,"
Mowlam added.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the beginning of May there had been twenty
such incidents, as well as 15 paramilitary assaults.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam also promised to act if evidence showed the loyalist
paramilitaries were linked to the car bomb.
</P>
<P>
She spoke after a BBC radio report said security reports showed
the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which is officially on ceasefire,
had taken part in the murdering.

<HEADLINE> Bosnich Ready to Replace Schmeichel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Mark Bosnich looks set to end
Manchester United's long search for a successor to departing
goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
The Aston Villa star has been linked with a move to Old
Trafford for much of the season, after refusing to renew his
contract with John Gregory's side.
</P>
<P>
And the decision of Ajax's Edwin van Der Sar - another long-
term target of Reds boss Alex Ferguson - to reject United and join
Juventus instead has brought the move a step closer.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, Bosnich is poised to sign
next week.
</P>
<P>
And United chief executive Martin Edwards increased the
speculation when he announced: "We expect developments on Peter
Schmeichel's successor within the next few days."
</P>
<P>
Bosnich is available on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling.
</P>
<P>
However, he is likely to command a salary of up to eight
million pounds over four years - and his wage demands have already
caused problems in his negotiations with the treble winners.
</P>
<P>
Schmeichel, who played his last game for United in the
triumphant European Cup final on Wednesday, had always planned to
leave Old Trafford at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to finish his playing days in his native Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Consider Importing Alien Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering to import
workers from abroad legally as the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare is planning to ask an agency concerned to conduct a study
on the appropriate ways, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TNA said Labor Ministry officials had said they would ask
the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board
(NESDB) to conduct the study to help ease labor shortages in the
country in some specific areas in the long run.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the financial crisis in mid 1997, the
unemployment rate in Thailand has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the jobless rate is estimated at 6 percent of the
total labor force, or more than 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has taken a series of measures to tackle
the problem and one of them is the deportation of illegal alien
workers.
</P>
<P>
However, few Thais wanted to fill in some of the job vacancies
left by deported foreign workers since they were mostly heavy in
labor intensity and less paid.
</P>
<P>
Local manufacturers and proprietors said Thai workers were not
interested in working in some areas even though they were given
higher wages due mainly to their unwillingness to move from their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB was asked to seek a solution to the problem in the
long run as an extension, approved by the Labor Ministry, of
hiring illegal alien workers expires on August 4.

The statement said that the indictment was an attempt to

describing the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as "
a tool" dominated by the United States and NATO.
</P>

In a related development, Yugoslav Ambassador to the U.N

indictment of President Milosevic, denouncing it as an excuse for

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- French oil group Elf Acquitaine said
on Friday that it was trying to take over the Norwegian private
oil company Saga with two billion euros (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Elf Chief Executive Officer Philippe Jaffre said that his
group will buy in cash each share of Saga with 115 Norwegian
crowns (14.6 U.S. dollars), which he said is "a friendly offer."
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian public oil groups Norsk Hydro and Statoil have
also offered to buy out Saga, and the Norwegian government has
expressed its intention to keep Saga under the Norwegian flag.
</P>
<P>
In order to win the competition, Elf has offered 8 percent more
money to purchase Saga than its rivals do.
</P>
<P>
If Elf can absorb Saga, about 30 percent of its oil and gas
production and proved reserves will be from Norway, which has a
huge offshore oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
Saga, which is suffering from financial problems, produces 200,
000 barrels of crude oil each day, while Elf's Norway branch
produces only half of that.
</P>
<P>
A takeover of Saga will let Elf produce 1.3 million barrels per
day in 2000 and 1.5 million barrels in 2002 in Norway.

<HEADLINE> Canada Couldn't Send More Soldiers: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian army would have trouble
sending any more than its current commitment of 800 soldiers to
the Balkans, said the Chief of Defense Staff General Maurice Baril.
</P>
<P>
The senior official warned Thursday that overworked Canadian
soldiers risk becoming burned out and demoralized if the
government commits a large number of additional troops to the NATO
force in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"I think, in the long run, it would be devastating," Baril said
following the release of his annual report to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Canada has already agreed to send 800 soldiers to participate
in NATO's peacekeeping force for Kosovo. They are to arrive in the
region next month.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced this week it is expanding the number of ground
troops in Macedonia from 28,000 to 45,000.
</P>
<P>
Canada could double the Kosovo commitment, but at a price,
Baril said. "If we are asked to double our contribution it will be
(a question of ) how long can we sustain it."
</P>
<P>
Canada might also have to say it simply can't send any
additional troops beyond current commitments or transfer Canadian
troops from lower priority overseas operations to Kosovo, Defense
Minister Art Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
NATO planners are to meet next Monday to consider the size of
an anticipated peacekeeping force for Kosovo and to hear from the
19 member countries what each can contribute.

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Official Sentenced to Death in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An official charged with
corruption was sentenced to death and permanent deprivation of
political rights in central China's Hunan Province today.
</P>
<P>
In a first instance trial, the Intermediate People's Court of
Changsha, capital of Hunan, found Lin Guoti, former director and
Party chief of the Hunan Provincial Mechanical Industry
Administration, guilty of taking bribes worth a total of over 5.27
million yuan (about 650,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During his term of office from August 1992 to August 1998, the
56-year-old Lin, along with his wife Zhao Youjuan and his son Lin
Ruhai, took bribes 29 separate times from 13 different people, who
in return received business contracts, promotions, job transfers
or licenses and loans from Lin, said the court.
</P>
<P>
Lin had earlier been called the "number one grafter" in the
history of Hunan by the local news media.
</P>
<P>
Lin's son was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent
deprivation of political rights and his wife was sentenced to six
years in jail for their roles in the case and their attempt to
conceal the illicit money during police investigations.
</P>
<P>
The court also decided to confiscate Lin's property worth 1.05
million yuan and his son's property worth one million yuan, and
impose a 30,000-yuan fine on Lin's wife.
</P>
<P>
All the money and some 1,500 items, including many antiques and
curios Lin had accepted as bribes, will also be confiscated into
the state coffer, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 local citizens and journalists from several dozen
news organizations heard the sentence of the court.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not to Participate in Any NATO Military Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
reiterated Friday that his country would not participate in any
military operation by NATO in Kosovo in line with the stance it
has stated since the beginning of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Parliamentary debate on the Kosovo crisis, Simitis
said that Greece had successfully, and without becoming
internationally isolated, opposed NATO's military operation in
Yugoslavia, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He also slammed the policy of the European Union (EU) toward
the Balkans as "completely wrong," saying that the EU should have
been more far-sighted and bolder in developing a specific and
comprehensive strategy for the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The EU should have understood and recognized ahead of time that
only a deeper approach to all the Balkans would have gradually
resolved the problems of democracy and under-development these
countries were facing, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that unfortunately, the EU did not proceed with
elaborating and implementing the appropriate policy toward the
Balkans with the result that it was unable to avert the Kosovo
crisis and, in the end, the clash.
</P>
<P>
The EU would have to contribute to achieving peace at the
coming EU summit which is to take place in Cologne on June 3, he
said, adding that peace must be achieved now because later things
would be much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos
Kranidiotis also warned that any change of borders without the
consent of the parties concerned was tantamount to the overturning
of the international order which had prevailed for many decades.
</P>
<P>
Any change would set a bad precedent, in effect opening up a "
Pandora's box", since it would overturn the order of things and
with it, the stabilization that every system needed, he told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece would once again express the view at the
Cologne summit that war could not lead to a solution and all the
parties concerned must persist with efforts for a diplomatic and
peaceful solution to the crisis on the basis of the principles
which they all want to see implemented.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that it opposes the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia and has worked hard on the diplomatic front to
seek a political settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, as a member of NATO, Greece has extended the alliance
logistical support and allowed the use of its northern port of
Thessaloniki for the passage of NATO troops and supplies to the
peacekeeping force based in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Recently, to help find a diplomatic settlement to the crisis,
Greece requested NATO to temporarily suspend its troops transit
through Thessaloniki while proposing a 48-hour cease-fire in the
Yugoslav conflict.

<HEADLINE> 2 Singapore-Acquired Submarines Launched in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Ministry of Defense
Friday declared that two Singapore-acquired submarines were
launched Friday morning in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that Rear-Admiral Teo Chee
Hean, Singapore minister for education and second minister for
defense, officiated the launching ceremony held at the Kockums
Shipyard in Kariskrona, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The two submarines, designed and built by the Swedish company
of KOCKUMS and commissioned as RSS CENTURION and RSS CONQUEROR,
are of the Sjoormen type, a single-hull submarine 51 meters in
length, 6.1 meters in width and 1,200 tons in submerged
displacement. The twin-engine submarine has the capability of
navigating underwater at a speed up to 16 knots (29.6 kilometers
per hour).
</P>
<P>
Teo was quoted as saying at the ceremony that in uncertain
times left over by the Asian economic crisis, Singapore has to be
even more alert and prepared to handle any contingencies that may
arise.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense capability underpins Singapore's security and
long-term competitiveness, and we are committed to ensuring a

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official said
here Friday that the government and various training bodies would
provide more vocational training and employment assistance for the
youth to facilitate their employment.
</P>
<P>
"The employability of a young person would be enhanced if he
could acquire a marketable and job specific skill, " said
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) at the 12th meeting of the task
force on employment.
</P>
<P>
Officials present at the meeting noted that the unemployment
rate for persons aged 15-19 in Hong Kong increased to 23 percent
in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Vocational Training Council (VTC) has been placing more
emphasis on designing courses that achieve a balance between
specific and all-round vocational skills. The placement rate of
graduates from many of the VTC's technical education and pre-
employment training courses has exceeded 90 percent despite the
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
The VTC will introduce, as from September 1999, a new one-year
full-time foundation diploma to 2,000 secondary 5 leavers with
three passes in the Hong Kong certificate of education examination
or equivalent and two-year full-time and three-year part-time
certificate in vocational studies courses for 1,400 secondary 3

<HEADLINE> COST Approves Cyprus as Full Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The committee of senior officials
of the European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and
Technical Research (COST) has approved Cyprus as full member, the
Cyprus News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting held in Warsaw on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
COST is a framework through which European Union member states
cooperate with third states on issues of research and technology.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for COST membership in December 1996, but it did
not get the status of an observer because of Turkey's objections
until May 27, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claimed at the Thursday meeting that the government of
the Cyprus Republic does not represent all Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
COST also approved Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia as full
members at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Golf Club Opens in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, South China, May 28 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of
the full 18 holes of Faldo Course at Mission Hills Golf Club here
on Friday, the golf club now offers the largest and most
comprehensive golfing facilities in Asia with 72 holes of
championship golf.
</P>
<P>
"The Faldo Course is an incredible layout. Its unique character
is ideal for major events and we have had an outstanding response
from golfing associations worldwide," said Reith Lawson, director
of Golf at Mission Hills.
</P>
<P>
South African Nick Faldo is a six PGA Tour title holder and his
trademark bunkering is thoughtfully placed to strike fear into any
player.
</P>
<P>
This is most evident on the 325 yard par 4. 3rd hole where the
fairway appears as an oasis of grass between a dessert of bunkers.
</P>
<P>
Covering a total area of 100 million square feet of land, the
Mission Hills Club with an investment capital of over 2 million HK
dollars (about 260 million US dollars) currently offers four 18
hole international championship standard golf courses designed by
American golf legend jack Nicklaus, who snatched 18 PGA Tour
titles, Asian golf king Jumbo Ozaki of Japan and Nick Faldo
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The golf club is the only one in China recognized by
prestigious US PGA, European PGA and Tournament Players Clubs as
an official venue for major international tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Asks UN to Take Note of Situation in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Friday that India's
recent military actions have "created a very dangerous situation
along the Line of Control (LoC) and undermine peace and security
in the region."
</P>
<P>
In his letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif emphasized that an envoy of the world body
should be sent to observe the situation in the face of Indian
actions in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf told a briefing that
Sharif has urged the U.N. chief to give "due consideration to this
extremely serious matter lest the situation gets out of control."
</P>
<P>
"We have exercised utmost restraint," Sharif said in his
letter, adding that "two nuclear powers should never be in a state
of confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Sharif accused India of failing to honor its commitments
concerning the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, saying
the onus squarely lies on New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
He charged that New Delhi not only refuses a U.N. role but also
rejects any third-party mediation on the issue which is contrary
to current international trends.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad is committed to the Lahore Declaration and the
dialogue process aimed at resolving all outstanding issues between
the two countries, especially the core dispute of Jammu and
Kashmir, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's commitment to peace process is firm," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office spokesman said the Indian forces' brutal
action against the Kashmiri people deserves serious international
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Pakistan's "serious concern over the Indian
oppression against Kashmiris in the Indian-held Kashmir and Indian
forces' firing from across the LoC."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Stresses Reform, Development, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here today that China will continue to unswervingly take
economic development as the central task, spare no effort to
promote reform and opening-up, and safeguard social and political
stability.
</P>
<P>
"We must faithfully uphold Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's
basic line and work hard for the attainment of the goals set by
the Party's 15th National Congress for our country's development
at the turn of the century," said Hu at a commencement ceremony
for 78 senior officials graduating from the Party School of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The officials, all principal leaders of various provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities across China and of
ministries and departments of the central government, have studied
Marxism and Deng Xiaoping Theory for three months at the Party
School.
</P>
<P>
"We're carrying out our reform, opening-up and modernization
drive in a complicated international environment," noted Hu, also
a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee and president of the Party School.
</P>
<P>
The more complicated the international situation becomes and
the more unexpected things happen, the more important that Chinese
people keep a sober mind, have a clear understanding of the
overall situation, and unify their thinking to unswervingly push
forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president went on to say that the recent U.S.-led NATO
missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has kindled
great indignation among people of various ethnic groups across
China.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to well protect and give full play to the
people's unprecedented patriotic passion and enthusiasm for
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that at the threshold of a new century, the CPC
is shouldering significant historical responsibility, so are the
Party officials at all levels, especially those medium and high-
ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
"After your graduation, I hope you can all play an exemplary
role for other officials and display a remarkable improvement in
your ideological and political awareness, style of work and
observance of the Party disciplines," he concluded.

DHAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A four-day Regional Policy-Level
Expert Group Meeting on the Trans-Asian Railway Southern Corridor
(TAR SC) ended here Friday after adopting an action plan and with
a consensus on the proposed route alignment of the main TAR SC.

recommendations of a study, commissioned recently by the U.N.
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) on the
techno-economic aspects of developing the TAR SC.
</P>
<P>
"There was a consensus on the proposed route alignment of the
main TAR SC which is of regional and international significance,"
said a press release issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The TAR SC starts from China's Yunnan Province passing through
Myanmar, India, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey
extends up to Bulgaria in Europe.

"All countries expressed their willingness and interest to
operationalize the routes wherever available," the release said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Up 4.8 Pct in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing output
rose by 4.8 percent year-on-year in April 1999 and recorded a
cumulative 6.1-percent growth in the first four months from a year
ago, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has maintained a growth momentum for
the fifth consecutive month since gyrating from negative to
positive territory in December 1998 and the growth was largely
contributed by the growth in the electronics and chemicals
clusters, according to data released by EDB.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster increased 11.3 percent over last April
and registered a 13.2-percent growth in the cumulative output for
the first four months of 1999 compared with the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew by 4.2 percent year-on-year bringing
the cumulative output up by 9.4 percent for the first four months
compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In April, the output of petrochemicals grew by 3.9 percent, the
pharmaceuticals industry recovered from its dip in March to grow
by 2 percent and output of the petroleum industry declined by 3.6
percent with poor margins and slacked demand in diesel and fuel
oil.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster dipped in April by 2
percent with the cumulative output for the first four months of
this year 3.6 percent lower than that produced in the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The precision, process and transport engineering segments
shrank by 0.7, 11.5 and 2.1 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Kashmiri Militants Claim Downing Indian Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Jehadi Council, an
alliance of 14 Kashmiri militant groups, Friday accepted
responsibility for shooting down an Indian gunship helicopter in
the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Downing of the Indian gunship helicopter is the result of the
collective operation of the all Mujahideen (holy war fighters) in
the council," chairman of the council Syed Salahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Four Indian Air Force personnel were killed Friday when an
Mi-17 chopper was shot down in the India-controlled part of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Salahuddin said the Mujahideen in the Kargil sector have not
changed their positions despite the firing of Indian jet fighters
and gunship helicopters.
</P>
<P>
He rejected an Indian defense official's claim that some 200
Mujahideen have been killed in the bombardment. "Two of our
Mujahideen have martyred -- one by firing of a gunship helicopter
while the other due to severe cold weather."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the Mujahideen have killed 150 Indian soldiers
and injured 200 others in the operation in the Kargil sector, he
alleged.
</P>
<P>
Salahuddin also rejected the Indian claim that Afghans are
fighting in the Kashmir valley.
</P>
<P>
He said Kashmiris are sufficient for Indian "occupation forces"
and such kind of utterances on the part of the Indian rulers is a
move to mislead world opinion.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Reviews Rules on Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it is reviewing the implementing rules of the Oil
Deregulation Law to find out whether under them "the oil industry
is developing in a manner that serves the public interest."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said President Joseph
Estrada had directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct the
review.
</P>
<P>
At the House of Representatives, some lawmakers are calling for
the repeal of the law, saying this has not stopped the three top
oil companies in the country from cartel-like operations,
particularly in jacking up the prices of their products.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui said the review will
cover the implementing rules and regulations issued by the DOE.
</P>
<P>
He added that the DOE would not hesitate to intervene if it
finds the prices of oil products have become unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui stressed, however, that the present prices of oil
products are reasonable, adding that these basically reflect the
higher costs of crude oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier radio interview, Barican also said that what is
really needed at the moment is more competition among oil
companies so that not a single group can control the prices of oil
products.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government on
Thursday strongly condemned the decision by the International War
Crimes Tribunal to indict Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the indictment was an attempt to
cushion the brutal crimes committed by NATO against Yugoslavia,
describing the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as "
a tool" dominated by the United States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Yugoslav Ambassador to the U.N
headquarters Branko Brankovic on Thursday rejected a war crime
indictment of President Milosevic, denouncing it as an excuse for
NATO to continue its air raids against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the indictment "is the last attempt by NATO
countries to avoid what is obviously inevitable, namely, a total
collapse of the policy of aggression by NATO against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the International War Crimes Tribunal in
The Hague announced that it had indicted Milosevic and four other
Serb officials for war crimes.

the missing victims of the Irish Republican Army, reported Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"Just after 7 a.m. today, a number of people called to Dundalk
Garda (police) station," an Irish police spokesman was quoted as
saying. "They passed on information to the effect that there was a
coffin in the graveyard at Foughert just outside Dundalk."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said they had sealed off the graveyard, which
was located near Dundalk on the southern side of the border
between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The remains had apparently been dug up at another location and
transferred to the graveyard overnight, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
If positively identified it would be the first body found in a
long search for the remains of 15 people reported missing during
the province's 30 years of turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Calls For Cheaper Solar Energy Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Science and Technology
Minister Mohammad Noor Uddin Khan Friday urged scientists to
innovate cheaper devices to make solar energy popular as an
alternative energy source, the BSS national news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khan made this call while inaugurating an international
workshop on dissemination of solar photovoltaic energy in
Bangladesh here, which was organized by the Bangladesh Center for
Advanced Studies and the Local Government Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy should be cheaper so that poorer people could
afford it as an alternative to the conventional electricity, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The conventional electricity could not reach inaccessible
villages and islands where photovoltaic energy could be an option,
he said. But, he said, it "is an expensive option and therefore,
the scientists, researchers and manufacturers should join hands to
slash its prices to popularize the system."
</P>
<P>
The concept of photovoltaic system should be developed by the
private sector, which could make profits by cutting the production
cost and increasing the number of consumers across the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The participants emphasized the need to forge a collective
effort of all concerned, including scientists, researchers,
manufacturers and consumers, to make the system a popular one to
overcome the present electricity crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, only about 15 percent of the total population in
Bangladesh has access to electricity. The present capacity of the
Power Development Board with 52 generation units under 18 power
stations is between 2,000 and 2,100 megawatts, whereas the
country's total need is about 2,300 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Calls For Settlement of Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said Friday that the developments along the Line of Control
(LoC) in the disputed Kashmir area in the past few days underline
the importance of settling the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the Kashmir issue is resolved, such happenings will go
on occurring," Aziz told some Islamabad-based local and foreign
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Aziz said that Pakistan had declared two
days ago that it reserved the right to defend its frontiers once
the Indians crossed the LoC or into Pakistan's airspace "because
that is violation of our sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He noted that two Indian Mig jet fighters were shot down by
Pakistan Thursday, with one of them falling within 10 kilometers
and the other five kilometers of the Pakistani side of the LoC.
</P>
<P>
"The violation of our airspace is an escalation of the
situation," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been urging India to de-escalate the situation and
not to violate the LoC, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that India would respond and "try to find a solution
to the local problem at the local level."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always said that the spirit of the Lahore
Declaration signed by the prime ministers of India and Pakistan in
February this year must be kept along to deal with all issues
between the two countries through negotiations.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Products for children's skin care
in large Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Nanjing are of good quality, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality and Technological Supervision Bureau carried
out the survey on 29 manufacturers and wholesalers of children's
skin care products in the four cities a short time before the
International Children's Day falls on June 1st.

The survey showed that 94 percent of the products surveyed meet
state standards, and 100 percent of all the products from the
state-owned, Chinese-foreign jointly-funded and stock enterprises
are of good quality.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey also found that the quality of children's
skin care products in some small markets do not meet state
standards.
</P>
<P>
"Quality supervision departments at all levels should
strengthen their supervision of enterprises of children's skin
care products, help them upgrade the production techniques and try
to create brand products to meet the demands of consumers," said
an official with the State Quality and Technological Supervision
Bureau.

NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Friday that the Pakistani army was behind the
recent "infiltration" into the Kargil sector of the disputed

"In this entire episode, the Pakistan army has hatched a

The Indian government had information that the Pakistan army
had undertaken this exercise in the past few days with a definite
objective, he said.

The cabinet was apprised of the latest situation in the Kashmir
region and the cabinet committee on security has worked out a
strategy to deal with the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The infiltrators would be flushed out soon, he said. But he
declined to give a set time-frame within which the flushing out of
the infiltrators would be completed.
</P>

He said 200 infiltrators had been killed while 24 Indian
personnel had lost their lives in the operations in Kashmir.

<P>
Husseini called on Israeli newly elected Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to declare that the expansion plan approved by outgoing
Defense Minister Moshe Arens would not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Israel would expand the boundary of
Maaleh Adumim settlement in the West Bank so that a continuous
swath of Israeli territory east of Jerusalem could be created.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the eastern Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, while the Palestinians
want to establish a future capital in the eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreements signed by the two sides,
the issue of Jerusalem should be settled in the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Maaleh Adumim's expansion would further separate the eastern
Jerusalem with other Palestinian-controlled areas in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yossi Beilin, Knesset member (parliament) of
Israel's Labor Party, called the expansion plan as one of the
provocative steps taken by the outgoing Likud government in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Beilin told Israel Radio that the new coalition government
will not agree to the planned expansion.

<HEADLINE> HK Exchange Fund Assets Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Total assets of the Exchange Fund
of Hong Kong amounted to 955.7 billion HK dollars (122.5 billion U.
S. dollars) by the end of April, 28.6 billion HK dollars (3.7
billion U.S. dollars) higher than at end-March 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was released by the Abridged Exchange Fund Balance Sheet
and Currency Board Account as at April 30, 1999, published by the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
In releasing these monthly figures on the Exchange Fund, a
spokesman for the HKMA cautioned that these figures should be
interpreted with care, as monthly figures are likely to fluctuate
due to short-term market movements and seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, both foreign currency assets and Hong
Kong dollar assets increased, by 900 million HK dollars (115.4
million U.S. dollars) and 27.8 billion HK dollars (3.6 billion U.S.
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
HKMA said the increase in foreign currency assets reflected
mainly investment income from and the revaluation effect on
foreign currency investments, which were partly offset by
redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Hong Kong dollar assets reflected mainly the
appreciation in the market value of the Hong Kong equities held by
the Exchange Fund.

<P>
HANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A dead deformed fetus has been
successfully removed recently from a Chinese woman's chest where
it had lain undetected for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old rural woman Jin Xiaoning from Zhejiang's

operated to remove it.
</P>

There is no further information on how it got there, although
it is likely it was Jin's twin, Wu Kangkang, one of the surgeons,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Belarussian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian has urged all peace loving nations to improve their
cooperation in a bid to safeguard worldwide peace especially as
current international developments in hegemonism and power
politics threaten it.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, made these remarks during a meeting here today
with Viktor Sheiman, visiting Belarussian State Security Committee
secretary and presidential aide on security.
</P>
<P>
Though U.S.-led NATO has bombed Yugoslavia under the pretext of
"humanitarianism," it is in substance aiming for world domination
and violating human rights, according to Chi.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that China and Belarus are geographically far
apart, they share the same destiny as well as identical or similar
views toward many international issues," added Chi, using as an
example the fact that both countries advocate the multi-
polarization process.
</P>
<P>
It is very necessary that the two countries strengthen
cooperation to contain this aggressive trend towards domination as
presently adopted by certain nations, Chi emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Sheiman agreed that both countries should adopt similar
attitudes toward major international issues, adding that Belarus
opposes the strategic new concept put forward by NATO, "because it
will only result in world instability."
</P>
<P>
Sheiman said that Belarus is very interested in further
enhancing bilateral cooperation in the security field with China.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Research of Tibetology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pasang Wangdu, an associate research
fellow of China Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, is now
cooperating with Charles Ramble and another expert, two
Tibetologists from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in a
translation of dBa' bzhed, an ancient Tibetan book tracing the
arrival of Buddhism in Tibet some 1200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the third ancient Tibetan book that Pasang Wangdu and his
Austrian counterparts have translated in cooperation through E-
mail.
</P>
<P>
Pasang Wangdu said, "The Research of Tibetology has been
promoted in China over the past four decades. As one of major
social sciences in China, it has been studied by academic circles
at home and abroad."
</P>
<P>
Tibetology is made up of human, social and natural sciences
involving Tibetan linguistics and written language, history,
philosophy, religion, literature, art and folklore, politics and
economy, Traditional Tibetan medicine, astronomy, geography,
handicrafts and architecture.
</P>
<P>
Dojie Cedain, secretary general of China's Center of Tibetology,
said, "The Central Government has attached great importance to the
social, economic and cultural development of the Tibet Autonomous
Region and it has invested a great sum of funds in the research of
traditional Tibetan culture, construction of research institutions
and cultivation of talents engaged in the study.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 research institutions with about 2,000 faculties
in China are now engaged in Tibetology, including China's Center
of Tibetology and China Tibet Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the institutions have published about 1,
000 kinds of books involving Tibetology.
</P>
<P>
The University of Tibet and Tibet College of Traditional Tibet
Medicines have written down Tibetan history, the Tibetan language,
Buddhism, Tibetan art and traditional Tibetan medicines.
</P>
<P>
China's Center of Tibetology publishes the magazines "
Tibetology in China" and "China's Tibet". The Tibet Autonomous
Region also publishes a dozen periodicals such as "Tibetan
Literature and Art", "Tibetan Research", "Tibet Education", "
Tibetan Folklore", "Trends in Tibetological Study Abroad" and "
Translated Theses of Tibetologist Research in Foreign Countries."
</P>
<P>
China has also opened the door for the study of Tibetology and
the Chinese government encourages academic exchanges between
Chinese Tibetologists and their counterparts throughout the world,
including exchange programs of visiting scholars between China and
a dozen countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Pasang Wangdu said that he has been to European countries like
Austria and Germany to give lectures on Tibetology in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
China also sponsored international Tibetology seminars in Lhasa
and Beijing in the 1990s to promote academic exchanges on
Tibetological research.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blasts NATO Contingent Actions During Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday accused the NATO
contingent in Macedonia and Albania of "unprecedented violation of
the letter and spirit of the 1994 Vienna document on confidence-
building and security measures."
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made in a Foreign Ministry statement, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the 1994 document, Russia conducted two
inspections in Macedonia and Albania "to define the scale of
military activities in the two countries," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian group was barred from carrying out
inspections from the air, which is contrary to the Vienna document,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a member of the NATO command in Macedonia barred
access to all areas where NATO formations are stationed. In
Albania, U.S. representatives prohibited Russian visit to the
American contingent and the inspection of the international
airport in Rinas.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side resolutely denounced the unlawful steps of
officials from NATO, Macedonia and Albania, the statement said. "
It regards all these actions as intentional and aimed at reducing
the transparency of the armed forces of the alliance and
withdrawing them from the control of the Vienna document."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry warned that the conclusions drawn from the
inspections "will be taken into account in forming Russia's
negotiating positions."
</P>
<P>
Russian special envoy for the Balkans Viktor Chernomyrdin is
now visiting Belgrade, the fourth such trip since NATO launched
air strikes against Yugoslavia 65 days ago.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Shipbuilding Orders Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's shipbuilding business
has seen a sharp decline in orders, the Korea Shipbuilding
Industry Association said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Through April this year, South Korea's total orders numbered 34
ships at 1.19 million tons, down 45.1 percent from 41 ships at 2.
176 tons in the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the decline to the shipbuilding rush
in the past few years and the uncertainty of currency exchange
rates and the maritime business situation around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shipyards have also toned down their marketing
efforts due to jitters over South Korean won's devaluation against
the greenback and the prices of new ships which have hit bottom,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Orders for South Korean new ships are expected to fall about 20
percent for the entire 1999 as the country's shipbuilding industry
is under restructuring.

CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket closed
in negative territory Friday on the back of falls in banking
stocks and key industrials, but the local bourse failed to match
the extent of a big retreat on Thursday night on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index shed 16.1 points, or 0.55 of
a percent, to close at 2,888.6, after hitting a low of 2,865.1
during the day as heightened fears of rising interest rates in the

all resources index also fell, closing 15.2 lower at 1,098.2.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector suffered Friday, with the banking index
closing down 20 points at 6,570.5, regaining some of the ground
lost earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Australia's biggest bank, the National Australia Bank, lost
11.8 cents at 24.812 Australian dollars, off a low of 24.52
Australian dollars, with the ANZ bank down 5.9 cents at 11.121
Australian dollars and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia 9 cents
lower at 24.63 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Westpac bank gained 9 cents to 10.49 Australian
dollars, recovering from a low of 10.26 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks were weaker after commodity prices fell in
trading on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Resource giant BHP lost 7.2 cents to 15.73 Australian dollars,
while global miner Rio Tinto shed 55 cents to 21.5 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold sector was one of few market segments to gain ground
Friday, with the gold index up 3.7 points at 851.
</P>
<P>
The precious metal was selling in Sydney 0.1 U.S. dollar lower
at 270.9 U.S. dollars per fine ounce.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- General manager of the Syrian Telecommunications
Authority Makram Obeid anticipates that the initial mobile
telephone network in Syria will start functioning within two
months in three provinces for one year, to be followed by the
installation of a country-wide network, Friday's Arab daily Al
Hayat reported.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Chairman of the World Contractors Union Company Saeed
Khouri has disclosed that agreement was reached with the Yemeni
leadership to construct a natural gas-operated electricity plant
in the Maarib region, some 173 kilometers east of Sanaa, at a
total cost of 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Friday's Al Hayat, the Yemeni official said the
company had also submitted offers for the construction of two
projects in the Aden free zone at a total cost of 25 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment in March was 8.6 percent, or
195,000 unemployed, the same as in the first two months of 1999,
the Central Bureau of Statistics said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts in Jerusalem said that one of the reasons
for the unemployment rate's stabilization at 8.6 percent in the
first trimester was the expansion of the public sector by 6.7
percent in the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In all of 1998, the unemployment rate was 8.6 percent, as
opposed to 7.7 percent in 1997. The average unemployment rate
for 1999 is expected to be 8.8 percent, according to Fiance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak promised to create 300,000
new jobs during his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- U.S. Boeing intensified its competition with
Lockheed Martin over valuable contracts with Israel for new
fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Vice President John Boyle, on a visit to
Israel, told Israeli defense officials Thursday that his company
would invest an additional 500 million U.S. dollars in joint
projects with Israeli companies if Israel purchases a number of
Boeing's F-15A jets, along with Lockheed martin's F-16s.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israel Electric Corporation's net profits
plunged 55.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, to 9.6
million U.S. dollars, compared to the same period last year, the
company reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the decline in profits to a 5 percent
drop in revenues from sales of electricity, which, it said, was
caused by the fact that rates fell 6.5 percent in real terms.

<HEADLINE> International Red Cross to Assist 40,000 Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International Red
Cross revealed Friday that the organization will launch an
agricultural development aid program from this June to benefit
over 40,000 families in central Angola's Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
Francoine Zambelline, the Red Cross official, said in Benguela
City in central Angola that Huambo is one of the worst affected
areas by the civil war in the southern African country, with more
than 150,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed to promote agricultural production to
alleviate the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the area, by
distributing agricultural production material such as seeds, farm
tools, and fertilizer so as to relieve the tension on food supply
in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, since Angola was plunged in a
renewed round of civil war, the Red Cross has enhanced emergency
assistance to the country, especially to the central highland
where the fightings are the most tense.
</P>
<P>
The international organization has offered over 10,000 families
with cooking utensils, blankets, food and other daily necessities
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Red Cross has a hospital in Huambo, treating an
average 20,000 patients every week.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross started its operation in Angola in 1975. At
present it has offices in Luanda, Benguela, Huila and Kuito, with
25 officials and over 200 partners.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Taps New Tourism Market in East Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) is to carry out a deeper penetration into East Europe to
boost visitor arrivals from the growing middle class there, a TAT
press release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A TAT marketing task force is to travel to Warsaw, Prague,
Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius and Kiev between May 30 to June 14 to meet
with tour operators, travel agents, hoteliers and airlines.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the team will be carrying with it a range
of tourism promotion collaterals and brochures that have been
translated into six local languages, the TAT release said.
</P>
<P>
This first trip will be aimed at imparting more knowledge about
Thailand as a tourist destination, including accommodation,
interesting activities and facilities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the team will collect market information
about the special needs of the Eastern European visitors in order
to help Thai product suppliers cater to those needs and also
prevent any potential problems and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The trip will be followed by a higher-ranking one in July, with
TAT Chairman and Minister of Prime Minister's Office Pitak
Intrawityanunt leading a high-level public and private sector
delegation for policy and decision-making meetings with his
counterparts in the Eastern European countries.
</P>

The East European market, though small, has shown visible
growth. In 1998, the number of visitor arrivals to Thailand from
this part of Europe totaled 48,464, an increase of 39 percent over
1997.

<HEADLINE> Indictment of Yugoslav President Provoked by U.S.: Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian military officer said
Friday the indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by
the Hague Tribunal was provoked by Washington, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Not only does it violate internationally recognized principles,
but the United States also subjugates international structures,"
Interfax quoted Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the
International Military Cooperation Board in the Russian General
Staff, as saying in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov was accompanying Russian envoy for the Balkans Viktor
Chernomyrdin in Belgrade on a visit that could include a meeting
with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The United States is pursuing its own agenda in talks on Kosovo,
and it has nothing to do with achieving "just peace in the region,
" Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Its goal is "to peacefully occupy Kosovo with Russia's aid by
installing NATO troops there and then subsequently dismembering
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force as planned by the United States and NATO
"would be more accurately referred to as an occupation force,"
Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
"If the scenario of the peaceful stationing of NATO
'peacekeepers' fails, Washington and NATO will step up efforts to
condition public opinion for the need to launch a ground operation,
" Ivashov warned.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the ground invasion "would be the same: the
dismemberment of Yugoslavia," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted the lack of progress in the Russian-Finnish-U.
S.talks on the Balkan situation held in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We did not see constructiveness in the American position, and
the Finnish position is not much different from the U.S. position,
" Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tax Reform Bill Expected to Pass Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government's goods and services tax (GST) bill will be passed by
the Australian Parliament by June 30 after the government has won
the support of the Australian Democrats Party by making
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Australian Democrats
Leader Meg Lees announced Friday that a compromise has been made
between the two sides after a week-long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' support is crucial for the passage in the Senate
of the government-proposed bill designed to reform the country's
decades-old complicated taxation system.
</P>
<P>
The government is only one vote short of a simple majority in
the Senate and other major parties in opposition or independent
MPs have announced their opposition against the bill.
</P>
<P>
A 10 percent tax is expected to be imposed on goods and
services in Australia from July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal by the two sides, basic food excluding takeaway
and restaurant food, alcohol and soft drinks, will be exempt from
the 10 percent GST.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats are against a 10 percent GST on basic food,
saying it is bad for lower-income earners.
</P>
<P>
The exemption will be paid for by paring back income-tax cuts
for workers earning above 50,000 Australian dollars (33,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Income tax cuts for those earning 33,000 U.S. dollars per annum
and more, regarded as high-income earners, will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The over 33,000 U.S. dollar earners to pay 42 percent personal
income tax, while cuts for the top tax bracket of 47 percent are
reduced from 49,500 U.S. dollars to 39,600 U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Listed Firm Managers Banned From Positions in Holding Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) today issued a circular banning senior managers
of listed firms from holding any positions in their holding
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, general managers of listed firms can
only be non-salaried board directors in their holding firms.
</P>
<P>
The general managers and other senior management staff,
including the deputy general managers, financial officers and
secretaries of the boards must get their salaries from the listed
firms.
</P>
<P>
The move is the latest in a string of efforts made by the
securities market watchdog to regularize the operation and
management of listed firms.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that some listed firms are still not
separated from their holding firms in terms of personnel, finance
and assets.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that the situation has often prevented
general conferences of shareholders, the boards of directors and
that of supervisors from functioning as provided for by the
corporate law.
</P>
<P>
It added that independence of personnel in listed firms would
help them establish an independent operating mechanism and protect
the interests of listed firms and their investors.

<HEADLINE> HK's Economic Performance Weak in 1st Quarter 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's overall economic
performance remained weak in the first quarter of 1999, according
to the government's First Quarter Economic Report 1999 published
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A crude initial assessment indicates that the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) could have dropped further by around 3.5 percent in
real terms in the first quarter of 1999 over a year earlier, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, GDP in the
first quarter of 1999 could have been further down by around 0.4
percent in real terms, smaller than the declines of 1.4 percent in
the third quarter and 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Locally, investment spending continued to be overshadowed by a
generally cautious attitude of the banks towards corporate lending,
the uncertain business outlook, and high interest cost in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
Externally, exports continued to fall, amidst a still difficult
trading environment. Total exports fell by about 5 percent in real
terms in the first quarter over a year earlier. But this was
relatively improved from the 10 percent decline in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Imports fell by about 10 percent in real terms in the first
quarter over a year earlier, which was also smaller than the 13
percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998. The relative
improvement was mainly due to a lesser decline in re-exports.
</P>
<P>
As imports continued to fall at a faster rate than exports, the
visible trade deficit shrank further to 12.9 billion HK dollars,
representing 4.4 percent of the value of imports in the first
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The volume of retail sales showed a further decline of 10
percent in the first quarter over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The labor market remained generally slack in the early part of
1999. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate went up from 5.7
percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 6.2 percent in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices remained on a decline in the first four months
of 1999, with the Composite Consumer Price Index falling by 2.3
percent over a year earlier, larger than the 0.8 percent decline
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, however, both the domestic and external
environments have generally turned better, providing a better
basis for overall economic activity in Hong Kong to gradually
revive, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
met with Viktor Sheiman, visiting Belarussian State Security
Committee secretary and presidential aide on security here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu said in recent years, through concerted efforts from both
sides, bilateral friendship has witnessed smooth growth, citing
the fact that cooperation in various fields has expanded and the
two countries have supported each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China appreciates and thanks Belarus's support of China on
issues concerning human rights, Taiwan, and U.S.-led Nato's attack
on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China respects the development road chosen by
Belarus, sympathizes and supports its efforts in safeguarding
national independence, sovereignty, and dignity, stresses
developing bilateral relations, and is willing to push forward
friendship based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Sheiman said Belarus and China hold the same or similar views
on many important world issues, and this created sound conditions
for the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Belarus pursues the foreign policy of peace, advocates non-
interference into other country's internal affairs, respects other
countries' national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
settlement of conflicts through negotiations, and supports the
developing trend of multi-polarism in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the Belarussian government has for many times issued
statements, strongly condemning Nato's military interference in
the internal affairs of Yugoslavia, and the Belarussian people are
all angry about the atrocities of the bombing of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Interview: S'pore Sees Great Prospect in Trading With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China-Singapore trade still
enjoys a great prospect despite the recent slowdown due to the
on-going but receding regional economic crisis, says Ko Khee Hwee,
the international director of Singapore's Trade Development Board
(TDB).
</P>
<P>
"I believe China's admission into the World Trade Organization
will provide Singapore enterprises more opportunities in doing
business in the country," especially in sectors such as financial
and legal services, information technology, construction, power
and environment, Ko said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's economy, heavily boosted by the recovery of world
electronic industry, along with its neighbors, is bottoming out
and the city state sees great potential in trading with China in
the future, Ko said in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ko, in charge of TDB's operations in East Asia and the Pacific,
was briefing Chinese journalists based in Singapore on the
performance of Sino-Singapore trade during the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest TDB statistics, Singapore's trade with
China in the first four months of this year totaled 4.9 billion
Singapore dollars (2.9 billion U.S. dollars), up 2.1 percent on a
year-on-year basis, but lower than the 3 percent growth for the
year of 1998 and the average 10 percent registered for the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade began its rapid development after the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1990, said Ko.
</P>
<P>
At present, China, striding ahead from its previous ranking of
11th, has became Singapore's sixth largest trading partner, and as
of 1998 Singapore's real investment and investment commitment in
China had reached 12.2 billion and 31.1 billion U.S. dollars
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, he said, the TDB will send trade missions
to China's provinces such as Yunnan, Zhejiang, Hubei and Shandong
and cities like Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore expects to cooperate with China in the area
of traditional Chinese medicine with the aim to tap the potential
markets of Southeast Asia, Europe, the United states, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The TDB also plans to encourage Singapore companies to invest
in automotive industry in Hubei province, particularly in the
production of auto parts, said Ko.
</P>
<P>
Ko said that his country, which depends almost totally on
imported agriculture products like vegetables, fruits and flowers,
seeks to expand these imports from China.

food markets in Beijing," said Ko, who once served as commercial
counselor for six years at the Singapore Embassy in Beijing. "They
tasted so good."

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Still in "Favorable" Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate index, which is
a pointer to the industry's health, reached 103.89 in April this
year, up 3.08 points from the same month in 1998, indicating that
it still operates in a "favorable" climate, an official report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Jointly issued by the National Bureau of Statistics and the
China Business Climate Monitoring Center, the report admitted that
the figure is 0.51 points lower than that in March, marking a
downward development trend.
</P>
<P>
"In April, the country's indices for sources of funding for
this year and its total investment both increased, which indicated
that China's pro-active financial policy and stable monetary
policy is taking effect," said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the January-April period, the paid-in fund from the real
estate firms reached 106.3 billion yuan (12.8 billion U.S. dollars)
, up 21 percent over the same period last year, the major factor
bringing up the index.
</P>
<P>
The total investment in the sector also increased by a large
margin this year. Statistics show that in April, the industry
completed investment of 66.4 billion yuan, up 19.5 percent on a
year on year basis.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, the indices for housing prices, land sales
and development along with the completed real estate projects
decreased.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, housing prices have been decreasing since the
beginning of this year," said the report, adding that April's
price stood at 1,967 yuan per sq. m, lower than 2,000 yuan per sq.
m for the first time since last year.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's April Current Account Surplus Down to 2.02 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account surplus
stood at 2.02 billion U.S. dollars last month, down 630 million
dollars from the previous month, the Bank of Korea said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus fell in April as the nation's income deficit
widened to 740 million dollars from 370 million dollars in the
previous month over additional interest payments accrued from
overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
"The level of current account surplus is largely determined by
the pace of import and export growth. The Bank of Korea expects
that the surplus will gradually be reduced in the next couple of
months," a report of the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South Korea's export totaled 11.59 billion dollars,
down 3.9 percent from that of the same month last year while
import hit 9.07 billion dollars, up 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The service sector deficit increased to 120 million dollars
last month, compared to only 80 million dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus target of 20 billion dollars for
1999 is within reach with an accumulated net gain of 8.8 billion
dollars in the last four months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to plunging imports, South Korea's current account
surplus hit a record high of 40.04 billion dollars in 1998,
reversing the deficit trend of the past four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices dipped on Singapore
Stock Market Friday dragged down by the overnight slump on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index fell by 12.09 points to
1,903.68 points, ending a week of consolidation around the 1,900
points level.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover decreased to 858.70 million shares worth 959.86
million Singapore dollars (557.09 million U.S. dollars). Losers
edged out gainers by 179 to 146 with 119 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 43.05 million stock parcel by GES
which was transacted at 1.50 Singapore dollars per share. Wee Poh

million units. UIC w99 was the next that had 26.67 million

MOSCOW -- Russian special envoy for the Balkans, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, left here Friday morning for Belgrade to continue
the search for a settlement to the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is expected to meet with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and other top leaders, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported, quoting the envoy's adviser, Valentin Sergeyev.
Before his departure, Chernomyrdin said that the U.N.
International Tribunal's war crimes indictment against Milosevic
and four other top Yugoslav officials would not affect Russia's
stand in the negotiations on Yugoslavia. Moscow "has been and is
dealing" with the lawfully elected president, Slobodan Milosevic,

visit.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after their talks, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said that as neighbors of Yugoslavia, Ukraine and
Romania have suffered severe economic losses caused by the Kosovo
conflict. NATO's over-60-day wanton bombings have not only caused
enormous life and economic losses to Yugoslavia but also inflicted
serious economic damages and social problems upon neighbor
countries, Kuchma said. Constantinescu said the proper handling by
Ukraine and Romania of their own ethnic minority issues could
serve as a good example in solving the Kosovo issue. (Ukraine-

"Whenever we are at the threshold of peace or a peaceful
solution, NATO countries try to put a stick in the process,"
Brankovic said at a news conference. "Obviously this might be a
stick in the wheel of the whole negotiation process, because they
find excuses with this so-called indictment to continue the
bombing, which is the worst part of everything," he said. (

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Suspects to be Handed over to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Four suspects involved in the
Rwanda genocide will be transferred to the the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based in Arusha in north
Tanzania to face trials, the court said Friday.
</P>
<P>
One of the four is in detention in the United States and three
others in Cameroon, the President of the tribunal, Judge Laity
Kama, said in a press release reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kama also said he will hand over his presidency to
another judge at an election in the sixth plenary meeting of the
tribunal next week.
</P>
<P>
Before the five-day meeting starts on Monday, three new judges
will be sworn in, he said.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was officially established on November 8, 1994
through U.N. Security Council Resolution 955. The judges were only
elected in May 1995, with Kama as the first president of the
court.
</P>
<P>
Kama was re-elected two years later but he is unable to seek a
third term as it is stipulated that president of the tribunal can
only be re- elected once. He said he will continue to serve as a
judge of the Trial Chamber of the court.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the achievements of the court, Kama said "we
should feel duly honored at having handed down the very first
conviction for genocide and, for the first time, included rape and
sexual violence as a constituent crime of genocide if perpetrated
with the intention of destroying a particular group."
</P>
<P>
He said the court has set a pace in history when it registered
guilty plea from a former prime minister of Rwanda, who
acknowledged and confirmed the fact that genocide had indeed
occurred in the country in 1994 and, beyond that, the fact that it
was a crime planned and organized at the highest political and
military levels.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future, Kama said the court still faces
considerable unfinished tasks and acknowledged that the trials
have not been going on at a comparatively slow pace.
</P>
<P>
"The progress should enable us to expedite trials and hand down
decisions in reasonably good time in case of the 35 accused
persons already apprehended," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were massacred in the genocide in 1994.

RIYADH, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi authorities have decided
to allow docking vessels crew to go ashore and to visit Saudi
towns, a step to develop Saudi harbors and promote tourism.

The paper said that this move is the outcome of flexible
agreement between shipping agents, the Saudi harbor authorities,
the immigration department and the border guards.
</P>

A joint committee of Ministries of the Interior and Health,
the harbors administration and customs department has been formed
to map out the procedures to be followed by crewmen to obtain

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Libyan peace-keeping troops have
arrived in Uganda and then deployed between the Ugandan troops
stationed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the DRC
government troops, Uganda's New Vision newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say how many Libyan troops have been
dispatched for this mission.
</P>
<P>
However, Ugandan Army Commander Jeje Odongo refuted this report
in a telephone interview with Xinhua Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Not at all. It is not true as reported. I don't know whether
these troops will be deployed there or not. But at present, no,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision report quoted a Libyan foreign ministry
statement as saying that the deployment of Libyan peace-keeping
troops in the DRC is a move agreed in an accord signed last month
in Libya by DRC President Laurent Kabila and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The accord called for the cessation of hostilities, the
withdrawal of foreign troops and the deployment of an African
peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rwandan Vice-President and Defense
Minister Paul Kagame attended a summit in Libya which endorsed the
accord, the report added.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Management of Processing Joint Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Plans for a big shake up in the way
manufacturing and processing joint ventures are managed in China
have been announced by Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi outlined details of the plan at a conference focused on the
issue here today and revealed that a series of new measures to
refine the procedures affecting such ventures will become
effective on June 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, the move follows a recent State Council
notice which details how such joint ventures will be divided into
four categories according to their performance and how they will
be treated differently according to their category.
</P>
<P>
"The main thrust of the plan is to be strict with sensitive
products and those ventures that have violated set rules; but
lenient towards those that operate within the law and are involved
with more general products," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, Shi added, was that the increasing number
of joint ventures in this sector has meant that certain
irregularities have been taking place which need to be tackled
such as redundant projects, smuggling, tax cheating, poor
management and economic gains, and illegal foreign exchange
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly hosted by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, Shi's ministry, the General Administration of Customs,
the People's Bank of China, the General Administration of Taxation,
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the Bank of China,
will examine ways to implement and enforce the new rules.
</P>
<P>
A direct result of China's opening to the outside world, such
joint ventures have been playing a significant role in China's
exports and use of overseas investments. Between 1979 and 1998,
exports in the sector grew 450 times from 230 million U.S. dollars
to 104.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that jointly established manufacturing and processing
ventures will continue to be an important part of China's foreign
trade and investments for quite a long period of time and that the
measures are merely to "fine-tune" their management rather than a
significant change of basic policy which will maintain its current
format.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Netanyahu Conducted Secret Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has conducted secret talks with Syria and has
agreed in principle to a significant withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, the local paper Ha'aretz revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks produced no final results because Netanyahu repeatedly
recoiled from committing himself at the last minute, the paper
quoted reliable U.S. and Israeli sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Involving in the mediating efforts were Oman's Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi, the Europan Union
special envoy to the Middle East Miguel Moratinos and American
tycoon Roland Lauder.
</P>
<P>
Retired Major General Danny Yatom represented Israel in the
initial "rapprochement talks" with Syrian ambassador to the
U.S. Walid Mualem in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's mission came to an end after the Israel's intelligence
organization Mossad's failed assassination attempt against senior
Hamas official Khaled Mashaal in Jordan last September.
</P>
<P>
The Omani mediation efforts began at the end of 1997 with the

<HEADLINE> Botswana Bank Credit Growth Causes Inflationary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is experiencing high
economic growth, but a 56 percent expansion in bank credit last
year caused inflationary concern in the country, South Africa's
Business Day newspaper Friday quoted a think tank report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
High economic growth, estimated at seven percent to eight
percent for the non-mineral sectors in 1998/99, has led to an
upsurge in inflation which reached 7.3 percent in March this year,
according to the report issued by the Botswana Institute for
Development Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
However, the institute warned that growth of non-traditional
exports is being curbed by sluggish economic growth in neighboring
markets such as South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the diamond market may have bottomed out,
according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
Diamond sales by the Central Selling Organization (CSO) of De
Beers in the first three months of the year indicate a small
market recovery, and as long as there is no economic slowdown in
the United States, this year should see a healthier international
diamond market.
</P>
<P>
With increased diamond production as the expansion of Orpa mine
 approaching completion, Botswana will sell more diamonds through
the CSO, boosting the balance of payments, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
It said one of the most striking aspects of the present
economic boom is that employment has not grown significantly.
Although real non-mining gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 36
percent between 1991/92 and 1997/98, formal sector employment grew
by only 10 percent over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Send Troops to Jezzine After SLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese government will deploy a
security force to the southern town of Jezzine after the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) leaves the area, the Daily
Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources at the foreign ministry as saying
that "contacts are underway for the authorities to take over
security in the region and to prepare a security force to deploy
in Jezzine and its vicinity."
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, the largest Christian town in south Lebanon, is not
part of the Israeli-occupied border enclave which Israel declared
as a "security zone" in 1985 allegedly to prevent cross-border
attacks on its north by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, SLA commander Antoine Lahd formally notified
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens of his decision to pull out
the SLA garrison from Jezzine within weeks or even days.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's decision, which reportedly got approval from the Israeli
authorities, was mainly the result of escalated guerrilla bombing
attacks around the town.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 SLA militants and 20 civilians were killed in bombing
ambushes around the town in the past nine months by Lebanese
guerrillas, notably the Hezbollah, or Party of God, who is leading
a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and the SLA out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the withdrawal will be viewed by Israel as a
test of Lebanon's ability to cope with the situation if Israeli
occupation troops are withdrawn entirely from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel worries that if they withdraw from the border zone,
Hezbollah will continue to launch attacks on its northern
settlements.
</P>
<P>
In Jezzine, the paper said, the first of the 170-strong
militiamen garrison have reportedly left for Marjayoun inside the
occupied border zone with their families.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are a total of 2,500 SLA militiamen in the
border zone, most of whom are helping Israeli forces patrol the
area.

<HEADLINE> HK Pensioners to Get Increased Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Pensions granted to Hong Kong's
former civil servants or their dependents will be increased by one
percent with effect from April 1, 1999, the Special Administrative
Region government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increased pension will be paid to pensioners on June 30,
1999, a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The increase was made in accordance with the statutory
requirement to raise the amount of monthly pensions according to
the percentage increase in the average monthly Consumer Price
Index (A) (CPI A) of the last financial year.
</P>
<P>
"This is prescribed by the Pensions Ordinance and Widows and
Orphans Pension Ordinance. The objective is to maintain the
purchasing power of pensions on account of inflation," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The one percent increase is determined strictly according to
the one percent increase in the average monthly CPI (A) of
financial year 1998/99. It will apply to pensions granted on or
before April 1, 1999," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Angola Not Looking for War With Zambia: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola is not looking for war with
Zambia, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia, Manuel Augusto, has said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disagreement between the Angolan and Zambian
governments. We still have our normal diplomatic relations,"
Zambian newspaper, the Post, Friday quoted Augusto as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador explained the essence of its persistent claims
that some top Zambian government officials were involved in
gun-running for the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Angola's persistent gun-running charges were aimed at "helping
make the Zambian government more cooperative with the Angolan
government in condemning the bad things happening," he said.
</P>
<P>
Augusto also dispelled media reports that Angola was not
grateful for what Zambia had done in trying to bring peace in
Angola through the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to some media reports we are grateful to the Zambian
people for what they have done to the people of Angola," he said.
</P>
<P>
Augusto said the Angolan government is still awaiting the
outcome of investigations into the bombing of it's embassy in
Lusaka two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the meeting between the Angolan and
Zambian heads of intelligence which was held in Mbabane,
Swaziland, recently may pave the way for a possible summit between
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Augusto said the intelligence chiefs had been detailed to
submit reports to their respective governments after which the
foreign affairs ministers of the two governments would meet and
decide whether or not the two presidents should meet.
</P>
<P>
"The presidents should meet with something substantial," said
Augusto.

<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister for Presidential
Affairs Erick Siwamba said in Harare Thursday that a summit is
soon to be held in Zambian capital Lusaka on the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Siwamba disclosed this at the Harare International Airport on
his way back to Lusaka after spending about an hour consulting
Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
But the Zambian minister said he could not say when the summit
would be held, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Siwamba, who jetted in Thursday afternoon, said that he
discussed with Mudenge matters affecting the peace process in the
DRC and other issues concerning the region.
</P>
<P>
"There have been new developments in the peace process and we
are now in the process of convening a summit," said the Zambian
minister.
</P>
<P>
"Before we do that, we have to address other issues of the
various committees that have been looking into the issue,
including the committee to superintend the mechanism of
cease-fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was an injection of urgency into the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
All participants to the conflict, he said, remained determined
to see a peaceful solution to the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "unfortunate" Angolan allegations that Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba supported the rebel National Union for
Total Independence in Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"Angolan allegations are unfortunate and don't help the
process," he said. "Anyway, there is a mechanism addressing
that."
</P>
<P>
Although Chiluba has denied the allegations, Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos has been adamant, and already the Zambian
leader's efforts have faltered and the allied forces are expected
to seek his replacement.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel, Palestinians to Take Joint Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians
have launched a joint action plan to eradicate the economic
losses inflicted by the Mediterranean fruit fly by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Under the ongoing plan, the sterile insect technology was used
in the Jordan valley to release sterile male flies to prevent the
flies from reproducing instead of massive pesticide use, Jordanian
experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fly destroyed 29 to 35 percent of farmers` yields in
Jordan, causing some 55.6 million Jordanian dinars (77.8 million
U.S. dollars) of financial losses to Jordanian farmers each year,
according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean fly mainly plagues crops of citrus fruits,
apples, peaches, apricot, pears, plums, dates, peppers, tomatoes,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The fly, better known as medfly, has been endemic in the
Mediterranean areas since the 1950s, and the warm summer and mild
winter in the region are conducive to the development and
reproduction of the flies. An entire life cycle can be completed
within 18 to 33 days.
</P>
<P>
New technologies, including the sterile insect technique, must
be used to combat the bugs, as they have developed certain immune
system against pesticides, Jordanian experts said.
</P>
<P>
There also had been mounting pressure from environmental groups
in the region to reduce the use of pesticides, and introduce more
eco-friendly measures to curb the Mediterranean flies, they said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped all countries in the region, particularly Syria
and Lebanon, will take part in the action plan to wipe out
the flies in the Mediterranean region, said a Jordanian official
who asked not to be named.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Launches Privatization of Insurance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has launched the privatization
process of the insurance sector with a step aimed at evaluating a
state-run insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Al-Chark Insurance Company signed a deal on Thursday with HSBC,
an internationally renowned valuation firm, under which HSBC is to
evaluate the Egyptian American Insurance Company, the Egyptian
Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight percent of the assets of the Egyptian American
Insurance Company are owned by the state-run Al-Chark Insurance
Company, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first step of the privatization process of the
insurance sector in Egypt, Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros
Ghali told reporters after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started the privatization process in 1996 to sell off 314
state-run enterprises and more than one third of the targeted
firms have so far been privatized.
</P>
<P>
But the government is cautious when it comes to the
privatization of the state banks and insurance companies,
especially after southeast Asian countries plunged into economic
turmoil in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
It will take HSBC six to eight weeks to finish the valuation on
the Egyptian American Insurance Company, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the government would also sign
deals with two other valuation firms, Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley, next week to value four more state insurance firms slated
for privatization.
</P>
<P>
The four companies are Al-Chark Insurance Company, Misr
Insurance, National Insurance and Egypt Reinsurance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's grain growing area has
decreased slightly from last year to an estimated 112 million ha,
but the summer grain output is expected to rise this year,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Those areas growing cotton, sugar crops and tobacco are also
smaller than last year but those involved in other crops and
vegetables have expanded, a ministry report revealed.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the output of meat will rise by three
percent and the output of aquatic products will increase steadily

<HEADLINE> Australian Sex Tourist Jailed for 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- John Arthur Lee, a 45-year-old
Australian boilermaker, Friday became the first person in
Australia convicted by a jury of sexually abusing children
overseas under the country's new child sex tourism laws.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced in the Perth District Court in the state of
West Australia, to a maximum 14 years' jail for child pornography
and a series of child sex crimes committed while holidaying in
Cambodia in 1997, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
It was a case in which the main crimes took place overseas,
none of the child victims could be found and there were no
witnesses. There were just photos.
</P>
<P>
Lee has spent 23 months in custody and will be eligible for
parole after six years.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case was made all the more difficult by the
fact that the only concrete evidence was a series of sexually
explicit photographs of Lee with young girls, but even those were
far from conclusive, since Lee's face could not be seen in them.
</P>
<P>
However, fingerprint and forensic experts testified that Lee
was the man in the photos, enlarging one shot showing his upturned
hand and comparing it to fingerprint samples Lee provided, the AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
Skin markings, muscle development and Lee's overall body
appearance were also compared to the man in the photos to prove it
was him.
</P>
<P>
According to expert evidence, at least one of the girls could
have been as young as 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
The girls were sexually abused by Lee in his room at the Chhay
Hour hotel.
</P>
<P>
He took photographs of what went on.
</P>
<P>
Returning to the single men's accommodation where he lived in
West Australia, Lee showed the photos to a workmate who later
alerted police. Lee was arrested in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the court Friday, Judge Peter Williams sentenced Lee to
eight years' jail for having sex with a girl under the age of 16
and four years for each of eight counts of indecent dealing with
underage girls.
</P>
<P>
Lee was also sentenced to two years' jail for 14 counts of
possessing and one count of displaying child pornography.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Efforts to Close Down Small Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Substandard and inefficient small
oil refineries are to be closed down in China in a campaign aimed
at making better use of resources.
</P>
<P>
New regulations concerning the distribution of crude oil and
petroleum products across the country are also to be introduced
following a State Council working team's study into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Ten ministerial-level commissions and bureaus took part in a
conference today where Li Yongwu, director of the State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries (SAPCI),
announced the moves, which are in the form of an official
directive.
</P>
<P>
Explicitly it specifies that all oil recovering operations
without proper exploration licenses and all "backyard" refineries
should be closed down before July 31 this year. All small
refineries which were not eligible for state-allocated crude oil
in 1998 will also be closed down as well as those small ones
processing imported fuel oils.
</P>
<P>
The directive also points out that if small refineries cannot
produce 100 percent unleaded gasoline with an octane number of 90
or above as of January 1st, 2000, or their pollutant emissions
fail to meet the national standard, they will also be ordered to
cease operations.
</P>
<P>
No new small refineries shall be built without approval from
the State Council and those already constructed cannot go on
stream without official go ahead. All domestic and imported crude
oil will be subject to unified allocation, the directive lays down,
and the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China
Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec) will be the exclusive, officially
authorized wholesalers of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
During the conference Shi Wanpeng, vice minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), said the campaign will help
improve the structure of China's domestic refining industry.
</P>
<P>
"The new regulations will also help upgrade refining technology
and improve the quality of petroleum products as well as
protecting the environment," Shi said, adding that state-owned
large and medium-sized refineries should be able to achieve a
better economic performance as a result.
</P>
<P>
He explained that by the end of 1998, there were 166 small
refineries each with a capacity of less than one million tones a
year among China's total of 220 refineries. The unchecked growth
of small refineries is a major cause of the waste of resources,
environmental pollution and chaos in the distribution of crude oil
and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to regulate this part of China's oil sector has
been jointly launched by SETC, the State Development Planning
Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of
Finance, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration of
Taxation, the State Environmental Protection Bureau, the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce, the State Bureau for
Quality and Technical Supervision and SAPCI.

LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

state-sponsored murders.
</P>
<P>
The Times:

powers.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:

<P>
-- Within the next few days, Israel is expected to withdraw its

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Index Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Index of Consumer
Expectations (ICE) grew 0.2 points on a monthly basis to 93.5
points in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (
NBS).
</P>
<P>
The NBS's China Business Climate Monitoring Center reported
that the slight rise indicated consumers are experiencing a subtle
psychological change after a long period of taking a wait-and-see
attitude.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indexes, including the ICE, Index of Consumer
Sentiment (ICS) and Index of Current Economic Conditions (ICC),
are used internationally as indicators of economic situations and
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The April's ICC stood at 86.7 points, up 0.1 point on the March
figure. It's the first time since the beginning of 1999 that the
index has witnessed a rise.
</P>
<P>
The NBS established its Consumer Survey System in December 1997
and lists the monthly ICE on a base of 100 points. The random
selection method means gathering 4,200 samples in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that 41 percent of respondents foresee
improving overall economic conditions in the next 12 months, and
40 percent of them also expressed confidence that the Chinese
economy will maintain stable growth over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
But 45 percent of respondents commented that their own current
family financial situation is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the government adopt effective
measures to expand consumption, such as improving the social
security system and accelerating the reform on state-owned firms.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Send MPs as Observers to Indonesia Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Politicians from Australia's major
parties will make up half of Australia's 25-strong delegation to
observe the June 7 Indonesian elections, Australian Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the delegation will not be determining whether or not the
elections are fair, he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the delegation would be led by Australian Liberal
Party Senator Alan Ferguson and comprise six government members,
four Australian Labor Party MPs and two Australian Democrat
senators.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by 11 Australian officials and former Labor
Senator Stephen Loosely and government adviser Vince Woolcock.
</P>
<P>
"The observer mission is an integral part of Australia's
commitment to assisting the conduct of a successful general
election," Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In sending observers Australia does not intend to stand in
judgment of Indonesia during the election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already donated about 10 million U.S. dollars
towards the running of the election, which Downer said would have
immense implications for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The money has gone towards the establishment of an
Australian-style national tally room and the production and
distribution of voter education material.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Criticizes Protectionism in U.S., Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand business leaders
have criticized stronger trade protectionist tendencies in the
United States and the European Union, the Dominion reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Meat NZ Chief Executive
Neil Taylor as saying that there are greater protectionism and
higher farm subsidies in the United States and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed that leading members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have
increased government farm support last year by six percent, with
the level of government farm support in the United States going
from 14 to 22 percent and that in the EU from 38 to 45 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Neville Martin, spokesman for the NZ Dairy Board, said that
every time it appears progress is being made in some markets,
trade barriers will pop up and it has become a constant battle.
</P>
<P>
He added that if there were no barriers to trade, particularly
into North America and Europe, then New Zealand farmers would be
at least twice as well off as they are at present.
</P>
<P>
NZ Federated Farmers President Malcolm Bailey said: "The world
at the moment is showing protectionist tendencies which are sadly
misplaced and the most dismal place at the moment is the United
States."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts 2 Percent GNP Growth in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- After three successive quarters of
negative growth, the Philippine economy is recovering at a pace
stronger than expected as GNP grew by 2.0 percent, and GDP by 1.2
percent in the first quarter of this year, figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report released from the Philippine National Statistical
Coordination Board attributed the increase to the sustained growth
of services at 3 percent, helped by the 2.5 percent rebound of
agriculture which resulted from the favorable weather condition.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that net factor incomes from abroad grew
strongly at 19.2 percent, as stabilized expectations on the
peso-dollar exchange rate encouraged greater overseas workers'
remittances.
</P>
<P>
Industry, on the other hand, contracted by 1.9 percent during
the period, but the contraction has slowed down from the 4.7
percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998 because of the
better-than-expected growth of the utilities sector and the
moderated fall of other factors.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, only personal consumption expenditure and
government consumption expenditures posted positive growths of 2.5
percent and 7.6 percent percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services dropped by 17.8 percent, with the
0.7 percent fall in merchandise exports weighed down by the
substantial drop of 43.3 percent in exports of non-factor
services.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that investments fell by 7.7 percent in the
first quarter but still marked an improvement over the 22.3
percent decline in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that with the better-than-target
performance of the first quarter, the economy has a higher chance
of hitting the 1999 growth target of 3.0-3.7 percent for GNP and
2.6-3.2 percent for GDP.
</P>
<P>
To realize of the target, the report advised the government to
implement the pump-priming program effectively, support the growth
of agriculture and sustain the environment for the recovery of
credit.

<HEADLINE> Special Dragon Stamp Souvenir on Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A special limited edition woodcut
featuring rare stamps from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) has gone
on sale in Beijing today to mark the forthcoming China 1999 World
Philatelic Exhibition scheduled for August 21-30 in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The original stamps, China's first, depicted dragons and were
issued in 1878, marking the establishment of a modern post-
industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin artist Mo Fei, who owns the patent for such work, was
commissioned by the All China Philatelic Federation to create the
woodcuts which incorporate 25 of the five-cent stamps in a block,
as if on a sheet of paper.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Philatelic Corporation will issue only 1,999 sets
of the special woodcut which sells at 699 yuan each. They can be
ordered at post offices and will also be available at the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the All-China Philatelic Federation said that
they expect the woodcut souvenirs to become collectors items in a
very short time.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Population Growth Falls Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's annual population growth
has declined 37 percent over the past 20 years and total fertility
rates of 8.1 live births per woman in 1978 dropped to 4.6 in1998.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the new headquarters of the Family Planning
Association of Kenya here Thursday, Kenya Vice-President George
Saitoti announced that his country has achieved one of the most
rapid rates of declines in fertility ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
"We project that the fertility rate will decline further to 4.5
(live births per woman) by the year 2000," the official Kenya
Times newspaper Friday quoted Saitoti as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's rate of population growth has declined from 3.8
percent in 1979 to an estimated 2.5 percent in 1998, the
vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the declines in fertility rates and population
growth to a successful policy and programs of family planning that
have introduced a culture of contraception.
</P>
<P>
However, World Bank official Harold Wachman warned at the
ceremony that AIDS and HIV infection threatened to bring down
Kenya's annual population growth to below two percent.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Kenya will conduct its national census in
coming August.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Quits Peace Talks With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Front (NDF)
said Friday that it has quit peace talks with the Philippine
government in protest against the senate's ratification of the
Philippine-U.S. Visiting Force Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
The NDF said in a statement sent from their international
office in the Netherlands that the group is backing out of peace
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Sison, head of the group, said in a separate
statement that "all patriotic and progress forces intensify all
forms of struggle" against the government after the treaty was
ratified.
</P>
<P>
The senate on Thursday ratified the VFA which allows the
resumption of large-scale joint military exercises between the
United States and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was immediately challenged at the country's Supreme
Court with officials saying that the lawyers' group Philippine
Constitutional Association and the New National Alliance lodged
petitions to have the pact declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Philippines, military spokesman Horacio Lapinid
said that they had stepped up their security precautions in the
wake of the VFA approval in anticipation that the rebel guerrillas
would stage more attacks in reaction.
</P>
<P>
The NDF started peace negotiations with the Ramos
administration years ago and already signed a cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Military relations between the Philippines and the United
States have cooled since the senate voted in 1991 to expel all
U.S. forces from major bases in the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Speeds Up Housing Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has set aside 609 million
Zimbabwean dollars (16 million U.S. dollars) for housing
development by local authorities countrywide, the daily Herald
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the ongoing 58th annual conference of
the Urban Councils Association in Kariba of north Zimbabwe,
Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo said
on Thursday the country was facing a critical shortage of housing
accommodation, adding that the situation needed to be urgently
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"The shortage of houses is emanating from lack of adequate
financial resources, lack of capacity to implement housing
projects by some local authorities and lack of investment by the
private sector," said Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the shortage of houses has been attributed to
poor planning by local authorities, who in turn say they cannot
fully cope with demand because of a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Increased rural-to-urban migration has also resulted in the
increased need for houses and provision of other basic services in
urban areas, Nkomo said.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Against White Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua)-- More than 30 Chinese manufacturers
of Styrofoam food boxes have called on all plastic processing
firms nationwide to start collecting their discarded Styrofoam
products and join the campaign against white pollution.
</P>
<P>
In a written proposal issued here today, they urge firms
involved in making plastic products to follow the examples of
several Beijing and Tianjin companies who first initiated the
project by sending out teams of workers to collect plastic foam
products which had been thrown away by the public.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 59 percent of plastic foam food boxes were retrieved
and re-processed into stationery and building materials. The
Beijing municipal government announced on May 1 this year that
only firms that retrieve and re-use plastic foam food boxes are
allowed to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
China has over 100 production units making Styrofoam food boxes
and produces 15 billion every year. However, as increasing numbers
of people refuse to use them because of the pollution problem the
industry is suffering from decreasing sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian special envoy for the
Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, left here Friday morning for
Belgrade to continue the search for a settlement to the Yugoslav
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is expected to meet with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and other top leaders, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported, quoting the envoy's adviser, Valentin Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Chernomyrdin said that the U.N.
International Tribunal's war crimes indictment against Milosevic
and four other top Yugoslav officials would not affect Russia's
stand in the negotiations on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow "has been and is dealing" with the lawfully
elected president, Slobodan Milosevic, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry
described the indictment as "motivated by purely political
considerations."
</P>
<P>
"One can hardly regard as accidental the fact that this step
was taken exactly at the time when the talks on the settlement of
the Kosovo problem are entering the decisive stage. Now the
negotiating process will become more complicated," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry accused Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the U.N.
International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, of showing
"surprising passivity in the face of the obvious fact of the NATO
aggression against Yugoslavia" and remaining "indifferent to the
consequences of incessant bombing" that has been going on for over
two months.
</P>
<P>
"She shows no emotions over the death of hundreds of guiltless
people, the destruction of the economic and social infrastructure
of the country, the turning of historic monuments into ruins and
the threat of an ecological catastrophe," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Ban In South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong and Hainan
provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are preparing
for a first fishing ban in the South China Sea that starts June 1.
</P>
<P>
Trawlers and purse seine fishing boats will be banned from the
northern part of the sea from June 1 to July 31, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has decided to integrate its marine, public security,
industrial and commercial departments to help implement the
decision. Those vessels that have special fishing approval in the
Nansha area will be equipped with a GPS system in order to be
better supervised.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi plans to have one or two more checks in addition to its
joint check with the South China Sea Supervisory Bureau of
Fisheries and Harbors.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province says it will provide better service during the
ban and fishermen will be given training and help in maintaining
vessels.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, the director of the ministry's fishery department,
says that the ban's purpose is to protect marine resources from
overfishing, which, in the past year, has significantly depleted
marine resources and caused a decline in the output of aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
China put a ban on fishing in the East and Yellow seas in 1995
that led to an annual increase in total aquatic product output.

NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has directed the country's Commissioner of Police to take measures
aimed at weeding out corrupt officers within the force.
</P>
<P>
Addressing police officers during a passing-out parade at Kenya
Police College here Thursday, the president said it was a matter
of concern that some members of the force had been accused of
taking bribes, collaborating with criminals and even engaging in
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Moi warned such behavior would not be tolerated in a force
whose duty is to protect the law abiding citizens, the state-run
Kenya Times newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement officers were bearers for the image of the
Kenya Police Force and should therefore uphold the law, the
president noted, saying they should maintain a morally clean and
upright image to win confidence of the people.
</P>
<P>
A well-trained and disciplined force is essential for the
maintenance of peace and social stability which is vital for
economic development, the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged police officers to be more vigilant in order to
curb the rising crime in the east African country.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China says it will provide more
funds for innovative research in mathematics and the physic
sciences, in a bid to boost the development of the country's basic
science research.
</P>
<P>
Special funds will be available to support research projects
with novel ideas that are not widely accepted, an official from
the National Natural Science Foundation of China's department of
mathematical and physical sciences said here today.
</P>

Many new ideas, especially those at the initial stage of
research, are not accepted by the academic community at the

although his department is cautious in evaluating such projects,
it never rejects them outright.
</P>

According to Xu Zhongqin, a deputy director of the department,
more than 6,000 mathematical and physical research projects and
about 20,000 scientists have received funds worth 520 million yuan

WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Portland Trail Blazers kept
their cool temper and didn't let the Utah Jazz pull off another
miracle finish.
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Rider scored 24 points, Jim Jackson had 17 and the pair
combined to make 12 free throws in the final 1:05 Thursday night

CHANGSHA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China

<HEADLINE> Present Wage System Recommended to Go on in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore National Wage Council
(NWC) Friday made public its recommendations on wage guidelines
for 1999/2000 which highlight wage restrains and introduce greater
flexibility in the wage system.
</P>
<P>
NWC Chairman Lim Chong Yah told a press conference that the NWC
has recommended to continue wage restraints and introduce greater
flexibility in the wage system with a view to help achieve
full-fledged recovery of the economy and avoid nipping the
recovery process in the bud.
</P>
<P>
He said the NWC believes some sectors of the Singapore economy
are beginning to show signs of recovery, but growth is not
broad-based and performances across companies and sectors are very
uneven.
</P>
<P>
Lim noted that the NWC guidelines for 1999/2000 provide
companies that perform well greater flexibility to reward their
workers by allowing different choices by companies under four
categories:
</P>
<P>
-- Companies with deteriorating performance and eroding
prospects could continue to implement a reduction or freeze in
total wages through variable components;
</P>
<P>
-- Companies with satisfactory performance but uncertain
prospects could consider rewarding their workers with a special
payment which could be in the form of a mid-year bonus;
</P>
<P>
-- Companies with improving performance and reasonably good
prospects could reward their workers through a bonus, including a
mid-year bonus payment, or a wage increase;
</P>
<P>
-- And Companies that have performed well with promising
prospects, including those doing exceptionally well, could reward
workers through a bonus, including a mid-year bonus payment and a
wage increase.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that the NWC recommends that a monthly variable
component (MVC) be introduced to further enhance the flexibility
of the country's wage system.
</P>
<P>
The MVC would give companies the flexibility of adjusting wage
costs downwards more responsively in the event of an economic
recession of sharp business, he said, adding more flexible wage
system will eventually consists of three components, namely 70
percentage of basic wage, 10 percentage of MVC and 20 percentage
of annual variable.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the NWC also recommends that the government continue
to moderate non-wage costs such as rentals, telecommunication and
utility charges, transport costs and government fees in a bid to
reduce the costs of doing business in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The NWC recommended wage restraint guidelines in May 1998 to
help contain the business cost and minimize unemployment in
Singapore when Singapore was beginning to feel the impact of the
regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
As Singapore's economic growth gyrated from positive to
negative territory in the third quarter of 1998, the NWC issued a
set of revised guidelines in November 1998, calling for a
five-to-eight-percent cut in total wages along with the proposed
10-point cut of employers' contribution to the CPF (central
provident fund) in order to achieve a reduction in the overall
wage costs of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the revised guidelines, total wage
in the city state fell by a further 4.3 percent as of March 1999
and the cut in overall wage costs, including the 10-point
reduction in employers' CPF contribution from January 1999,
amounted to 12.3 percent.

CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for business
investment in Australia slumped to a 15-year low during the first

<P>
Miners would slash investment by 42 percent while manufacturers

<P>
Some economists here believed that Australia's economic growth
rate could well below the official forecasts of 3 percent later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy is undergoing its 8th consecutive year
of growth and the growth rate for the 1998-1999 financial year
ending on June 30 was estimated at over 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the fall of business investment in one quarter did not
dilute the optimistic atmosphere spread all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank's chief economist Craig James was quoted by
press reports as saying: "Strong growth in profits, buoyant
business sentiment, firmer Australian dollar and improved out-look
for the world economy will prove positive influences on investment
plans in the next few quarters."

LANZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese glaciologists have found a
previously unknown mountain peak 8,011 meters high in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of peaks more than 8,000 meters high in
the world to 15. Most are along an arc from the Himalayas to the
Karakorum Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The peak, which has been named "Zhongyang (center)", is in the
Karakorums and is surrounded by glaciers that cover an area of
several hundred square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The peak was discovered by Mi Desheng, of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences' Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology, who
said he was surprised to find a 7,830-meter-high U-shape ridge
between the Zhongyang and Buluoate peaks while he was making a map
of the area.
</P>
<P>
Mi's discovery was later confirmed by Shi Yafeng of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rejects Milosevic Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to the U.N.
headquarters here Branko Brankovic on Thursday rejected a war
crimes indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic, denouncing it
an excuse for NATO to continue its air raids against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we are at the threshold of peace or a peaceful
solution, NATO countries try to put a stick in the process,"
Brankovic said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this might be a stick in the wheel of the whole
negotiation process, because they find excuses with this so-called
indictment to continue the bombing, which is the worst part of
everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
The International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague announced
earlier on Thursday that it had indicted Milosevic and four other
Serb officials for crimes.
</P>
<P>
"This court does not exist for us," therefore nor does the
indictment, Brankovic noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Security Council had no mandate -- either in
the international law or in the U.N. charter -- to set up the
court.
</P>
<P>
The indictment "is the last attempt by NATO countries to avoid
what is obviously inevitable, namely, a total collapse of the
policy of aggression by NATO against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," Brankovic said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav diplomat expressed hope for Russian Balkans envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin to make progress in his diplomatic efforts in
Belgrade. He said NATO countries should be excluded from any U.N.
civilian and security presence in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"All those countries that have participated in the aggression
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, namely countries from
NATO, are not welcome to send anybody to be present within the U.N.
(force), that is for sure," Brankovic said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, U.S. President Bill Clinton interrupted his
vacation in Florida to welcome the indictment and said NATO will
continue its air war on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It will make clear to the Serbian people precisely who is
responsible for this conflict and who is prolonging it," Clinton
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Many say leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which has been called by demonstrators in the United States as the
North Atlantic Terrorist Organization, should be indicted for the
war they launched on March 24 against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government has filed a lawsuit against NATO before
the war crimes tribunal. But the tribunal,which is dominated by
NATO countries, will not give the case a second glance.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have fled Kosovo and many were killed in
the brutal NATO bombing. The U.S.-led block not only targeted its
bombs at military sites in Yugoslavia, but also at civilian
installations including hospitals, refugee camps and the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces have shown courage and skill. We and our allies
have shown determination," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The United States blamed the Yugoslav authorities for the
refugee crisis, which was created by the alliance's violent
bombing, and claimed that NATO had hit the civilians by mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also reiterated the U.S. demands for halt to bombing:
withdrawal of the Serb forces from Kosovo, return of the ethnic
Albanian refugees and deployment of a NATO-led security force to
police the province.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Michael McFaul, a senior
researcher on Russia in the Carnegie Endowment, said that the
indictment will complicate the peace negotiations going on between
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the White House rejected suggestions that the
indictment may undermine Russia's efforts to negotiate a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French
President Jacques Chirac on Thursday to discuss the indictment,
which the spokesman suggested might help to erode Milosevic's
support within Yugoslavia, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

and stabilizing the institutions, marketing, etc. According to
Diouf, implementation of this strategy will be launched in October.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Golkar Party Calls For City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar Party
General Chairman Akbar Tanjung Thursday urged President B.J.
Habibie to impose city arrest on former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally in Solo, Central Java, Akbar urged
the government to solve the alleged corruption case involving
Soeharto, national newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the case is not settled before the next People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR)'s General Session, it would pose a
stumbling block to Habibie in presenting his accountability speech
to the MPR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party on May 14 had agreed to nominate Habibie as the
party's presidential candidate for the president election in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said it would be difficult for Habibie to become
president again if his accountability speech is rejected, but on
the other hand it would be easy for him to be re-appointed if his
speech is accepted.
</P>
<P>
One effective means would be imposing city arrest or tight
security on the former president, he added.
</P>
<P>
Akbar's statement was described by newspapers as an attempt to
regain the public's trust. Having been used as a vehicle by
Soeharto to stay in power for three decades, Golkar emerged with a
clear majority in each of the last six polls held under Soeharto's
regime amid complaints of cheating and election rigging.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the planned visit of Justice Minister Muladi and
Attorney General Andi Ghalib to Switzerland and Austria to probe
the alleged money transfer by Soeharto, Akbar said that all sides
should be given a chance to take follow-up steps on investigating
the alleged corruption case.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government should announce to the people the
results of the investigation so that they would know what the
government had been doing.
</P>
<P>
Habibie ordered Muladi and Ghalib to travel to Europe to follow
up on a report by the U.S. news magazine Time that 9 billion U.S.
dollars were transferred from a Swiss bank to an Austrian bank a
few days after Soeharto resigned from the presidency in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
Muladi Thursday said that he and Ghalib would leave on Sunday
following consultations with experts and officials, including
representatives of the U.S., Swiss and Austrian embassies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Soeharto visited Ghalib's office to
present a letter empowering the attorney general to investigate
any wealth found abroad in his name.
</P>
<P>
Although he insisted he held no assets abroad, Soeharto
promised to relinquish anything the government might find in his
name during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said it also offered to help the government by
contacting central banks in other countries.

<HEADLINE> German Law Experts: Charges Against Milosevic Politically Motivated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn May 27 (Xinhua) -- The international court's decision to
charge Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was made under
pressure from the West, and it will hamper diplomatic endeavors to
end the current Kosovo crisis, German law experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Norman Paech, a legal expert in Hamburg, described
the court's decision as an act of "political publicity." The
charges will not be easy to prove, he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands, on
Thursday issued an indictment against Milosevic charging him with
"war crimes."
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the international court is under pressure
from European countries and the U.S. to make the decision at this
time," Paech said.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which has won approval from leaders of Western
countries, will make it more difficult to seek a peaceful solution
to the Kosovo crisis, said Kai Ambos, a law expert in the city of
Freiburg.
</P>
<P>
"The charges can be negative to a peaceful solution," Ambos
said, adding, "Now it is more unlikely that Milosevic will be
willing to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
The West cannot expect the Yugoslav people to send Milosevic to
the court, said Karin Oellers-Frahm, a law expert from Germany's
well-known Max Plank Law Institute.
</P>
<P>
Another expert, Hajo Funke from the International Politics
Institute of Berlin Free University, said the decision was a
political pose rather than a pure juristic case.
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it is indicative of a ground war," Funke said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Yet to Decide SEA Games Medals Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- With only 10 weeks to go, Indonesia
is still waiting to set its medal target for the 20th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam, The Jakarta Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council (KONI) official in charge of the
SEA Games training Imron Z.S. said the individual sport bodies
with athletes competing in the biennial event in August must
submit their projected medal tally by mid-June at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"Each sport's body has yet to report to me on training programs
and the analysis of their opponents' strength. We hope they will
submit their reports next month to determine the medal-winning
estimation," he said after a KONI plenary meeting here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Imron said he visited 11 of the 20 organizations to observe
their training for the Games, which he said was "serious" despite
their shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
"They have made breakthroughs even though they also are
suffering from the financial crisis. The training also continues
without any disruption caused by general election campaigning. For
example, our boxers are still competing in the Arafura Games in
Darwin, Australia, as their SEA Games tryout," he said.
</P>
<P>
KONI received 10 billion rupiah (1.25 million U.S. dollars),
consisting of 5.5 billion rupiah from the National Development
Planning Board and 4.5 billion rupiah from the Gelora Senayan
Management Board. It is short of the goal of 22.3 billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will send 448 athletes in 20 sports at the Games, to
be held in Brunei Darussalam from August 7 to August 15.
</P>
<P>
The sports are badminton, basketball, billiards and snooker,
tenpin bowling, boxing, cycling, golf, hockey, karate, pencak
silat, sepak takraw, shooting, soccer, squash, swimming, table
tennis, taekwondo, tennis, track and field and traditional boat
racing.

<HEADLINE> Austria Busts Major Drug Trafficking Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A major drug trafficking ring has
been busted in a nationwide police operation in Austria, Federal
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Schloegl told the press that after preparations spanning one
year, 850 policemen in Vienna, lower Austria, Linz and Graz joined
in an operation Wednesday night that resulted in the arrest of
more than 70 drug traffickers and the seizure of a large amount of
drugs and cash.
</P>
<P>
He said 80 percent of the traffickers are people seeking asylum,
or people without legal resident status. The operation reportedly
destroyed the entire structure of the ring, suspected to be well
connected with at least 100 other groups inside and outside of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the group sold at least 10 kilograms of
heroin and cocaine every month. About six kilograms of drugs,
worth some 24 million schillings( 1.92 million U.S. dollars), were
seized in this operation while some 2.5 million schillings (200,
000 dollars) were confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Most Romanians Against NATO Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Public objection by Romanians to
the U.S.-led NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia increased in May,
according to a poll published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the IMAS firm on May 15-20, showed that
78.1 percent of those questioned were against the airstrikes, up 2.
3 percentage points from the result of a similar poll conducted in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The poll, in which 1,511 adults were questioned, carries a 2.6
percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to reports of the popular ANTENA-1 TV
Station, most Romanian people believe the current Kosovo crisis
should be solved by Balkan countries through political and
diplomatic means. Some said the reason the US-led NATO continues
current airstrikes against Yugoslavia is to show it boasts a "
power machine" capable of controlling Europe.
</P>
<P>
Romanians have already organized several anti-war
demonstrations since NATO started its airstrikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties on many occasions have criticized the
stand adopted by the Romanian government's support of NATO. They
said the government's position does not represent the will of the
public.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the recent sharp fall of public support for
the Romanian coalition government to the gap between the
government and the public opinion on the Kosovo issue.

COLOMBO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government had
provided a grant of 7 million U.S. dollars to support Sri Lanka's
bridge reconstruction program this year, the official Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is a follow-up grant of 3.5 million U.S. dollars last year
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
A total of five bridges have been identified by the Japan
International Cooperation Agency for funding for urgent
reconstruction. Three of these bridges are already under
construction with funds from the previous grant, the report said.
</P>
<P>
These three bridges are located at Modaela at Elpitiya in the
Northern Province, Bolawatte at Dankotuwa in the North Western
province and Gilimale at Ratnapura in the Sabaragamuwa Province.
</P>
<P>
Funds provided under the new grant will be used to construct
the 42-meter long Kospalana bridge across the Bolgoda Lake in the
Western Province and the 75-meter long Narthupana bridge at
Anguruwatota in the Southern Province.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been a major contributor towards the development of
roads and bridges in Sri Lanka. At present the widening of the
Baseline Road and the construction of the Japan Friendship bridge
across the Kelani river are being carried out with Japanese
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Opposes Tribunal Indictment Against Yugoslav Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Swedish leaders on Thursday
disapproved of the decision by the International War Crimes
Tribunal to indict Yugoslav leaders for "war crimes," saying it
will not help find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said the indictment by the
International Tribunal in the Hague against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and four other Serb leaders will only make
negotiations aimed at solving the Kosovo crisis politically more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The move will undermine the peace process in the Balkans, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Anna Lindh said the crime indictments against
Yugoslav leaders are "inappropriate" from a political viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, the United Nations' special envoy to the Balkans
and the former Swedish Prime Minister, said the war crimes
indictment against Milosevic would cause big problems to the peace
process in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War
Crimes Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, confirmed Thursday that the
Tribunal had indicted Milosevic and four other Serb officials for

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Romania said Thursday they
would join hands to push for an early end to the Kosovo crisis as
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu arrived here for a two-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after their talks, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said that as neighbors of Yugoslavia, Ukraine and
Romania have suffered severe economic losses caused by the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
NATO's over-60-day wanton bombings have not only caused
enormous life and economic losses to Yugoslavia but also inflicted
serious economic damages and social problems upon neighbor
countries, Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said the proper handling by Ukraine and Romania
of their own ethnic minority issues could serve as a good example
in solving the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Such an example plus diplomatic efforts, he added, would be
conducive to peace in Kosovo, a Serbian province overwhelmingly
populated by ethnic Albanians seeking independence for years.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed potentials of bilateral
cooperation in various sectors, notably in economic and trade
fields.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Crashes out of French Open, again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- World number two Pete Sampras has
once again failed to capture the only Grand Slam title that has
eluded him, crashing out at the French Open second round in four
sets here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Grand Slam titles holder went down to No.100 Andrei
Medvedev of Ukraine 7-5, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a flawed game which saw
him spray 61 unforced errors and serve just five aces.
</P>
<P>
It marked the second consecutive year for Sampras to bid
farewell to the famous Rolland Caros court at the early second
round stage. The American fell to No. 97 Ramon Delgado of Paraguay
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' loss, a day after the exit of No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia, left the French Open without seven of its 16 seeded men
before the end of the second round.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the men's event, Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, the
1997 champion, breezed through Argentine Guillermo Canas 6-2, 6-3,
3-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
No.16 Thomas Enqvist of Sweden bowed to Norway's Christian Ruud
7-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the women's action, eighth seed Pierce of France went out 4-
6, 6-3, 6-3 to Spain's Conchita Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati advanced to the third round with a 6-3, 3-6,
6-2 victory over fellow American Lilia Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
Also advancing are Americans No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, a 6-3, 2-
6, 7-5 winner over 16-year-old Justine Henin of Belgium and No. 3
Monica Seles, who beat Bulgarian Lubomira Bacheva 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Steffi Graf of Germany, No. 11 Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland, No. 16 Julie Halard Decugis France, and unseeded Anna
Kournikova of Russua also reached the third round.

<P>
CHENGDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- In the past 36 years, southwest
China's Sichuan Province has set up 51 wild plant and animal
protection zones.
</P>
<P>
A local environmental protection official says that the zones
cover 2.4 million hectares of land in all and 80 percent of the
province's rare animals like the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The Wolong Nature Protection Zone for Giant Pandas has been

</P>
<P>
Sichuan has 12 giant panda protection zones on 5,000 square

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Sets up New Bank to Back Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government would
open a new bank next month to finance exports, Minister of
Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the legal basis for the establishment of the special
financing agency was signed by President B.J. Habibie Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, the agency, to be named Bank Eksport
(Export) Indonesia, will begin operations with an initial paid-up
capital of 3 trillion rupiah (about 375 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The agency will start its operations next month," Rahardi was
quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said private companies would be allowed to hold shares in
the bank, but the government would be the majority shareholder.
</P>
<P>
The bank would not raise funds from the public, Rahardi said,
adding that the bank's funding would mainly come from bilateral
and multilateral foreign financial institutions, including the
Japan Export Import Bank, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government has secured one billion U.S. dollars in standing
loans from the Japan Export Import Bank to finance the new bank's
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The export financing agency is designed to provide financial
assistance to Indonesian exporters who had been hurt by the
collapse of the country's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Because of low international confidence in the local banking
system, letters of credit issued by local banks are often rejected
by foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The government attempted to help export companies by
guaranteeing all letters of credit issued by certain local banks.
However, exporters still have had to make deposits before being
allowed to open letters of credit at these local banks.

<HEADLINE> Andean Nations Vow to Tighten Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Andean
Community countries concluded a two-day summit here Thursday,
pledging to strengthen relations and cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the summit, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said creating an Andean common market before the year
2005 is their main commitment.
</P>
<P>
He said the Andean nations also agreed to adopt a common
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In a final statement, the Andean leaders agreed to strengthen
relations with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), which groups
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community consists of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Venezuela, with a total population of 105 million.
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized the importance of regional integration
between the Andean Community and Mercosur, saying it will promote
economic and social development in both blocks.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the European Union to ease debt burdens
of the poorest countries in Latin America as the high debt
servicing limits their social development and affects their
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Andean summit opened on Wednesday in the historic
Caribbean port city of Cartagena, coinciding with the group's 30th
anniversary.

<HEADLINE> NATO Air War on Yugoslavia Affects Ecuador's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO's endless bombing
of Yugoslavia has affected Ecuador's banana exports, one of its
main hard currency earners.
</P>
<P>
The Banana Exporters Association (AEBE) said in a report
Thursday that Ecuador exports its bananas to Russia, Lithuania,
Poland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Romania and Yugoslavia via the
Mediterranean-Adriatic route, which is the most cost-saving in
terms of maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
However, in the aftermath of NATO bombings, boats carrying
Ecuadorian bananas refrain from crossing the Adriatic sea for
safety considerations. As a result, the ports along the
Mediterranean-Adriatic route have failed to receive 7.8 million
boxes of bananas as expected.
</P>
<P>
The AEBE's Executive Director Sergio Seminario said that
bananas which can not enter the conflict zone have tried to enter
other European markets, resulting in an excessive supply, a
drastic drop in the banana prices and great losses to banana
exporters.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Ecuador earned 1.071 billion U.S. dollars from banana
exports. The figure is expected to drop well below 950 million
dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Drink Less Milk Than Liquor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- There is still a long way to go to
have ordinary Chinese people get used to drinking milk, experts
said, lamenting that customers buy more liquor than milk and dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
A report delivered by the China Dairy Industry Association
reveals that at present eight million tons of spirits is produced
in the country a year, compared with 7.4 million tons of milk,
though milk sells much cheaper than liquor.
</P>
<P>
An average Chinese drinks 6.6 kilos of milk a year or the
equivalent every day of two tiny bottles of eye drops, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
About half of the country's milk output is consumed by people
in Beijing and Shanghai, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The world average consumption for an average person a year is
102 kilos.
</P>
<P>
Alcoholic drink has a history of thousands of years in China

<HEADLINE> China's First Local Rule on Radioactive Pollution Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province, a major nuclear
industry base in southwest China, has issued a regulation on
radioactive pollution, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The regulation was announced at yesterday's news conference by
Director Zhao Xiwen of the Provincial Bureau on Legal Affairs. He
noted that at the present time China has no national law dealing
with this issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Sichuan has many nuclear facilities
which are posing the threat of possible nuclear pollution
discharges and leakage.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government hopes this new rule will provide a
legal means for insuring the safe use of nuclear technology, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulation, institutions producing
nuclear waste do not have the right to dispose of the waste,
instead, all nuclear waste and other polluting materials must be
handed over to special warehouses. Also, local governments are not
allowed to approve radioactive projects without prior consent from
the central government or the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, in 1991 the central government
invested in Sichuan in building a large nuclear waste storage
facility sufficient to hold radioactive waste produced in Sichuan
within 20 years, and with a safety guarantee term of 100 years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has shut down a number of
polluting rare-earth mines and further strengthened its nuclear-
pollution monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are three nuclear-pollution monitoring centers
in China, one in Sichuan and the other two in Guangdong and
Zhejiang provinces. Both Guangdong and Zhejiang have nuclear power
stations.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Fishing in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 28 ( Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Agriculture
is to ban fishing in South China Sea starting from midnight on
June 1 to midnight of July 31 this year in a bid to protect fish
resources.
</P>
<P>
Trawlers and net catches by boats are banned in an area north
to 12 degrees of north latitude, including the Beibu Gulf, in line
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong provincial government has made preparations for
the implementation of the decision and decided to grant subsidies
for fishermen who may suffer a great loss due to the order,
according to Dai Yongren, deputy director of the Provincial Marine
and Aquatic Products Department.
</P>
<P>
Berths for 70,000 fishing boats from Guangdong and Hainan
provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been
designated.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that Guangdong's aquatic products output would be
reduced by about 200,000 tons, or one-eighth of the province's
total, due to the two-month long fishing ban.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, fish supplies would be little affected as
there are 300,000 tons of frozen aquatic products in stock that
could last two months.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China, for the first time, banned fishing in July and
August in its offshore waters.

<HEADLINE> Portland Hopes to Kill Utah Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Hoping to avoid a return trip
to Utah, the Portland Trail Blazers attempt to continue their home-
playoff dominance against the Jazz in Game Six of their Western
Conference semifinal series tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers failed to wrap up the series in Utah on
Tuesday as Karl Malone scored 23 points to lead the Jazz to a
convincing 88-71 victory.
</P>
<P>
Now the Blazers are back on their home floor, where they have
won their last 10 playoff encounters with Utah, including Games
Three and Four in this series.
</P>
<P>
Portland's last home-playoff loss against the Jazz came on
April 30, in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Portland posted a league-best 23-3 mark at home during the
regular season and have won all four of its postseason games at
the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
Malone, who sparked the Jazz to a 93-83 win in Game One with a
left elbow to Brian Grant's jaw, once again found his spot with
his elbow in Game Five when he found the bridge of Grant's nose in
the first quarter. Malone was fined $10,000 for the Game One
incident.
</P>
<P>
The two-time Western Conference defending champion Jazz are 3-0
this postseason when facing elimination and 6-1 over the last two
years. They have not been ousted prior to the championship round
since losing a decisive seventh game to the Seattle SuperSonic in
the 1996 Western finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The tickets for the women's
World Cup soccer championship have been sold over 400,000, well
past the organizers' initial projections.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Women's World Cup, unlike the men's World Cup, is
relying almost exclusively on fans from the United States. The
championship will start on June 19.
</P>
<P>
More than 62,000 tickets have been sold for the first day
doubleheader in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which matches the
United States against Denmark and Brazil vs. Mexico, said the cup
president Marla Messing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Messing said the tournament is averaging more than 23,000
tickets per doubleheader, including 16,000 for those not involving
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The organizers initially projected ticket sales of 386,000, but
has since revised that to 475,000. Messing thought that 500,000 is
more than reachable.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup runs June 19 to July 10 in seven U.S. venues with
16 teams attending.

FUZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The border police in Fuzhou, capital

<HEADLINE> Official: U.S. Remains Committed to Engagement with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government vowed
Thursday to continue its engagement policy with China despite the
bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the release of the
anti-China Cox Report.
</P>
<P>
"We are still prepared and want to engage, to try to make
progress on all the issues that we have with China," said Stanley
Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Roth told a Senate committee that the United States is not
going to use the bombing incident as a reason to alter its
policies.
</P>
<P>
Roth, who spoke at the hearing of the bombing incident at the
the Eastern Asian and Pacific Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign
Relations, expressed his hope that the effects of the bombing on
the U.S.-China relations will be short.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-China relationship has seen difficult times in the
past and overcome them. The United States is committed to doing so
once again," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If China is equally committed to making the relationship work,
I am hopeful we will overcome the effects of this tragic
accident," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same hearing, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
Defense Frank Kramer said "comprehensive engagement with Beijing
represents the best way to promote our interests and to encourage
a positive and constructive PRC role in the world".
</P>
<P>
Kramer said that it is important for the United States to deal
with China as a "developing" and "a potentially rising major
power".
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is ready to resume military relations with
China "once it is appropriate".
</P>
<P>
The China-U.S. relations suffered a serious setback due to the
bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade, in which three Chinese
were killed and 20 others injured, and the recent release of the
anti-China Cox Report that accused China of "stealing" nuclear
secrets from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
China has postponed high-level military contacts and suspended
dialogs on proliferation and human rights with the United States
after the bombing incident.
</P>
<P>
"China is too big to ignore and too important to our interests
in the long term to not to look for constructive ways to engage
them," said Senator Gordon Smith at the same hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Senator hoped that the two countries will "ultimately be
able to rebuild a more constructive relationship".

<HEADLINE> WB Supports Animal, Plant Health Protection in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a loan of 44 million U.S. dollars to help Brazil increase
the competitiveness and productivity of its agricultural and
livestock sector.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the project will support the Brazilian
government's efforts to eliminate or significantly control the
incidence of animal and plant diseases which result in trade
barriers, and strengthen the country's sanitary and phytosanitary
monitoring and surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
The government also will reorient the public health sector role
to a regulatory, certification, and inspection function and
strengthen its coordinating and facilitating functions in animal
and plant health protection.
</P>
<P>
The private sector participation in the design and delivery of
animal and plant health protection services also will be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The project will promote increased competitiveness and enhanced
productivity by helping the government mobilize farmers to promote
systematic interventions in agricultural sanitary and
phytosanitary practices in 14 states, which will lower mortality
and morbidity rates in livestock and reduce losses in the fruit
sector due to pests and plagues, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of this project is 88 million dollars, of which
the World Bank will contribute 50 percent, the Brazilian
government 20 percent, famers associations 15 percent, and state
governments 15 percent. The bank's loan is a single-currency,
LIBOR-based loan with 15 years maturity and a five-year grace
period.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 180 Million Dollar Credit for Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a credit of 180 million U.S. dollars to support the
government of Ghana in strengthening the foundation for sustained
broad-based, private sector-led economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This credit will assist the government's medium-term strategy
outlined in "Ghana Vision 2020" which aims to turn Ghana into a
middle-income country by the turn of the next decade, the bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Second Economic Reform Support Operation Credit will build
upon foundation laid in the first credit by consolidating recent
gains in macroeconomic stability and by supporting the
implementation of a deeper and more challenging phase of reforms
in the cocoa, energy, and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The credit will also assist in reducing the government's
domestic financing requirements and help support a downward trend
in inflation and interest rates, resulting in a reduction of the
country's heavy domestic debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The creation of an enabling environment for private investment
is the main focal point of the government's strategy for
accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction, according to
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, the World Bank's lending arm for poor countries, and
will be repayable in 40 years, including a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Dow Index Plunges on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged Thursday as investors continued to get concerned with
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 235.23, or by 2.2 percent at 10,466.93,
wiping out all the gain of 171.07 points Wednesday. It was the
ninth-worst point drop ever since September 30, 1998, when the
Blue chip index lost 237.20.
</P>
<P>
The government report on a robust economic growth rate of 4.1
percent with a modest 1.1 percent rise in the first quarter did
not encourage the market but renewed investors' fear of inflation
that would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rate to
cool off the economy. The market rallied, ending a four day slump
Wednesday mainly because an official report on declining factory
orders for big-ticket manufactured goods last month eased the
market concerns about inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a response to a 0.7 percent rise in consumer prices in
April, The Federal Reserve warned last week that more sings of the
inflationary pressures would prompt it to raise interest rates in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking from Wednesday's gains also helped the selloff
before investors were going into the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 23.35 at 1,281.41 while the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 8.02 at 2,419.15.
</P>

The NYSE index fell 10.82 at 614.02 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 8.27 at 774.39. The Russell 2000 index of

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,936 down, 1,041 up and 551
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 809.18 million shares from 868.39

<HEADLINE> EU Official Rules out Financial Aid to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN May 27 (Xinhua)--A key European Union (EU) official
Thursday said the bloc would not give any financial assistance to
Yugoslavia if President Slobodan Milosevic still governed the
country.
</P>
<P>
Guenter Burghardt, general director of the European Commission,
told the Deutsche Welle radio that even after the situation in
Kosvo was settled, he did not believe there was anyone seriously
prepared to support Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Burghardt was in Berlin attending a meeting of 28 European
nations to discuss a stability pact for the Balkan region. The
pact was aimed at rebuilding the region following the end of the
war.
</P>
<P>
The Europe has wasted 7 billion euros ( 7.3 billion dollars )
since 1991, as a result of wars in Yugoslavia, Burghardt said. He
attributed the losses to Milosevic's policy.
