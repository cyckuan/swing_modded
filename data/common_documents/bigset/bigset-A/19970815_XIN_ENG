<HEADLINE> Arafat's Says Israeli Sanctions Lead to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- In his first comments
following the visit of United States peace envoy Dennis Ross,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today warned that the continued
Israeli sanctions would lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Jewish and Arab members of Israel's
Hadash Party in Ramallah, Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of fighting the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) instead of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Israeli sanctions, imposed after the July
30 suicide bombings in Jerusalem which killed 16 people,
inflicted tremendous sufferings to the Palestinian people. He
estimated that 100,000 Palestinian workers are not paid due to
Israel's halt of transferring the 14 million-U.S. dollar tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader vowed that none can humiliate the
Palestinian people, who would never be forced to kneel down.
</P>
<P>
Later in a meeting in Nablus with visiting Israeli opposition
Labor lawmaker Yossi Beilin, Arafat downplayed the results of
Ross' just-concluded shuttle mission to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not optimistic about the situation following
Ross' visit, but added he was looking forward to the pending
visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's comments reflected his unsatisfaction with Ross, who
focused his attention on pressuring the PNA to fight terrorism
while failing to persuade Israel to lift the sanctions against
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Washington after his fifth meeting with
Arafat in Ramallah Wednesday night, Ross claimed he had succeeded
in opening a new beginning for reviving the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross described his major achievement as having managed to
persuade the PNA to renew security cooperation with Israel under a
mechanism, in which U.S. officials from the Central Intelligence
Agency will participate and monitor the Israeli-Palestinian
security efforts in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have expressed regret about Ross'
one-sided position in favor of Israel's security needs, while
refraining from exerting more pressure on Israel to lift
sanctions against the Palestinians. Senior Palestinian negotiator
Nabil Shaath said Ross was returning "empty-handed" because of
his failure to lift the Israeli sanctions.
</P>
<P>
One concrete result of Ross' mission seemed to be that he had
paved the way for Albright's much-expected first visit to the
Middle East to promote the ill-fated peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before Ross' visit, Albright made it clear that her visit was
conditional on Ross' success in renewing the Israeli-Palestinian
security cooperation, which Ross claimed having been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports expected Albright to visit the region in
early weeks of September, and before then Ross would likely return
here to prepare for her trip.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Condemns Arson in Market Stalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today condemned the burning of the old Soweto market
stalls, saying it was the work of Zambia's enemies and that the
government had nothing to do with the arson.
</P>
<P>
The burning is an act of dogs and is retrogressive and
criminal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The days when people were political idiots and resolved to
burning property were long gone, he remarked at Soweto market
after touring the section burnt by a mysterious fire on Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to find out how many stalls was
destroyed to see how the victims of the burned stalls could be
assisted by the state.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged his countrymen to be alert and guard against
such criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
He assured the marketeers that the government has every
intention to build new structures behind the newly-opened Lusaka
city market.
</P>
<P>
Street vendors should not be chased from the streets unless an
alternative place is found for them to operate from, noted the
president.
</P>
<P>
The burning of the stalls triggered off riots on Wednesday in
the capital city. More than 60 people were arrested and dozens
of others injured in the clashes between policemen and vendors
who went on rampage in protest against the arson.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Starts Oil Pumping Through Iraqi-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish oil company BOTAS said
that Iraq today started to pump oil through Baku-Ceyhan oil
pipeline under the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A BOTAS statement said that pumping of crude oil started in
Iraq at 10:55 local time (07:55 GMT) and the oil was loaded onto
the shipping-tank of BOTAS called Arcadia in the southern
Mediterranean Turkish port of Ceyhan to be shipped to buyers.
</P>
<P>
The shipment is the first in the second phase of U.N.'s
oil-for-food program, which was renewed on June 8, allowing Iraq
to sell another 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a
six-month period to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that 63.7 million barrels of oil were
transferred from Kirkuk oil fields to Ceyhan from last December to
June, the first six-month period of limited oil sale of Iraq
under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the 30 million barrels of Iraqi oil, which
is planned to be sold by the end of August, will be loaded from
Ceyhan and 1.8 million barrels of this amount will be purchased by
Turkish oil company Tupras, added the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Turkish pipeline was closed on August 8, 1990 due to
a U.N. embargo imposed upon Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Does Not Rule Out Pre-Election Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
once again rejected calls by Finance Minister Theo Waigel for an
immediate cabinet reshuffle, but did not rule out the possibility
of personnel changes at a later date.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment I don't see any reason for a reshuffle," Kohl,
who is now on vacation in Austria, said in an interview with the
German ZDF television network.
</P>
<P>
But when asked if a cabinet reshuffle was possible before the
German general elections due in September next year, Kohl said,
"I'm completely open on this, but I'd not say now what I'll be
doing before the election."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild today, Waigel
said a shake-up would strengthen Kohl's 17-member cabinet and
improve his chances to win the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that some ministers did want to leave but were just
trying to hang on to their jobs until the elections, Waigel urged
Kohl to drop them now for the benefit of the whole ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the government's plan for tax reform
has been foiled by the main opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) and the economy is growing too slowly to bring down
Germany's record unemployment, analysts said that a shake-up in
Kohl's cabinet was overdue and could help reverve the government's
steep slide in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
A columnist of the Welt newspaper even questioned whether Kohl
himself had instructed Waigel to speak out, a notion rejected by
Kohl today.
</P>
<P>
According to an Allensbach Institute poll published Wednesday,
Kohl's party continued to trail the SPD in popularity.
</P>
<P>
His Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) chaired by Waigel, would
win just 33.4 percent of the vote if elections were held next
Sunday, the poll said. The SPD meanwhile would win 37.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even without a large-scale reshuffle, Waigel's CSU is still set
to lose one seat in the cabinet at the end of this year when the
Postal Ministry become defunct due to privatization. Some press
reports said that by suggesting a cabinet reshuffle, Waigel was
actually demanding compensation for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also admitted that the dismantlement of the Postal
Ministry would tilt the balance of his ruling three-party
coalition consisted of the CDU, the CSU and the junior partner Free
Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to talk about the issue," Kohl said, but stressed
that it was not a question for public debate.
</P>
<P>
The FDP, which fears that it might be forced to give up one of
its cabinet posts to the CSU, today also reject Waigel's cabinet
reshuffle proposal as "totally unnecessary."

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Erupts in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A defense information officer of
Sierra Leone's military government confirmed today that there was
fresh fighting between west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
and government soldiers near the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the British Broadcasting Company, the
fighting erupted Wednesday evening in Lungi, the location of
Sierra Leone's main international airport outside Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out as some units of the ECOMOG contingent
based in the airport moved from their positions and tried to use
the cover of darkness to attack government positions around the
airport area at about 10:30 last night, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures have not been released, however, the defense
source said they did not suffer any loss in the fighting despite
the fact that ECOMOG had used heavy weapons such as mortars and
artillery.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, hundreds of local residents fled into
all directions in the long fighting, and a number of houses were
destroyed, most of which were blamed on ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The battle, one of a series of clashes since the May 25 coup,
broke out as many people were hoping talks would restart between
the junta in power and the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) when diplomatic moves were stepped up for
peaceful settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting has been continuing around Zimmi,
southeastern Sierra Leone, between government soldiers and their
allies, the former rebel Revolutionary United Front, and the
Kamajors, a group of tradition hunters who have vowed to restore
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said the Kamajor militiamen were forced
to retreat from a town east of Zimmi, under the attack of
mortars and artillery of their enemies.
</P>
<P>
But a battle field commander was quoted as saying: "We will
never give up this fight. We will fight back."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 22 people, including 10 soldiers,
were killed last weekend in clashes around Zimmi, 250 km
southeast of Freetown near the border of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The strategic town, with Liberia just across the Mano River,
has been the scene of heavy fighting between the Kamajors and
government soldiers in the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues to Expel Ethnics From Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF) and border police forces are continuing to evict about 150
members of the Bedouin Jahalin Tribe from their homeland,
according to a statement of a human rights group today.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen and women are again being driven out of
their dwelling places where they have lived for 40 years since
their first expulsion shortly after the establishment of the
State of Israel in much of Palestine in 1948, said the
statement issued by the Catholic Human Rights Center for Legal
Resources and Development.
</P>
<P>
"This eviction is another phase in Israel's plan to expand
"Jerusalem" and impose direct Israeli hegemony in 1967-occupied
Palestine. This expulsion will create Jewish territorial
continuity between Jerusalem and the (Jewish) settlement of Ma'ale
Adumim," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement continued, "The Jahalin are being removed to an
alternative -- environmentally hazardous -- site set aside for
the Bedouin. This is an area set aside for the 'natives' because
it is not good enough for the Jews."
</P>
<P>
"This system is based on the same principle 'group areas' used
by the white South African apartheid regime condemned by the
civilized world, according to which each racial group had to live
in its own designated areas," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement added "The Bedouin are forced to live in
intolerable, inhuman conditions: moving their families into
containers originally designed to house goods, not people, and
into tin shacks which are like ovens under the burning sun."

<HEADLINE> Russian Finance Ministry to Pay Debts to Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Finance Ministry has
allocated 2.5 trillion rubles (about 432 million US dollars) to
pay off wage arrears to the military since early this month, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted head of the federal treasure at
the Finance Ministry Alexander Smirnov as telling the Financial
Information Agency today that the Finance Ministry will earmark
another 1.5 trillion rubles (259 million dollars) for the purpose
by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The head said he was confident "they will do their part of the
job and pay off the debt to the military before September 1." In
July, the ministry channeled 1.9 trillion rubles (328 million
dollars) for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Smirnov sharply criticized the Defense
Ministry and the local commanders. He said, "The debt amounted to
4.5 trillion rubles (777 million dollars) in early July when we
were preparing the presidential decree on paying off arrears to
the military. Later the figure increased to 5.9 trillion rubles (1
billion dollars). Now the military is saying the amount exceeds
8 trillion (1.38 billion dollars)."
</P>
<P>
"We have the impression the schedule of covering the arrears
exists only for the Finance Ministry, while local commanders often
use the arriving funds as they see fit," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that wage arrears to federal defense and law

<HEADLINE> Northern Iraqi PUK Leader Asks Turkey's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani today asked Turkey's support
against the "assimilation policy" of the Baghdad government.
</P>
<P>
Talabani, who arrived here Wednesday night for a visit, made
the remarks at a press conference here following his contacts with
Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party will do its best to protect the
security of the Turkish border along northern Iraq, adding that
Turkey has the right to have safe borders.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party always
infiltrate into Turkey from northern Iraq to launch attacks on
Turkish military and civil targets in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Talabani added that he had discussed the expansion of
no-fly zone with U.N. officials, not with Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur
Oymen said that Turkey attributes importance to continue its ties
with the different parties in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources said that Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani is also expected to visit Turkey
in a bid to be informed on the results of the visit by Talabani.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the PUK fought a war with the Iraqi
government-backed KDP, leading to a U.S. air strikes against the
Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996 under
the mediation by the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish
rebels since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival
zones after the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Lead SADC Campaign Against Gender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe was chosen to lead the
campaign to fight domestic violence against women in the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) region, a Zimbabwean minister
said today.
</P>
<P>
Thenjiwe Lesabe, Minister of National Affairs, Employment
Creation and Cooperatives, said Zimbabwe was chosen on Tuesday in
Gaborone, Botswana at a meeting of SADC ministers for women's
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We were chosen because we have a good working relationship
with some of our non-governmental organisations (NGO) which deal
with women's issues and we have asked these NGOs to help us,"she
said.
</P>
<P>
The government would work with the NGOs to come up with a
document to map out a strategy for educating people in the region
about domestic violence against women and other gender issues,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists on the outcome of the Gaborone meeting,
Lesabe said the ministers had also approved a declaration on
gender issues which was drafted in Namibia in January this year
at a ministerial meeting of the Council of Women's Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The declaration would now be presented to the meeting of SADC
heads of state in September in Malawi for approval.
</P>
<P>
However, Lesabe could not reveal the details of the
declaration, saying they would only be revealed after they had
been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Gaborone meeting was attended by all SADC countries,
together with representatives of NGOs which deal with gender
issues.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Suspends Domestic Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has suspended with immediate effect issuing loan guarantees to
public enterprises as a measure of minimizing debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced today by Minister for Finance
Daniel Yona at a seminar on national debt awareness held in
Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Government guarantees issued to public corporations in the
past to cover their borrowings were not properly handled, "thus
resulting in many corporations' default on their obligations and
passing over the burden to the government with serious
implications on the budget", Yona said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yona, many government institutions including
ministries, parastatals have made the government in heavy debt
due to their failure to observe the provisions of the Government
Loans, Guarantees and Grants Act.
</P>
<P>
The government has been necessitated to instruct ministries
and parastatal organizations not to incur any new debts without
prior approval of the cabinet, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 people including principal secretaries, senior
government officials and heads of public institutions are taking
part in the seminar.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Concerned at Low Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) was deeply concerned by the all-time low
level of aid to developing countries in 1996, UNICEF chief Carol
Bellamy said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite a steady rise in the number of people with incomes of
less than one dollar a day, overall aid to developing countries
last year tumbled 4 percent in real terms over 1995, to 55.1
billion dollars from 58.9 billion dollars, according to a report
released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The OECD reported recently that the Official Development Aid
fell to 0.25 percent of the combined gross national product (GDP)
compared to 0.27 percent in 1995. These are the lowest recorded in
the nearly 30 years since the United Nations set a global aid
target of 0.7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
"These are more than numbers in an accounting ledger; they
represent a threat to millions of children and to the societies in
which they are growing up. They are a testament to the persistence
of appalling global inequalities -- and to the international
community's shameful failure to eradicate them," she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF executive director noted that according to UN
estimates, 1.3 billion people are trapped in absolute poverty --
650 million of them are children -- and their numbers are growing
in every region of the world except South-East Asian and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
If governments summon the will to earmark 0.7 percent of their
GNP for official development assistance, the additional proceeds
would more than cover the additional 80 billion dollars over 10
years that the UN estimates required to eliminate the worst
aspects of global poverty, she said.
</P>
<P>
The tailspin in aid levels is a direct challenge to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which speaks to the plight
of the world's poorest children, and to the work of the United
Nations generally, she said.
</P>
<P>
Private investment and financing are absolutely vital if the
poorest countries are to emerge from poverty, she said, "yet they
cannot attract the private sector without official development
assistance. ODA not only helps these countries weather painful
economic reforms, but enables them to create the social and
economic infrastructure that is vital to development," Bellamy
stressed.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian cosmonauts Vasily
Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin today returned to the earth safe
and sound from the troubled space station Mir today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax, during the stay in orbit that lasted
186 days, the cosmonauts made one of three planned space walks,
received two progress cargo craft, carried out a docking with the
U.S. Atlantis space shuttle and conducted a number of experiments
in the areas of biology, geophysics, materials science, ecology
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
It said the most interesting research work in orbit concerned
experiments to study the brain, sleep and human conduct in extreme
situations and zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
However, this expedition was marked by a record number of
incidents on the Mir space station, the flight control center
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the toughest tour in the history of space navigation.
There were 10 incidents within a half year in the space station
Mir.
</P>
<P>
The most serious of the incidents occurred on June 25, when the
Progress M-34 cargo space craft collided with the Spektr
scientific module. The collision made the scientific module
airless and cut power supplies to the orbital space station by
almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Expenses on the restoration operation to repair the Spektr
module and the delivery of materials for repair work to the
orbital space station exceeded 100 billion rubles (17.27 million
US dollars), Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri
Koptev said.

LAGOS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- By June this year, members
countries of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) have owed the sub-regional organization about 44.7
million U.S. Dollars, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an ECOWAS source as saying in Lagos today
that the debt includes arrears of between 3 to 17 years as well
as contributions for 1997.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, among ECOWAS's 16 members, only the Benin
Republic and Cote D'Ivoire have fully paid their contributions,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has not paid its contributions since 1980, while
Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea Bissau have not paid
their contributions for 14, 11, 9 and 8 years, it
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ECOWAS secretariat in Lagos has been
suffering difficulties in organizing its activities, and indeed
in paying its staff, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS source noted particularly that this year's ECOWAS
summit, which had been scheduled for this month in Abuja, had
been postponed to an unknown time to allow Liberia's new

CAIRO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' total imports (covering imports for home
consumption and imports placed into bonded warehouses) in the
first five months of 1997 fell by 4.5 percent to 765.1 million
Cyprus pounds (about 1,392.48 million U.S. dollars), compared to
801.3 million pounds (about 1,458.37 million dollars) in the same

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anti-Semitic Incidents on Rise in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- As hundreds of European Nazi
sympathizers are preparing to organize ceremonies Saturday marking
the 10th anniversary of the death of Rudolf Hess, the top aide of
Hitler, two synagogues and two Jewish shops in the southern French
city of Nice were attacked Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Creating the most serious anti-Semitic incident in France since
the Carpentras incident in which several skinheads destroyed tombs
at a Jewish cemetery years ago, attackers desecrated the
synagogues with Nazi slogans and painted swastikas on their
facade.
</P>
<P>
This incident is not an isolated one: anti-Semitic incidents
have taken place recently in the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland,
Portugal, Germany, and Belgium, while Denmark will see a big
neo-Nazi rally in Roskilde Saturday and the extreme-right in
Norway are winning unprecedented support in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Unknown people placed leaflets denying the existence of Nazi
death chambers on cars parked near an open-air film theater Monday
evening near Zurich, Switzerland, when the movie "The List of
Schindler" was being shown.
</P>
<P>
The military aide of former Portuguese President Mario Soares
and candidate for the mayorship of Porto, General Azeredo,
described in a published article the Jewish nation as "the
inventor of usury which made it odious and persecuted by many
peoples in the course of history."
</P>
<P>
In the two Dutch cities of Alphen aan den Rijn and Woubruge,
unknown people distributed Wednesday and today on parked cars
leaflets printed with the pictures of Hess and accusing the
British government of murdering the former Nazi leader, who
committed suicide on August 17, 1987, in the prison of
Berlin-Spandau in West Berlin.
</P>
<P>
People protested in the German city of Hamburg today when an
exhibition of the works of Nazi movie shooter Leni Riefenstahl,
who produced numerous big propaganda films for Hitler, was opened
in an art gallery.
</P>
<P>
In the Italian capital Rome, a mysterious group called itself
"Beam of Revolutionary Action -- Core Alessandro Pavolini,"
which is named after an Italian wartime fascist leader, Wednesday
asked for the "symbolic hanging" of paper effigies bearing the
names of the Italian partisans who killed 33 German SS soldiers in
an ambush in central Rome on March 23, 1944.
</P>
<P>
In the Belgian city of Antwerp, where lives a big Jewish
community specialized in diamond-cutting, the extreme-right party
Vlaam Blok has been campaigning for the naming of a street after a

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up 0.2 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the U.S.
increased by a modest 0.2 percent in July, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the increase in its Consumer Price
Index was also the largest since a 0.3 percent advance last
February. Increases in each of the following four months were just
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gain in July resulted in an increase of 1.5 percent annual
rate in the index so far this year comparing with an inflation
rate of 3.3 percent for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The July increase in consumer prices was held back by a 0.1
percent dip in energy costs. It was the fifth straight month that
energy prices failed to rise. Food prices climbed 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The so-called core inflation rate -- excluding the volatile
food and energy costs -- also rose 0.2 percent, up slightly from a
0.1 percent gain in June. That translated into a 2.4 percent
annual rate of increase so far this year compared with 2.6 percent
in 1996..
</P>
<P>
Although inflation remains contained, many analysts fear it
could ignite from rapid economic growth and prompt the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) to raise short-term interest rates later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed policy-makers will meet again next week and most
analysts don't expect a rate increase in this month.

It noted that the coupists have breached the ceasefire
agreement, reached last month in Cote d'Ivoire, by their new
offensives not only on ECOMOG positions but also on innocent
citizens in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the ECOMOG troops would continue to
defend themselves and take other necessary actions as directed by
ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed the accusation by the junta of being
attacked by ECOMOG soldiers around Lungi international airport
near the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A defense source of Sierra Leone's military government said
earlier today that some units of the ECOMOG contingent based in
the airport had moved from their positions and tried to use the
cover of darkness to attack government positions around the
airport area Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures have not been released, however the source
said the government soldiers did not suffer any loss in the
fighting launched by ECOMOG with the help of such heavy weapons
as artillery.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local residents fled in all directions during the
long fighting, while a number of houses were destroyed, he said,
adding that ECOMOG should be blamed for most of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
A number of clashes have taken place between the two sides
since the coupists toppled Sierra Leone's elected government led
by ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has announced full-scale economic sanctions against the
junta after it announced it would stay in power for four years.
The sub-regional body has also threatened to use force to flush
out the junta.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Bombing Defendant Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Richard
Matsch today formally sentenced Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
McVeigh to death for the truck bomb attack on the Murrah federal
building that killed 168 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Imposing the death sentence returned by jurors in Denver,
Colorado, on June 13, Matsch said, "It is the judgment of the
court that Timothy McVeigh be sentenced to death on all 11
counts," according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Matsch then told McVeigh that he would be put to death by
injection. McVeigh is the 13th man on the federal death row.
</P>
<P>
Matsch then asked McVeigh, "Do you have any questions?" McVeigh
responded, "Not with this court, your honor."
</P>
<P>
McVeigh's lead attorney Stephen Jones has 10 days from
McVeigh's formal sentencing to file an appeal with the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. He told reporters after the
sentencing that he had filed a notice of appeal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week with a Buffalo, New York, newspaper,
McVeigh said he wants Jones removed from the case, accusing the
attorney of lying to him.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh, 29, was convicted on June 2 of eight counts of
first-degree murder in the deaths of federal officers in the
building when he blew it up, and three bombing charges.
</P>
<P>
His alleged accomplice Terry Nichols, charged identically, is
scheduled to go to trial on September 29. Nichols has asked for a
change of venue, suggesting San Francisco as an alternative to
Denver.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-Fighters Protest Suspension of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's former freedom
fighters will continue to press for their demand for pension
cumulation payments until the government meets its obligations
to them, war veterans leader Chenjerayi Hunzvi said today.
</P>
<P>
Chenjerayi Hunzvi said that arrests, detentions, blackmail and
mudslinging will not abate the situation which has recently seen
hundreds of ex-combatants picketing the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union (PF) and government offices, including the
presidential residence, demanding an immediate disbursement of
disability pensions.
</P>
<P>
''The ex-combatants are very much disgruntled because they are
living a destitute life and you cannot give excuses that they
must be loyal," said Hunzvi, Chairman of the Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans Association.
</P>
<P>
" The best way to solve this is to understand and appreciate
their plight by meeting the demands of the war veterans,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that arrests would only provoke resentment.
</P>
<P>
''It will be very stupid of someone to arrest an ex-combatant
and think it will solve anything. The war veterans have been
quiet for too long so people must think why are they uprising
now,'' Hunzvi said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about hundred ex-combatants protesting the
suspension of pension cumulation payments, ransacked the ruling
ZANU (PF) national headquarters in Harare, cuting telephone lines
and looting foods. They went on their demonstrations today,
demanding to meet President Robert Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Afghan Embassy Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States decided
to suspend operations at the Afghanistan embassy in Washington
because of its factional contention over who would be the
representative of the fighting country, State Department said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The (State) Department has been forced to take this action
because of continuing contention among Afghan factions within
the embassy over who represents Afghanistan and our belief that
there is no effective government in the country," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The "temporary" suspension will come effective on August
21st, but "the suspension does not signify a break in relations
nor any diminution of U.S. government interest in promoting a
peace process in Afghanistan," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
There are two diplomats in the Afghan embassy, both of whom
claimed to represent their country. One is Seraj Jamal,
nominated charge d'affaires by the Taliban, and the other is Yar
Mohammad Mohabbat, who was appointed as charge d'affaires by the
old government.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Taliban asked Mahabbat to give up his post in
favor of Jamal but the U.S. State Department had not accredited
Jamal as his successor, one source disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Rubin hoped the decision made by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to suspend the Afghan embassy's operation would
encourage the factions in Afghanistan to end the fighting and
form a broadly based representative government.
</P>
<P>
While the Afghan embassy in Washington was ordered to stop
working, the Afghan consulate in New York will remain open
"because the consulate provides useful services to the Afghan
American community, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets With Senior US Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen told a senior US diplomat here today that
more co-operation between China and the US in the United Nations
affairs will not only benefit bilateral relations but will also
serve peace, security and development in the Asia-Pacific region
and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The remark came in a meeting with the US's Permanent
Representative to the UN Bill Richardson, where Qian said that, as
two permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US
have major responsibilities for maintaining international peace
and security and play a very important role in the UN.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two have identical or similar interests in
many areas, though there are differences, and that the Chinese
side is ready to increase consultation and co-operation with the
US in the UN in every aspect, especially in UN Security Council
work.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that the two countries have had sound
co-operation in the UN Security Council and in other areas and
that he hopes that the two sides will further their co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, Chinese vice-foreign minister, and William
McCahill, charge d'affaires ad interim of the US Embassy in
Beijing, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Li also held discussions with Richardson today on reforms in
the Security Council and on UN fiscal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li called reforming the Security Council a profound matter and
said that it is imperative that full and careful discussions be
held and that an attempt be made to reach an agreement. This
reform can not be done at a moment's notice, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In reforming the UN Security Council, he said, China agrees to
necessary and suitable reforms and that any expansion of the
council should comply with a principle of equitable geographical
distribution of member states. Developing countries, he said,
account for more than two-thirds of the member states, so any
expansion should reflect their desires and also take their
interests into consideration.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China is still a developing country and
that its per capita GNP is relatively low, but that the country
has tried its best to contribute to the UN.
</P>
<P>
The UN's financial issues, he said, are something China is
concerned and worried about, especially a financial crisis in the
long run. "Timely and complete payment of UN dues is the
obligation of every UN member, according to the UN Charter," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Richardson arrived here earlier today for consultations with
his Chinese counterpart.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government Troops, Rebels Fight Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Fighting renewed today between
government troops and rebel forces in western Tajikistan despite a
peace agreement hammered out this week.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass agency quoted the rebel leader, Colonel Makhmud
Khudoiberdyev, as saying fighting flared because pro-government
troops and heavy artillery did not withdraw from positions outside
Kurgan-Tyube, 110 kilometers south of the Tajik capital of
Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
The rebel brigade's commander accused the government of
President Imomali Rakhmonov of not fulfilling its part of the
peace agreement struck on Wednesday. He warned that the government
would face a "new spiral of the armed stand-off with unpredictable
consequences" if its troops did not withdraw immediately.
</P>
<P>
Khudoiberdyev, a motorized rifle brigade commander, was
dismissed from his post by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov on
Wednesday for leading the brigade mutiny. He is believed to be
the most powerful military leader in the remote central Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted between the brigade and government troops last
weekend just weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with
Islamic opposition guerrillas which ended four years of civil
war.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A 116-year-old Canadian woman has
been recognized as the world's oldest living human being, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Book of World Records announced Thursday that Mrs.
Marie-Louise Meilleur, who was born on August 29, 1880 in Quebec,
Canada, is the oldest person in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Meilleur inherited the title left vacant by the death 11
days ago of 122-year-old French woman Jeanne Calment.
</P>
<P>
Though there are other claimants for the title, she was the
only person in the world able to provide documents such as a birth
certificate, marriage licenses and census records.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Meilleur is now living in a nursing home in Corbeil, near
North Bay, Ontario, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
She has outlived two husbands and eight children. She has 75
grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren and 55 great-great-children.
</P>
<P>
Her descendants said that throughout her life, she was an
energetic woman who smoked until she was in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
She never drank alcohol, didn't eat meat. She once said the
secret to her longerity was manual work and prayers.
</P>
<P>
"She always said that hard work never kills a person. She must
be right," said Rita Meilleur, 72, the youngest of her 10
children.

Mrs. Meilleur does not speak much now, for she is blind and
almost totally deaf.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Exchange to Stop Trading Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Vancouver Stock Exchange
(VSE), the third largest in Canada, will cease trading options on
August 22, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The move represents a continuation of the exchange's return to
its roots in the venture capital securities market, the Financial
Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Options are move appropriate for senior companies and not
appropriate for junior listings," a VSE spokesperson was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
From August 25, all options trading in Canada must be routed
through the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Montreal Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The VSE began trading options in 1983. It is estimated that
between 10 and 15 percent of Canada's options business goes
through the exchange.
</P>
<P>
But the market has failed to become a strong revenue generator
for the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The VSE is also rethinking its commitment to the Vancouver
International Securities Trading Access (VISTA).
</P>
<P>
Launched less than a year ago, the VISTA system allows
after-hours VSE trading in Asia and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Since the pilot project has attracted little investor interest,
the VSE said it will decide whether to continue the operation.
</P>
<P>
The latest developments are "strategic business decisions" on
the part of the new management to return the VSE to its 1907 roots
as a venture capital market, the paper said.

in the Chinese capital of Beijing next week to set a schedule for
long-stalled negotiations aimed at normalizing diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed earlier today to hold talks on August
21 at Japan's embassy in Beijing. These would set a schedule and
agenda for formal normalization talks, which had been stalled for
nearly five years over disputes between both sides, the Korean
Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which controlled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from
1910 to 1945, normalized relations with South Korea in 1965, but
has yet to establish diplomatic ties with the DPRK.

NANJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese students
met today in Nanjing, capital city of east China's Jiangsu
Province, to attend a summer camp on "Witnesses to the Nanjing
Massacre".
</P>
<P>
Students from 14 Tokyo and Osaka middle schools will visit
survivors of the historical event, which took place 60 years ago,
with the help of local middle school students.

of women were raped during the ensuing occupation.
</P>
<P>
"We will describe the situation of the war to our compatriots
when we are back home," said one Japanese student, "we will not
let such a tragedy happen again."
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 of Nanjing's students have been involved in the

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today that regardless of circumstance, the
reunification of the Korean peninsula should be achieved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The time had come when South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) should clearly perceive the true meaning
of peace and work to achieve it, Kim said. His speech marked the
52nd anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's independence after 36
years of Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, above all, means the renunciation of arms," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the four-party talks -- comprising South Korea,
the DPRK, along with China and the United States -- should be a
forum for dialogue based on mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
The four parties held talks in New York last week to arrange
formal negotiations aimed at forging a permanent peace mechanism
on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders from the four parties failed to set an agenda
for the formal peace talks but agreed to try again on September 15
in New York.

both countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Vu
Khoan, came for the fifth round of government-level boundary
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that China and Vietnam have similar national
situations and face the same task of promoting economic
development and the standard of living, and both need a long-term
stable and peaceful international environment.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the fifth round of boundry negotiation at government
level is held under the circumstances of the important consensus
reached by leaders of the two countries not long ago on speeding
up the process of negotiations, making the negotiation an
important issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he is convinced that, with these joint efforts,
issues remaining from the past can be settled as soon as possible,
to promote good neighborly relations for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Vu Khoan and his party arrived here Tuesday as guests of
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, attending the fifth

<HEADLINE> Thai Draft Charter Passes Third Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-two out of the 99 members
of the Constitution Drafting assembly of Thailand voted today in
favor of the new charter draft, according to local TV reports.
</P>
<P>
The draft will then be submitted for studies by
parliamentarians, who are due to vote on it next month.
</P>
<P>
The 99-member drafting assembly was elected last December and
was given 240 days to draft a new charter.
</P>
<P>
Many people pin much hopes on it, seeing it as a way to reform
and improve Thailand's politics, while others believe that the new
charter, which has as many as 336 articles, some highly
controversial, will not be a panacea to cure all political
ailments of the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the controversial articles is ban on MPs concurrently
holding Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
A number of MPs may not like this clause, but the drafting
assembly argues that a power separation is needed to keep better
check on the state.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Constitution, the overwhelming majority of
the Cabinet are MPs, with only a few rare exceptions.

<HEADLINE> Australia Vows to Be Regional Financial Center: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia would become the
second financial center in the Asia-Pacific region, Australian
Prime Minister John Howard said tonight in a speech signaling a
more interventionist industry policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to making Australia the second financial
center of the region after Tokyo for the 21st century," the prime
minister told an industry conference dinner in the coastal city of
Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Hong Kong are currently the main financial
centers after Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
This would partly be based on Australia's advantage in the
information sector where growth information technologies were
flourishing, according to the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"Australia ranks second only to the United States in computer
ownership and our spending on information technology as a
proportion to gross domestic product is 2.8 percent compared to
1.9 percent in Japan and 3.1 percent in the United States," Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that his government would soon announce new
incentives for the technology and telecommunication industries to
help bridge the information gap between cities and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Australia's industry policy must be forward looking
in an era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is on facilitating adjustment from declining to
emerging activities, encouraging international best practice and
gaining access to lucrative markets, particularly in the
Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high unemployment rate of 8.7 percent and slow economic
growth have been widely considered major problems for the prime
minister to win the next election as his government has less than
two years to make preparations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government is considering wide-ranging
industry policy adjustments.

KUNMING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The '97 Kunming Export Trade
Fair ended today in China's Yunnan Province with 1.57 billion US
dollars worth in business volume.
</P>
<P>
The business volume represents an increase of 24.5 percent over
that of the previous fair which was attended by more than 8,700
business people from 56 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Export trade was worth 417 million US dollars, with industrial
products accounting for 70 percent. Exports of agricultural
products, which accounted for the majority of business in the
past, made up only 15.4 percent this time.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that southwestern parts of China have made major
progress in industrial production, an official related to the fair
said.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation with Southeast Asian countries has grown and
exports to Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia have grown to
79.3 million US dollars and business volume for border trade
reached 75.5 million US dollars, he said.

<HEADLINE> Technician Arrested After Cairo's Shop Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The maintenance technician at a
Cairo shopping mall was arrested today in connection with the
deadly fire in the mall on Thursday midnight, the Egyptian MENA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not given, will be remanded in custody
for four days pending investigation under an order issued at noon
today by the East Cairo District Attorney Counselor Hisham Hmouda,
according to the MENA report.
</P>
<P>
Three were killed and more than 280 injured in the fire that
raged through the crowded shopping center for two hours on the eve
of the Muslim prayer holiday. Criminal lab experts started
investigations into the reasons behind the fire.
</P>
<P>
Several technicians at the mall attributed the fire to a short
circuit, saying electric cables were overloaded. Shop owners at
the mall were notified more than once about the dangerous
situation there, they added.
</P>
<P>
The fire gutted the fifth and sixth stories of the mall besides
 its movie house. Several shops at the third and fourth floors
were also severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
The first of fire engines arrived 30 minutes after the fire
broke out because of the difficulty to drive through the
overcrowded streets all around the mall.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out, the seven-story Al-Horreya Mall in the
Cairo suburb of Helioplis was full of late-night shoppers and
merry-makers who came to enjoy a cool summer time.
</P>
<P>
The report said 252 injured, most of them suffering from
suffocation due to inhaling smoke caused by the fire, remain in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations showed that the building lacks all
emergency preparations including emergency stairs and has no
emergency ventilation systems or exits.
</P>
<P>
Those who happened to be at the building during the fire had
to smash the building's windows to allow fresh air in, especially
after its central air conditioning stopped functioning. Panicked,
some jumped out of the windows for life.
</P>
<P>
Reports on the cause and the site of the fire are varied and
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
Some say the fire started in either the second or fourth floor
while some survivors said that it erupted in the sixth
floor. Other survivors said that the fire ensued from a short
circuit at an elevator under repair at the mall.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses heard a deafening sound of a crack before the
outbreak of the fire and agreed that the power failure left the
entire building in darkness.
</P>
<P>
At hand at the scene to supervise fire-fighting operations were
Minister of Health and Population Ismail Sallam and governor of
Cairo Abdel Rehim Shehata.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges 200 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah plummeted
again today, the second day following the government's decision to
float the currency.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah tumbled to a record low of 2,840 to the U.S. dollar
this afternoon, reducing 200 points from Wednesday, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Minister for National Development Planning
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said here today that the government
decision has long been considered, especially after neighboring
countries did the same.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia (the central bank) Governor Soedradjad
Djiwandono announced Thursday that as of that day, the Monetary
Authorities have decided to float the exchange value of the rupiah
by abandoning a set trading band.
</P>
<P>
On the rupiah fluctuations, Ginandjar said they pose no problem
because the country's economic foundation is strong with foreign
exchange reserves reaching 21 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To defend the rupiah fluctuation which began in the middle of
July, the central bank had widened the spread of rupiah exchange
band from 8 percent to 12 percent. The government had also sold
1.5 billion U.S. dollars as well as raised overnight interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
But the measures had no obvious effects as "the regional
factor" was the main factor affecting the value of the rupiah,
official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Co-operating With the New Hong Kong Government: Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- There is no relationship of
subordination between the Office of the Commissioner of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), a Chinese
diplomat says.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Yuzhen, the first commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong, the two will work for the common
goal of maintaining state sovereignty and promoting the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ma's comments come in Beijing's "Outlook" magazine for Monday
where he says they co-operate and have a division of labor in a
relationship of "mutual support, mutual respect, mutual trust, and
close cooperation."
</P>
<P>
To do a good job in diplomatic and foreign affairs for Hong
Kong, the commissioner's office will have more contacts and will
consult the HKSAR government and not intervene in the autonomy of
the HKSAR, he said, noting that his office will adopt a pioneering
and cautious attitude and solve new problems with a new way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
The function of the Chinese Foreign Ministry commissioner's
office in Hong Kong, Ma said, is different from that of Chinese
embassies in other countries in that it is a functional organ of
the Central Government in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"We work on the territory of our own country and are concerned
only with diplomatic matters concerning Hong Kong. We have no
diplomatic privileges or immunity," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he made the acquaintance of Tung Chee-Hwa, the chief
executive of the HKSAR, while serving as ambassador to Britain and
built a good relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month or more, Ma said, he has developed close
co-operation with Tung Chee-Hwa, and other members of the office

<HEADLINE> China Continuing Narcotics Control Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- According to a decision made
during a committee meeting today on anti-drug work, China's
National Narcotics Control Committee will extend its nationwide
anti-drug operation to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
From April, when China started the operation, to June, public
security departments across the country established 187 new drug
rehabilitation centers, sent 30,000 people to the centers, and
worked on 39,105 drug cases.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments arrested 55,211 people in drug
cases, seized 1,623 kg of heroin, 400 kg of the drug "ice", and
more than 100 tons of chemicals used for making drugs. During that
period, 499 drug networks and 1,196 places for dealing in drugs
were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Guangdong province, 1,846 drug sales were
discovered and 3,801 people involved were arrested. Authorities
there discovered 33,648 drug addicts and sent 28,287 of them to
rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has helped reduce the number of drug-related
cases. In the first half of the year, robberies and thefts were
down 27.9 percent and 22.8 percent respectively from the same 1995
period.

<HEADLINE> Georgia, Abkhazia Determine to End Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Georgia and Abkhazia agreed today
to put an end to their conflict through peaceful means, an
Itar-Tass news agency report said from the Georgian capital of
Tibilisi.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba,
leader of the Abkhazia republic in Georgia, signed a statement in
Tibilisi and pledged not to let bloodshed happen again.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at the presence of Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Shevardnadze and Ardzinba on Thursday
held several hours of talks and discussed means to settle the
Abkhazia conflict.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two sides should exercise tolerance
towards each other and take the stand of reconciliation and
compromise.
</P>
<P>
They pledged not to resort to force to settle the existing
conflict and, under no circumstances, should they let bloodshed
happen again.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to maintain regular contacts in order to
resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Ardzinba and Primakov arrived in Tibilisi together on
Thursday. Russia had been making efforts to mediate between
Georgia and its breakaway Republic of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on August 1 that he
planned to invite the leaders of Georgia and Abkhazia to go to
Moscow for talks, in order to sign an accord with them to ensure
peace and territorial integrity in this region.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Abkhazia declared independence from Georgia in
July 1992, and the Georgian government sent troops into this
autonomous republic in the following month, which led to armed
conflicts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the United Nations and Russia, the two
sides signed a ceasefire accord in May 1994, and a Russian
peace-keeping force entered and stationed itself in the conflict
area in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the final status of the Republic of Abkhazia remains
unsettled.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Official on Legislative Council Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said today
that a government-drafted bill on the overall arrangements for the
first SAR Legislative Council elections due to take place in late
May next year would be tabled before the Provisional Legislative
Council next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the document entitled the Legislative Council Bill
at a news conference this afternoon, Secretary for Electoral
Affairs Michael Suen Ming-yeung stressed that a major voter
registration will be mounting between December and January and the
Election Committee must be established in early April.
</P>
<P>
"Having carefully considered the views of the community, we
have completed drafting of the relevant electoral legislation,"
Suen said. "It will be introduced into the Provisional Legislative
Council on August 20 for the first and second readings."
</P>
<P>
The bill will provide a legal basis for the overall
arrangements for the Legislative Council election, and for matters
such as the delineation of the electorate of the functional
constituencies and the Election Committee, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"The clear and consistent objective of the SAR government is to
ensure that elections take place on an open, fair and honest
basis, so that all candidates could compete in a level playing
field," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
SAR shall be composed of 60 members, with 30 to be returned by 30
functional constituencies, 10 by the Election Committee and 20 by
five geographical constituencies through direct elections
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The division of geographical constituencies and the voting
method for direct elections therein, the delimitation of
functional sectors and corporate bodies, their seat allocation and
election methods, and the method for electing members of the
Legislative Council shall be specified by an electoral law
introduced by the SAR government and passed by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the delineation of the functional constituency
electorate, Suen said: "We have adopted the traditional concept
and standards. This approach is to ensure that various functional
constituencies are representative and of importance, so that the
future legislative body could reflect different views of the
community."
</P>
<P>
As to the formation of the Election Committee, he said that the
great majority of the 800 members making up the electoral body
will be chosen through election from within the relevant
sub-sectors. The Electoral Affairs Commission, which will soon be
established, will supervise the electoral process to ensure
openness and fairness, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to complete a number of key steps as
soon as possible, adding: "This means that the progress of each
key step would have a direct impact on that of the other."
</P>
<P>
"For example, the Electoral Affairs Commission cannot take
formal steps to draw up recommendations on geographical boundaries
 until the number of geographical constituencies is determined,"
he said. "There is no certainty on the latter, however, until the
 Legislative Council Bill is passed."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Stage Largest Timepiece Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 760 timepiece
companies from 17 countries and regions will be in Hong Kong next
month for the 16th Hong Kong Watch &AMP; Clock Fair, making it the
world's largest timepiece trade fair in terms of number of
exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here today, Co-chairman of the
Fair Organizing Committee Stanley Lau said that Hong Kong's watch
and clock industry has conducted business as usual after Hong
Kong's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Hong Kong remains a leading trader of watches, clocks
and timepiece components. Last year, Hong Kong exported 47.9
billion HK dollar (6.18 billion U.S. dollar) worth timepieces, up
two percent over 1995."
</P>
<P>
"Our fastest-growing markets are in the increasingly affluent
regions of Asia and Latin America," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the five months of 1997, Hong Kong's timepiece exports rose
49 percent to the Philippines, 29 percent to Paraguay and 25
percent to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
According to Lau, the 16th annual edition of the fair will
feature more than 760 exhibitors, up from 713 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The five-day fair will feature group pavilions from France,
Germany, Italy, South Korea and China, and individual exhibitors
from Denmark, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain,
Switzerland, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Hong Kong Watch &AMP; Clock Fair attracted 16,000
buyers from 89 countries and regions, generating orders worth 2.4
billion HK dollars (309.67 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Casualties Rise in Cairo Shop Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of those injured rose
to more than 280 in the fire that ravaged a crowded shopping mall
Thursday night, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The death toll remains at three, two of the dead have been
identified, according to an Interior Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The injured, most of them suffering from suffocation due to
inhaling smoke caused by the fire, were rushed for treatment. Up
to 252 of the injured are still in hospital.
</P>
<P>
When the fire broke out, the seven-story Al-Horreya Mall in the
plush Cairo suburb of Helioplis was still full of late-night
shoppers and merry-makers who came to enjoy a cool summer time.
</P>
<P>
The blaze was contained in two hours, but red smoke billowing
from the building had already lit up the dark sky above.
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed 25 boutiques and two cinemas which were
still operating at that hour.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations into the cause of the fire show that
the building lacks all emergency preparations including emergency
stairs and has no emergency ventilation systems or exits.
</P>
<P>
Those who happened to be at the building during the fire had
to smash the building's windows to allow fresh air in, especially
after its central air conditioning stopped functioning. Panicked,
some jumped out of the window for life.
</P>
<P>
The first of fire engines arrived 30 minutes after the start of
the fire because of the difficulty to drive through the
overcrowded streets all around the mall.
</P>
<P>
Reports are still contradictory about the cause of the fire and
the place where it started.
</P>
<P>
Some say the fire started in either the second or fourth floor
while some survivors said that it erupted in the sixth
floor. Other survivors said that the fire ensued from a short
circuit at an elevator under repair at the mall.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses heard a deafening sound of a crack before the
outbreak of the fire and agreed that the power failure left the
entire building in darkness.
</P>
<P>
At hand at the scene to supervise firefighting operations were
Health Minister Ismail Sallam and governor of Cairo Abdel Rehim
Shehata.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Broke out in Southwest Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting reportedly
broke out Thursday in Somalia's southwestern region of Bakol
between the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the
Rehanwein Resistance Army (RRA).
</P>
<P>
At least 30 people were killed and about a dozen others were
wounded during fierce clashes at Dhiil village, 32 km north of
Huddor town.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, nine battle wagons belonging to
Hussein Aidid's faction and a hundred infantry militiamen were
involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
VHF radio reports received in Huddor town said the battle
wagons left the town to Dhiil village following an armed
insurgency by the RRA men in the area.
</P>
<P>
Reports added that Hussein Aidid's army contingent were
ambushed just outside the village as the infantry militiamen left
their battle wagons to search for the RRA guerrilla fighters in
the mountain lands north of the village.
</P>
<P>
Five of Hussein Aidid's battle wagons were destroyed by the
RRA infantry men using rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades
and assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed quoted a
RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden (Qalinle) as saying all of the 30
war victims who died on the spot were Hussein Aidid's men.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle, who is among the RRA political leaders based in north
Mogadishu told Xinhua that two of his fighters were killed and
five others wounded.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that his forces have confiscated six BKM guns,
seven RPGs and 15 assault rifles from Hussein Aidid's men during
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's men have perpetrated the attack and raided
their RRA militia base in Dhiil village, Qalinle added.
</P>
<P>
South Mogadishu Radio of Hussein Aidid did not mention the
fighting and none of his top lieutenants were available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
The clash is characterized as the most catastrophic since the
RRA militiamen started their hit-and-run guerrilla fighting
against Hussein Aidi's men in Bakol region three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there has been no independent source to confirm
the situation in Dhiil village today and the damage caused by the
fighting.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A man who suspected of sending
a letter bomb to Sweden's justice minister was arrested thursday
by Security police, according to local reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The man, 23, was identified as a leader of the Aryan

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Keen on Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province, southwest
China, expects to reap yet another good grain harvest this year
following the record 1996 grain output of slightly over 47 million
tons, or nearly a tenth of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Bumper harvests have enabled the province to contribute greatly
to the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has placed top priority on agricultural development
since 1992. Related efforts have enabled the rural economy to
reach a new high, with last year's per capita income for farmers
reaching 1,453 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan also paid special attention to applying science and
technology in agriculture. The province has led China in seed
breeding research for the past five years, with scientific and
technological contributions reaching 50 percent in cultivated
areas.
</P>
<P>
The province sends more than 20,000 agriculturists to rural
areas annually to promote the application of new technology.
</P>
<P>
The province's livestock industry has led the nation for 20
consecutive years in output and sales volume for pigs.
</P>
<P>
Over five million Sichuan natives working as migrant laborers,
the largest number from any province, return earnings of 20
billion yuan to their home province annually. The over 300,000
former migrant workers who have returned to open businesses have
emerged as a major force boosting local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan's township enterprises, which employ over 10 million
redundant rural workers, are in transition from cottage industry
to highly efficient technology-intensive enterprise groups.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Food Shipments Allowed into Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel has agreed to allow
shipments of Egyptian food, medicine and powder milk to cross to
the Palestinian self-rule areas, the Middle East News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Palestinian Liaison Committee was quoted as
saying that shipments of Egyptian rice and flour have already been
given access to the Palestinian areas through Rafah checkpoint on
the Egyptian-Israeli border, which was closed early this month.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Palestinians working in the Gulf countries were
also allowed to travel to the Egyptian Al Arish Airport from Gaza
Strip today together with their families to fly back to their work
after a summer break at home.
</P>
<P>
These measures came as results of international efforts to ease
the siege, among other Israeli security measures, imposed on the
Palestinians since two suicide bombs killed 14 Israeli civilians
in Jerusalem on July 30.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority warned that conditions could
explode at any minute as its reserves of food and medicines are
almost exhausted. Palestinian losses due to the closure were
estimated at several million U.S. dollars daily.
</P>
<P>
Israel has ordered the closure of the crossing points along its
border with Egypt since the bombing attacks, leading to a halt in
the traffic of Egyptian commodities on the trade route into Israel
and the Palestinian autonomy areas. Only foreign tourists were
allowed to pass.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, left out in the cold for the third week in front
of the Rafah checkpoint awaiting to get into the Gaza Strip, have
been complaining that they are running short of money.
</P>
<P>
Israel Thursday lifted a travel ban that had barred
Palestinians from traveling out of two major cities in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the easing of travel restrictions on the cities of Ramallah
and Hebron did not affect the closure which prevents tens of
thousands of Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a four-day misson by U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross, who had urged Israel to eliminate any measures which
prevent tens of thousands of Palestinians from entering Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Approves Integrated Anti-Drug Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today approved in principle an integrated strategy to combat the
serious drug problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strategy calls for the full cooperation and proper
coordination among the five pillars of the country's criminal
justice system, namely, law enforcement, courts, prosecution,
correctional institutions and the community.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said earlier that a sixth pillar, international
cooperation, is also needed for the success of the all-out war
against drug lords and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
According to the strategy, the government and the citizenry
will cooperate in conducting information drives against dangerous
drugs in schools, communities, labor circles and villages down to
the street level.
</P>
<P>
They would also take all legal and unrelenting actions to
prevent the communities against dangerous drugs through
cooperative efforts, conduct investigation, arrest and prosecution
to control the sources of illegal drugs and apply the full force
of the law against drug lords, drug traffickers, drug pushers and
scalawags in the police.
</P>
<P>
The government and the citizenry would also conduct research
and studies to support legislative proposals and other measures to
amend outdated laws dealing with dangerous drugs and establish
more rehabilitation and treatment centers for victims of dangerous
drugs.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos ordered the immediate release of 50
million pesos (1.7 million U.S. dollars) as initial funding for
the success of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Philippines had at least 1.7 million
drug addicts and that illegal drug sales reached 9.5 billion U.S.
dollars a year in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Severs Relations with Chad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China has severed diplomatic
relations with Chad, a north African country which on Tuesday
announced that it would resume "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang announced
that the government of the People's Republic of China decided to
sever diplomatic relations with Chad on August 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, "The implementation of all the agreements
between the two governments will cease immediately."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Chad must bear full responsibility for
all consequences arising from its erroneous decision," said Shen.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chad and Taiwan authorities jointly announced
the restoration of so-called "diplomatic relations" on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, "The decision of the government of Chad
violates the principles set forth in the communique announcing the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Chad
on November 28, 1972.
</P>
<P>
"The decision also violates Chad's commitment that 'the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government representing all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The erroneous decision of the government of Chad has seriously
damaged China's sovereignty, has sabotaged friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries, and runs counter to the
fundamental interests and wishes of the two peoples."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government has provided selfless
assistance to Chad for many years and has made positive
contributions to Chad's economic construction and social
development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the people of the two countries enjoy a
traditional friendship, and that the Chinese government does not
wish to see a reversal in Sino-Chad relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Chad Gao Ruming issued a stern
representation to the government of Chad today in Chad's capital
of N'Djamena concerning Chad's resumption of "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Gao also conveyed the Chinese government's strong protest on
the issue to the government of Chad.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the
Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong
said here today that the office has been working to help settle
the fishing boat issue, in which 23 Chinese fishermen, including
three Hong Kong residents, were detained by the Philippines late
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong boat was caught by the Philippine military on
July 31, 1997, when it scurried for safety near Half Moon Shoal
against typhoon Victor on its way to the Indonesian waters,
according to the Commissioner's Office. The boat was later handed
to concerned departments in Palawan, the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hongbo, the spokesman, said today that the Chinese embassy
has negotiated with the Philippines on the matter and urged Manila
to release the boat and the crew with the least delay. The embassy
has sent consul officials to visit the detained fishermen and
provided them with consul services and protection.
</P>
<P>
There were 23 fishermen on the boat, including three residents
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). The other 20
were from Taishan in South China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that since the fishing boat was seized by the
Philippines, the Commissioner's Office has kept close contact with
the Chinese embassy in Manila and informed the SAR government of
the latest progress, so as to help solve the problem as soon as
possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy maintained
sustained growth in the first half of 1997 thanks to strong
domestic demand and close ties with the Chinese inland areas,
today's Ta Kung Pao quoted Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of the Chinese
General Chamber of Commerce, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's foreign trade kept steady growth in the first six
months, with total exports up 3.2 percent and total imports up 4.6
percent in value compared with the same period of 1996, said the
business leader.
</P>
<P>
Transactions were brisk on stock and property market in the
first half of this year, and retail business continued to pick up,
according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
With a total market capitalization of 548 billion US dollars,
Hong Kong emerged as the sixth largest stock exchange in the
globe. Its benchmark index, the Hang Seng Index, hit historic
highs time and again during the January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Tsang contributed the sustained economic growth in Hong Kong to
a fundamental element -- China impact. The Chinese inland areas
has become Hong Kong's largest export market, taking in 35 percent
of the city's total export.
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive labor and low rents in China's inland areas helped
Hong Kong manufacturers reduce production costs and enhance
competitiveness of their products, said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the GDP growth in Hong Kong would reach 5.4
percent in the year of 1997, up from the growth rate of 4.7
percent in 1996.

JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Experts representing
governments, employer and labor organization in southern Africa
are meeting in Swaziland today to work out a draft code on the
safe use of chemicals in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will formulate a common principle on the
safe handling and use of chemicals in member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), reports reaching
here from Mbabane said.
</P>
<P>
Philomene Makolo, an official of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), told the delegates that more than
80,000 chemicals are now in use worldwide.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there is little information and knowledge on
proper handling of chemicals in all SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
The SADC was formed five years ago to coordinate efforts for a
common market. The regional grouping is made up of 12 countries,

<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Investors confidence that the
volatile United States market was settling down, was "the most
important" influence on the local sharemarket closing strongly
today.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very strong day and it was almost entirely due to
overseas," senior broker Bill Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
"The most important of all, the influences on Australian stocks
today was "the fact that the American market appears to be
settling down," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 38.8 points higher at 2,666.2,
with blue chip stocks leading the charge as well as better than
expected profit results this week from some major companies.
</P>

The all resources index was 23.3 points higher at 1,409.2 and
the all industrials index was 59.1 points higher at 4,280.1.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Marginally Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
marginally lower today with its virtually flat closing levels
concealing a volatile day of trading.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 74.33 US cents down from 74.41 late Thursday. It
fell as low as 73.85 US cents in the morning and then rallied to a
high of 74.50 during the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of lower interest rates had undermined the local currency
later in the week while a sharp fall in the price of gold also
weakened the currency in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Bankers trust, believed to be a major buyer of Australian
dollars all week, helped push the Australian dollar up towards its
highs in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The revised wages data released Thursday had increased
speculation that the central bank would lower the official
interest rate from its present level of 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
A good barometer of where the market expects interest rates to
be in the coming months is the bill futures contract.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Reserve Bank's quarterly report on the economy
to be released Tuesday will be closely read for clues on the
direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 87.95 from 86.50 against the
Japanese yen and was at 1.3707 from 1.3700 against the German
mark.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Compulsory Conscription Becomes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- S. Africa has announced
that its newly established National Defense Force will not
recruit forcibly the military personnel who served in the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie
Kasrils as saying that apartheid-era soldiers can, however,
volunteer for service. If they do, they will be obliged to make
themselves available for call-ups.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils said that volunteers would be contractually obliged to
make themselves available for call-ups, possibly for up to 16
years. About 500,000 men at the ages of from 22 to 55 are
affected.
</P>
<P>
However, as the commander-in-chief of the defense force, the
president of S. Africa will have the authority to reintroduce
conscription.
</P>
<P>
S. Africa's current conscription was originally introduced in
1953 as a selective ballot system, and became compulsory in 1968.
It was originally for nine months but later became two years and
then reduced to one year.
</P>
<P>
The conscription was officially suspended in 1994, which saw
the first non-racial general elections in S. Africa, but the
status of the apartheid era conscripts has not been clarified
until now.
</P>
<P>
The conscription remained in S. Africa's statute books because
the relevant defense act was never repealed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses 5 Bn Drs From Resources Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will suffer an annual
loss of some 5.1 billion U.S. Dollars if its environmental
problems are left unsolved, accounting for 4.3 percent of its
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
According to Director-General of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (FEPA) Adegoke Adegoroye, the figure comes from
a World Bank assessment of the Nigerian past and present inaction
to check the nation's degradation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference on sustainable development in
the capital Abuja, he said the environmental problems confronting
the country were deforestation, erosion and urban decay.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the federal government should always be protective
on the nation's natural resources, said Adegoroye who has just
concluded an assessment tour of several coastal states.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to enforce some of the related decrees
to protect forest resources and endangered species of animals.
</P>
<P>
"Reckless logging in the forest has opened the soil to
devastation of erosion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that FEPA would work with the federal department
of forestry on a new strategy for sustainable management of the
nation's forest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Adegoroye said that sustainable development did not
mean that Nigeria must immediately shut down all polluting
industries.
</P>
<P>
To do so was to dislocate the economy, throw people out of
jobs and dislocate families as well as aggravate poverty and
social tension, he added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a research agenda for the country must
integrate environmental consideration at all stages of its
development for Nigeria to attain its ultimate goal of
sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> China Controls Hepatitis B (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved remarkable
progress in controlling Hepatitis B (HB), with more than 85
percent of infants and preschool children in urban areas having
received vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
Officials note that breakthroughs have also been recorded in
the nation's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a recent International Symposium on Liver
Diseases pointed out that the rate of HB surface antigen (HBsAg)
seropositivity in China can be reduced to around one percent if
the HB virus (HBV) can be prevented over two generations.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that incidence rates for HB and liver cancer
caused by the virus can be reduced to very low levels.
</P>
<P>
HB is a viral infectious disease which has spread throughout
the world and is especially prevalent in China. A recent survey
showed a 58 percent HB virus infection rate in China. The
country's rate of HBsAg seropositivity is 9.75 percent, and nearly
30 million Chinese suffer from chronic HB.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that close to 80 percent of the liver cancer in
China is related with the HB.
</P>
<P>
China introduced vaccines for universal infant HB immunization
programs in Beijing and Shanghai almost a decade ago, with recent
examinations of vaccinated children showing that the rate of HBsAg
seropositivity has dropped to below one percent, down five
percentage points on levels prior to the programs.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that the majority of children in the two cities
are protected," according to Wang Bao'en, China's authority on
liver diseases.

<P>
Centers to manufacture HB vaccine were set up in 1984, and DNA
vaccines have since been widely used in the country's immunization
program.
</P>
<P>
China continues to give priority to infant immunization, with
programs covering children below the age of six and people working
in hospitals, schools and public places.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has carried out a full-scale program in
the nation's vast rural areas, while at the same time trying
to raise the vaccination rate in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"China has manufactured amply supplies of HB vaccine to meet
needs of the immunization program," according to Prof. Wang with
the Beijing Friendship Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that achievements have been scored in developing
anti-HBV drugs, but therapeutic effects remain less than
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is still the main method for dealing with the
disease," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Experts have found that various types of traditional Chinese
medicinal herbs can effectively prevent liver fibrosis formation
and can even reverse early stages of cirrhotic change.
</P>
<P>
In addition, considerable progress has been achieved in the
research using such herbs to treat the HB virus.
</P>
<P>
Reports as early as the 1960s indicated that some herbs helped
to remove some symptoms characteristic of hepatitis
sufferers. Over the past three decades, China has carried out
clinical experiments to study the therapeutic effect herbs
offer in the treatment of liver diseases, and to develop effective
anti-HBV drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The nation of Bangladesh today
paid homage to its independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, who was assassinated 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina placed wreaths at the portrait of the slain leader
at the Bangabandhu memorial museum in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
All members of Bangabandhu's family, except his two daughters,
the present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, fell
victims of the pre-dawn coup led by some army officers that
drastically changed the political landscape of the country.
</P>
<P>
The August 15 putsch pushed Bangabandhu's Awami (people's)
League out of the political arena for some time, but the party,
led by Sheikh Hasina, returned to power through the national
election last year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Awami League was back to power, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina's government declared August 15 as National

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Keeps Away from Controversial Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto did not visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine today,
the 52nd anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The shrine, which houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals including Japan's wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo and
other Japanese military personnel, is a symbol of militarism in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit to the shrine last year attracted severe
criticism from Japan's neighboring countries, which forced him to
announce that he would not visit the shrine any more while in
office.
</P>
<P>
Following Hashimoto, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama,
Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka said that they would also not visit the shrine on August
15.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine are controversial
because Japan's postwar Constitution stipulates separation of
religion and the state.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, eight Japanese ministers including Health and
Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi and International Trade and
Industry Minister Shinji Sato, Transport Minister Makoto Koga and
Labor Minister Yutaka Okano visited the shrine today.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Parties Mark End of World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Japan issued
statements today to mark the 52nd anniversary of Japan's defeat in
World War II, Kyodo news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said Japan must
repent the past and strive continuously to strengthen friendly,
forward-looking ties with Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party (SDP) said Japan must deeply repent
the fact that its war of aggression and colonial rule led to the
suffering to people in neighboring Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to set a 'table of peace' in Asia where each country
can participate in the establishment of peace and trust," said a
statement by the SDP, a non-cabinet ally of the LDP.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about an ongoing review of the Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines, the opposition Japanese Communist Party
alleged that "the review will lead to a system whereby Japan
automatically participates in war if and when the United States
makes military intervention on the grounds of an emergency near
Japan."
</P>
<P>
"We must never allow a dangerous plan that will lead Japan once
more to a war of aggression," it said.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition party, the New Frontier Party, said it
is determined to "establish new relations of trust with Asian and
other countries by repenting the past and making active
contributions to the international community."
</P>
<P>
New Party Sakigake said it wants to reflect deeply on how Japan
inflicted pain on its neighboring countries during World War II,
which was ended on August 15, 1945.

probation officers had been banned from giving address of
paedophiles and sex attackers to the police.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Failures in the Ministry of Defense equipment program were

PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- India began Thursday the celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of its independence after two centuries of British
rule. The official activities contrasted with the indifference of
the majority of over 900 million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
-- The arrest earlier this week in Bogota of the Latin American
heroine king, Peru's Waldo Simeon, immediately helped warm up
relations between the United States and Colombia. Washington had
accused Colombian President Ernesto Samper of having connections
with narco producers because of the ill-managed combat against
drug since his election two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Although the French government has fixed the increase rate
of state spending under 1.6 percent in 1998, it is always having
difficulty in making its budget to meet the 3 percent criteria set
by the Maastricht treaty for joining the euro. Meanwhile, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy and the state electricity company
EDF Thursday denied a report that government plans to draw 30
billion francs (5 billion U.S. dollars) from the expenditure of
the company to help balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
-- After two incidents in vacation resorts in which a girl was
raped by nine boys from a working class outskirt and a young man
was killed in a brawl with a Paris music band, Minister of
Employment Martine Aubry accused some people of "stigmatizing the
city outskirts" where these young people came from. She compared
the present situation with that of 1936 when "the bourgeois class
on the beach was afraid when seeing the arrival of the workers on
paid holidays, because it did not like sitting side by side with
the latter."

<HEADLINE> 11 Still Missing in Philippine Ship Capsize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were still not
accounted for hours after a passenger ship carrying them sank in
the small hours this morning in the central Philippines, the
Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the rescued has risen from 38 to 66, including 34
crew members and 32 passengers, Assistant Public Information
Officer for PCG Jaime Daquilanea told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Daquilanea said the death toll from the incident remained 10 as
so far only 10 bodies have been recovered. But he said the number
of the fatalities is feared to rise because of big waves and
strong winds on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Being battered by big waves and strong winds, the passenger
ship capsized and sank at 2 a.m. near Maripipi Island, Biliran
province, on its way from Cebu city to Tacloban city.
</P>
<P>
The coast guard has so far failed to determine the exact number
of passengers on the ship. According to Daquilanea, a list
provided by the ship captain showed there were 52 passengers but a
report from the owner of the ship said 88 passengers were on
board.
</P>
<P>
Two naval seacraft, two air force helicopters and some civilian
volunteers are now searching survivors at the capsize site,
Daquilanea said.

BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasan today urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to play a more active role in regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Asking the ASEAN to review its policy on Cambodia, Prachuab
said the regional grouping should not stand idle while the
prospective member country is torn apart by domestic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The seeds of domestic instability sown in Cambodia would
disrupt the stability of the region, he noted, adding that the
ASEAN should reconsider its non-intervention policy on Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was due to be admitted into the ASEAN last month along
with Myanmar and Laos, but its entry was indefinitely postponed
after armed crashes broke out in the Cambodian capital of Phnom
Penh on July 5.
</P>
<P>
The Thai minister hoped that ASEAN would come up with creative
guidelines to solve the Cambodian crisis, from which refugees are
fleeing into neighboring Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Leaders Remorse for Victims of World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese leaders expressed "deep
remorse" for Japan's role in World War II at a ceremony held here
today to mark the 52nd anniversary of Japan's surrender.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reiterated
"deep remorse" for Japan's wartime acts and expressed condolences
to war victims, particularly those in neighboring Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"The last war caused tremendous pain and sorrow not only to our
country but also to people in many countries, particularly those
in neighboring Asian nations," Hashimoto told the annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
"I am sincerely mindful of this fact and would like to offer
heartfelt condolences to them with deep remorse," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to make an all-out effort to realize a
permanent world peace.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito offered condolences to the war dead and prayed
for world peace at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back at history, I pray from the heart that the
ravages of war will never be repeated," the emperor said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony at Nippon Budokan here was also attended by House
of Representative speaker Soichiro Ito, House of Councillors
President Juro Saito as well as other government officials and
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto today did not visit the controversial Yasukuni
Shrine, a symbol of militarism in the country.

<HEADLINE> Panzhihua Heavy Industrial Base Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua City in southwest
China's Sichuan Province expects its gross domestic product (GDP)
to reach 13 billion yuan by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The city is working hard to form an important part of the
economic belt along the Yangtze River based on the strength of its
basic industries, according to Panzhihua Mayor Qin Wanxiang.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua, famous for Panzhihua Iron and Steel Co. and Ertan
Hydropower Station, is home to 20 percent of China's iron
reserves, 64 percent of vanadium reserves and 93 percent of
titanium reserves. Vanadium and titanium are rare minerals used by
the iron, coal, military and aerospace industries.
</P>
<P>
The central government listed the construction of Panzhihua as
a major strategic policy in the early and mid-1960s. At that time,
there were only seven households at the place. The goal was to
adjust China's industrial layout and promote economic advancement
by exploring rich mineral resources in the locality.
</P>
<P>
The city, founded 32 years ago, has sold more than 50 million
tons of iron, steel, electromechanical and building materials,
with last year's steel output hitting 2.8 million tons and iron
3.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Second-stage construction of Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company,
which commenced in 1986 and is scheduled for completion by the end
of this year, involves the installation of furnaces, and
continuous casting and sheeting equipment. Completion of the
project will raise the company's annual production capacity for
iron, steel and sheeting materials by one million tons each.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 240 meter Ertan Hydropower Station dam is
scheduled for completion in the near future. The station, located
in the lower reaches of the Yalong River, will have a combined
generating capacity of 3.3 million kw and will generate 17 billion
kw/hours of electricity annually. The project is being constructed
at a cost of 33 billion yuan, with the first set generators
expected to enter operation in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua is preparing to construct a new airport, said the
mayor, adding that future plans call for the city to electrify the
Chengdu-Kunming Railway Line, rebuild highways and bridges, and
install a modern telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
The city will continue to develop heavy industry in conjunction
with establishing more bases to produce farm and sideline
commodities. The bases will offer "high yields, high quality and
high efficiency", and will serve as centers for scientific and
technological information, finance, trade and commerce, said Qin.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua will celebrate its 50th Anniversary in the year 2015,
and by that time will have achieved 41 billion yuan in GDP and a
per capita GDP of 34,000 yuan, which will reach the standards of
the world's moderately developed countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Xiaolangdi Dam to Tame Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, China's
second longest river, has for years loomed perilously over cities
at elevations below the river bed, including Zhengzhou, capital of
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese hydrologist noted that the completion of the
Xiaolangdi dam and reservoir project on October 31 will
effectively mitigate catastrophic flooding. It will raise the
flood prevention capacity along the river from the current 60 year
flood to a 1,000 year flood.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi, located 40 km from Luoyang, Henan Province, will
have a storage capacity of 12.65 billion cubic meters. Main
structures include 10 intake towers, nine flood and sediment
tunnels, six power tunnels, an underground power house and a
rock-filled dam.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the world's muddiest river in the world,
carries over 1.6 billion tons of sand annually, with each cubic
meter of water containing 35 kg of sand, 69 times levels in the
Yangtze River. The river bed rises 10 cm (four inches) annually
due to silting.
</P>
<P>
As a result, dikes along the river have been breached on 1,500
occasions and the river has changed course 26 times over the past
2,500 years dating back to the Warring States Period (475-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has allocated vast amounts of material,
funding and manpower since the founding of New China in 1949 to
reinforce 1,300 km of embankments along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
People living in areas along the Yellow River have reclaimed
156,000 sq. km. of eroded land since the end of 1995, or a third
of the total land area scheduled for reclamation. Over 316,000
sq. km of eroded land, or 73 percent of the total, will be
reclaimed by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will also have the capacity to store 7.6 billion
cubic meters of silt flowing from upstream. The fact that the
river bed will remain stable for 20 years will save the state vast
amounts of funds and materials.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Greenpeace Sinks Coca Cola's Advert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A million U.S. dollars
advertisement for Coca Cola, which has been on Lebanon's TV only
for a month, has been withdrawn since its slogan was considered as
a wrong message to the consumers, local newspaper the Daily Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fouad Hamdan, member of Lebanon's environment group Greenpeace,
said the advertisement featuring one-way plastic bottles and its
slogan "Drink it and don't return it" could be understood
as encouraging people to aggravate Lebanon's waste crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the use of non-returnable plastic bottles was
making an already serious waste problem worse and that
authorities were not "even thinking about introducing plans based
on waste reduction, separation at source and then recycling."
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, Coca Cola "had responded very positively
to our comments and decided to change it."
</P>
<P>
Pierre Haddad, general manager of Fortune Promo-Seven Beirut,
the advertizing company that handles Coca Cola, said that the
intention behind the advertisement had been "to answer in a
marketing way to a specific campaign by Pepsi" which sports
the slogan "Drink it and return it."
</P>
<P>
"Pepsi already has two thirds of the market, the majority of
which is in non-returnable packaging, and our 15 percent share
would not have added to the problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda's Coffee Exports Reaches Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda exported 4.15 million
bags of coffee in the 1995/96 season, reaching a record high in
the country's history of coffee industry and surpassing the
exports of 3.7 million bags recorded during the 1972/73 season.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been Uganda's biggest foreign exchange earner,
covering 65 percent of the country's export income while the
figure in 1988 is 95 percent when the country started to
diversify its economy as part of a broad economic reform package.
</P>
<P>
Uganda earned 388 million U.S. Dollars from last season's
coffee export.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's total coffee output declined from 174,000 tons in
1989 to 168,000 tons in 1990 due to the price fall caused by the
breakdown of the quota system on coffee in July 1989 when Brazil,
a major coffee producer, clashed with central American countries
on the quota.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the 1993/94 season rose to 180,000 tons or
three million bags (60 kilograms per bag) and then 4.2 million
bags for the 1995/96 season.
</P>
<P>
The significant rise of coffee production or exports (Uganda
exports most of its coffee produced yearly) in recent years is
attributed to a number of measures taken by the Ugandan
government in a bid to promote its coffee production.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up three task forces to review the
coffee production, marketing and export systems. Based on their
recommendations, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA)
revised its relevant regulations on the coffee production and
export so as to make them more responsive in the coffee industry
and its regulatory functions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, privatization of the coffee nurseries was initiated
to increase the production of coffee seedlings so as to speed up
replacement of low yielding coffee trees at reasonable costs to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of prolific variety called a clonal
coffee, Uganda's coffee production has increased by a wide
margin. The clonal coffee has a yielding capacity of three tons
per hectare compared to the robusta coffee with a yield of 1.2
tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise of coffee earnings is attributed to the coffee
retention system introduced by the world's coffee production
countries in October, 1993 and the liberalization of the export
system on the national level.
</P>
<P>
The retention system has helped the rise of coffee price from
84 U.S. Cents to 2 Dollars per kilogram since African coffee
producers adopted in August 1993 a new policy which stipulates a
20 percent reduction of coffee exports.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the export system has removed export
monopoly from the Coffee Marketing Board Ltd and today over 80
companies in the country have been licensed to export coffee.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rise of earnings is that the interest
in Uganda's coffee worldwide has been boosted by the Uganda
coffee home page on internet, which was fully developed last year
with the support from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
As for the future of Uganda's coffee production and exports,
the Uganda Coffee Farmers' Association (UCFA) has decided to
double the country's current annual coffee production of 4.2
million bags during the years 1996-2001.
</P>
<P>
The measures for realizing this target have also been worked
out. They are to improve the quality of coffee, increase its
yield and export directly at least 30 percent of the production
into specialty market as well as establish extension service in
all major coffee-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the UCFA will develop an efficient and functional
information system between the coffee farmers and all its
structures and other relevant organizations in the coffee sub
sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to
invest more than 200 million yuan (24 million US dollars) into a
massive renovation project for the Forbidden City in the heart of
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An ancient city moat surrounding the complex of imperial
buildings will be dredged, and all of some 480 sewage outlets
along the waterway will be closed in order to prevent the water
from becoming polluted.
</P>
<P>
All the residential dwellings between the waterway and the
compound wall will be dismantled as residents and units gradually
move out. Units occupying some houses, which are cultural relics
under the top state protection, will also be asked to relocate.
</P>
<P>
The whole project, called "To Bring A Complete and Beautiful
Forbidden City to the 21st Century," will be completed by the year
2000. It was initiated by some noted relics protection experts in
Beijing, and will be jointly carried out by local relics
protection authority and district governments.
</P>
<P>
The Forbidden City neighboring Tian'anmen Square is one of the
most popular tourist spots in Beijing. It served as the imperial
residence during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A top official of Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) has defected to the ruling African National
Congress (ANC), which is viewed as a major setback for the
biggest opposition black party in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, Water Felgate, a former

Felgate accused the IFP of lacking democracy within its

the decision by the IFP last week to withdraw from peace talks
with ANC, added the report.
</P>
<P>
"I am by no means the first to move. Others will follow,"
Felgate said, adding that there was a "massive migration" of IFP
support to the ANC in IFP-based Kwazulu Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ANC in Kwazulu Natal Province had expressed welcome
to Felgate's joining in ANC, and issued ANC membership card to
him.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Economic Efficiency By Setting up Company Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's strategy to improve the
efficiency of its state-owned enterprises by establishing more
big-name company groups has been successful, with eastern coastal
areas charting the most progress, the People's Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Big company groups have reported good economic returns. In
Shanghai, a prominent industrial city on China's east coast,
large-scale enterprises which account for only three percent of
the all industrial enterprises there generate nearly 55 percent of
the city's total industrial output value and 76 percent of its
total pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
City officials have pledged to get several local conglomerates
listed among the world's top 500 companies by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province, an economic powerhouse in east China, has
been experiencing a higher growth in heavy industrial development
since the beginning of the 1990s, and has been working to ensure
the planned establishment of the province's 21 major enterprise
groups.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu's neighbor on the coast, has been
creating conditions to help form a coalition of efficient
enterprises through joint financing and development of common
products.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that these inter-regional company groups
have been given more decision-making power in business, which has
improved economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market has become increasingly closely linked to
the world market since the country opened to the outside world in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of the world's top 500 companies have
broken into the Chinese market. Many domestic conglomerates have
learned how to compete as a result of their competition with
trans-national companies.
</P>
<P>
Big Chinese company groups such as the Chunlan Group and Panda
Group of Jiangsu, Lizhu Group of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, and
Hai'er Group of Shandong Province, have become well-known
in China.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er Group, one of China's leading manufacturers of
refrigerators and other household electrical appliances, has
acquired a dozen enterprises of different kinds across the country
to form a conglomerate with some 100 enterprises as its members,
thereby increasing its assets to 3.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Its products are sold in more than 40 countries. The group
chalked up 6.2 billion yuan in sales and generated 500 million
yuan in pre-tax profits in 1996.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Release 62 Million Dollars to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, now comfortable
with the Zimbabwean government's plans to restore fiscal
discipline, has approved the release of the second tranche of
about 62.5 million U.S. Dollars to its reform program.
</P>
<P>
The bank's deputy resident representative Kapil Kapoor told
journalists on Thursday that the bank was pleased with the
general direction of reforms during the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The tranche would provide the government with the much needed
budgetary support to assist fiscal reform efforts in various
sectors, including trade liberalization, agricultural reform,
investment deregulation, transport sector deregulation and the
commercialization of parastatals.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the central government budget, he said that the
expenditure control system put in place two years ago was
beginning to work.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the bank is now of the opinion that good progress
has been made in turning the fiscal situation around."
</P>
<P>
Following a detailed public expenditure review, the budget
announced last month for 1997/98 was aimed at further
consolidating the fiscal situation, and the government reiterated
its commitment toward fiscal reform.
</P>
<P>
Kapoor said with such positive developments like privatization
of state-owned enterprises, tightening of tax administration and
decisions to establish an independent revenue authority had made
the bank to start discussions with the Zimbabwean government on
supporting the next phase of reforms.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm to Set up Titanium Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company, Tiomin
Resources Inc., is to set up a titanium processing factory in
Kenya's second largest city of Mombasa, following the discovery
of large deposits of the mineral at the Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Anton Esterbuizen, the firm's exploration manager, said here
this week that the construction of the factory, to be based at
Dongo Kundu near the Indian Ocean harbor, will start in June next
year and get raw materials from mines in Kwale District.
</P>
<P>
The company will invest around 100 million U.S. Dollars to
start the processing, which is said to be capable of raising over
400 jobs for Kenyans in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that the mining of titanium would not be
harmful to the environment of the east African country and the
land could be used later for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
High-grade zones of titanium-bearing sand have been identified
at Kenya's Indian Ocean coast and also believed to contain
combined rutile and zircon whose grade approaches 0.5 percent.
Titanium is used by paper, food and paint industries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Attack Copter Sale Dismissed by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
dismissed a report that Turkey had asked South Africa to supply
its army with 12 Rooivalk attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Local media today quoted a statement issued by Turkish embassy
in Pretoria as saying that Turkey's embargo against South Africa
still stands, not only for helicopters, but for all defense
materials.
</P>
<P>
Turkey recently announced a tender for the manufacturing of a
number of helicopters locally.
</P>
<P>
"South African manufacturers were not and will not be invited
to participate in the tender," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The South African government last week had blocked the sale of
Rooivalk helicopters to Turkey on "human rights and political
grounds", according to the report.
</P>
<P>
South Africa lifted its arms embargo against Turkey in April,
which was imposed in 1995 in the wake of a massive incursion by
the Turkish army into neighboring northern Iraq to hunt down
separatist Turkish Kurds who had bases in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, South African Foreign Ministry said all future
applications for the sale of arms to Turkey would be dealt with
"on a case to case basis".

TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese leaders expressed "deep
remorse" for Japan's role in World War II at a ceremony held here
today to mark the 52nd anniversary of Japan's surrender.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reiterated
"deep remorse" for Japan's wartime acts and expressed condolences

BUENOS AIRES, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Argentina broke all records
in first seven months this year by exporting 345 football players
abroad, pumping around 30 million US dollars into its football

Argentine players, running around Europe from the northern
Finland to southern Greece, enjoy good reputations in the

Paraguay with 19.

<HEADLINE> China's Booming County-Level Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's county-level economy is
playing an increasingly important role in national economy and
currently accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
County-level revenues also account for over 40 percent of total
local revenues, according to the Shanghai-based Business News.
</P>
<P>
The number of surplus rural laborers employed by township
businesses in counties is larger than the total work force in
China's state enterprise sector.
</P>
<P>
The county-level economy is not only responsible for
agricultural production, but also is the major source of
livelihood for a large segment of the population and the primary
producer of raw materials for the processing industry. Counties
have emerged as an important factor supporting rapid national
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The urbanization and integration of urban and rural areas have
expanded along with changes in the rural economic
structure. Economists noted that county-level regions are expected
to be the first to make further breakthroughs in China's reform.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Happy with Progress in Congo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe has
commended the Congolese government for accepting the formation of
a transitional government as a positive move that will facilitate
elections in the troubled Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, the
Zimbabwean leader said on Thursday that he had been informed of
"significant" progress in the negotiations to end the crisis in
Brazzaville by secretary-generals of the U.N. and the OAU, Kofi
Annan and Salim Ahmed Salim respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to persevere in your magnanimity in the interest
of compromise and reconciliation that will restore peace,
democracy and stability to Congo," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "we all count on your continued determination and
understanding to agree on viable transitional arrangements in
order to find a speedy solution to the crisis in your country."
</P>
<P>
He also sent a similar message to former Congolese strong-man
Denis Sassou Nguesso whose militia have been fighting government
forces for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean leader who is also thae current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), equally commended Gabonese
President Omar Bongo for his "untiring fforts" in his capacity
as chairman of the International Mediation Committee.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's messages also followed an announcement on Wednesday
by central African leaders of a peace initiative for Congo which
he will spearhead.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Congo (B) resumed in earnest last week ending a
tenuous cease-firae that had held since mid-July amid reports the
clashes have claimed some 4,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animal Attacks in Central China Present New Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Crops on China's Shennong Shelf, a
mountainous area known for reports of "big foot" sightings in
Hubei province, are facing a new threat now -- wild animal
damage.
</P>
<P>
For hundreds of years, farmers there lived on farming and
hunting and were plagued by droughts, hail, insects, and other
natural disasters. Then, beginning in the 1970s, the shelf's
ecology caught the attention of environmentalists who called on
the local government to protect the animals there, and now a new
burden has been added as the result of wild animal protection
regulations.
</P>
<P>
When the farmers gave up their guns for hunting they took to
looking after the wild animals. Eventually however, wild pigs,
bears, and rhesus monkeys turned to "robbery", raiding the
farmers' fields for corn and sweet potatoes, their major crop, at
night.
</P>
<P>
To drive the wild animals away from the crops they put up
scarecrows and set off firecrackers in iron pails. But after a
while, all these tricks failed, and the farmers could do nothing
but watch as the wild animals ran free.
</P>
<P>
To compensate the farmers, the local government has had to
offer a large sum of money as aid to the victims of this odd
"calamity".

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Continues Attacking PNA on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu again lashed out Thursday night at the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for failing to crack down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony of the National Defense
College, Netanyahu sharply criticized the Oslo accords, which he
said have enabled terrorists to establish themselves in
sheltering cities in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that in the past four years since the signing of
Oslo accords, the PNA has not acted to fight terrorism. At the
same time, he added, extremist groups such as the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad have grown stronger
and used Palestinian towns to launch attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The hardline premier said he still wanted to continue the peace
process if the PNA would fulfill its commitments to fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's attacks came immediately after the four-day shuttle
mission here by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, who said
having succeeded in reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have been critical of Ross' biased
position in mediation which was in favor of Israel's insistence on
the PNA's fighting terrorism but neglected the Palestinian demand
for an end to Israeli sanctions imposed after the July 30 suicide
bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed 16
people and wounded 170 others. Israel has yet to prove the
authenticity of the claim.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli response included a total closure on the
Palestinian self-rule territories, and suspension of transfer of
tax revenues to the PNA. Since the PNA has agreed to resume
security cooperation with Israel, it remained doubtful if such
collaboration will be effective when the sanctions are still
intact.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat strongly condemned Thursday the
continued Israeli sanctions, saying Netanyahu was fighting the
Palestinian people instead of the terrorists. He vowed that the
Palestinians would never bow to any humiliation and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Israel and the PNA has been rising since Israel
began building the controversial Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem last March, which led to the prolonged deadlock in the
peace talks. The situation was further aggravated by the suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which erased
glimmering optimism over a quickened resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting the PNA launch a long-term fight against
terrorism as a precondition for lifting its sanctions and
resuming the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Ready to Talk with Garang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar el
Bashir has said he is preparing to hold peace talks with the
southern Sudanese faction leader John Garang, according to a
"East African Standard" report today.
</P>
<P>
During a stop-over at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
on Thursday, he said his mission to visit southern African
countries was aimed at urging other African nations to facilitate
the peace process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president en route to Khartoum stressed that the
Inter-governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) still plays a
major role in peace negotiations in his country.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to South Africa, Bashir said, he briefed
President Nelson Mandela on preparation of a meeting for peace
between the IGAD and Garang who heads the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has fought in southern Sudan since 1983 for greater
autonomy of the Christians from the Moslem north and now is
allied with armed opposition groups in northern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir also briefed Mandela on the outcome of the Khartoum
Peace Agreement passed in Nairobi after a two-day summit attended
by five heads of state in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the Nairobi Summit held last month, the Sudanese government
expressed its willingness to accept the Declaration of Principles
drafted by the IGAD in 1994 as the basis for peace negotiations
in Sudan.

for an end to Israeli sanctions imposed after the July 30 suicide
bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed 16
people and wounded 170 others. Israel has yet to prove the
authenticity of the claim.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli response included a total closure on the
Palestinian self-rule territories, and suspension of transfer of
tax revenues to the PNA. Since the PNA has agreed to resume
security cooperation with Israel, it remained doubtful if such
collaboration will be effective when the sanctions are still
intact.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat strongly condemned Thursday the
continued Israeli sanctions, saying Netanyahu was fighting the
Palestinian people instead of the terrorists. He vowed that the
Palestinians would never bow to any humiliation and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Israel and the PNA has been rising since Israel
began building the controversial Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem last March, which led to the prolonged deadlock in the
peace talks. The situation was further aggravated by the suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which erased
glimmering optimism over a quickened resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting the PNA launch a long-term fight against
terrorism as a precondition for lifting its sanctions and
resuming the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> China Now World's Third Largest Energy Producer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Once labeled one of the
bottlenecks of China's economic development, the energy industry
after a five-year buildup has become the power behind the
country's overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China is now the world's third-largest energy producer,
according to a report recently released by China's State
Statistics Bureau (SSB) which also said that the country has built
up a comprehensive energy production system and formulated
effective energy policy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the status of the energy industry as one of the
basic industries supporting the national economy has been
elevated, and the once limited energy supply has been increased.
</P>
<P>
China invested heavily in its energy sector between 1992 and
1996, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The state units during the past five years invested 970 billion
yuan in fixed assets in the sector. The capital construction
investment in the period totaled 779 billion yuan. A total of
9,476 energy projects have been put into operation and some 489.3
billion yuan was added to the fixed assets of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The energy supply also showed marked improvement in the period;
China's energy production registered an average growth of 4.64
percent. The amount of energy produced in 1996 alone was
equivalent to 1.3 billion tons of standard coal, up 25 percent
from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's coal mining capacity increased to 171
million tons. The coal output in 1996 reached 1.4 billion tons, a
net increase of 310 million tons over the figure in 1991, or a
rise of 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Coal production of collective and private coal mines since 1993
has exceeded that of the state-run mines.

China's oil drilling capacity increased 48.51 million tons
while the natural gas exploration capacity posted a rise of 2.7
billion cubic meters. An additional 730 million tons of oil
reserve and 95.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas were
confirmed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil output in 1996 reached 157 million tons, ranking
fifth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil and natural gas exploration also progressed
significantly. In the offshore fields, 104 million tons of oil
reserve was confirmed while the natural gas reserve added 68.5
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The development of the electricity industry stayed on the fast
track. China in the past five years added power generation units
with a combined capacity of 126 million kw. The installed
generation capacities till the end of 1996 totaled 237 million kw,
ranking second in the world.
</P>
<P>
China last year generated 1,081 billion kwh of electricity, a
rise of 59.6 percent over 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, the world's largest hydropower
endeavor, is now underway and is considered a milestone in China's
hydropower development.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that China's energy development in the
future should still concentrate on electricity and be based on
coal. More efforts will also be made to develop hydropower and
high-quality fuels such as oil and natural gas. The development of
nuclear power should by then be put on the country's agenda.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the sustained economic growth in the future, the
energy supply should be increased correspondingly, the report
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's energy demand in 2000 may reach
1.45 billion tons of standard coal. The output of coal should hit
1.5 billion tons; the turnover of crude oil, 170 million tons;
natural gas, 30 billion cubic meters; and hydro-electricity, 240
billion kwh.

<P>
QINGDAO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sifang District Neighborhood
Committee in the east China port city of Qingdao has installed
electric alarms in the homes of over 70 elderly people, with
members of the committee responding immediately to emergencies.
</P>
<P>
For example, Liu Yujie, a 69-year-old woman suffering from
cerebral thrombosis, fell and committee members responded
immediately to provide emergency assistance when summoned by her
elderly and infirmed husband.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has prioritized assisting the
elderly in an effort to promote the country's community
services. Well over two million elderly people like Liu throughout
the country have received various forms of assistance from
neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
Many young people have joined the "help-the-elderly campaign"
by volunteering to be "sons" or "daughters" of elderly
people. Their efforts have enabled many elderly people living
apart from their own children enjoy family happiness.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages and fully supports community service
agencies which fulfill the needs of local residents, according to
Bai Yihua, director of Social Welfare Department of the Ministry
of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The main job of neighborhood committees is to provide services
for residents, said Bai, adding that all members of a community
are involved in the service designed to assists residents in need.
</P>
<P>
"Community services were first introduced in 1987 and have
since played an important role in serving the people and
maintaining social stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, services have been expanded from
assisting people with special difficulties to all members of a
community. The goal of community services centers have evolved
from simply helping those in trouble to developing and improving
the quality living conditions and environment for local
residents.

<P>
The number of people involved in providing community services
has grown rapidly throughout the country. There were more than
5,000 community service centers and 260,000 smaller neighborhood
service centers in place at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that more than 5,500 service
organizations and over four million volunteers are involved in
the work.
</P>
<P>
The most common form of service is the mutual assistance
provided by neighbors, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
Most neighborhood committees in Qingdao, Shandong Province,
have established mutual aid groups which provide dinner for
schoolchildren, and set up bookstores for children and vegetable
stores for the convenience of the local community. Experts note
that related activities, regardless of their simplicity, have
helped to solve a number of problems for local residents.
</P>
<P>
"People in trouble used to turn to the government or their
employers for help, " according to Xu Guoliang, deputy-director of
the Shandong University Social Economic Development Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu pointed out that development of a market economy
and improved community services have prompted more people to
approach their neighborhood committee or community service center
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the deepening of China's urban reform,
combined with changing family and population structures, will make
a number of problems more evident, such as providing daily
necessities for the elderly, assisting the disabled and employing
displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the improving living standards of urban residents
and their views concerning consumption and lifestyles will create
greater demand for community services.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to redouble efforts to
promote community services. Government plans call for the
establishment of service centers in more than 85 percent of the
country's over 5,600 neighborhoods by the year 2000, and to form
volunteer service groups in more than 50 percent of the country's
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The number of volunteers involved in the work is projected to
double to eight million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Millionaire-Farmer Spends Million Yuan on Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- In a rare twist, a Chinese
millionaire-turned-farmer has spent 1.6 million yuan to cultivate
nearly 100 ha of barren hillside in his hometown of Zhongning
County, located in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
Ye Tingzhu, 37, made a fortune in the past decade from his
successful transportation business. Early last year, he went to
Mingsha Township in Zhongning County from the city of Yinchuan,
the region's capital, to start a new adventure.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural development needs a long period of time and means
a lot of hardship. But I'm still young, and just won't believe I
cannot make a career out of farming," answered Ye, when relatives
asked him about his "foolish" notion of making money from farming.
</P>
<P>
He employed some technicians to work out a cultivation plan,
and built a 2.4-km water diversion project at the foot of the
Xiejiatang hills, where the once-barren hillside is now covered
with greenery.
</P>
<P>
Because of the shortage of money, he sold his car to buy a high
lift pump this spring. He stayed in the mountains for a whole
month to oversee the construction.
</P>
<P>
Ye also spent tens of thousands of yuan harnessing a valley so
that the villagers in his hometown could protect their farmland
from flooding.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious young farmer plans to open up another 200 ha of
wasteland in three years to further develop agriculture, and also
plans to experiment with forestry and animal husbandry projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Down on Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Yang Shengxue, 13 years old, a
city kid and the only daughter in her family, is spending her
summer vacation on a farm to learn how to plant rice and raise
sheep.
</P>
<P>
For urban youths who want a hands-on experience of the farming
life, a special farm was recently built in Cha'an village, Hongqi
Town, Ganjingzi District, in the suburbs of Dalian, a port city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province. The farm has dorms with 200
beds and one-hectare of cultivated land. The construction of the
farm cost 830,000 yuan (about 104,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 20 varieties of crops, such as rice, cotton and
peanuts, are grown there and several hundred head of livestock
raised.
</P>
<P>
The young people say they get a kick out of the sheep, rabbits
and ducks, and for the first time in their life have seen wells,
methane-generating pits and wind-driven generators.
</P>
<P>
During their one-week stay, the students are organized to visit
vegetable-growing areas, work in the fields, and learn about
agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Shao Jungong, one of the teachers, said, "We want the students
to come here and experience the hard work of the farmers."
</P>
<P>
When Yang was at home, she did no housework and was treated as
a "little empress," a common occurrence in Chinese families since
the country launched its one-child policy about two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, I had never thought about how the rice
comes into my bowl. Now that I've experienced the farmers' hard
work, I'll never take it for granted," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
On the farm, every 20 students share a room. They are required
to eat the same food as the local farmers and are forbidden to buy
snacks in the nearby shops.
</P>
<P>
"Every day we have to carry water from the well to our dorms,
and so we try to save every drop of water. After I go back home,
I'll never waste water again," Yang added.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 15 (Xinhua)-- The women's federations in east
China's Fujian Province are endeavoring to help poor rural women
eliminate poverty and improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the women's organizations in this coastal province
have put 6.66 million yuan in economic development of
poverty-stricken areas. They has also created opportunities for
about 54,000 poor women in these areas to work abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Fujian Women's Federation, the
province currently has 271,000 people under the poverty line, half
of whom are women. To help them out of their circumstances, the
women's federations start by teaching the women farming skills
such as cultivating tea and fruit trees, feeding goats, hens and
rabbits, and producing mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, women's federations have held a total of
50,000 training classes for rural women, and great changes have
taken place as a result. The Women's Federation in Nanpin, located
in a mountainous region, has established 1,600 model
poverty-relief bases, including tea and mao bamboo bases. Together
they have helped more than 30,000 poor women get rid of poverty in
only two years.
</P>
<P>
And the Women's Federation of Xiamen Special Economic Zone
encouraged urban women to donate more than one million yuan to
help 1,100 poor rural women get jobs.
</P>
<P>
To support the aid-the-poor projects, the Fujian Provincial
Government will allocate an initial one million yuan to the Fujian
Provincial Women's Federation. Over the next year the sum will
increase to three million yuan.

<HEADLINE> 18 Percent of Singaporeans Want to Emigrate: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one out of every five
Singaporeans have considered emigrating to another country mainly
because of the high cost of living and a stressful life in
Singapore, according to a Straits Times survey, which is published
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said that the 18 percent who had thought
about emigrating was up from the 15 percent who said they had
considered leaving Singapore in a similar 1989 study by
sociologists of the National University of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A total of 477 Singaporeans were interviewed, reflecting the
general population in terms of race, age and housing types. And 85
of the interviewed said they had considered emigrating.
</P>
<P>
The survey also finds out that Australia was the top choice,
with more than one-third, or 35 percent of those who wanted to
leave Singapore considering it as a potential destination.
Malaysia was a distant second, with 13 percent, followed by the
United States, 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, conducted last month by the Singapore
Press Holdings' Research and Information Department, those who had
thought of emigrating were mainly middle-aged, better educated or
from the middle-income group.
</P>
<P>
Those between 30 and 44 years of age formed 45 percent of the
group that considered emigrating, while white collar workers
formed 60 percent of this group, with the largest proportion
earning between roughly 1,334 US dollars and 2,667 US dollars a
month.
</P>
<P>
By race, among those who had thought of leaving for another
country, 68 percent were Chinese, 19 percent Malays and 11 percent
Indian, while other races made up merely two percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the reasons for migrating, 85 percent of those who
wanted to leave said that the cost of living is too high in
Singapore; 78 percent said life is too stressful and hectic in
Singapore; 73 percent agreed that housing is expensive in
Singapore, while 72 percent said car ownership is expensive in the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Singapore chief statistician Paul
Cheung was quoted by the Straits Times as saying that the figures
were not alarming because although more people said they were
considering emigrating, the number of those who actually do so had
not increased.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) has granted Nepal 4 million U.S.
dollars for its efforts in reducing fertility and improving
maternal and child health, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This grant to the Nepal Contraceptive Retail Sales Company
(CRSC) is part of a six-year-long, 35 million dollars worth of
efforts by the USAID and the Nepali government to lower birth
rate, improve maternal and child health and control the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, with the USAID's support, the CRSC has been
actively promoting the use of temporary family planning methods
including condoms and pills.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have contributed to a dramatic decline in the
total fertility rate, with the average number of births by a woman
reduced from 5.6 in 1991 to 4.6 in 1996, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The CRSC has also made a range of health care products

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has formulated plans
to develop ten core areas of industry with funds from the Asian
Development Board (ADB) and the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Science and
Technology here, the plan is to raise the manufacturing capacity
of ten industries which have shown promise at national level.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will provide an interest-free loan of 20 million US
dollars while OPEC will provide 7.4 million US dollars on
concessionary terms for the program.
</P>
<P>
The ten areas earmarked for the project are electronics,
information technology, manufacturing engineering, biotechnology,
food technology, aquaculture, environmental technology, polymer
sciences, textiles and ready-made garments, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the program will be to improve quality so that
these products become competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose centers of excellence for the 10 industries
will be set up to conduct research and train personnel.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Forced to Take Actions for IMF Aid: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Thanong
Bidaya Thursday said that Thailand was forced to implement actions
as the country needs a credit line from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Thailand has no choice but raise value added tax (VAT) from 7
percent to 10 percent, as it could not satisfy the IMF with a
small VAT hike and find another source of income, Thanong told a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The government also has to slash the budget to improve the
balance of payment as the country is undergoing a major economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was assured with a financial aid package of 16 billion
U.S. dollars by the IMF and other economies at a meeting earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
As the IMF is expected to give a final approval for the aid
package scheduled for August 21 this year, the Thai government now
is pushing ahead measures to meet the IMF conditions, including
tax hikes, budget cut, and restructuring of the finance sector.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also is making efforts to ease economic,
political or social disturbances caused by its decision to seek
the IMF aid within the country, which might include a cabinet
reshuffle recently.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet Monday approved in principle to cut the
government budget for the 1998 fiscal year by at least another 50
billion baht (1.7 billion dollars) and is working on the details
for government agencies under the budget cut plan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will begin to increase the VAT to 10 percent
nationwide on Saturday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will start
rotating and soon increase the number of troops deployed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Troop rotation will begin on Friday, and the number of troops
will increase from 8,000 to 11,000 during the forthcoming Bosnian
elections, said a Pentagon spokesperson.
</P>

"It's an increase, a planned increase, and it's done for a

</P>
<P>
The in-and-out move, which will take place over a series of
weeks, allows for an overlap to occur just as Bosnia plans its

Advance units of the Army's 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment will
soon begin moving from a base in Hungary into Bosnia. They will
replace soldiers from the 1st Infantry brigade who will return to

<HEADLINE> Domestic Light Industry Booming in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- According to statistics from the
China National Council of Light Industry, the total output value
of light industry topped 343.6 billion US dollars in 1996, 2.3
times up from 1992, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Output of some major products, including refrigerator, washing
machines, electric fans, irons, electric cookers and bicycles has
jumped to first place in the world, while that of beer, detergents
and salt stands in second place.
</P>
<P>
Along with the vigorous increase in output, the variety of
light industrial products also increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Every year, more than 10,000 new products appear on the
consumer market. The number of different light industrial products
now tops 260,000.
</P>
<P>
The light industry has not only satisfied the needs of the
domestic market, it has also become a major export-oriented
industry. More and more products exported have become technology
intensive.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the State Statistics Bureau of 40
consumer products in 1996, over 70 percent of the market for 33
products was dominated by domestic brand names.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, light industry has undergone comprehensive
restructuring. Some lalllllrge enterprises have broken through the
restrictions of industry sectors and regions and have established
economics of scale.
</P>
<P>
According to the third national industry survey, the number of
overseas-funded companies topped 2,000 by the end of 1995, making
up 12 percent of the total number of light industrial enterprises
and attracting about 14 billion US dollars from overseas, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments in Myanmar Reaches 6.2 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in Myanmar
reached 6.242 billion U.S. dollars at the end of June this year,
the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The investments, which came from 22 countries and regions,
covered 260 projects.
</P>
<P>
The five leading foreign investors are the United Kingdom,
Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Malaysia, injecting
1.318 billion, 1.215 billion, 1.132 billion, 582 million and 524
million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 sectors where foreign investments are involved, oil
and gas stood first with 2.192 billion U.S. dollars in 38
projects, followed by housing estate, hotels and tourism, and
mining, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that foreign investments are rising
rapidly as investors have much confidence in Myanmar's political
stability, and the nation's rich natural resources and fair labor
charges are also its advantages.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has changed to market-oriented economic system from the
centralized economic one since late 1988, opening its door to the
outside world.

<HEADLINE> Firm Shifts Focus to China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading West European small
household appliance manufacturer has shifted its investment
priority to focus on developing the Asia-Pacific market, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moulinex Group of France has announced in Beijing that the
company, having concentrated on the European market for half a
century, has now decided to shift its strategy and "spare no
effort to develop the Asia-Pacific market, especially China,"
sources in the Moulinex Beijing Representative Office said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China, with a population of 1.2 billion, is considered by
Moulinex as a huge potential market and, therefore, has been made
the focus of its Asia-Pacific development plan.
</P>
<P>
The company has made two major moves toward realizing this
strategy: establishing its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong
and building up its largest Asia-Pacific manufacturing plant in
Zhongshan city, in Guangdong Province, sources in the Moulinex
Beijing Representative Office said.
</P>
<P>
Moulinex will use half of its total investment for the
Asia-Pacific region in China, promoting its products and
establishing the Moulinex (China) Co Ltd in Zhongshan.
</P>
<P>
A massive advertising and product promotion campaign will soon
be launched in China, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongshan manufacturing plant, whose actual investment
volume is not available at present, will first produce Moulinex
brand micro-wave ovens to be marketed in both China and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments Welcome in Bulgaria: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- One in two Bulgarians believes
that foreign investments can help the Bulgarian economy emerge
from the current crisis, according to the results of a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the National Public Opinion Center in
July, in which 46.3 percent of the respondents were positive that
foreign investments would help the economy to recover.
</P>
<P>
While 24.1 percent of the respondents had the fear that the
national economy would become an appendage to foreign ones, 10.5
percent of the respondents held mixed views, with the remaining
19.1 percent having no opinion.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will hold its first national forum on investment at
the end of October which is expected to attract more than 1,000
potential investors, investment agents, bankers, and managers of
leading European companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament is reportedly considering enacting a
new law on foreign investment to remove barriers to foreign
investments, including the requirement for the minimum amount of
investment, the restrictions on the duration of investment in
securities, and the compulsory registration of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Credits, including capital leases and management contracts, are
recognized as particularly promising in attracting foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
Land purchase by foreigners has been a concern to
Bulgarians. The ruling Union of Democratic Forces proposed to
remove the constitutional clause forbidding land purchase by
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll of the National Public Opinion Center showed
that ordinary Bulgarians had reservations about the issue. Only
22.2 percent of the respondents favored selling land to foreigners
while 68.7 percent of them were against it.
</P>
<P>
In addition, half of the respondents opposed selling national
enterprises to foreigners and 37.7 percent of them favored such
moves.

<HEADLINE> Lei Feng: Model for Chinese Children in 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese hero who
died some 30 years ago is regaining popularity and is being held
up as a model for his countrymen, especially children.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, a People's Liberation Army soldier, gained fame
throughout China in the 1960s for his patriotism and love of the
Chinese people. He was praised by late Chairman Mao Zedong for his
unselfish deeds and plain lifestyle after he died in a traffic
accident in 1962.
</P>
<P>
A summer camp themed "Let Us Gather Around Uncle Lei Feng" was
launched this week in Fushun in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, where Lei had worked.
</P>
<P>
"Lei's spirit is not out of style -- it is the spirit of the
Chinese nation that can be inherited by our children," said Du
Xinquan, an educator.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xiaohua, headmaster of the Lei Feng Primary School in
Fushun, noted that children can learn a great deal from Lei's
legacy. "Lei has set an example for the people to love the
motherland, love work, and feel happy about helping others," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Lei's friend Qiao Anshan has given lectures about Lei in 60
cities. Following each of his reports, youngsters have crowded
around him to ask for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver said that Lei's story is responsible for changing
the bad habits of his "little sun" -- a Chinese term for a single
child who is spoiled by the family.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of first being a kind person and second being a
talented person has been widely accepted by the public," said Han
Li, headmaster of the Lei Feng Primary School in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the "Lei Feng spirit" has a different meaning
in the 1990s. "In the 1960s, when helping others, people were
asked to be more selfless in their lives. Now we tell the children
simply not to bother other people. If we require a child to be a
complete man, we must gradually teach him more in the future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Gets More Funding Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Three more foreign firms have
offered financial assistance to the Philippines to beef up its
foreign exchange reserves following the renewed attack on the peso
and other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today that Bank of Tokyo
and U.S.-based investment firms Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers
have informed the Philippine Central Bank of their desire to help
boost the country's gross international reserves.
</P>
<P>
This has brought to eight the number of international financial
institutions willing to assist the Philippines in beefing up its
foreign exchange reserves, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' foreign exchange reserves, a measure of the
country's financial capability to pay for the importation of goods
and service, dropped to 9.6 billion dollars on July 18 when the
central bank intervened in the currency market to defend the peso.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that details of the funding offers by the three
firms will be submitted later.
</P>
<P>
Soon after speculative attacks forced the Philippines to
devalue its currency from 26.5 pesos against the dollar to over 29
pesos on July 11, the International Monetary Fund approved a 1.1
billion dollar loan to the country.
</P>
<P>
ABN Amro, Chase Manhattan, JP Morgan, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
and ING Barings have also offered assistance to the Philippines,
according to the central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Daily Inquirer said that the central bank will
have to review the details of each offer before a final decision
can be made.
</P>
<P>
The peso was dragged down Thursday by fresh turmoil in Asia's
currency market. It closed at 29.44 pesos to the dollar Thursday,
down from the previous day's close of 29.05.
</P>
<P>
The peso's weakness was also triggered by a four-point cut in
the Central bank's overnight interest rates to 14 percent
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the peso rate is still far from being
stable because of the turmoil in other Asian countries' currency
markets.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Faces No Parliamentary Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's
parliamentary representative Roman Bessmertny said here today
there will be no parliamentary crisis in fall.
</P>
<P>
Denying predictions for such a crisis by some politicians and
members of parliament, Bessmertny said, "There are enough wise
people in the parliament who are capable of implementing the
Ukrainian constitution."
</P>
<P>
He explained that some lawmakers attempted to convene a special
session on August 28 and 29 to consider amendments to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the proposed amendments would
virtually eliminate the president's right of veto and strip him of
the power to fire the prime minister without legislative backing.
</P>
<P>
Bessmertny also said that he saw no obstacles to the
parliamentary adoption of the 1998 draft budget, adding that
adoption of the 1998 budget would be facilitated by the recent
appointment of Viktor Suslov as the economics minister.
</P>
<P>
Suslov had been the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for
Finance and Banking before his latest appointment.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet was formed on July 25.

<HEADLINE> Extra Charges on Foreign-funded Firms Eliminated in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, south China, has eliminated 60 types of illegal charges
that were being levied against foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a thorough investigation into existing
levies on foreign-funded enterprises, "China Daily" quoted Zhang
Wenxue, vice chairman of the autonomous region, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 60 types of charges were levied by 24 institutions. They
are considered illegal because they were instituted without the
approval of authorized departments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang reiterated that the power to assign levies rests in the
hands of the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
However, some local departments have arbitrarily increased
levies against foreign-funded enterprises, damaging the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that the investigation will be thorough. Those
levying charges without approval from the Central and local
governments will be strictly punished.
</P>
<P>
The region will compile and make public a list of allowable
charges, Zhang said, adding that foreign-funded enterprises will
get the same treatment as their domestic counterparts.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this investigation, the region's price and
finance departments will issue unified charge certificates,
collector's certificates, charging notes and payment receipts.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region will also improve its supervision
mechanism by separating charging activities and supervision.

<HEADLINE> Amazon's Water Level Drops Due to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Amazon River's water level has
been dropping suddenly in the past two weeks probably due to the
El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian meteorologists said today that the river's water is at
110.22 meters above sea level. On August 8, it was as low as
108.39 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, the level is still higher than the record low of 107
meters registered 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The experts attributed the drop to the lack of rains in the
upper Amazon watershed and mountain range caused by the El Nino
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a warm Pacific inshore current, which flows south
along the coast of Ecuador annually and extends down to the coast
of Peru in every seven to ten years.
</P>
<P>
There it causes an abnormal rain pattern in the Peruvian jungle
and mountain range and has a devastating effect on farming and
fishery.

<HEADLINE> Investor Satisfaction In Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has found that
overseas businessmen are satisfied with the investment environment
in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, three municipalities directly
under central government control.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's biggest city, is considered more attractive
than the other two, according to the survey, done by a Shanghai
company over the phone, of 475 investors from the U.S., Japan, the
Republic of Korea and the European Community as well as Singapore,
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They said Shanghai is better than Beijing and Tianjin because
of its skilled people and intelligence, dense commercial
atmosphere, great market potential, high level of international
communication, and management reforms.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the nation's capital, attracts investors because of
policy information, while Tianjin, which is two hours drive from
Beijing, has resources and a good surrounding area and convenient
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign businessmen are not so satisfied with property
and labor prices, efficiency of government, environmental
protection, or market studies and consultation services in the
three cities.
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed described their profits as
"very good" and "good," about 38 percent said just "ok," and 60
percent want to expand investment, 30 percent want to maintain the
current level, and only 1 percent want to reduce their
investment.

<HEADLINE> Austria Urges EU, U.S. to Help Resume Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
U.S. should shoulder their responsibilities and help the stagnant
peace process in the Middle East to resume, Austrian Prime
Minister Viktor Klima said today.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Austria Presse Agentur (APA),
Klima said the EU in particular should consider concentrating new
efforts on renewing the Middle East peace process as one of its
major tasks. The Palestinians, he added, have always valued the
influence of Europe.
</P>
<P>
As for Israel and Palestine, the two parties concerned, Klima
said Israel should first send a message -- no matter how weak --
to Palestine indicating that they are willing to re-build mutual
confidence and re-start peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He added that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's role in the
peace process should also be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with the APA, Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel echoed the same opinion.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said the Mideast peace talks were not mere bilateral
talks between Israelis and Palestinians; the EU and the
U.S. should participate and act as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the Middle East peace talks be combined with
the issues of security and economy.
</P>
<P>
As for a long-lasting peace in the Middle East, the foreign
minister listed three preconditions: guaranteed security for
Israel, extensive and constructive aid for Palestine, and the
halting of Israel's construction of a new Jewish settlement in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process stalled after Israel decided in
early March to build 6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa, a
tree-covered hill in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy to Expand by 7 Percent: Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
announced that its economic growth target of 7 percent for this
year can still be achieved despite the peso's recent devaluation.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here today, the National Economic and
Development Authority said that no downscaling of major economic
growth targets for this year and next year has taken place.
</P>
<P>
The planning agency was reacting to reports that it has revised
the gross national product (GNP) growth target for 1997 from 7
percent to 6.64 percent following the peso's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
No such revision has been made and the final and official GNP
targets for this year and 1998 are still 7 percent and 7.5 percent
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that gross domestic product will grow by 5.8
percent this year, led by the service sector, which will grow by
about 7 percent, as it continued to benefit from the
liberalization and deregulation measures implemented by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The recent peso depreciation has minimal effects on these
targets, the net exports and net factor income from abroad are
expected to increase and are likely to offset the dampening
effects of the peso depreciation on the industry sector," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government was forced to allow the peso to float
"within a wider range" in the currency market on July 11 when the
currency was under heavy speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The peso has slid from 26.5 pesos to the dollar to 29.6 pesos
since then.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Labor Unions Call National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Argentine labor union
confederations called for a 24-hour national strike today to
protest the country's economic situation and the labor reform
launched by President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
The Transports Ministry said subway, railway, air and river
transports were functioning normally, while vehicle public
transport in the capital and the province of Buenos Aires was at
about 19 percent of normal.
</P>
<P>
The labor suspension, especially in education and transports,
has had a strong impact on the inland areas of the country,
including the provinces of Cordoba, Santa Fe, Jujuy, Tucuman,
Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called a month ago by the Movement of
Argentine Workers and the Argentine Center of Workers without the
backing of the General Workers Confederation, the main labor
organization of the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's general strike is the seventh of its kind faced by
President Menem since he assumed office in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to support the Argentine peso in the aftermath of
the collapse of Mexico's currency in early 1995, President Menem
adopted austerity measures, including severe restrictions on
public spending, which eventually resulted in a high unemployment
rate and widespread social unrest.

WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States approved a
visa for Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s
political wing Sinn Fein in Ireland, the U.S. State Department
announced today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a news briefing
that there will be no restrictions on fund raising while Adams is in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Adams' visa request, lodged in Dublin on August 11, was
approved by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"He has been granted waivers in the past based on conditions of
a cease-fire. And since there is a cease-fire in place, she
granted a waiver this morning," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted a fund-raising ban in
1995, Sinn Fein has raised more than two million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Adams, 48, and senior Sinn Fein officials, who are due to
arrive here early September, are expected to raise hundreds of
thousands of dollars for the party during their visit.
</P>
<P>
Adams is expected to meet with administration officials for the
first time since an earlier IRA cease-fire ended in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
IRA, which seeks independence of Northern Ireland from British
rule, announced a new cease-fire on July 20.

tragedy, closed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, 1937, Japanese aggressor troops launched a war in
Shanghai, and in December seized Nanjing, which at the time was

one third of the city's houses were burnt down, according to Wang

Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>

He said that the forum was convened to review the historical
facts in a scientific and fair manner. "The Chinese people cannot
accept the fact that some Japanese have distorted the truth and
refuse to reflect on the history," he said.
</P>

Some 60 scholars from China, Japan and the United States

<HEADLINE> Net Sales of Industrial Sectors Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Led by food processing and
electronics sectors, overall net sales value of 21 surveyed
industrial sectors in the Philippines went up 11 percent in the
first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
For the month of May, net sales value increased 8 percent over
the same month last year, according to the latest data released by
the Department of Trade and Industry Management Information
Survey.
</P>
<P>
Food processing topped the list of gainers, with net sales
value reaching 32 billion pesos (1.1 billion US dollars), a 4
percent increase from last year's 31.5 billion pesos (1.08 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is followed by electronics, with 29 billion pesos (1
billion dollars), while garments sector came in third, with net
sales soaring to 28 billion pesos (966 million dollars) from the
previous year's 22 billion pesos (759 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other top gainers recorded in this period include cement,
non-consumer durables, construction materials and pharmaceuticals,
the data showed.
</P>
<P>
Sugar, on the other hand, was the top loser during the period
with sales dropping 53 percent to 392 million pesos (13.5 million
dollars), because of a decrease in demand due to stiff competition
in the domestic market with the influx of cheap imported sugar.

WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov
advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen International
Championships on Thursday by ousting Slava Dosedel of the Czech
Republic 6-2, 6-3 in a quick baseline battle.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov broke Dosedel four times in a match that featured
mostly back-and-forth blasts from the baseline and lasted only 53
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded American David Wheaton won twice on Thursday as he was
forced to play two matches under a squeezed schedule to make up
for time lost to Wednesday's near-washout.
</P>
<P>
The 142nd seed Wheaton started his day by upsetting No. 3 seed
Mark Philippoussis 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Hours later he faced Marc Goellner in another long match,
outlasting his opponent 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 to advance to the
quarterfinals and survive as the lone American in the field.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Alex O'Brien was upset 7-5, 6-3 by Goellner
in another match that had been suspended because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
In other matches at the Connecticut Tennis Stadium, No. 5 Petr
Korda beat Javier Sanchez 6-2, 6-4; No. 11 Greg Rusedski of

<HEADLINE> Chile Rejects Symbolic Alliance With United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- In an immediate response to a
United States' proposal that would give Chile status as a
U.S. Non-NATO ally, Chilean Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma
said his country rejects the idea if it means a loss of
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
her Chilean counterpart Luis Miguel Insulza that the U.S. may
grant Argentina the "symbolic" status as a main ally outside NATO.
</P>
<P>
But the Chilean minister, who is also the country's military
chief, said on television the proposal is "far from symbolic."
</P>
<P>
The best thing the United States can do is "to continue with a
fair treatment for the southernmost countries of Latin America,
especially toward the peoples of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must know first whether an alliance with the United States
implies some kind of loss of autonomy, of which we do not fully
know the consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nations already designated as close non-NATO U.S. allies
include Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Though it does not require the U.S. to come to their aid in
times of war, nations with this status stand a better chance of
purchasing ammunition and spare parts during a conflict.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- No. 6 Mary Pierce of France and
No. 11 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain failed to enter the
quarterfinals after Thursday's defeats at the du Maurier Open in
Torondo, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Pierce was ousted by Italy's Rita Grande 6-2, 6-2, and
five-seeded Sanchez Vicario, who reached the final last year, was
thrashed 6-4, 6-3 by her doubles partner 10th-seeded Mary Joe
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
Pierce was clearly out of form by committing 24 unforced errors
and lost half of her services. She even gave up two playable balls
in the last set.
</P>
<P>
No. 69 Grande, who was more consistent and strong, had four
aces and three double-faults.
</P>
<P>
Trailed by 4-2 in the second set, Pierce called timeout and
went to the washroom. But Grande maintained her dominance to seal
the match in just over an hour.
</P>
<P>
Grande's quarterfinal rival will be top-seeded Monica Seles,
while Fernandez will face Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In other matches Thursday, seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez
overtook Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki 6-1, 6-4 and No. 3 Amanda
Coetzer edged No. 11 Kimberly Po 6-3, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> 117,000 Year-Old Footprints Discovered in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists said today that
they have discovered a set of 117,000 years old footprints of
modern humans in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The footprints were left most likely by a woman, who was
between 5.3 to 5.4 feet and walked downhill in wet sand after a
rainstorm, Lee Berger, a paleoanthropologist, told a news
conference at the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
The ancient footprints, the oldest so far discovered, were
preserved in a ledge of sandstone at the edge of Langebaan Lagoon,
about 97 kilometers north of Cape Town near the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
They were made "by a person who... looked just like us," said
Berger, who currently studies ancient life forms at the University
of Witwatersand in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
He said that raises the possibility that the person who left
footprints in the sand so long ago is an ancestor of humans living
today.
</P>
<P>
"They were made at the right time, in the right place," he
said, adding that the prints also happened to be made by a person
who carried the genetic material that would lead to the rise of
every human being.
</P>
<P>
Actually the prints were found in September 1995 by Berger and
David Roberts, a South African sand geologist.
</P>
<P>
Roberts told reporters: "The chances of finding something like
this are a million to one."
</P>
<P>
Once the prints were made they were covered very quickly
probably with windblown sand on a hillside that eventually turned
to sandstone after being buried under pressure for scores of
thousands of years, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
"They had to be buried for a very long time to turn to rock,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Three other sets of hominid footprints have been found in
Africa. Two of them were more than one million years old, too
early for modern humans. The third was made 30,000 years ago.

<P>
MADRID, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany reapt three of the first
six medals in the European Swimming Championships with a gold and
two silvers while Russia won one gold in Seville on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Wels of Germany claimed the first title of the
championships when he won the men's one-meter springboard diving
final.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Holger Schlepps, the 25-year-old national
champion, edged Rafael Alvarez of Spain to clinch the silver medal
with a near-perfect final dive.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Wels collected 362.10 points from his six
dives, beating Schlepps by 5.02 points while Alvarez scored 355.56
points.
</P>
<P>
Wels finished the fourth in the continental championships two
years ago and runner-up in the German nationals last month.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 10-meter platform final, Russian 17-year-old
Olga Khristoforova won the gold with 441.60 points ahead of German
Annika Walter's 438.66 and Ukrainian Svetlana Serbina took the
bronze with 438.51.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town "Too Optimistic" on Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Analysts commissioned to
assess Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympics said on Thursday
estimates of the economic benefit to South Africa were too
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
"The bid has a number of weaknesses linked to the possibility
of the government sustaining a long term net loss," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The study was commissioned by the committee managing the Cape
Town bid to analyse the economic, social and environmental effects
of hosting the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of South Africa's prediction of a 30
billion rand (6.4 billion US dollars) economic boost and an eight
billion rand (1.7 billion US dollars) increase in government
revenue, the report said, could be excessive.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that "the overall macroeconomic benefits
associated with the Games are probably optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, short-listed with Buenos Aires, Stockholm, Rome and
Athens for the final International Olympic Committee (IOC) vote in
Switzerland on September 5, has promoted its bid as a key to
post-apartheid development and economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Greece Skips University Games in Sicily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece has decided to skip the
upcoming World University Games slated on August 18-31 in Sicily,
the organizing committee said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to the committee, Greece said it has decided not
to attend the Games "due to technical reasons", but failed to
elaborate the "reasons".
</P>
<P>
Nino Strano, head of the committee, depicted it "absurd" and
vowed to demand an explanation from the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
However, the withdrawal of Greece from the Games is considered
a tit-for-tat action against the criticism of Primo Nebiolo,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
During the World Athletics Championships in Athens, the Italian
who heads the International Amateur Athletic Federation, passed
the bucks to the organizers for the scarcity of audience and
claimed that Greece is in no way to solve its political and
economic problems through the hosting of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Currently, both Athens and Rome are among the top runners in
their bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games, and the International
Olympic Committee will cast their votes on September 5.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Around 400 Muslim refugees have been promised full security
to return to their homes in the Jajce region of central Bosnia.
Local Muslim and Croat officials agreed that the Muslims, who fled
intimidation from Croat gangs early this month, could return
starting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
-- Negotiations to end the strike at United Parcel Service are
scheduled to resume today as pressure mounted on the President to
intervene more aggressively in the 11-day old labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sounded a
conciliatory note Wednesday by promising to lift sanctions against
Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as soon as
Yasser Arafat shows signs of good faith by cracking down on
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
-- Ontario Hydro, North America's largest electric utility and
a major investor in nuclear power, is shutting down a third of its
reactors after an internal study documented widespread management
problems, years of inadequate maintenance and safety practices
that were only marginally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Calcium is lacking in U.S. diets, leading to an "alarming"
increase in osteoporasis, an Institute of Medicine panel said.
The panel said average intake is less than 75 percent of the more
than 1,000 milligrams a day needed. It urged more dairy
consumption, which has fallen due to concerns about fat.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Inquiry Findings Put NZ Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The findings of a long
inquiry into alleged tax evasion by some New Zealand companies
have put the coalition government in a difficult position as wide
differences have emerged in the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry, which lasted 29 months at a cost of over 12
million NZ dollars (7.7 million US dollars), was conducted by an
independent commission after allegations of tax evasion by some
big NZ companies in the deals known as the "Winebox transactions".
</P>
<P>
The allegations were made by Winston Peters, who was in
opposition at the time of filing the charges in January 1994, but
now is Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer of the coalition
government formed last December.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the heads of Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and
Inland Revenue Department (IRD) of conspiracy, incompetence and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the inquiry came out yesterday. But the inquiry
 commissioner concluded that no evidence of unlawful conduct,
impropriety and incompetence has been found on the part of the SFO
or IRD.
</P>
<P>
He also found that Peters' allegations against corporates and
individuals involved in the Winebox transactions to be "false and
completely unjustified."
</P>
<P>
However, after the findings were released, Peters maintained
that the report is wrong and he vowed to challenge the findings.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to apologize to the SFO and IRD heads who have
now been cleared of Peters' charges.
</P>
<P>
In Parliament yesterday, opposition parties questioned Peters'
integrity and called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
It was also a difficult time for Prime Minister Jim Bolger. If
Peters was still an opposition leader as two years ago, Bolger
would claim victory for the government and attack his opponent
because nothing wrong was proved on the part of the government.
</P>
<P>
But now Peters is his deputy and the man he has to work
together.
</P>
<P>
Trying to distance himself from Peters, Bolger said this
morning that it is up to Peters whether to challenge the findings.
</P>
<P>
He also said in Parliament yesterday that he was delighted that
the SFO and IRD heads had been cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that time ahead will not be easy for Peters.
When he raised the question of tax evasion, he was trying to upset
the then National government. By doing so, he has angered some big
companies.
</P>
<P>
No only because some people accused by him are considering
seeking compensation, but as the Treasurer in charge of NZ economy
and finances, Peters will find it hard to accomplish his job
without the support of the major businesses.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average experienced another bumpy day Thursday, going up and down
again and then ended the day up 13.71 at 7,942.03.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also ended higher as bond-market interest
rates fell for the second straight day on encouraging inflation
news.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened higher, jumping 70 points in early trading after
the government said consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July, in
line with market expectations. The consumer price index has gained
just 1.5 percent this year, or less than half last year's
inflation pace.

On Wednesday, the government said prices at the wholesale level
fell in July for a seventh straight month.
</P>
<P>
For the day, the Dow moved a span of more than 130 points
compared with the 160-point swing on Wednesday before the Dow
finished down 32.52.

On the bond market, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which
move in the opposite direction of prices, fell to 6.55 percent
from 6.62 percent late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Offers $2 Million Reward for Information on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
today offered a 2 million U.S. dollars reward for information
leading to the arrest of those responsible for four letter bombs
sent to the al-Hayat newspaper office in Washington D.C. last
January.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to us that the people who were responsible for this
letter bomb campaign intended to conduct a terrorism campaign in
the United States and this is one of those important steps that we
can in fact take to find the perpetrators," said Greg Bujac,
director of diplomatic security at the State Department, at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Starting on January 2, al-Hayat at the National Press Building
in Washington received a total of four letter-bombs. The
letter-bombs were sent in the form of musical Christmas cards
which contained improvised explosive devices. Another letter-bomb
was uncovered at a post office in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the letter-bombs appear to have
originated from Alexandra, Egypt, and were all postmarked December
21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, several letter-bombs were found in Leavenworth,
Kansas, and New York City.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslim Party Opposes Religious-related State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August (Xinhua) -- The Ruling Muslim Democratic
Action Party (SDA) on Thursday said that the new Bosnian Currency
and flag should not carry religious symbols.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sarajevo news agency ONASA, SDA spokesman
Ismet Grbo said at a press conference Thursday that since the
country has four religions -- Islamic, Cathlic, Othodox and
Jewish, bearing of religious signs on the state symbols could
cause problems.
</P>
<P>
Last week, former U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke won a concession
from the Serbs to drop their insistence on the printing an
Oxthodox church on the joint Bosnian currency, but an agreement on
the currency design has yet to be reached.
</P>
<P>
According to Grbo, the design of the flag is at its final stage
in the Office of the High Representative and there are two
proposals: one that the flag consists of green, red and blue
colors and the other that it has no colors, only a neutral symbol.
</P>
<P>
Grbo also claimed that there will be a rotation of Bosnian
ambassadors every two years among different nationalities,
although an agreement was reached last week by the Bosnian
presidency on dividing ambassadorships.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Increases in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production in
July increased by 0.2 percent following an increase of 0.3 percent
in June, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth was slowed by a fall in the production of motor
vehicles and parts and smaller declines in a number of nondurable
goods manufacturing industries, the U.S. Fed said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, warmer weather and increased use of air conditioning
translated into a 1.5 percent increase in utility output.
</P>
<P>
The report said that overall output of consumer goods slipped
by 0.2 percent in July after an increase of 0.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The production of nondurable goods fell by 0.3 percent
resulting from significant declines in the output of clothing,
chemical products and fuels. And the production of durable goods
was unchanged. The lack of growth in durable goods resulted from a
drop of nearly 15 percent in the production of consumer light
trucks including vans and sport untility cars.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output increased by 0.1 percent in July after a
0.3 percent increase in June. But mining output decreased by 0.3
percent, as a large gain in coal mining was more than offset by
substantial drops in other mining industries, especially the
drilling of oil and gas wells.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. industries operated at 83.1 percent of capacity, well
below a level that typically could mean inflation-causing
bottlenecks.

<HEADLINE> Albright's Mideast Trip may be Postponed to September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright might travel to the Middle East in September, not as she
announced last week to take the trip at the end of this month,
State Department spokesman James Rubin said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility the trip will be in September. I
would't expect it to go much beyond that," Rubin said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing for Albright's trip "is going to be linked to
the kind of trip she wants to have and the kind of results that we
see, in the area of security, that we're going to be watching in
the coming weeks."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the secretary of state had decided her maiden trip
to the region is "not exclusively focused on the Israeli-Palestinian
problem."
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be fair to day it will be primarily focused
on the Israeli-Palestinian problem, but we have broader interests
in the region; we have national security interests in the region
that go beyond Israel and the Palestinian Authority. So her trip
may also include a public component," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright had a long meeting with Mideast envoy Dennis Ross this
morning and they went over in some detail "what the progress and
lack thereof was in his trip," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
She has decided to "watch closely what results occur" from a
"mechanism" for Israeli-Palestinian cooperation over
anti-terrorism issues, which Ross proposed and was accepted by
Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary ... (will) make a decision about timing for a
trip based on that assessment," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Reduction of UNPREDEP Forces in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to reduce the troops of the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia by
300.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security council, Annan said it was
possible to reduce the force of 1,050 by 300 soldiers starting in
October because the turmoil in neighboring Albania had subsided.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations now had to analyze what kind of
an operation was needed for Macedonia for the rest of the year and
after the troops eventually leave.
</P>
<P>
"Internally social and economic problems continue to pose a
significant threat to the country's integration and long-term
stability and further exacerbate inter-ethnic tensions", he said.
</P>
<P>
"These internal problems give rise to the question of whether
the current mandate of UNPREDEP is relevant to the present
situation and whether it can be implemented with fewer resources,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said he was exploring "practical options
for flexible redeployment of the force" and studying what kind of
international presence was needed for the future.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Preventive Deployment Force was originally deployed to
prevent conflict elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia from spreading
over into Macedonia. It includes nearly 500 United States troops,
350 soldiers from Finland and small contingents from Indonesia,
denmark, Norway and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees No Significant Food Aid Diversion in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Department on
Thursday dismissed as unfounded the charges by a congressional
delegation, who, after their visit to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), alleged the DPRK government had
diverted food aid to the military.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that there has been any significant
diversion of the assistance we have provided," spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are able to judge, nearly all our assistance thus
far has been directed at helping young children, particularly
children under six," he said.
</P>
<P>
The congressional delegation has just wound up its visit to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The delegation said after
the visit that it saw evidence food aid may have been transferred
to the DPRK military.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said: "We believe the World Food Program, with
experienced in-country staff, has been carefully monitoring the
distribution of assistance (and the aid) has gone to the right
places."

LUSAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The first affiliate of Bank of
China in Africa officially opened today in Zambian capital
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony, Zambian Deputy Finance Minister
S. Simasiku said, it is the outstanding relations between Zambia
and China that has made it possible for Bank of China to set up
its affiliate in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
China has been "an all-weather friend of Zambia, it therefore
comes as no surprise that one of China's major banks is poised to
become a major player in our financial sector."
</P>
<P>
Bank of China, with its specialization in trade and finance,
will act as a facilitator for the further development in the
major sectors of Zambia's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Bank of China is one of the world's highest-ranked banks in
terms of capital and assets and is therefore capable of making a
significant impact in the financial sector of this country," the
deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ange, the bank's Managing Director and Executive Vice-
President, said at the ceremony that the Bank of China (Zambia)
will uphold its principle of providing best services for the
customers.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who went all the way from China for the inauguration,
said the bank will abide by the local laws and regulations, make
great efforts to better serve Sino-Zambia and Sino-African trade
and financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bank started its trial operation late last month.

NAIROBI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police spokesman Peter
Kimanthi said today that six police officers and seven civilians
were killed during an armed attack on two police stations in
Mombasa, a southern port city, Wednesday night.

senseless act of violence," the minister said.
</P>

Kenyan Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira has flown to Mombasa
from the capital Nairobi to direct investigations into the attack
started by dozens of gangsters armed with machetes.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Kenyan police in Mombasa said: "A major
security operation was immediately launched to net the culprits."

<P>
LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
United Nations' singed an agreement today to officially renew the
UN Peace Verification Mission in the war-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
Faustino Muteka, the Minister of Administration of Territory
said after signing the agreement that the agreement would help
the implementation of the Lusaka Peace Accord signed in November
1994.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement also indicates that the Angolan
government will push forward the peace process in the country,
through whatever means acceptable by all parties concerned,
Muteka said.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, the UN official who signed the agreement, said
that the founding of the UN peace verification mission in Angola
proves that the international community believe that the Angolan
government and the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) could accomplish the work outlined by the Lusaka
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Beye said that the peace process in Angola is at a critical
moment, and what's most important is that both the government and
the UNITA should observe the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The UN peace verification team started its new mission on June
30 to supervise the implementation of the Lusaka Peace Accord in
Angola.

SARAJEVO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Croat and Muslim
officials have reached an agreement on the return of Muslim
refugees to the Croat-controlled Jajce area, the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached on Wednesday at a UNHCR-chaired meeting

involving more than 1,000 people to return to the Jajce area,
UNHCR Kris Janowski said at a daily briefing in Sarajevo.
</P>

The permission of return will not only be accorded to some 500
people who were kicked out earlier this month upon their arrival
at their destroyed homes in Jajce but also those had not dared to
venture back.

One hundred families will start to return to the village of
Kruscica on Saturday, to be followed by the return of the remaining
families to other villages in the next week.

"It's good news, but again we have to wait and see whether
that happens and how it happens to tell it is successful or
not," Janowski said.
