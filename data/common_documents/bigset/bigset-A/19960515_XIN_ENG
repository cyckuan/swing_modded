</P>
<P>

to the State Council, giving suggestions to judicial and
administrative departments on punishment for those responsible.
</P>
<P>

international conventions and Chinese laws regarding the transfer
of dangerous waste.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Revise Laws on Special Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 13 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam plans to standardize laws
governing its Industrial Zones (IZ) and Export Processing Zones
(EPZ), said Vice Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Nhac.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Vietnam Investment Review quoted Nhac as
saying that draft laws will be submitted to the cabinet later this
month after soliciting opinions from the ministries and sectors
concerned.
</P>
<P>
In recent surveys, a major complaint is that enterprises within
the IZs are not differentiated from those outside the zones other
than in terms of taxes on their profits.
</P>
<P>
Another complaint is that domestic enterprises do not have the
same tax breaks and exemptions as foreign-invested ones enjoy in
the zones.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's six EPZs and 9 IZs will be grouped in a single
category under the new laws, said the vice minister.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Won't Fight in Tajikistan: Grachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia will maintain special
military relations with Tajikistan but Russian troops will not
fight in the central Asian republic, Russian Defense Minister
Pavel Grachev said today.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must promote special military relations with Tajikistan
because the latter is practically in a state of a civil war, " he
told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Russian troops will not take engage in active
combat to repel invaders on Tajikistan's territory.
</P>
<P>
Russia has a motorized infantry division and border-guard units
deployed in Tajikistan to help guard important installations.
</P>
<P>
Grachev's remark came after fighting broke out between Tajik
government troops and Islamic militants in the Tavildara area, 150
kilometers east of the capital Dushanbe, during the night between
May 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, about 500 militants seized Tavildara city at the
foot of the Pamir mountains and advanced several kilometers into
the region. They have now halted their advance to wait for
reinforcements, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports did not give casualty figures from the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan, a mountainous state of 5.7 million people bordering
Afghanistan, has been plagued by unrest since 1992 after a bloody
civil war in which Islamic forces were driven out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic opposition has been trying to establish a
bridgehead in the Tavildara mountains for the past three years and
have made incursions every spring after the snow melts in the
mountain passes.

<HEADLINE> UK, U.S. to Jointly Build New Vertical-Launch Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MOD) has decided to join an America program of building a second
generation jump jet capable of aircraft launch and vertical
landing, according to a press report today.
</P>
<P>
The British MOD is expected to invest 133 million pounds (about
200 million U.S. dollars) in this joint project in a bid to
replace the Royal Navy's fleet of ageing Sea Harriers fighter
planes.
</P>
<P>
Under the title of the Joint Strike Fighter, the military
experts of the two countries have been given an unique task of
designing a single airframe capable of various roles previously
done by separate planes.
</P>
<P>
The new fighter will be capable of dogfighting like the old
F-16, juddering aircraft carrier launches like he F-18 and STOVL
(short take-off, vertical landing) like the Harrier, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As the new fighter plane is relatively low cost, both Pentagon
and the British MOD are expected to place a large order.
</P>
<P>
Military experts predict that the new vertical landing plane,
with a potential export market of up to 2,000, is expected to be
the defining aircraft precurement for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three designs have been put forward and American
officials, assisted by British experts, would choose two of the
competitors to build full-scale aircraft for what is called the
Concept Demonstration phase.
</P>
<P>
After the Concept Demonstration phase, the winning option is
scheduled to begin construction in 2005 with delivery in
2007.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Make 4-Day Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac is
to make a four-day state visit to Britain from Tuesday, with the
BSE shadow following the French president closely during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is the first French president to visit Britain in
12 years, is expected to voice solidarity with his British host
Queen Elizabeth II and will be pressed to support a partial
lifting of the European Union (EU) ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace announced recently that Queen Elizabeth
will serve British beef at lunch soon after Chirac arrives in
London by Eurostar train.
</P>
<P>
A senior British government official has strongly indicated
that France, which was the first European country to declare a ban
on British beef, would back a lifting of the seven-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
However, French officials have reportedly ruled out a dramatic
initiative saying that any premature, over-hasty measure could
prove counter-productive if it did not restore consumers'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit, Chirac will hold talks with British
Prime Minister John Major Wednesday to exchange views on various
issues from the beef crisis to European integration.
</P>
<P>
The French president is also to make a rare address to both
houses of the British parliament and hold talks with business
leaders.

<P>
AMMAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- First Ladies of many countries met in
Jordan's Sports City today for a three-day meeting on ways of
improving the living standards of rural women around the world.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan opened the 1996 Meeting of the
International Steering Committee on the Economic Advancement of
Rural Women (ISC), which is hosted by ISC President Queen Noor.

Declaration for Rural Women through the mobilization of political
will and public opinion and the formulation and implementation of
national policies for rural women around the world.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Christopher told the leaders of the

<P>
"There are things only you can do to create a secure
environment and compliance with the federation agreement," the
U.S. Secretary of State said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-Croat federation was formed two years ago. Despite
slow progress, it is considered possibly the best hope in Bosnia
for resolving ethnic differences that erupted into the 43 month
war.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters
earlier that the United States is "determined to not let it fail."
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for bringing them together," the

nearly completed by Muslims and Croats although several questions
remain. Bosnia's Muslims and Croats were at war only two years

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister On Nullification Of Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean minister today said
the nullification of the Harare, Bulawayo and Masvingo executive
mayoral elections held last October was an embarrassment to
Zimbabwe's local government system.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Local Government, Rural and Urban Development
Minister John Nkomo criticized the clerks of the three towns for
not holding the mayoral elections in accordance with both the
presidential powers regulation and urban councils act.
</P>
<P>
He said the nullification of the elections should serve as an
important lesson to those in public office that the law should
not be taken for granted and that no one was above the law.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would not tolerate anyone who used the
ruling ZANU (PF) as an excuse for the mistakes made in the
elections of the first executive mayors in the three towns.
</P>
<P>
''We were disappointed that it happened in the big cities --
Harare, Bulawayo and Masvingo -- which are supposed to be
leading. The whole things was an embarrassment," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Justice of the High Court of Zimbabwe Adam nullified the three
executive mayoral elections on May 8 following an application by
the opposition Forum Party of Zimbabwe who contended that there
had been gross irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The judge blamed the three town clerks for not complying with
the regulations pertaining to urban councils' election.
</P>
<P>
Harare is the country's capital, and Bulawayo is Zimbabwe's
second largest city.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Promises Strengthening of School Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Education Secretary
Gillian Shephard promised today a "substantial sum" of extra money
to strengthen security in schools.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Mrs Shepard accepted the
recommendations raised by a working party on school security which
was set up after the murder of a school teacher in London last
December, but she ruled out extra funding this year.
</P>
<P>
In the parliament, the opposition Labour offered full
cooperation with the government on improving school security.
</P>
<P>
Labour leader Tony Blair called for measures recommended to
strengthen security in schools to be fully funded.
</P>
<P>
He urged that the measures should be funded if necessary from
the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major said his government would do
everything to ensure schools were secure places for children to
learn.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee safety in schools, Major told the house,
he personally expected tighter gun controls will be materialized.
</P>
<P>
Now violence and indiscipline in schools have left the Tory
government and the opposition Labour to device plans to help
teachers keep control, according to press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, robberies in schools have doubled and drug
offences are ten times up on a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
But many methods of ensuring order in classroom have either
been legislated out of existence or can no longer be used.
</P>
<P>
This month, teachers in two schools boycott teaching of violent
pupils who had been expelled from school for their indiscipline.
</P>
<P>
They have even threatened to wage industrial action against
local education authorities who had sent the expelled pupils back to
school.
</P>
<P>
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association
of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT), said that
Britain could not expect good education and good standards of
discipline when teachers had to put up with lawless and mindless
pupils.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Head Teachers expressed
dissatisfaction with the government for not pledging immediate
extra funding to make schools safer.
</P>
<P>
David Hart, general secretary of the Association who accused
the education secretary of "hinding behind the Treasury", said
that schools could not wait for extra cash to protect teachers
and pupils.
</P>
<P>
Hart called for an immediate injection of at least 25 million
pounds (37.5 million US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A charter airliner with 119
people aboard made an safe emergency landing Tuesday at Norfolk
International Airport, Virginia, after losing cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
Some minor injuries, including bloody noses and inner ear
problems were reported and one person was taken to a hospital, the

<HEADLINE> Germany to Aid Cambodia in Demining Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The German government will
donate one million U.S. dollars for demining operations in
Cambodia, the Cambodian Action Center (CMAC) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the CMAC said German Ambassador to Cambodia
Dr Wiprecht Von Treskow will present a check for one million
dollars to CMAC Chairman Ieng Mouly at a ceremony on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is one of the most heavily mined countries in the
world. Military experts estimate that as many as 10 million
anti-personnel mines are scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40,000 Cambodians have been disabled by mines, and
up to 300 are killed or maimed every month.

<HEADLINE> New Approach To Housing Spelt Out In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government plans to
build high-rise residential flats as opposed to conventional
houses in its housing development program, Local Government,
Rural and Urban Development Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
''We have decided, in terms of our new strategy, that any new
housing development should focus on high-rise buildings, say of
four floors. Where possible some high-rise buildings will be
fitted with lifts,'' Deputy Minister Tony Gara said.
</P>
<P>
Gara, who was addressing a conference on ''Access To Land And
Security Of Tenure'' in Harare, said if executed, the new
approach would mark a departure from the traditional way of
housing delivery.
</P>
<P>
The system used in the past, he said, resulted in costly
infrastructural development such as roads, trunk sewers, sewer
reticulation, bulk water supply systems, water reticulation and
refuse disposal.
</P>
<P>
The new system, he said, would have such spin-offs as
reduction in the cost of servicing plots as lengths of piping and
related service would be shorter.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-French Relations At Their Best: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Britain and France
have been at their best over the past 50 years, but the two
countries have different views on European integration, British
Prime Minister John Major told a French newspaper in an interview
published today.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with Le Figaro before French President Jacques
Chirac's three-day visit to Britain beginning Tuesday, Major said
that Britain's defense cooperation with France is closer than with
any other country.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France were also in agreement on a common foreign
policy for the European Union (EU), he said, although he added
that such a policy should be adopted unanimously, not by majority
vote among EU member-countries.
</P>
<P>
Major acknowledged that the two countries have different views
on European monetary union and the social policies of an
increasingly integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain would not join the EU's proposed single
currency and there were no "if" or "buts" about it.
</P>
<P>
Britain would not support "foolish" aspects of integration and
the excessive centralization of power, he said, but nor would
Britain oppose European integration, he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Arrives in Moscow for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali arrived here today for a four-day official visit
which will focus on further cooperation between the U.N. and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his arrival at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-2 airport,
Boutros-Ghali said: "The principal aims of my visit are to give a
new impulse to cooperation between the United Nations Organization
and Russia, and to attend a meeting of the Heads of State and
Government of the CIS."
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that my regular consultations with the
Russian leadership be furthered," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief will meet with Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to meet with State Duma (lower house of
parliament) Speaker Gennady Seleznyov and Patriarch Alexy II of
Moscow and All Russia.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said that his talks with Yeltsin will cover the
U.N.'s negotiations with Iraq on the delivery of humanitarian aid
in exchange for oil.
</P>
<P>
He said they would also discuss regional conflicts in
Tajikistan and Georgia, and the implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
will be touched upon during his talks with Russian leaders, the
U.N. chief said the Chechen problem "is Russia's internal affair."
</P>
<P>
"If the conversation turns to the developments in Chechnya, I
am prepared to discuss them, proceeding, however, from the U.N.
basic principle, namely, non-interference in the internal affairs
of the U.N. member-countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
While in Moscow, Boutros-Ghali will also attend a round-table
discussion on "Russia and the United Nations" and a summit meeting
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Itar-Tass news
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Clashes with Hezbollah in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army killed a Hezbollah
gunman today during a clash with the guerrilla organization's
fighters in south Lebanon, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the eastern sector of the Israeli
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon when an Israeli
army patrol spotted a group of Hezbollah fighters and opened
fire, killing one of them.
</P>
<P>
The other Hezbollah fighters managed to flee, and there were no
Israeli casualties, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese sources said that Israeli artilleries
shelled Hezbollah targets north of the "security zone" following
the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Today's fighting came as a continuation of the clashes between
Hezbollah and the Israeli army and the South Lebanon Army (SLA)
in the "security zone," after five Israeli soldiers were wounded
earlier this week by Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
The five Israeli soldiers were injured in the northeastern
sector of the "security zone" Sunday when a Hezbollah anti-tank
rocket hit one of the army's patrol vehicles, while mortar shells
were fired at an Israel army outpost nearby.
</P>
<P>
An army major riding with the patrol was badly hurt by the
rocket, and four other soldiers, including two junior officers,
were lightly wounded at the outpost.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israeli army and the SLA responded to the attacks
with heavy shelling at Hezbollah positions beyond the "security
zone" as the wounded soldiers were evacuated by helicopters to
the Rambam Hospital in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Last week, one SLA soldier was killed and two others were
injured when roadside bombs exploded in two other separate
attacks by Hezbollah militants in the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no signs of an end to the clashes
between the Israeli army and the Hezbollah fighters in the
"security zone" since the end of the Israeli blitz on south
Lebanon more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army started the military operation against
Hezbollah targets on April 11, as an effort to stop Hezbollah
Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
However, Katyushas had continued to fire into Israel
throughout the 16-day-long operation until a cease-fire
arrangement was worked out between Israel, Syria and Lebanon
through U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's diplomatic
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
All together more than 100 Lebanese civilians were killed and
over 300 others wounded in the Israeli strikes against Hezbollah,
which once reached deep into the suburbs of Beirut, capital of
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, officials estimated that the operation
had cost the Israeli economy at least 100 million U.S. dollars,
including lost work days, damaged property, handling of thousands
of evacuees, decreased tourism, and various other indirect costs
of the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the cease-fire understanding, achieved as a result of
the operation, do not prevent Hezbollah fighters from attacking
Israeli army and the SLA troops in the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, civilians on both sides should not be
attacked, and Israel will maintain the right to hit any Hezbollah
position or base used for launching attacks, even if it located
inside one of the villages opposite the "security zone" or
elsewhere in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts Again In Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Only one day after hand-shakes and
confession for peace between rival gunmen, heavy fighting broke
out again today in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, shattering two
days of relative calm in the city.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted witnesses as saying that
shooting began before dawn after fighters loyal to Charles Taylor
and Alhajikromah advanced toward ethnic Krahn rivals in and
around the Tarclay Training Center barracks in the city center.
</P>
<P>
The Krahn fighters fought back, driving them back up toward
the Gravy Stone Compound, which is adjacent to the US embassy and
where more than 2,000 frightened civilians gathered for
protection.
</P>
<P>
The crackle of automatic weapons and the thud of
rocket-propelled grenades echoed around the Oamba Point
diplomatic district.
</P>
<P>
US marines protecting the embassy have twice opened fire when
the gunmen fired and aimed at the embassy. It is learned that the
marines have since April killed about nine of the gunmen and
since then the gunmen tend to walk with their guns lowered near
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, according to the report, launched Liberia's civil war
in 1989, in which more than 150,000 people have been killed and
put over half the country's population of 2.5 million to flight.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting in Monrovia began on April 6 after
Liberia's interim cabinet dismissed Krahn warlord Roosevelt Johnson
as rural development minister and ordered his arrest on murder
charges.

<HEADLINE> CJD Victim's Family to Sue UK Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid scare of mad cow disease, a
family of a woman who died from Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease, the
human equivalent of mad cow disease, is seeking today legal aid to
sue Britain's Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old woman in Oxfordshire died in 1994. Her
23-year-old daughter Ilja Andrew announced her intention to take a
legal action against the government at a meeting attended by 15
families, who said that their relatives also died from CJD,
according to press reports here.
</P>
<P>
Andrew accused the Ministry of Agriculture of making misleading
statements on the possibility of link between CJD and BSE.
</P>
<P>
She feared any more people in Britain, including herself, could
be infected and has urged other victim's families to join her in
taking action.
</P>
<P>
The High Court in London is currently hearing a lawsuit on
behalf of 17 children who contracted CJD after being treated with
human growth hormone taken from the brains of human corpses.
</P>
<P>
The government health department and the Medical Research
Council have been accused of not taking enough care in making sure
that the injections were safe.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Insists on Security Nature of Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon today reiterated its request
that the proposed cease-fire monitoring committee should be
restricted to the security aspect and distanced from political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi reaffirmed that the committee,
which is to be set up to implement the cease-fire understanding
brokered by the United States between Lebanon and Israel on April
26, should be nothing but a "military security committee."
</P>
<P>
This was the Lebanese and Syrian position, Hrawi was quoted as
saying by Ali al-Khalil, Lebanese minister of the immigrants, who
visited the president this afternoon.

Hrawi said that the committee's headquarters should be at
Naqura, "where it can carry out its missions on the spot." Naqura
is a southern Lebanese bordering town where the headquarters of
the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon is also located.
</P>
<P>
"The committee should not interfere in the political affairs,
because the interference will lead to the incompatibility with
the (peace) negotiating process or to the impairment of the
contents of resolution 425 whose implementation is desired by
Lebanon," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's remarks came when representatives from the five
members of the proposed monitoring committee, namely the United
States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, are holding their
second meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, on the other hand, said
today that "the failure of (forming) the monitoring committee is
not in anyone's interest."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committee should be of security nature rather
than of politics nature so as to avoid being a "substitute for
resolution 425." U.N. Security Council resolution 425 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri said a result should be achieved at the meeting now being
held in Washington.
</P>
<P>
As the representatives from the committee's member states are
meeting in Washington to iron out their differences, tension
remains high in south Lebanon on the third successive day.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, ambushed this morning an Israeli patrol on the road near the
village of Tallouseh, Marjayoun, inside the Israeli self-
proclaimed "security zone" in south lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fire between the guerrillas and the Israeli
patrol led to the killing of one of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this operation, the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of the Shiite Hezbollah, announced that its
fighters attacked the Israeli position at Sejoud with rockets and
machine-guns, destroying an Israeli tank, killing and wounding
several Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Tension in south Lebanon escalated following the attacks at
Israeli occupation forces launched by Hezbollah guerrillas in the
bordering buffer zone on Sunday in which five Israeli soldiers
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
From early this morning till late this afternoon, Israeli
forces bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a mountain
area often used by Hezbollah guerrillas to launch attacks at the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out intensive reconnaissance flights
over the areas of Iglim Al-Toffah and Nabatiyeh at low altitute
and flew over the Lebanese capital twice at 10:55 a.m. (07:55
GMT) and at 1:50 p.m. (10:50 GMT), breaking sound barrier to make
terrifying noises.
</P>
<P>
Anti-air units of the Lebanese army and the Syrian forces in
the hills around the capital refrained from firing at the Israeli
warplanes.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Investment in Europe Increases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies' appetite for
investment in Europe is rising for the first time in six years,
according to a report today in the Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese companies setting up new operations in
western Europe rose last year for the first time since 1989 and 36
manufacturers set up operations, taking the total to 727, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
This is a sharp increase from 19 new companies in 1994 and 26
in 1993. While the total is well short of the peak of 88 new
companies recorded in 1989, the increase suggests Japanese
companies' investment plans are recovering from the impact of the
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that companies with existing European
operations are also significantly more enthusiastic than a year
ago about investment plans.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters plan to invest in the next two years,
compared with 55 percent in 1995, the report said, citing a survey
by the Japan External Trade Organisation and covering 437 Japanese
companies in European Union countries, Switzerland, Norway and
Iceland.
</P>
<P>
Britain remains the most attractive place to invest in
production plants for 41.9 percent of those surveyed, and of the
727 Japanese companies in western Europe, 215 are in the UK, more
than double the totals for France and Germany, which have 109 and
105 respectively.
</P>
<P>
But eastern European countries are gaining ground, with 23.6
percent of companies putting the Czech Republic or Slovakia at the
top of their list, and 16.2 percent naming Poland.

<HEADLINE> UK Politicians Worried about Screen Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 members of parliament
in Britain have signed a petition, urging the government to ban a
film of violence entitled "Natural Born Killer".
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major also expressed concern this
afternoon about the screen violence in the House of Commons and
indicated that he would endorse a call for a ban of the above-said
film.
</P>
<P>
At a question time in the house, Major said that he shared the
concern of millions of British people who were worried about the
level of violence in feature films, and perhaps even more
damagingly, in videos, which will be more readily available to
young people.
</P>
<P>
Liz Lynne, a MP of the Liberal Democrats, urged the prime
minister to press Britain's Board of Film Classification to
withdraw the video certificate of the above-mentioned film and
persuade the BBC not to show the film.
</P>
<P>
Major replied that although he had not seen the film,
everything he had heard about it suggested that it was distasteful
and he hoped that the film censors would consider it with great
care and act on it.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of National Heritage, also
pointed out last weekend that there was too much violence in
films.
</P>
<P>
Bottomley, who is charge of arts including films, said that
excessive violence was not what people wanted and it could only be
detrimental in society.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturers Hold down Output Prices in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturers have been
forced to slash prices last month in order to sell goods as weak
demand at home and abroad has prevented them from passing on
higher production costs to customers, official figures showed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' input prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8
percent in April after a one percent increase in March, according
to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The annual rate of
increase rose to 3.1 percent from 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in input prices last month was bigger than the 0.4
percent that the City had been expecting. However, the rise
largely related to higher crude oil and food prices.
</P>
<P>
Core input prices, which strip out food, drink, tobacco and
petroleum products, rose by 0.3 percent in the month. This took
the year-on-year rate to minus 0.3 percent, the first year-on-year
drop since early 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of goods leaving the factory gate rose last
month at the lowest annual rate since December 1994, the ONS said.
Manufacturers were again unable to raise prices in the face of a
build-up of unsold goods and weak export demand.
</P>
<P>
Output prices rose by 0.3 percent in April, depressing the
annual rate of output price inflation to 3.2 percent from 3.5
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol, core output prices
rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, taking the annual rate
of increase down to 2.8 percent from 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
City economists predicted that retail price inflation will
continue to drop in the months ahead, helping to keep base rates
low.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Appeals For Asylum For Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner For Refugees (UNHCR ) today appealed to west African
countries to keep their doors open to thousands of Liberian
refugees fleeing fighting in Monrovia, a press release issued
here by the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner Sadako Ogata specially mentioned the
Nigerian freighter Bulk Challenge with some 3,600 passengers
aboard and the Victory Reefer with 700 people off Sierra Leone,
saying that the freighter has been refused entry in two countries
and as of Monday morning was still looking for a port that would
accept its 3,600 passengers.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned about the situation of the people aboard
these vessels. They have been at sea for some days now." "Unless
the door is opened to them, a lot of people, many of them women
and chldren, may die," the press release quoted Ogata as saying.
</P>
<P>
" While I understand the security concerns and pre-occupation
of the governments in the region I ardently appeal to their
compassion for these desperate people seeking refuge," Ogata
added.
</P>
<P>
She said UNHCR is prepared to help the countries that would
grant asylum to the Liberians in full compliance with
internationally accepted humanitarian standards, adding that it
would be contrary to basic international commitments to keep
these people in the current limbo.
</P>
<P>
In spite of repeated interventions by UNHCR and others,
passengers of the Bulk Challenge and the Victory Reefer have not
been allowed to disembark, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who recently visited west Africa, referred with
appreciation to the hospitality countries in the region have
shown to the Liberian refugees, allowing them to live
side-by-side with the local people.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 750,000 Liberian refugees in west Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nigeria and Cameroon are
ready to hold a summit, to be hosted by Togo, on the disputed
Bakassi Peninsula, a United Nations source announced today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha and President Paul
Biya of Cameroon have indicated their willingness to attend the
summit in their discussions with UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi
who is on a mission in Nigeria, said UN spokeswoman Sylvana Foa,
quoted by local reports.
</P>
<P>
The UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has informed
the Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema of the development, the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"So we hope to find a peaceful settlement to the question of
the Bakassi Peninsula," she said, adding that she did not know
when the summit will be held.
</P>
<P>
In the Nigerian capital of Abuja yesterday, General Abacha
accepted an invitation of President Biya to atted the forthcoming
Organization of African Unity summit scheduled for Yauounde,
capital of Cameroon, in July.
</P>
<P>
General Abaca has assured that he would personally attend the
summit, which he considered as a unique occasion to discuss vital
issues facing the continent including the territorial dispute
between the two countries over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who is also the UN Under-secretary-general for
Special Assignments, was sent by the secretary-general to Nigeria
last week to discuss the Bakassi issue with Nigerian authorities.
He met with President Biya in Paris before proceeding to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The UN spokesman expects Brahimi back in the next few days to
present his report to the UN secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon clashed repeatedly since 1994 over the
Bakassi Peninsula. But Nigeria accuses Cameroon of launching the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Officials of both countries have met in Togo before as part of
efforts to resolve the dispute, sources said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's NP To Withdraw From Provincial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP) will
also withdraw from all provincial governments except the Western
Cape's, from the end of June, NP leader and outgoing deputy
president F. W. de Klerk announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, de Klerk said the decision
was unanimously taken by the party's Federal Council early
today.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, de Klerk announced the NP will pull out of the
government of national unity from June 30, saying the new
constitution did not provide for the continuation of joint
decision-making in the executive branch of government.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first democratic constitution was adopted by
the Constitutional Assembly on May 8 with the approval of the NP.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the reason for the NP's withdrawal from the
eight provincial unity governments was the same as for its
pull-out from the central government.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the NP remained firmly committed to
the ideals that consensus-seeking models are needed at all
levels of government, and that a multi-party democracy needed to
be developed in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
After South Africa's first non-racial general elections in
1994, the African National Congress (ANC) controlled seven of the
country's nine provinces, while the Inkatha Freedom Party was
majority in Kwazulu/Natal and NP in Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also said his party would, however, be willing to
join a new government of provincial unity in the IFP-controlled
Kwazulu/Natal if the NP-supported new provincial constitution
came into effect there.

<HEADLINE> ACI: New Jumbos Cause Cost, Capacity Impact on Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The new generation of large aircraft
(NLA) would reduce airport capacity and cost affected airports an
average of 105 million U.S. dollars in infrastructure adaptation
to them, said the Airports Council International (ACI) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latest ACI survey were based on study
covering 32 major international airports considered most likely to
fly NLA, which, still in the stage of design, was assumed to have
a 80-meter wingspan and 80-meter length.
</P>
<P>
ACI Director General Oris Dunham Jr. said: "While these Super
Jumbos, capable of carrying 600-plus passengers, offer potential
improvements in terms of lower unit operation costs and increased
capacity for the airlines, they pose considerable challenges for
airports."
</P>
<P>
The survey found that airports would have to modify themselves
to accommodate the NLAs, the cost being averaged at 105 million
dollars per airport or 16 million dollars per NLA gate.
</P>
<P>
The modifications would include adaptations to the movement
areas -- runways, taxiways and aprons, changes to passenger
terminals -- new passenger boarding bridges, extra baggage claim
systems, etc., and revised operational facilities.
</P>
<P>
The three projects were estimated to cost an airport an average
of 62 million dollars, 37 million and 6 million respectively.
</P>
<P>
ACI survey showed that NLAs were also likely to lead to airport
capacity loss, which would result from increased ATC separations
between aircraft on takeoff and landing, operating restrictions on
taxiways and runways and loss of aircraft parking capacity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia's largest opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP) today officially
launched its 1996 election manifesto with a commitment to uphold
the rule of law and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the 57-page manifesto at a press conference here,
UNIP President Kenneth Kaunda said UNIP will face the challenges
of the future by addressing four major issues including
establishing a lasting foundation for plural politics,
reconstructing the economy to create equal opportunities for the
people, building an equatable social order and sustaining
environment.
</P>
<P>
Once voted into power in this year's general elections, UNIP
will ensure that there is complete separation of powers from the
legislature, judiciary and executive because their independence
has been eroded under the present government, Kaunda noted.
</P>
<P>
UNIP has also pledged to make the electoral commission an
autonomous and independent institution to ensure free and fair
elections since plural politics will be allowed to continue under
the new UNIP government, Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said his party will repeal the 1995 land act, claiming
that the present government has vested the traditional land of
the people into the hands of foreigners who under unip rule will
not be allowed to develop land without the authority of
traditional rulers.
</P>
<P>
UNIP will also reserve 33 percent of seats in parliament and
the government for women, he added.
</P>
<P>
UNIP, which ruled the nation for 27 years, was defeated in the
1991 general elections.

the Ethiopian central high court has heard the testimony of the
seventh witness agaisnt officials under the Menggistu regime and
decided to adjourn until June 11.
</P>
<P>
The court made the postponement after considering the request

</P>
<P>
The seventh witness of the prosecutor testified that a death

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force has ordered
the grounding of all its B-2 stealth bombers after discovering a
mechanical flaw in an routine inspection, an Air Force spokeswoman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Kathleen Cook told reporters that the fleet of 10
B-2s, all based at Whiteman Air Force Base, are being inspected,
and the Air Force is working with manufacturer Northrop Grunman to
find a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that inspectors found a broken clamp in the tailpipe
assembly in the routine inspection of a B-2 at Whiteman Base.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that the grounding of the B-2 fleet took effect
last Friday but it was not yet clear how long the fleet of
radar-evading bombers would be kept on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The B-2's first flight was in July 1989, and the first bomber
entered service at Whiteman in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force has ordered 20 B-2, the most expensive
warplane ever built at a cost of 2 billion U.S. dollars each.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG To Remain Neutral In Liberia's Renwed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The West African peacekeeping
forces, the ECOMOG, will remain neutral in Liberia's renewed
factional fightig, a military spokesman of Nigeria, which
contributed the Bulk of ECOMOG, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Fed Chijuka, Director of Nigeria's defense
information, said the ECOMOG was avoidig confrontation with any
of the factions involved in the conflict so that it would not be
branded partial.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated that the ECOMOG was currently on a
peacekeeping mission and had no mandate to enforce peace on the
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
During the latest round of factional fighting starting from
April 6, the ECOMOG was accused by some West African countries of
not doing enough to stop the manslaughter in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
But Chijuka said the Nigerian military had made enough
contributions to maintain the peace in Liberia which has been
torn apart by six years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG started its peacekeping mission in Liberia since
August, 1990, eight months after the war broke out in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently maintains 8,00 soldiers in the 10,500 strong
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military spokesman said so far the ECOMOG bases
in Liberia remained safe havens for the Liberan civilans and the
ECOMOG continued to be the most credible force that can
facilitate peace in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG is still working with the interim government of
Liberia, which was installed in August last year following the
signing of a peace accord in Nigeria's capital of Abuja.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Smith Meet on Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and Bosnia Implementation Force (IFOR) Commander
Leighton Smith held talks here today on important issues
concerning the implementation of the Bosnia peace accord,
especially its military aspect.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Serbian presidential office after the
talks said a positive assessment had been given to the results of
the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that cooperation in the implementation of the
peace agreement had helped stabilize peace in war-affected regions
in Bosnia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accords, 60,000-strong NATO-led multinational
peace implementation force, commanded under Smith, began to flood
into Bosnia since last December to secure the full compliance of
the peace agreement that officially ended the civil war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Both Milosevic and Admiral Smith said they expected progress to
be made also in the implementation of civilian and political
aspects of the peace agreement, which include economic
reconstruction and preparations for the coming general elections
in the whole country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Smith told reporters that the talks had
focused on the successful implementation of the Dayton agreement
and on some problems, primarily concerning the freedom of movement
in the whole country which comprises two entities -- the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The freedom of movement was quite possible in many places in
Bosnia but a greater degree of such freedom was just a hope at the
moment, the U.S. admiral said.
</P>
<P>
The peace accords stipulate that all Bosnian civilians have
right to move freely in the country but the reality at the moment
is difference. The former enemies have barred the other ethnic
groups to enter their own territories even for brief visits.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that IFOR had so far built or reconstructed over 50
bridges and repaired a number of roads across Bosnia, and four
airports in the country have already or will soon open for
traffic.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, things are moving on quite well," and he
was "particularly satisfied with the implementation of the
military part of the Bosnian peace agreement," Smith added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Pledges to Develop Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China attaches importance to the Arab League's role in
international and regional affairs and will continue to develop
the friendly ties with the league and its member states.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here while visiting the headquarters of
the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid greeted Jiang,
describing his visit to Egypt as "historic" and thanked China's
support to the Arab cause on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Since the Arab League opened its office in Beijing in 1993, its
relations with China have been strengthened, Abdul-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is seeking to push forward the Middle East
peace process and hopes to win more support from China in this
aspect, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Arab League, as an important regional political
organization in the world, is playing a positive role in
safeguarding the interests and solidarity of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It will play more important roles in international affairs if
the Arab countries consolidate their solidarity, the Chinese
president noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the current new international situation, Jiang said,
China and the Arab League hold identical or similar views on many
regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can further strengthen their coordination and
cooperation in international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to make joint efforts with the Arab League in
pushing forward the Middle East peace process, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"You can believe that China will always be a friend of the Arab
countries," Jiang told the Arab League chief.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Cairo on March 22, 1945, the Arab League aims to
promote cooperation, coordinate the political activities among its
member states and safeguard the independence and sovereignty of
the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Among those accompanying Jiang on the visit to the Arab League
headquarters were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong, Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi and Chinese Ambassador to
Egypt Yang Fuchang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also viewed the Egyptian Museum, the Pyramids in Giza,
the Sun Boat Museum and the Sphinx here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chines president arrived in Cairo Monday on a five-day
state visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the third leg of his six-nation African tour which
has already taken him to Kenya and Ethiopia. He will also visit
Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Allows Liberian Refugee Ship To Dock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ghana finally allowed the Nigerian
cargo ship Bulk Challenge crowded with thousands of Liberian
refugees to dock at its harbor, Ghanian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammed Ibn Chambas said today.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Ghana quoted him as saying that the Ghanian
government changed its stance after the United Nations and the
European Union promised to give aid to his country.
</P>
<P>
"We have recalled the vessel back because of assurances of
assistance from the U.N. and the EU to enable Ghana to take care
of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The dilapidated old freighter, packed with around four
thousands of Liberian refugees, has been stranded off the West
African coast for over a week with its human cargo braving
unsanitary conditions, as several ports turned it away.
</P>
<P>
So far one woman and three men have died from disease aboard
the ship due to unhealthy conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, Liberians prefer the risk of exile at sea to the
danger of living in the war-torn capital of their country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said of the two other refugee ships that have
left Monrovia, capital of Liberia, one Nigerian registered vessel
called Victory Reefer obtained permission to dock at Freetown's
harbor of Queen Elizabeth of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"More refugees are coming from Monrovia as the fighting hanged
on in Monrovia," said a Ghanian official.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ghanian authorities had met earlier today to
decide what to do with the 4,000 Liberian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the EU later promised to provide Ghana with all
the expenditure to aid the refugees, including medical and other
humanitarian assistances.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM on US Reservation about Establishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that the reported U.S. reservation on the establishment
of a Palestinian state is not a subject to be raised for
discussion now.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. Administration has not expressed its
objection to the establishment of a Palestinian state despite the
fact that there have been certain opposition voices, noting that
it cannot be said that there is U.S. reservation "as the issue is
not raised for discussion now."
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks when he was asked by reporters about
the reported diplomatic contacts between Cairo and Washington to
ensure that the United States would not object to the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the issue of guardianship over Jerusalem had been
raised during the just-concluded tripartite Egyptian-Jordanian-
Palestinian summit, Moussa said the issue of Jerusalem was tabled
for discussion during the final phase of Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations which started on May 5. But the ad hoc
Palestinian-Israeli committees which will discuss various items in
detail have not been formed yet.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Minister said these committees would be
formed after the Israeli general elections on May 29, adding that
these issues were not under consideration at present.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the time was opportune for Arab coordination
among the countries concerned with the peace process, known as the
ring states, namely, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon,
Moussa said, "the time is always opportune for Arab coordination,
an example of which has been the tripartite Egyptian-Jordanian-
Palestinian summit held in cairo Sunday, which is a form of Arab
coordination."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Heads for Political Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The ruling by Turkey's Constitution
Court to annul the March 12 confidence vote for the center-right
coalition government has shocked the political arena with the only
exception of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) which called for
the resignation of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The court today upheld an appeal by the RP which argued that
the confidence vote in March was against the procedure code of the
parliament which requires an absolute majority of those who
attended the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The government set up by the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the
True Path Party (DYP) won by 257-207 votes with 80 abstention,
thus failed to gained an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court also annulled two motions approved by the
parliament, the extensions of emergency rule in southeastern
Turkey and the mandate of Operation Provide Comfort, the U.S.-led
air force that patrols northern Iraq from a base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, the court said it will not scrap the decisions since
the ruling is not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
The RP leader Necmettin Erbakan held a press conference
immediately after the court decision and asked Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz to resign.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said Yilmaz should return the mandate of forming
government at once and let RP, the biggest party in the
parliament, to set up a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
The RP appeared at the top of last December's general election
but failed to find a coalition partner after all the left or
right-ring parties boycotted the pro-islamic party.
</P>
<P>
The situation forced ANAP and DYP, two center-right rival
parties, to come together and formed a two-party coalition on
March with Democratic Left Party (DSP)'s support from outside the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The 70-day-experiment (by the coalition) is not successful,"
claimed Erbakan. "Such a forced wedding has brought no good
services to Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who flied back to Ankara this evening from his
hometown Rize, told reporters at the airport that his government
was still on duty.
</P>
<P>
He added that he could make no more comment on the decision of
the Constitutional Court until the reasons behind the ruling are
published in detail in the official gazette.
</P>
<P>
Bulent Ecevit, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (DSP),
who played a key role in securing the confidence vote in March by
abstaining with all his deputies, said, "It is up to the
government whether to renew the confidence vote or not".
</P>
<P>
"If the government wants to renew the procedure regarding the
vote of confidence to prevent any political crisis, we think it
is not necessary to start from the very beginning -- referring to
president's giving first mandate to the leader of the biggest
party in parliament for government formation attempt -- a voting is
enough," said Ecevit,
</P>
<P>
Observers believe following the supreme court's decision, the
government may continue to serve on paper but it now has a moral
obligation to legalize itself by seeking a new vote of confidence
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Although the Constitution Court ruled that its decisions would
not be retroactive, that does not mean the government can just
rule as it did in the past 70 days, they said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the political situation was no longer the same as it
was 70 days ago. Disputes between the two coalition partners have
surfaced, especially after ANAP deputies backed a RP motion to
investigate DYP leader and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller over
corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
Now all political parties are seeking an answer to the same
question -- what should be done next following the decision of the
Constitution Court ?

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has to put out a
macroeconomic package to show the world its capabilities, Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel said today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
In a snap debate on the fall of the country's currency Rand
and its implications on its economy, the South African minister
said: "We have our finger on the pulse. We are more confident we
will deliver on what we promised."
</P>
<P>
Currency fluctuations are not unique to South Africa, but the
shocks are felt more locally "because we have a much thinner
market", said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business sectors argue repeatedly that the
Rand was overvalued until February this year, and many
industrialist complained of being squeezed out of the export
markets.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Manuel said exporters now has to take account
of the devalued Rand before they asked for the reinstatement of
the general export incentive schemem at earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Rand's depreciation offered a window of
opportunities for exports, added the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Rand dropped from 3.65 against the dollar in mid-February to
4.58 in early this month.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that speculations on the possible lifting of
the exchange control and recent political situation contributed
to the dramatic fall of the Rand.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production shot
up 0.9 percent in April, rebounding from a big loss in March, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebound was larger than analysts had expected. Many had
predicted output would bounce back only about 0.5 percent. But the
Fed said that excluding motor vehicles, output at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The advance was the second in three months. After jumping 1.2
percent in February, U.S. industrial production fell by 0.5
percent in March, caused by an 18-day strike in General Motors
assembly plants which resulted in a 14 percent plunge of motor
production.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Issues Statement Opposing US Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation issued a statement here tonight concerning
the US announcement of sanctions against China. The full text of
the statement is as follows.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, the United States Trade Representative Office
unilaterally announced the imposition of trade sanctions on
Chinese exports to the United States, such as textiles, garments
and electronic products, with a total value of three billion
U.S. dollars. The tariff rates for these products will be raised
to 100 percent and the sanctions will be effective 30 days later.
</P>
<P>
By making such a decision, the United States government has
shown total disregard of the overall interests of Sino-US
relations and the fundamental interests of the peoples in both
countries, as well as the series of effective efforts that China
has made for the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR)
and the enormous progress China has made in this area. Such a
decision has seriously damaged the Sino-US relations and
undermined the cooperation between the two countries in the area
of IPR protection. We hereby wish to express our strong
indignation and utmost dissatisfaction over the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
IPR protection, which is fully in line with China's basic state
policy of "invigorating the nation by developing science and
education". Protection of intellectual property rights is not
only for the benefit of China's scientific and technological
progress and economic development, but is also out of the need of
China's economic and technical cooperation with the rest of the
world. China made an enormous amount of highly effective efforts
in the past decade and more. As as result, China has established
a fairly complete legal system for IPR protection and has
completed legislations which took some developed countries tens or
even hundreds of years to accomplish. China has made unremitting
efforts to deter and fight IPR infringing activities, and the
achievements made in this area have been acknowledged by the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
Since China and the United States signed the Agreement on the
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights last year, the Chinese
government has enacted a series of rules and regulations,
including the Regulations of the Customs of the People's Republic
of China on Border Enforcement of IPR Protection, and has
established special IPR enforcement task forces to resolutely crack
down on infringing and piracy activities on a nationwide basis,
especially sources of the infringing and pirated products.
Efforts have been made to sort out the order of the markets for
audio-visual products and computer software, and factories engaged
in the production of infringing and pirated products have been
closed down. All these efforts have demonstrated the
determination of the Chinese government on IPR protection,
representing the concrete, serious actions the Chinese side has
taken for the implementation of the Sino-US Agreement.  The
United States, quite on the contrary, appears to lack sincerity
in implementing the Agreement. Not only did it fail to honor its
obligations as committed to the Chinese side, but also made
unwarranted accusations against China's IPR protection efforts in
disregard of the facts. Furthermore, the United States has
unilaterally set numerical targets and time frames to request
China to close down all CD reproduction factories, and it has
gone so far as to request China to allow the establishment of
Sino-US joint venture enterprises making audio-visual programs, in
an attempt to break into the Chinese cultural market and penetrate
into China's ideological sphere. These demands go far beyond the
scope of IPR protection, let alone the framework of the
Agreement. China will never accept such a high-handed, selfish
act, gaining advantage at the expense of the others.
</P>
<P>
For safeguarding the state sovereignty and state interests, and
in line with provisions of the Foreign Trade Law of the People's
Republic of China, we have no other alternatives but to take
counter-retaliatory actions in the face of American trade
retaliatory measures. The US side shall be held responsible for
all the consequences arising herefrom.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and developing the normal relationship as well as
the economic and trade cooperation between China and the United
States is in the fundamental interests of the two countries. The
differences between the two sides in the area of intellectual
property rights can only be resolved through consultation on an
equal footing rather than through the display of power politics as
exertion of pressure and threat of retaliation. Confrontation
will lead us nowhere. We would like to strongly request that the
government of the United States correct its erroneous decision on
the issue of intellectual property rights and remedy the damage
inflicted on the relationship between China and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Solve Dispute with FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece, responding to the ban from
international soccer by the International Football Federation
(FIFA) on Monday, said Wednesday it would take prompt action to
make its soccer association meet FIFA requirements.
</P>
<P>
"The issue will be soon settled so that Greek soccer can
return to international play," government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials also said sports under-secretary Andreas
Fouras would submit a bill to the parliament next week to
accelerate the approval of the new statutes of the Greek Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the association, FIFA announced Monday that
neither Greek clubs nor the national team could compete
internationally.
</P>
<P>
The country also could not be involved in any cross-border
transfers, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said in Zurich on Wednesday
that the suspension was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said it should not be interpreted as a punishment to the
Greek soccer body as it appeared "the only way to help it achieve
what it desires".
</P>
<P>
The Greek Football Association revised its statutes in November
1994 and submitted them to parliament for approval, but up to date
failed to have them passed.
</P>
<P>
According to FIFA regulations, national associations must have
valid statutes in order to be members of the international soccer
body.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Rules Out Quebec's Unilateral Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking
province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority
of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying that the laws of Canada must be respected, that
there won't be a unilateral declaration of independence and that
international law must also be respected," Chretien told the House
of Commons Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were among the most aggressive and explicit
Chretien has made on how the federal government intends to deal
with a third independence referendum in Quebec, according to
today's Globe and Mail newspaper. They also signal a tougher
approach toward Quebec separatists following their near-victory in
the most recent referendum on October 30, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the
separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the
legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is arguing that a referendum is a
"consultation", not the first legal step out of the
confederation. It also maintains that Canada's constitution would
have to be amended to allow Quebec to secede, which would require
the consent of all other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois,
lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the
democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is creating a climate of "confrontation" similar to
that of 1981 and 1982, when the constitution was amended against
Quebec's wishes, Gauthier warned.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Bans Smoking in Public Places (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Guihua failed to find a single
smoker to fine in a big Beijing department store, even though she
searched among the bustle of shoppers for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Sun was happy about her work anyway, saying: "It shows that
almost all people know about the regulation and observe it."
</P>
<P>
The regulation she was referring to, which took effect today,
bans smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
To enforce it and to fine offenders, a small army of more than
80,000 people like Sun was sent to department stores, hospitals,
schools, railway stations, and other public places.
</P>
<P>
The air in packed waiting rooms at the Beijing Railway Station
used to be filled with smoke, but now look cleaner and smell
better.
</P>
<P>
"I have to go outside to take a cigarette because of the 'no
smoking' signs everywhere," a traveller waiting for his train
said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
That sign and others have been placed in easy-to-see locations
on major streets, in busy shopping areas, and in public places
around the city, for several months.
</P>
<P>
There were even people handing out millions of pamphlets on the
street to make people aware of the adverse effects of smoking and
advising them to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved because I will no longer be surrounded by
clouds of cigarette smoke in offices and meeting rooms," said a
passer-by who stopped at one information site on Chang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
A government office worker was another beneficiary of the
massive anti-smoking drive: "I don't need to clean ash trays full
of cigarette butts from now on, because nobody will use them
anymore," she remarked while cleaning up a meeting room.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of smoking less and trying to quit," Tian Yong,
vice president of the Beijing No. 4 Middle School and a veteran of
26 years of smoking, told Xinhua. He said he thinks stopping
teachers from smoking at school is vital to providing a healthy
example for students.

Announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation
</P>
<P>
(List of Trade Counter-Retaliations of the People's Republic of
China Against the United States of America)
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact, disregarding the tremendous efforts made
by China in the field of intellectual property rights protection
and the whole array of effective measures that China has adopted
to protect intellectual property rights, the United States Trade
Representative Office has unilaterally announced the imposition of
trade retaliations on China's export products to the United States
such as textiles, garments and electronic products valued at three
billion US dollars, effective 30 days later. Article 7 of the
Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates
that should any country or region apply discriminatory
prohibitions, restrictions or other similar measures in the field
of trade against the People's Republic of China, the People's
Republic of China may, dependent upon the actual circumstances,
adopt corresponding measures against that country or region. In
compliance with this provision, with a view to safeguarding state
sovereignty and national dignity, China shall have no other

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A South African national was arrested
on the Greek-Turkish border today with 4.7 kilos of heroin, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities at the Kipi border crossing said 54-year-
old Dennis Young, a business consultant from Johannesburg, had
the heroin stashed in his suitcase when arrested on board a bus on
the Istanbul-Athens route.
</P>
<P>
Police also found a forged British passport in his possession
under the name Andy Martin, which police believe was supplied to
him by a Narcotics cartel in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Young confessed that he was acting as a
''go-between'' and was supposed to deliver the heroin to an
Italian merchant in Rome ''in exchange for a sizable fee''.
</P>
<P>
Kipi customs officer Stavros Tzioras said the South African was
believed to be a drug dealer ''with international connections'',
and that his passport showed frequent visits, mainly by airline,
to cities in the United States, Africa, Asia, Europe and
Austrilia.

<HEADLINE> GM to Produce Cheaper Cars for Asia-Pacific Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- US car giant General Motors Corp.
(GM) plans to produce people's cars for the Asia-Pacific market at
a cheaper price of 5,000 to 6,000 US dollars per unit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Detroit-based car maker, the engine
displacement of the people's car will be less than 1,000 cubic
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Board of Investments said today that assembly
of the people's car here is open to all new car entrants with a
minimum investment requirement of only 10 million pesos (400,000
US dollars) for parts manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that the people's car for local supply is
no longer viable because of the already existing people's car
assemblers competing for the small market.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Thailand are wooing a proposed one billion
US dollars GM car manufacturing facility.
</P>
<P>
The GM plans to produce 100,000 units or 120,000 units of cars
annually in the new plant, with 80 percent of the production for
exports to the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The project is in line with the company's policy to capture a
10 percent market share in the region by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Greece Not to Let Press Tour Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ankara today warned Athens not to
let European Union (EU) journalists tour the disputed Aegean islet
of Kardak, or Imia, adding that it would take measures to counter
the Greek "provocation."
</P>
<P>
The Greek government is reportedly organizing a tour for
journalists from EU countries based in Athens to the disputed
islet of Kardak on Saturday and Sunday, which Ankara regards as a
new provocative act.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with such a new provocation, Turkey will take necessary
countermeasures within the framework of its legitimate rights and
interests," Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan
told a weekly press conference here.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not reveal what measures Ankara would
take.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan added that Greek Ambassador to Ankara Dimitrios
Nezeritis had been summoned to the Foreign Ministry earlier today
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, narrowly escaped from a
military conflict over the disputed islet of Kardak in January
with the last-minute intervention by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Greece has vowed to veto all EU aids to Turkey until Ankara
gives up its claim over the islet.

<HEADLINE> HK Credit Card Industry Willing to Offer Good Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The credit card arm of the Bank
of China Group (BOC) said it would compete to bring clients more
convenience rather than merely slash price, as American Express --
the world third largest card issuer -- recently did in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
American Express launched its credit card in Hong Kong at the
end of April, offering an annual interest rate of 18 percent --
the lowest among the prevailing rates of between 24 and 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
W. O. Yang, deputy general manager of the BOC Credit Card
(International) Ltd. told Xinhua that his company would not follow
suit as the new issue has little effect on its business.
</P>
<P>
Interest charges on outstanding customer debt make up a small
proportion of the company's revenue since 60 percent of its
clients make full payment at the end of each month, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The company issues approximately 400,000 MasterCard and VISA
cards, accounting for 9 percent of the total on the Hong Kong
market, according to Yang. It acts as the agent of 18 banks,
including 13 members of the BOC Group, and four other banks in
Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Many other credit card issuers in Hong Kong do not pin much of
their revenue on interest charges. So far none of them toe the
line after American Express to reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Competitions are keen among banks and credit card companies,
which are all trying to expand their market shares. Among various
choices, Yang said that credit card holders prefer to get their
money's worth rather than lower price accompanied with
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
The BOC Group company is not alone in offering consumers such
services as ticket booking on telephone and around-the-clock
global emergency service for travelers. Thanks to BOC's nationwide
network on the mainland, the company gains an upper hand in
providing services to clients who travel to China.
</P>
<P>
Yang saw a robust prospect for the local card industry, as Hong
Kong people turn more and more to credit cards from the
traditional payment instrument -- cash.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the foreseeable future, credit cards would
be used for big payment while smart cards, known as "electronic
purse," for small amount of money. Currently, the BOC Group Credit
Card Ltd is drawing a plan to produce a new card to combine the
functions of both credit and smart card.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Dismisses Moderate Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic has dismissed his Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic, local
radio reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a statement from Karadzic's office as saying
that Kasagic's willingness to cooperate with Carl Bildt, high
representative of the international community, threatened the
"vital interests" of the Serb Republic within Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the prime minister was removed to
"prevent any further worsening of the crisis in the government's
work".
</P>
<P>
Kasagic committed himself to full implementation of the Dayton
peace accord when Bildt toured Banja Luka last week and has since
been regarded as a moderate alternative to hardliners in the
Bosnian Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
Bildt was quoted by the radio reports as saying that he was
disappointed by the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Three deputy prime ministers will run the government until
Karadzic names a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Karadzic prevented Kasagic from attending a
conference in Brussels of donor countries which will help to pay
for the reconstruction of Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> China to End "Silk Wars" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to end a
notorious cocoon war that has torn the country's silk industry
apart.
</P>
<P>
A national silk and cocoon corporation will be established and
play the role as a top controller of the country's silk industry.
</P>
<P>
The country is to carry out a comprehensive reform program in
its debt-ridden silk business, aiming at halting the decrease in
exports and heavy shortage of cocoons for large silk mills.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on cocoon and silk production
today, Yu Xiaosong, vice-minister of State Economics and Trade
Commission, said that through the reform, China will establish a
unified management system to adjust silk production as an
independent business, instead of several parts belonging to
different industries.
</P>
<P>
The proposed corporation will specialize in arranging silkworm
egg raising, cocoon purchasing and silk production, as well as
promoting silk exports.
</P>
<P>
China's silk cocoons were once solely managed by China Silk
Imports and Exports Company. But the monopoly was broken in 1988
when a price war broke out all over the country, and cocoon
resources were quickly eaten away by the mushrooming local silk
mills in the following years.
</P>
<P>
A chaotic price war directly led to a hike in
production costs and decline in product quality, according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the central government will launch a
rectification drive among silk realing mills in the countryside,
which took away most of the raw materials from larger plants, and
caused a shutdown of hundreds of state-owned mills in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The overnight mushrooming of small reeling mills in the 1990s
resulted in a surplus of production capacity. To meet the
country's silk reeling capacity, there should an output of 950,000
tons of fresh cocoons every year, 270,000 tons higher than the
current 680,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that small-sized and technically backward reeling mills
will be shut down or merged with other companies in the near
future, and the licensing of silk reeling factories will be under
tight control.
</P>
<P>
The reform will also include issuing regulations for silk
cocoon trade, expanding the involvement of central government in
cocoon price control, and strengthening the construction of
semicultural institutes and silkworm raising bases.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's cocoon purchase still faces a gloomy
year.
</P>
<P>
A national silk market adjustment system will be brought into
operation to lower the market risk as much as possible. The
system will consist of a risk fund for cocoon purchase and cocoon
reserves of the state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The two-tie cocoon reserves aimed at getting rid of price
fluctuations will maintain the balance between demand and supply,
Yu said.

CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
here today with Jacques Andreatti, personal envoy of French
President Jacques Chirac, who briefed him on France's views and
intentions vis-a-vis the forthcoming Group of Seven summit.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, the French envoy told reporters that he
was commissioned by Chirac to brief Mubarak on the agenda of the
G-7 summit to be held in Lyon next month under the presidency of
France, and to acquaint himself with the Egyptian president's
views on a number of international economic problems, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the first time France, as a country
chairing the G-7 summit, takes an initiative such as dispatching
envoys to countries outside the G-7 to get acquainted with their
viewpoints before the convening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
France believes that the big industrialized nations should take
into consideration the views of other countries toward economic
problems, the French envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among the countries
whose viewpoints will be considered.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether France would submit to the summit a report
voicing views of countries outside the group on international
economic issues, he said that the current initiative made by
France is purely a French one and that it does not concern the
other G-7 member states.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether he discussed with Mubarak a
wider French role in the Middle East peace process, the envoy said
that the issue was not tackled at today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Teachers Union Condemns Child Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Teachers Union (ZITU)
today expressed concern at the increase in the number of teachers
who rape school girls, saying it is necessary to formulate a
national code of conduct and ethics.
</P>
<P>
ZITU National Chairman Felix Mafa said his union condemned the
unprofessional conduct by teachers who took advantage of their
innocent pupils who needed their protection and care.
</P>
<P>
There have been quite a number of cases and allegations of
rape against teachers and headmasters reported in the media and
among the most serious ones was one where a headmaster from
Mvurwi in Mashonaland Central Province, was sentenced to a
jail-term of over 100 years for raping 23 girls.
</P>
<P>
''ZITU, on behalf of teachers, is not amused by the tendency
of some teachers in Zimbabwe of abusing school children sexually.
We deplore this inhuman tendency in the strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
''We would like to urge the ministry and unions to have a
concerted effort in organizing seminars to re-conscientize
teachers on their noble duty and to make them understand that a
girl child needs to be protected at all costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers feel very ashamed of this inhuman abuse of children
in such a manner which is very barbaric,'' Mafa added.

<HEADLINE> China Agrees to UN's Maritime Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China decided at a meeting today to
abide by the UN's Maritime Convention.
</P>
<P>
In doing so it will increase the sea area under its
jurisdiction to about three million sq km, from 370,000 sq km, and
have its rights to territorial waters and continental shelves
recognized under international law.
</P>
<P>
The convention took effect in 1994 as the most comprehensive
international law of the sea. China is the 87th country to adopt
it.
</P>
<P>
It sets the 200 nautical mile limit, giving a sovereign nation
the right to explore, develop, preserve, and manage natural
resources in the exclusive economic zone.
</P>
<P>
It also allows nations to establish a 12 sea mile territorial
sea and contiguous zone, which makes clear of China's sovereign
right over its territorial sea and continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
According to the convention, international seabeds and natural
resources there are common assets of people all over the world and
should be administered by the International Seabed Management
Bureau. China registered as an investor to develop a sea zone of
150,000 sq km in the northeastern Pacific in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The move also helps China better develop and manage the sea.
China boasts six million ha of shallow sea area along its
coastline, and less than one percent of the area exploited.
</P>
<P>
"China will establish and perfect its laws more quickly in
accordance with the convention," said Zhang Dengyi, director of
the National Oceanographic Bureau, noting that China should
improve management of the sea, establishing a system and training
professionals.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Expands Demining Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has removed mines from
27,000 hectares of land in the past two and a half years, saving
55,700 people from being disabled, the Cambodian Mine Action
Center (CMAC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Mine clearance operations starting November 1993 have destroyed
55,700 anti-personnel mines, 375 anti-tank mines and 362,245 other
explosive devices, said CMAC Director Sam Sotha.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at an inauguration ceremony for a demining unit
in Kompong Thom, one of Cambodia's most heavily-mined provinces
where demining work has been delayed by poor roads and the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
There are estimated to be 8 to 10 million mines in Cambodia, and
every month around 300 people are killed or maimed by
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
The CMAC is now seeking to expand its demining operation which
was established by the United Nations' Transitional Authority in
Cambodia in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sam Sotha listed four priorities of demining: to clear land
for the resettlement of refugees and displaced people; to clear
land for farming; to clear land in or near towns or public
buildings such as schools, hospitals and water wells, and
clearance of land for the development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The demining operation in Kompong Thom is supported by funds
from the European Community which has donated 2.5 million
U.S. dollars for demining since late 1995, said CMAC Chairman Ieng
Mouly.

<HEADLINE> Four Countries Not to Reduce Their Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia, China, Jordan and Germany
have decided not to implement the U.N. Security Council Resolution
1054 which imposed diplomatic sanctions on Sudan, a high-ranking
Sudanese official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's non-governmental newspaper Akhbar el-Yom today quoted
him as saying that the four countries have informed Khartoum that
they will not reduce the size of their diplomatic missions in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued resolution 1054 imposing
diplomatic sanctions on Sudan after it failed to come up with
three Moslem extremists wanted in connection with an attempt to
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on June 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, which calls on countries to "significantly
reduce the number and the level of the staff at Sudanese
diplomatic missions" and restrict diplomats' movement, went into
effect last Friday as the African nation tried to rally support
against them.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions could be toughened after 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Germany made it clear that it would not
reduce its diplomatic mission in Sudan, and that entry visas to
Germany would be tackled individually.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has so far got no reaction from Britain, Egypt and
Ethiopia in connection with the U.N. resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Syria's ambassador in Khartoum Mohamed
el-Mahmaid also said his country will not implement the

<HEADLINE> HK Foreign Exchange Fund Yields Good Returns in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Foreign Exchange
Fund saw its accumulated surplus gain a record increase last year,
says the 1995 Annual Report released today by the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA), which plays the role of central bank in
the territory.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange Fund is a significant asset for the people of Hong
Kong, which stood at 461 billion HK dollars (59.1 billion US
dollars) at the end of 1995 or 73,100 HK dollars (about 9,400 US
dollars) per person in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the accumulated surplus of the Fund rose
by 34.3 billion HK dollars in 1995, the biggest increase in a
single year throughout the history of the Fund.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA said :"The year of 1995
was exceptionally good for bonds of all maturities, with overall
total returns the third highest since the Second World War. The
Hong Kong Exchange Fund shared fully in this benign and favorable
environment,"
</P>
<P>
He also announced today that the foreign currency assets of the
Exchange Fund reached 59.84 billion US dollars at the end of
March this year, posting a 4.7-percent increase from the end of
December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the returns in 1996 is unlikely to
match the good performance of the Fund in the previous year due to
uncertainty about interest rate movements and the prospect of a
stronger US dollar.

<HEADLINE> Eight-Point Way to Escape Poverty By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to meet its goal
of ending poverty among its remaining 65 million poor people by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the world's most populated country starting the
21st century by waving goodbye to poverty, experts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They say that the basic needs of the remaining poverty-stricken
people have to be met through upgrading agriculture and
developing the country's food industry.
</P>
<P>
That forms the first point in an eight-point way experts have
suggested to help erase China's poverty problems by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More money needs to be spent on agriculture to help farmers
have better farming conditions in poverty-stricken regions, say
leading experts.
</P>
<P>
Target areas for help is vast stretches of farmland mostly
located in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the Chinese Academy of Social Science (ASS)
and the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said in an interview that
they have written an eight-point prescription to enable China to
meet its vow to sweep out poverty among its population by 2000.
</P>
<P>
China has 65 million people with annual incomes less than 530
yuan (64 US dollars). Those people - ranked by the government in
1995 as "definitely poor" - account for 7.1 percent of the
country's total rural population.
</P>
<P>
China has to face an annual task of helping at least 13 million
to escape poverty to meet its target for the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The central government launched a campaign in 1994 to help
poverty-stricken people, aiming to increase their annual income
from 300 to 500 yuan (according to 1990's fixed price), an annual
growth of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rich in natural and mineral resources, the regions should be
given aid to make full use of the resources to develop mineral,
architectural, food processing and service industries, one expert
from the ASS says, ranking it as one of the eight points in the
"poverty escape" plan.
</P>
<P>
This would also increase employment in the regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The experts also want to encourage people leave the poorer
regions and work in the economically-thriving ones, both to earn
good livings and learn new working skills.
</P>
<P>
It will help the poor regions to develop their own industries
when these workers return home, one expert says.
</P>
<P>
Other points listed suggest that poor regions develop science
and technology, build infrastructure, use aid-poverty funding more
efficiently, advocate family-planning and establish a watchdog-net
for aid-poverty work.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the ASS says there are favorable conditions for
achieving the great target of eliminating poverty by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
He has urged the local authorities to exert efforts, including
allocating money, in solving poverty problems. Funds from the rest
of society should also circulate to the poor regions.
</P>
<P>
Another expert harmonied his colleague, suggesting the central
government needs to put more money into the poor regions. It
should also establish a strict watchdog net to ensure that the aid
is used efficiently.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Shuts Ports To Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) - While Ghana decided to accept some
3,000 Liberian refugees on board of the Bulk Challenge vessel,
the Nigerian authorities yesterday directed that the ill-fated
ship carrying Liberian refugees should not be allowed into the
nation's territorial waters, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a confirmation from the defence authorities
as saying that the decision to bar the ship from entering the
Nigeran waters was to avoid possible influx of refugees into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, a 24-hour surveillance has been mounted for the
vessel, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
At a news brefig yesterday, Director of Defence Information
Fred Chijuka said that the decision was made by the federal
government and that it was aimed at averting a repeat of the 1990
refugee problem in which refugees from war-torn liberaia were
discharged and abandoned at Nigerian ports for months.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, still unclear if there are Nigerians on board
the embattled ship, but sources said yesterday that concerned
maritime operators had initiated a lobby on the government to
ensure that the ship will be rescued and the Nigerians on board
be safely discharged.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, which had earlier rejected the refugee ship, decided
yesterday to allow more than 3,000 desperate Liberian refugees to
disembark from the crippled Nigerian ship Bulk Challenge at the
assurances of assistance fom the United Nations and the European
Union to enable the country to take care of them, according to
local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Sugar Output Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, China's largest sugar producer, turned out 2.3 million
tons of sugar in the 1995-1996 production period, setting a
historical record.
</P>
<P>
Located in the country's subtropical area with a mild climate
and sufficient sunshine, Guangxi is an ideal place for growing
sugarcane. Its sugar output makes up one third of the national
total.
</P>
<P>
The area sown to sugarcane in Guangxi has expanded from 111,700
ha in 1980 to last year's 424,000 ha. Sugar output soared to 20.4
million tons in 1995, said a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the rising sugarcane output, Guangxi has built 36
new refineries and expanded 60 existing ones, bringing the total
number of refineries in operation to 105. These plants have a
combined daily production capacity of 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to a local development plan, the annual sugar output
in Guangxi will reach three million tons by the end of this
century.

<HEADLINE> Varity Perkins to Set up 150 Sales Outlets in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The US engine company Varity
Perkins is to set up 150 sales outlets in all major Chinese cities
by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The company wants to beef up its muscle in China.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 20 sales outlets are planned to open this
year, said Jimmy Shen, the company's Asia Pacific Vice-President,
who is now attending an engines show in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the company will also open its first China
office in Beijing in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Varity Perkins sold 2.4 Billion US
dollar-worth of engines last year, adding that one-tenth were to
the Asia Pacific region. He estimates the ratio will rise to 40
percent by the end of the century, with China leading the region's
demand.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Varity Perkins signed a ten-year agreement with the
Tianjin Engine Works for the production of its four and six
cylinder diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that his company is now exploring with the Tianjin
factory the feasibility of developing the technology transfer
agreement into the establishment of a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint venture is expected to be set up by the
end of this year, and it will be its first joint venture in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China will turn out 18 million internal
combustion engines, 400 million kw worth, in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics
Industry said that international cooperation is playing a
significant role in the development of the domestic internal
combustion industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that, over the past two years, a number of advanced
products, using imported technology, have been mass produced and
many contracts have been signed for international cooperation
projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 alone, China signed 20 product and technology
introduction agreements and another 60 for importing processing
and testing equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 140 companies from both China and abroad
participating in the "Engine China '96" event.

<HEADLINE> TCM to Enter World Market with Help of Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientifically-based treatments
will open the world market wider to traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM), a national conference in Beijing was told today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, director of the State Bureau of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (SBTCM) told the conference on TCM that the SBTCM
plans to choose five prescriptions of Chinese traditional medicine
with good curative effects, which can meet the demands of the
world market. The aim is to develop them within the next five
years to meet world criteria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bureau will conduct a quality standard study
of 80 kinds of commonly-used TCM in a bid to build up a
world-recognized standards system for traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traditional medicine has become more popular in world
markets in recent years due to few side-effects. But China's
export volume of TCM is only about 500 million US dollars a year,
a very small share in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion enjoy a legal
status in medical treatment in many developed countries due to
efforts by Chinese scientist. They have also explained why
acupuncture can kill pain, with extensive publicity helping make
acupuncture popular in the world.

<HEADLINE> Injured Suspect Identified as HK's Most Wanted Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A man injured in a pre-dawn
street shoot-out with police here Monday has been identified as
Hong Kong's most wanted man, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Police said that fingerprinting has confirmed the identity of
Yip Kai-foon, 31, who is now in Queen Mary Hospital for bullet
wounds, was believed to have run out of money and may have been
planning raids on banks or jewelry shops with powerful weapons and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
Security at the hospital's custodial ward was immediately
stepped up with deployment of armed officers wearing bullet-proof
vests.
</P>
<P>
Yip, known in the underworld as "Goosehead", escaped from the
same hospital in 1989 during a visit while serving an 18-year
prison term for firearms offenses.
</P>
<P>
It is also feared that fellow gangsters could either spring him
out or have him killed before he talks to police.
</P>
<P>
A reward of one million HK dollars (128,534 US dollars) had
been posted for the successful capture of Yip, who is believed to
be involved in a series of violent and spectacular armed jewelry
robberies in 1991 and 1992. In two of the raids, more than 100
shots were fired at police from AK-47 assault rifles by robbers
who got away with valuable goods worth of millions of HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Police are still hunting five others who were believed to have
come to Hong Kong with Yip by speedboat. The suspects fled during
the 4:30 a.m. shoot-out Monday in Western.
</P>
<P>
Yip, who was shot in armpit and stomach, was in a fair
condition last night.
</P>
<P>
A bag containing 1.8 kilograms of military explosives, two
holsters and a Russian-made 7.62 automatic machine-gun loaded with
12 rounds of ammunition was left at the shoot-out scene.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's media has given a wide coverage of the shoot-out
and its further development these days, with front-page stories on
most newspapers today for the identification of the injured
suspect.

<HEADLINE> International Observers Begin Patrol In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian members of
International Temporary Presence in Hebron (TIPH) began patrols in
the streets of Hebron at 6:00 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The observers' vehicles moved around the city except downtown,
where the Jewish settlements are situated, because the Israeli
authorities did not yet specify the locations where the observers
could be near these settlements although these areas are the most
tense and high-friction areas between Palestinians and Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the observers met with the Israeli military
officers in Hebron, who gave the observers city maps demarcating
the streets and places where they could patrol. Meanwhile, the
settlers in the city have filled the city with graffiti welcoming
the Norwegians to Hebron "as tourists but not observers."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Godal and discussed
observers' role and status in Hebron. Godal also traveled to
Hebron and met with the Palestinian Mayor of Hebron, Mustafa
Natshe.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents welcomed the Norwegians although they are
sure that their role will be very limited as it was after the 1994
Hebron Massacre, when TIPH was not able to alter the harsh
conditions and sufferings of the Palestinian citizens,
particularly those living downtown.
</P>
<P>
As many as 200 men and women may participate in the
TIPH from contingents being considered from Sweden, Denmark,
Italy, Turkey and Australia.

<HEADLINE> China not to Devalue Yuan to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency, the yuan,
will continue to be relatively stable throughout the year, a
spokesman of the State Administration of Exchange Control said in
Beijing today, warning exporters not to expect a cheaper yuan to
boost their business.
</P>
<P>
A devaluation of the yuan will not happen, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for a balance in foreign exchange supply and
demand are generally good and therefore the exchange rate of the
yuan will remain relatively stable," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, though China recorded a foreign trade deficit of
1.15 billion US dollars in the first four months of this year, the
fundamentals of the foreign exchange market have not changed, as
reflected by a basically stable yuan.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as equipment imports by foreign-funded
ventures have been paid for in the form of capital investment or
in kind, a trade deficit in the first quarter has not left a big
impact on the overall balance of foreign exchange supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
When imports of this sort are not calculated, China's foreign
trade balance in the first three months should be a favorable 3.65
billion US dollars, with two billion US dollars of the amount
reaped by domestic enterprises, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that buying of foreign exchange by
Chinese banks was 5.28 billion US dollars more than selling
between January and March, adding that foreign-funded ventures
sold a net 2.19 billion US dollars worth of foreign exchange
during the period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had a foreign exchange reserve of
80.83 billion US dollars at the end of March, up 7.2 billion US
dollars from the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a year-round balance on the current
account is "optimistically likely" so long as the policies on
export tax rebates are implemented as planned and nothing
unexpected happens in world economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore the exchange rate of the yuan won't be much pressed
to fluctuate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "the authorities will continue to use the
firm backing of China's abundant foreign exchange reserves to
support a stable exchange rate (of the yuan)", adding that even a
year-end small foreign trade deficit will not greatly affect the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises, said the spokesman, are quite pessimistic
about exports and expect a devaluation of the yuan to help improve
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We hope those enterprises will make realistic judgements of
their own," he said. "The yuan will not be artificially devalued
under the current realities of foreign exchange supply exceeding
demand."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that an artificial devaluation of the
yuan to boost exports will dampen on-going efforts by enterprises
to readjust their export strategies and product mix by pursuing
efficiency and quality.
</P>
<P>
"It will also force the central bank to increase the supply of
money and therefore exacerbate inflationary pressures," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Pak-Maldives Trade to Increase Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ibrahim Sharif, head of the
visiting Maldivian trade and investment delegation, said today
that the trade between Maldives and Pakistan will be further
increased in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FPCCI) in Karachi today, Sharif said there was demand
for a number of products including those of vegetables, fruits and
electric goods in Maldives.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that for the enhancement of trade between the
two countries there was a need of cheap, efficient and regular
shipping service between Maldives and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that there was a lack of information in his
country about the commodities in Pakistan. The delegation's visit
to Pakistan was aimed at looking at ways and means to help enhance
trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that for expansion of trade between Maldives and
Pakistan there should be a container service from Karachi,
Pakistan's southern port city, to Male at special rates.
</P>
<P>
The Maldivian businessmen are in Karachi primarily to explore
possibilities of buying products from Pakistan such as textiles,
garments, rice, fruits, vegetables, onyx, carpets, pharmaceutical
and medical equipment, shoes and leather products.
</P>
<P>
The president of FPCCI, Ilyas Ahmed Bilor, assured that
Pakistan can supply these items in good quantity and to the entire
satisfaction of the Maldivian importers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need of a concrete commercial relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The FPCCI chief also said Pakistan can take good advantage of
the booming tourist trade in Maldives and can supply all the
required food items and other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
According to Bilor, the total volume of bilateral trade between
Pakistan and Maldives during 1994-95 was only about 35.31 million
Rupees (about 1.02 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bilor said that it is high time that businessmen of Pakistan
and Maldives come close and strive to enhance the two-way trade.
This can be done through regular exchange of trade information,
visits of trade delegations and participation in trade fairs, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Satisfied with EU-Cyprus Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides has expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the
European Union (EU)-Cyprus Association Council meeting held in
Brussels Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus radio today, Michaelides said in Brussels
that it has now become a conviction and is in the minds of the
Europeans that Cyprus and Malta will be included in the next EU
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He said everyone believes that Cyprus is ready in all aspects
to join the EU and the only concern is the Cyprus problem, which
should be solved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides added the Europeans understand the need to work
together with the United Nations to solve the Cyprus problem,
with the United States' initiative on Cyprus being the pivot of
the efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Tuesday, the Association Council
reconfirmed the EU decision, made on March 6, 1995, that
negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU will begin, on the
basis of commission proposals, six months after the conclusion of
the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
It said the presence of President Glafcos Clerides and
Michaelides at the European Council meetings in Cannes and Madrid
and the invitation extended to them by the presidency to attend
the European Council meeting in Florence are earnest examples of
the EU's commitment to the process leading to the accession of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it supports "a comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus question in accordance with the resolutions of the
U.N. Security Council, based on the concept of a bi-communal and
bi-zonal Cypriot federation."
</P>
<P>
It confirmed that the "status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable
and that the period remaining before the start of the accession
must be put to good use in efforts to find a comprehensive
settlement to the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The Brussels meeting was chaired by Cyprus Foreign Minister
Michaelides, and the EU delegation was led by Italian Foreign
Minister and President-in-Office of the Council of the EU Susanna
Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The island applied for EU full membership in July 1990. It
believes that the move to join the EU will be in favor of efforts
for solving the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> New Types of Dowries Popular in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Farming machines are now popular
dowry gifts for brides in Huaiyuan County in east China's Anhui
Province, while in suburban Bengbu City, large greenhouses are
becoming more and more common among local brides.
</P>
<P>
More and more brides in rural Anhui are buying farming
machinery or investing in agricultural production. In the past,
they used to spend money on clothes.
</P>
<P>
This is not an isolated case; new patterns of expenditure have
also emerged in other aspects in the rural areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by a provincial department showed that
during the period 1993-1995 farmers' investment in production
increased by an average 1.5-fold annually, 20 percentage points
higher than the increase in their expenditure in non-production
aspects.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that farmers' investment in fixed assets
in 1995 was five times the figure for 1993.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995 the per capita investment of Anhui
farmers in planting was 339 yuan, amounting to 45 percent of their
total expenditure on production; the per capita expenditure on
fixed assets stood at 67 yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, Anhui farmers spent 5.4 billion
yuan in buying farm machinery, 3.1 billion yuan more than in the
1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Anhui farmers are investing more to establish
share-holding enterprises, and develop breeding and the service
industries.
</P>
<P>
In Fuyang City there are hundreds of co-operative firms, and in
the Dabieshan Mountains area, nine farming families have set up an
industrial trading company.
</P>
<P>
In the past, farmers often spent their money on building
houses, or holding extravagant wedding ceremonies and funerals.
</P>
<P>
But with the implementation of cremation in rural areas farmers
now only spend one-fifth of the amount of money they used to spend
on funerals in the past.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Anhui farmers have also been spending more on
books. Expenses in this regard are rising at an annual rate of 121
percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Fertilizer Production Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's fertilizer production is
growing rapidly, and the first four months of this year saw 8.26
million tons of fertilizer produced, an increase of 10 percent
over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
According to an on-going national nitrogenous fertilizer
production conference here, this figure includes 6.6 million tons
of urea, an increase of 18.6 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this remarkable increase to massive state
investment in agriculture, better management of the fertilizer
industry and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
Last year China produced a total of 23.3 million tons of
various kinds of fertilizers, an increase of 12.7 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
And the industry had a sales income of 67.4 billion yuan (about
8.1 billion US dollars), resulting in taxes and profits of 4.7
billion yuan, registering increases of 46 percent and 120 percent,
respectively over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The conference is optimistic about the current fertilizer
production and predicts a new record output this year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Be Self-Sufficient in Polyester Fiber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to become
self-sufficient in polyester fiber for consumption by the local
textile mills by June this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year Pakistan will be able to export its
surplus production and the price of polyester fiber would come
down to the level of international market, according to a press
release here today by the Dhan Fiber Limited.
</P>
<P>
The self-sufficiency would be the result of increased
production of the man-made fiber. Dhan Fiber project, the largest
fiber plant of Pakistan based in the Northwest Frontier province,
has already begun trial production, and another fiber plant,
Hatter project, will also start production at commercial level
soon.
</P>
<P>
Other mills including Suleman, Dewan, ICI, National and
Pakistan Synthetic Mills now produce a total of about 165,000 tons
of polyester fiber annually. And the total annual production of
polyester fiber in the country will reach the level of 255,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Pakistan's annual domestic
demand for polyester fiber is nearly 200,000 tons, thus around
55,000 to 60,000 tons will be available for export. And Pakistan
will for the first time become an exporter of polyester fiber.
</P>
<P>
According to a study, the demand for polyester staple fiber in
Pakistan had grown by about 23 per cent between 1986 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The local market for polyester staple fiber is now suffering
from acute shortage due to increased demand within Pakistan for
durable, longer-wearing synthetic material and an increase in
cotton prices worldwide in general and in Pakistan in particular.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaking body today
said that citizenship arrangements for Hong Kong residents after
next July are in line with China's own nationality rules.
</P>
<P>
The explanation adopted by China's top legislature in Beijing
today on the implementation of China's Nationality Law in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is consistent with the
country's legal principles, and is also flexible and pragmatic to
meet needs of Hong Kong residents after 1997, senior lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
"The explanation solves the citizenship problem of major
concern by Hong Kong people, and should be conducive to the smooth
transfer of power to China in July 1, 1997 and Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability after that," said Zhou Nan
after the legislature's vote on the explanation this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) and director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch, has been attending the 19th session of the top legislature
which ended today.
</P>
<P>
The explanation says that from July 1, 1997 on, all Hong Kong
residents of Chinese descent born in Chinese territory, including
Hong Kong, will become citizens of the People's Republic of China
(PRC).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will not acknowledge the British
citizenship of Chinese citizens in Hong Kong as proposed by the
Plan of the Right of Abode in Britain of the British government.
</P>
<P>
But from July 1, 1997 such Chinese citizens may use the
passports issued by the British government as travel documents
with which they will be able to travel to other countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said this explanation is consistent with Chinese law
ruling out double citizenships, but provides the most convenience
for Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents are very concerned about their citizenship
after 1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international cosmopolitan city, whose
citizenship situation is quite complicated, and the British plan
further complicates the situation, according to him.
</P>
<P>
If the problems were not solved promptly, it will be difficult
to issue SAR passport and produce administrative officials, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China has made clear its stance on the issue, but the
explanation adopted by the top legislature would further beef up
Hong Kong people's confidence and be welcomed by them, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Tsing Hin-chi, member of the NPC Standing Committee and Hong
Kong business elite, said what Hong Kong people, especially
business people, care most about is whether they will be allowed
to travel freely to other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the explanation is quite preferential toward Hong Kong
residents in this matter.
</P>
<P>
The explanation says that Chinese citizens in the Hong Kong SAR
who intend to change their citizenship may resort to relevant
departments in Hong Kong in charge of nationality affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tsing said this stipulation is also consistent with the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The importance for China to speed
up the economic development of its offshore islands was stressed
today by Song Jian, State Councillor and minister in charge of
State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting in Beijing to highlight the
fruitful results achieved in the eight-year comprehensive survey
of offshore island resources.
</P>
<P>
He said it has become an important task for China to make its
ocean development catch up with the rapid development of its
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The survey has put the country's offshore island resources
under the microscope, providing a scientific basis for the
development and management of island resources, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The transformation and application of survey results should be
the focus of governments at various levels, he noted, adding that
they are responsible for developing island resources and
protecting ocean environment.
</P>
<P>
Better working conditions and more opportunities will be
offered by the State Council to the development and building of
islands, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,400 scientists, technicians, and management
personnel from 11 ministries participated in the eight-year

<HEADLINE> Isuzu to Make Trucks Jointly With Malaysian Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Isuzu Motors Ltd. has signed
a memorandum of understanding with two Malaysian companies to
jointly produce low-priced small trucks in Malaysia, according to
a Kyodo News Service report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum calls for Isuzu, Heavy Industries Co. of
Malaysia Holdings Bhd. (HICOM) and Diversified Resources Bhd. to
start a feasibility study into promoting the tripartite joint
venture, Isuzu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Isuzu President Kazuhira Seki and representatives from the two
Malaysian companies signed the document Tuesday in the presence of
Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir, who was visiting an
Isuzu factory in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will receive full support from the Malaysian
government, which is seeking to develop its automobile industry
under Malaysia's national vehicle project, an Isuzu spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The new company's trucks will be based on Isuzu's Elf truck and
its upcoming models will weigh between 3.5 and 7.0 tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Production will begin by mid-1997 with annual output in the
initial 12 months projected to reach 6,000 units and then 20,000
units in the third year of the manufacturing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trucks will be sold on the Malaysian market, the spokesman
said, adding that the joint venture will consider exporting them
to other Asian countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of equity Isuzu will hold in the new venture has
not yet been decided, the spokesman said, adding that Malaysian
government regulations ban foreign companies from obtaining an equity
stake of more than 30 percent in a joint venture there.
</P>
<P>
Isuzu said it will use the existing production facilities at
its affiliate, Automotive Manufacturers (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd.,
which is now assembling Elf trucks in Malaysia, in order to reduce
its capital outlays for the new joint venture.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition to Campaign Against Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The three South Korean opposition
parties have decided to launch a political campaign against
the ruling party's move to gain a parliamentary majority by
recruiting independent and opposition lawmakers-elect.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP), the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) and the Democratic
Party (DP) here today.
</P>
<P>
They will stage a public display of information on election
campaign irregularities allegedly committed by the ruling New
Korea Party (NKP) and political rallies denouncing those
lawmakers-elect who recently joined the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The three opposition parties will also boycott the new National
Assembly opening early next month if the government fails to meet
their demand for a thorough investigation of all alleged election
frauds.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam secured
139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP led by Kim Dae-jung won 79 seats, the ULD headed by
Kim Jong-pil got 50 seats and the DP obtained 15 seats. The
remaining 16 seats went to independents.
</P>
<P>
The NKP's seats in the National Assembly are expected to
increase to 149, only one seat short of majority, after
independent lawmaker-elect Baek Seung-hong promised today to
join the NKP before the end of this week, following the example of
nine others.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Step up Education in Legal Knowledge (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide drive to educate all
Chinese people about their legal rights and the rule of law is to
be launched.
</P>
<P>
It follows the conclusion of the 19th Meeting of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) that today
adopted five new laws.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, in Beijing, also made a decision to educate the
entire Chinese people in legal knowledge within five years.
</P>
<P>
The move is hailed by people from all walks of life as a major
step taken by China to advance progress in improving its legal
system.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in early 1996 the Chinese government put
forward, in the form of a legal document, the objective of
"governing China according to the rule of law and building a
socialist country with a sound legal system."
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuwen, a NPC Standing Committee member and an expert on
legal affairs, said it indicated that with the progress of
creating a socialist market economy, "China has been making steady
advances in improving democracy and its legal system."
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten-plus years the NPC and its Standing Committee
have enacted 200 laws.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, we have laws to abide by in political, economic
and social areas. Soon we will formulate a whole range of basic
laws indispensable for the establishment of a socialist market
economic structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
But there still exists the practice of laxity in some areas in
the enforcement of laws, and the failure to investigate law
breakers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some citizens and even some leading officials still do not have
a strong legal sense.
</P>
<P>
"This has seriously impeded the creation of a socialist market
economy and a legal society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think education of the entire Chinese people in
legal knowledge and the improvement of citizens' legal awareness
are of paramount importance to speeding up the establishment of a
socialist market economic structure."
</P>
<P>
Xiong Qingquan, a NPC Standing Committee member, expressed the
view that education in legal knowledge will enable China to shift
from the traditional practice of "China being governed by
officials to a system of rule of law."
</P>
<P>
He said, "China lacks the tradition and cultural background for
introducing a system of rule of law because of its long history as
a feudal society."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Step up Education in Legal Knowledge (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time after the founding of New China in 1949, close
attention was not paid to the introduction of a sound legal
system, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is why I think it is particularly important for us to
build China into a country with a sound legal system and enable
citizens to have the concept of a system of rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shengping, a law professor with Beijing University, said
that the enhancement of citizens' legal awareness and building
China into a country with a sound legal system will realize Deng
Xiaoping's projection that China's system "will not change even
though the leadership changes and will not change even though the
viewpoints and attention of leaders change."
</P>
<P>
"This will enable China to eventually embark on the path of
sustainable and steady development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time China will carry out education in legal
knowledge. In the first two education campaigns, people were
required to study the Constitution and various special laws.
</P>
<P>
In the current education campaign, focus will be on officials
of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, workers of
judicial departments and administrative law-enforcement
departments, enterprise managers, youth and teenagers.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese Minister of Justice Xiao Yang, leading
Party and government officials, and officials responsible for law
enforcement, are essential to the introduction of the system of
rule of law, enterprise managers serve as the foundation for a
market economy, youth and teenagers are the future of China.
</P>
<P>
"This is why education in legal knowledge should focus on
them," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels and various central departments have
drawn up specific plans for education in legal knowledge. The
result of education in different areas will be assessed by
judicial departments and other departments.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year top Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and
Qiao Shi have attended legal lectures and stressed the importance
of carrying out education in legal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels throughout the country are now
conscientiously studying the theory of governing China according
to the rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Becomes Smoke-Free Zone From Today (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's 350 million
smokers might have to consider giving up smoking after capital
Beijing became the latest city to outlaw smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
The city of 12 million people is the 26th to introduce
stringent new rules, with on-the-spot fines for people caught
having a quick drag in prohibited places.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's first regulation to ban smoking in public places came
into effect today, with department stores, hotels and other places
hanging-up "No Smoking" signs.
</P>
<P>
Smokers breaking the law will be fined ten yuan. The
regulation also grants non-smokers the right to stop people from
smoking in public, as a move to prevent 'passive smoking'.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by the city's Public Health Bureau showed that
more than 90 percent of the citizens support the ban. It also
showed that nearly all smokers realized that smoking not only
does harm to their own health, but to the health of others.
</P>
<P>
On day one of the ban cigarette sales in the department stores
were not affected.
</P>
<P>
The campuses of the country's colleges and universities may
also become 'smoking free zones', since Zhejiang Medical
University and Dr. Norman Bethune Medical University recently
called on all colleagues in China to stop recruiting
cigarette-smoking students from middle schools, and to teach
existing smoking students how to quit their bad habit.
</P>
<P>
A teacher in one Beijing middle school, - a veteran smoker -
sighed, "I'm considering giving up smoking soon, because I'll not
be able to find anywhere to smoke."
</P>
<P>
Even though the smoking population in developed countries is
continuing to drop at a annual rate of 1.1 percent, China's
number of smokers is expanding by three million every year.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have also seen a sharp rise in the number of young
smokers and female smokers. Smokers in rural areas have also
increased on a rising curve over the past few years, as their
standard of living improves.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, most of the Chinese people are aware of the harm
to their health by smoking. And there have been 26 cities that
have taken measures to encourage smokers to stop smoking, and to
prohibit tobacco advertising on TV, and radio, and in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
But only the capital's legislators have been so bold enough to
ban smoking in public through the law. Beijing was also the
country's first city to prohibit firecrackers and fireworks during
the Spring Festival, and set limitations on dog ownership.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of China's Ministry of Public Health,
500,000 Chinese people die from smoking-related diseases every
year. By the year 2025, the figure could be as high as two
million.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israeli Forces in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, carried out a series of operations targeting the
Israeli occupation forces in the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
Hezbollah, announced that its guerrillas attacked the Israeli
positions at Sejoud and Bir Kalab with rockets and machine guns,
causing casualties and damages to the positions.
</P>
<P>
The radical armed group also said that its guerrillas
detonated an explosive device targeting an joint patrol of the
Israeli forces and its client militia the South Lebanon Army on
the road between the towns of Sejoud and Rihan in the eastern
sector of the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
It added that the bombing attack at 8:50 a.m.(05:50 GMT) led to
the killing or wounding of a number of elements in the patrol.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance said that shots of fire were exchanged
between the patrol and the attackers.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
confirmed the bombing attack at the patrol, saying that two
Israeli soldiers were lightly injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces since earlier this morning resumed bombardment
at Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge opposite the Israeli-occupied border
strip which is often used by Hezbollah guerrillas at the Israeli
occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that more than 150 heavy
and medium artillery shells hit Iglim Al-Toffah overnight and this
morning.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth successive day of the Israeli bombardments
in the area since tensions escalated in south Lebanon on Sunday
following Hezbollah guerrillas launched attacks at the Israeli
occupation forces in which five Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces extended the bombardment this morning to
Western Beqaa, where they shelled the vicinities of a number of
villages without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire understanding mediated by the United States
between Lebanon and Israel ended 16 days of Israeli military
strikes in south Lebanon last month. But the April 16
understanding did not deprived Hezbollah guerrillas of the right
to launch attack at the Israeli forces on the southern
Lebanese occupied lands.

<P>
The budget for curing the smokers' diseases is also very
high. For example, in 1989 the tobacco industry paid the country
24 billion yuan in tax and profits, however, it cost the country
28 billion yuan to treat smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Most of the domestic and overseas tobacco companies refused to
comment on the ban, or on the strong awareness among Chinese
people that "Smoking is harmful to your health".
</P>
<P>
With the tobacco market in the west declining, most of the
giant tobacco multinationals have explored the Chinese market
because of its great potential.
</P>
<P>
Although the country set strict prohibitions over tobacco
companies sponsoring sport games, The US-owned tobacco giant
Philip Morris is still the biggest sponsor of China's Football
League.
</P>
<P>
An official in China's tobacco administration department said
that the ban will not negatively effect the country's tobacco
industry too much in the short term, because only a few cities
have so far made the ban effective.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the Chinese tobacco manufacturers have
started to diversify their economies, by investing in service
industries, real estate and the construction industry, to avoid
any future risks that might occur if cigarette sales nosedive.
</P>
<P>
It is like the two sides of a coin, he said, with the tobacco
industry benefitting 10 million farmers in Yunnan Province,
China's biggest tobacco producer, even though it is considered
dangerous to people's health.
</P>
<P>
China has also recently launched a program to lower the tar
content of domestic cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
A local woman doctor said: "It is immoral to smoke in public,
so I hope the legislator's laws can become strong enough to make
smokers give up their habit."
</P>
<P>
She also wants film and TV actors to be banned from smoking
on the screen because of the bad influence on young people, she
added.
</P>
<P>
And China's number of smoking middle and primary school
students is increasing, so China is still very far from the goal
of becoming a land free of smokers, she said.

<P>
SEOUL, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Tongyang Cement Company
today announced its plans to build a cement silo in Rajin-Sonbong
Port of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) sometime
this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed silo project would be a joint venture with the
DPRK's External Economy Commission, a Tongyang official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Tongyang, whose officials visited the DPRK twice last year, is
nearing an agreement on technical details of the project after
negotiations with the DPRK earlier this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To implement the 3-million-U.S.-dollar project, Tongyang is to
apply to the South Korean National Unification Board (NUB) for
approval as an inter-Korean venture.
</P>
<P>
The cement manufacturer is also planning to dispatch a survey
team to the DPRK for the cement silo, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The cement silo project, if approved, would be the second
Seoul-Pyongyang joint project, following South Korean Daewoo
Company's joint-venture plant in the DPRK's Nampo, which is now
under trial operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German Minister of Defense Volker
Ruehe, NATO's staunchest advocate of Poland's admission into the
military bloc, Tuesday expressed his optimism over membership for
Warsaw in three years.
</P>
<P>
"It is practical to expect Poland's accession to NATO in 1999
when the alliance will celebrate its 50th birthday with new
members," said Ruehe, whose two-day visit here is centered on
Poland's accession to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The German minister said the most important criteria for NATO
membership are political ones including political development and
a stable democracy, economic achievements and social and
non-military supervision over the military. He rejected military
capability as an essential criterion for an applicant.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic military group has undergone changes, Ruehe said,
adding that its new ties with east and central European countries,
particularly Russia, are a case in point.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe, who is awarded a warm reception in the former Warsaw
Pact nation, has met with President Aleksander Kwasniewski and
Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. He discussed with Polish
Minister of National Defense Stanislaw Dobrzanski Poland's NATO
membership issue.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Prime Minister Cimoszewicz assured Ruehe that
Poland's general public and major political powers have lent their
support to the country's foreign policy of focusing on securing a
seat in the EU and NATO as its main objective.

<HEADLINE> China Quickens Development of Coal Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up the
development of coal gas as one of its major new energy resources
by giving a series of preferential policies in terms of loans and
exemption of fees.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official from the Ministry of Coal
Industry, the government will not collect compensation fees for
the exploitation of coal gas resources from enterprises which are
in the initial stage of developing coal gas. Moreover,
preferential loans will be made available for key coal gas
projects.
</P>
<P>
The official said China has given priority to the development
of coal gas to make up for the shortfall in the energy supply. The
increased use of coal gas is expected to improve the country's
consumption structure of energy resources, reduce air pollution
and enhance safe production.
</P>
<P>
China is very rich in coal gas resources. Coal fields in the
northern, northeastern and southern parts of China are calculated
to have recoverable coal gas deposits totalling 3.5 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far developed over 50 coal gas projects,
including a gas storage tank with a capacity of 650,000 cu m and
coal gas pipelines with a cumulative length of 620,000 m.
</P>
<P>
The ministry source added that the national annual utilization
of coal gas has exceeded 400 million cu m.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has developed complete sets of advanced coal
gas technologies, with over 20 of them up to the international
standards.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The heads of Israel's defense
establishment met Tuesday night to review the country's security
situation and decided to tighten its closure of the Palestinian
territories whenever necessary, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shimon Peres presided over the meeting, which
was attended by Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, Director of the General Security Service Ami
Ayalon, Minister of Public Security Moshe Shahal and Police
Inspector-General Assaf Hafetz as well as heads of army

Those attending the meeting were briefed on continued
intelligent reports about possible terrorist attacks prior to the

opened fire at an Israeli bus on the highway near Beit El, killing
a 17-year-old student and wounding three others.

<HEADLINE> Love At First Site For Man in 90s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Cupid has brought romance to a
Chinese man in his mid-90s after finding the new love of his life
through a matchmaker. It led to Yu Yisheng, 94, marrying his bride
of 77, Wang Xiuchun - after their 'love at first sight' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The marriage demonstrates the old Chinese proverb, "A man
becomes more in want of a partner as he is putting up age".
</P>
<P>
The couple started their new life together one morning in
May. A cab stopped in front of a building in Nan Guanling Railway
Station's residential quarters in northeast China's coast city of
Dalian, and Yu Yisheng alighted arm in arm with his new bride Wang
Xiuchun.
</P>
<P>
The couple, with marriage certificates in hand, and accompanied
by relatives and friends, smiled happily as they stepped into
their house.
</P>
<P>
The bridegroom is a retiree from Nan Guanling Railway Station
of Shenyang Railway Administration. He first arrived in Shenyang
from his famine-stricken home town Dalian in east China's Shandong
Province when he was 17. He worked as a loader in the station from
then until his retirement in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Since his wife died 16 years ago, and his married daughter
returned to his home town, Yu had been leading a lonely life. A
kind-hearted colleague acted as a go-between for Yu and Wang, who
felt in love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
The happy couple decided to choose May 7th as their wedding
day. They went to the town government to register their marriage,
and after the ceremony took a cab home.

<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Body of Chinese Taipei
climber Chen Yu-Nan, who died last Friday in an accident on Mount
Qomolangma, was brought back here late Tuesday by a Nepal army
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a 36-year-old worker, member of the first Chinese Taipei
expedition to the Himalayas, was reported dead after slipping
about 25 meters down from a 7,300-meter height during his attempt
toward the summit of Mount Qomolamgma on the southern side last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter also brought back Swiss climber Marss Dicrk who
had abandoned his bid to conquer Qomolamgma due to bad weather and
physical exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, leader of the Chinese Taipei Qomolangma
expedition Gau Ming-Ho was rescued from Qomolangma base camp to
Kathmandu by another helicopter flight.
</P>
<P>
Gau, 39, a professional photographer, had reached the 8,848-
meter summit last Friday but got into trouble while descending
from the world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
He was carried down to base camp by local sherpa mountaineers
Saturday from a more than 8,000-meter height after spending there
a whole night without any food, water and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Gau, reportedly suffering frozen wounds in his face, toes and
fingers, told a local newspaper that he would come back to Nepal
and climb more mounts next year if his health conditions allow.
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to fly back home on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Canada Makes Drastic Changes to Unemployment Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian parliament passed a
bill today that will dramatically alter the country's unemployment
insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The bill will affect 14 million Canadian workers, cut nearly 2
billion Canadian dollars out of the system, and bring "historical
changes" to the country's social safety net, said a report of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
</P>
<P>
The bill would mean less money for most Canadians who lose
their jobs and have to work longer to qualify for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the maximum benefit for the unemployed
will fall from 448 dollars a week to 413 dollars, and the maximum
length of time they collect fall from 50 weeks to 45.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there will be further cuts for those people who
use the system repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
These changes to the system have been two years in the making,
and represent the first fundamental redesign of Canada's social
safety net since 1941, the CBC said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years under both the Conservative and now the
Liberal governments, Canada's unemployed have seen their benefits
cut by some 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its initial response, the Canadian Labor Congress said the
government has gone too far in its efforts to save the money.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the view of a scholar from the Fraser Institute,
today's bill does not "go nearly far enough" and should "bring
true reform to the system so open to abuse."
</P>
<P>
Unemployment insurance system should be insurance system rather
than a way to give money to various groups of the society, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Third Front Names Gowda as Its Prime Ministerial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Karnataka chief minister and
Janata Dal leader H.D. Deve Gowda has emerged as India's third
front's unanimous candidate for the prime ministerial office after
two days' meetings and consultations among the front partners.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the third front consisting of more than 10 small
parties and accounting for about 180 Lok Sabha (lower house) seats
in the current general elections, called on the president Tuesday
evening and informed him about their decision to stake claim for
forming a government at the center.
</P>
<P>
Deve Gowda was reported to have written a letter late Tuesday
night to Congress President P.V. Narasimha Rao seeking
confirmation of the Congress support for his claim to form a
government. On May 12 the Congress in its meeting decided to
support a secular government so as to prevent the "communal party
of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) from coming into power at the
center.
</P>
<P>
With the left backing out from the prospect of forming a
government, the Congress leaders are finally hopeful of forming a
coalition government with Janata Dal, headed by P.V. Narasimha
Rao.
</P>
<P>
A seemingly hopeless situation has arisen for the BJP with nine
regional and smaller parties throwing their lot with the third
front. If these parties stick to their position, it will more or
less be the end of the road for the BJP's plans to form the next
government. The Congress spokesman, V.N. Gadgil, has said that the
Congress would vote against the government in parliament if the
BJP is called to form a government.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Further Tariff Cuts on Farm Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to introduce a new
round of import duty cuts on 15 categories of processed
agricultural products in a bid to make its processed agricultural
goods to be globally competitive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
A Customs Department source said the new duties would be in the
20-30 percent range rather than the current average of more than
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cuts are expected to reduce the cost of Thai agricultural
exports, increase revenues earned by the country and bolster the
national economy, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The duty cuts will involve products which are in insufficient
supply or of quality below international standards.
</P>
<P>
In a previous tariff reduction scheme on processed agricultural
goods initiated in March 1995, some items were not touched upon,
such as live animals, meat products, fish and shellfish, dairy
products, animal products, fruit and nuts, coffee, and animal or
vegetable fat and oil.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Vietnam Start to Build Joint Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Singapore today began
building their first joint industrial park near Ho Chi Minh city,
which will cost more than 200 million U.S. dollars and create more
than 50,000 jobs over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his Singaporean
counterpart Goh Chok Tong attended a ground-breaking ceremony for
the park, about 20 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh city, southern
Vietnam, this morning.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, proposed by Goh during his
first visit to Vietnam in March 1994, will cover 100 hectares and
cost about 52.5 million dollars. It is expected be completed
within two years.
</P>
<P>
A further 400 hectares will be developed over another six years
at a cost of 156.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to create more than 50,000 jobs and
create industrial output of more than 1 billion dollars for Song
Be Province.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is Vietnam's largest trading partner and its fifth
largest foreign investor, with more than 100 projects worth about
1.43 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vo Van Kiet and Goh Chok Tong held talks Monday afternoon
shortly after Goh arrived in Vietnam on a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore attaches importance to developing
cooperation with Vietnam, particularly in the economy, trade and
investment, since Vietnam has now joined the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers both said that they were satisfied with
bilateral cooperation in recent years, especially in investment,
trade, industrial construction, air services and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Explosion May Have Occurred on ValuJet Plan Before Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Investigators are exploring the
possibility of a fire or explosion on board the ValuJet DC-9 plane
which crashed into the Florida Everglades on Saturday killing 109
people.
</P>
<P>
Transport safety officials say there was evidence of fire
aboard the plane - they have found several pieces of the plane
with apparent soot damage. They are also investigating whether 50
to 60 oxygen generators and three inflated airplane tires in a
front cargo hold might have exploded.
</P>
<P>
A floor beam and "internal material" recovered from the
Everglades swamp had what appeared to be soot on them and the
parts were believed to have come from the front of the jet, said
National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Robert Francis
at an evening news conference.
</P>
<P>
The jet's crew had reported smoke in the cockpit and cabin
shortly before the plane crashed near Miami International Airport,
killing all 104 passengers and the five crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
The emergency oxygen generators the plane was carrying in its
hold were being transported to ValuJet headquarters in
Atlanta. Some of them were past their shelf life.
</P>
<P>
One of the plane's two "black boxes", which record flight data,
was recovered from the swamp on Monday and was sent to Washington
for analysis.
</P>
<P>
Francis said preliminary analysis of the data recorder showed
the plane was climbing normally at 267 mph and had reached 10,628
feet (3239 meters) when the recorder noted an anomaly. The data
showed the plane fell 815 feet and airspeed dropped by 39 mph in
three to four seconds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The device then indicated the airplane was descending and
gaining speed. The plane hit the ground traveling at 352 mph, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, for reasons which are unclear, the "black box"
failed to record the last 50 seconds of the flight and therefore
it was too early to draw any conclusions from the data, said
Francis.
</P>
<P>
The search for the other "black box", which records cockpit
conversation, is continuing.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Asks Opposition to Resume Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has called for resumption of dialogue with the
Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the country's main opposition, the
official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to UML President Man Mohan Adhikari, Deuba
criticized the opposition for dodging talks with the government
despite the latter's willingness to sit for talks over the UML's
demands, said the RSS.
</P>
<P>
The act of backing out of the dialogue and continuing to blame
the government could give rise to new problems, Deuba warned in
the letter made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In February, the UML handed over a memorandum of 30 points to
the government, demanding that it improve its performance within
one month.
</P>
<P>
The UML launched a no-confidence challenge against the
coalition government in the parliament soon after the talks on the
memorandum started between its representatives and the government.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion was later defeated in the 205-seat
lower house by a narrow majority.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said in his letter that the defeat of the no-confidence
motion automatically rejected the allegations leveled by the UML
against the government.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Foreign Exchange Reserve Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's foreign exchange
reserve fell further to 2.098 billion US dollars on May 12 from
3.07 billion dollars at the end of last June, according to a
statement issued by Bangladesh Bank (BB).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve was at its peak at 3.4
billion dollars in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the fall to the import of huge
amount of foodgrain and decline in overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
However, the BB expected that the reserve would come to a
comfortable level at the end of the current fiscal year (from July
1, 1995 to June 30, 1996) as both the remittances and exports had
started rising.
</P>
<P>
The amount of remittances was 122.8 million dollars in April
and such trend would continue in the current fiscal year ending in
June, it said.
</P>
<P>
The BB statement also said that the inflation rate at the end
of this February stood at 5.2 percent and it was expected to
remain confined within 5.5 percent at the end of the current
fiscal year.

DHAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC)
has issued a total of 54 election symbols to 54 political parties
and alliances which are going to contest the June 12 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday's hearing, at which the symbols were issued, was
disrupted and turned into chaos amid scuffles and the hubbub by
rival representatives from more than 100 smaller parties, and the
remaining symbols are expected to be distributed later today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena, who was present
at the hearing, vented his anguish over the situation which almost
went out of control at one point.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pained seeing this pandemonium," said Hena, adding
that all the 115 political parties which have applied for poll
symbols will get theirs today.
</P>
<P>
However, representatives from the four major parties
encountered no trouble in obtaining their traditional symbols.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its
biggest rival Awami (People's) League were allocated their symbols
"the Sheaf of Paddy" and "the Boat" respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-E-Islami also got
their traditional symbols "the Plough" and "the Scale"
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Restrict Imports of Alcoholic Drinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government is

<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A 400-year-old market here in this
historical city in central China's Henan Province is playing an
important role in facilitating the flow of commodities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Covering a total of 184,000 sq m, the Guanlin Market draws
about 100,000 to 300,000 traders every day. Transactions last year
came to over 3.5 billion yuan (421.68 million US dollars)-worth.
</P>
<P>
Usually, over 10,000 varieties of industrial and handicraft
goods are traded on the market each day, with about 80 percent of
the commodities coming from Beijing, Tianjin and major coastal
cities and selling to the northern and western provinces.
</P>
<P>
The temple-fair-turned market is now divided into two
parts: the Guanlin Commerce and Trade City and the Luoyang
Economic and Technology Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The main structure of the gigantic market is composed of 80
two-story business buildings with 390 show-windows and
80,000 roofed stalls located in 21 commercial streets.
</P>
<P>
Doing business there is greatly facilitated by the presence of
130 travel agencies, over 80 restaurants and food stalls, and
adequate public bus and transportation services.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the marketplace is a development zone which is
still under construction and which has already drawn applications
from over 150 Chinese and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Being a junction of the country's two major railway trunk
lines, and with a newly built super-highway and an airport,
Luoyang has favorable geographical and transportation conditions
for commerce.

WARSAW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Poland today lodged a protest with
Belarus over the arrest of the head of Poland's Solidarity Union
and other union activists, who were visiting opposition trade
unions in Belarus' capital of Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned the Belarussian charge
d'affaires in Warsaw and handed over a protest note to him, a
government spokesman told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski, who headed a Solidarity
delegation to Minsk, and three other members of the delegation
were detained Tuesday at a Belarussian restaurant where they were
having lunch after meeting with members of Belarussian independent
unions.
</P>
<P>
The protest note said the act of the Belarussian authorities
has broken international law and seriously threatened the
relations between Poland and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Krzaklewski, who was released hours after the detention, told
Polish public television that he would be sent to the Polish
border under a police escort before they were deported from the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian authorities told him they were arrested because
they had organized a meeting of a political nature, Krzaklewski
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that delegation members had just met a group of
workers from a Minsk factory and talked about something concerning
free trade unions and the situation in Poland.

He attacked his former defense minister and campaign manager
Fernando Botero, now in jail, for manipulating the media to
speculate about the guilt of the three.
</P>
<P>
There has been intense media speculation about the imminent
arrest of Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo Garcia-Pena, Interior
Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe and Communications Minister Juan
Manuel Turbay who were part of Samper's election campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
They have been under criminal investigation by the Supreme
Court since March into their role in the campaign and have been
implicated in acts of criminal wrongdoing or efforts to cover up
drug-related corruption by Botero.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are expected to decide this week whether to absolve
the ministers or order their arrest.
</P>
<P>
Samper said their alleged involvement was fabricated by former
Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea, one of Samper's closest
aides and election campaign manager who has publicly accused the
president of receiving funds from the Cali drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no documents or testimonies to implicate the
ministers, only media speculation and the testimony of Botero.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who was speaking during the swearing in of Fernando
Castro Caballero as magistrate of the National Court, accused
Botero of manipulating the media into launching accusations
against the three ministers that didn't even correspond with
statements he himself had given to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who can lie once can lie one hundred times, said Samper.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been mired in a political crisis following
accusations by Botero that Samper knew about the use of
drug-related money in the election campaign which brought him to
power in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Boasts Satellite Capacities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina is Latin America's
biggest and the world's seventh biggest customer of the "Intelsat"
satellite system, especially for cable television viewing, the
National Telecommunications Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
This capacity surpasses that of India, Canada, Spain, Austria,
Norway and China.
</P>
<P>
The Intelsat system, consisting of 23 satellites in orbit, has
the greatest territorial coverage in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Argentina paid 24.5 million U.S. dollars for Intelsat,
2.9 percent of the total the country paid for its traffic
communication, immediately after the United States with 19
percent, Great Britain with 9.1 percent, Italy 4.8 percent, Japan
4.7 percent, France 3.6 percent and Germany 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Argentina also uses the service of "Panamsat" and "Nahuelsat"
which operate two space satellites leased to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will have greater satellite capacity at the end of
this year when the domestic satellites Nahuel I and II are
launched.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Toni Kukoc of Chicago Bulls was
voted on Tuesday to take the National Basketball Association's
Sixth Man Award.
</P>
<P>
Kukoc got 45 of 113 votes from a panel of sports writers and
broadcasters, beating Portland Trail Blazers' Arvydas Sabonis to
second with 24 votes.
</P>
<P>
Jayson Williams of New Jersey Nets was third with 14 votes.
</P>
<P>
The 2.11-meter Kukoc averaged 13.1 points, four rebounds and
3.5 asssits in 81 games this season.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Croatian became the first Chicago player to win
the award. He scored a career-high 34 points on April 4 when the
Bulls won over the Miami Heat 100-92.
</P>
<P>
However, Kukoc who suffered a back injury, had missed two games
of the NBA Eastern Conference semifinals in which the Bulls led
the New York Knicks 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Kukoc joined Chicago in the 1993-94 season.

BRASILIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso today approved a new intellectual property bill
passed last week by the National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, replacing the one passed in 1971, permits
industrial property patents on foods, medications, chemical and
biotechnological products.
</P>
<P>
The bill prevents the piracy of products that may only be
copied through the payment of copyrights.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to share know-how and transform the country in
such a way that it will be the master of its own destiny," said
president Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Brazil should have its own laws to regulate intellectual
properties and honor its international commitments, Cardoso said.

AMSTERDAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Soccer budding star Patrick
Kluivert was ordered for 240-hour community service after being
convicted on Tuesday of causing death by dangerous driving.
</P>
<P>
At a courtroom here, judge Rob Blekxtoon also sentenced the
19-year-old Dutchman three months in prison with two year
suspension, and banned him from driving for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert was not present in court and was reportedly to seek
for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
However, the order of community service meant that the soccer
prodigy can still play for Ajax in the European Cup final against
Juventus on next Wednesday, and the European championships in
England next month.
</P>
<P>
On September 9, 1995, Kluivert drove his borrowed BMW into

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Port to Focus on Energy Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- This north China port city is
seeking foreign investment to promote itself into a port
specializing in the export of energy and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ende, director of the Tianjin Port Administration, said
that the city is expected to build 12 berths able to accommodate
ships of 10,000 dwt in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Included will be two berths for coal, two for coke, one for
minerals, two for passenger transport and five for multi-purposes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tianjin will build three sundry berths and one berth
for liquid chemicals.
</P>
<P>
It plans to add two coal wharves and one oil berth in the first
decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
At present it has 62 berths, handling 57.86 million tons of
cargo last year.
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign investment, according to Wang, the city
will issue a package of such preferential policies as encouraging
bonded zones to attract foreign capital and allowing Sino-overseas
joint venture projects to enjoy policies granted to the bonded
zone.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ Employment Act Enters Sixth Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Employment
Contracts Act is five years old today, and controversy has
remained over the act as ever since it was enacted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The architect of the act, Finance Minister Bill Birch, said
over 200,000 new jobs have been created in the past five years and
the economic recovery would not have happened without the act.
The Employers Federation also described the act as a great
success.
</P>
<P>
The act was designed to liberalize the labor market once
monopolized by trade unions. It replaced the compulsory union
membership with freedom of association and voluntary union
membership. It also encouraged employees to enter into direct
negotiations with their employers on wages and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The result is that the power of the unions has been greatly
weakened. Figures indicated that the union membership has been
almost halved since 1991, from over 720,000 to about 370,000 at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
Now, three fourths of the employees have signed individual
contracts with their bosses, and the number of organized
industrial actions have steadily declined in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
While the government and the employers are celebrating the 5th
anniversary of the act, the opponents and the unions have little
to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
The opponents have charged that the act favored the employers,
putting them in an advantageous position in industrial bargains.
The employers could deliberately press down the wages and prolong
the working hours. The act also pitted the employers and the
employees against each other, they said.
</P>
<P>
Figures recently released by the Labor Party showed that
average earnings of the workers have risen less then two percent
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The act is so controversial that even the International Labor
Organization (ILO) stepped in to express concern over the alleged
worsening conditions of the workers. The ILO sent a mission to NZ
last year to investigate unions' complaint against the act.
</P>
<P>
But a survey conducted early this year showed that 41 percent
of those surveyed approved the act, 31 percent neither approved
nor disapproved, 24 percent did not approve and 3 percent did not
know.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the debate on the Employment Contracts
Act is bound to continue. It may become even more heated after
the general election later this year in the new MMP (Mixed Member
Proportional representation) system under which the present ruling
National Party is most likely to become a minority party in the
Parliament and a coalition of some sort will have to be formed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Outlays $227 Million on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore said
Tuesday that the federal government is spending 227 million U.S.
dollars to support the Atlanta Olympics, mostly for security and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The amount is a conservative estimate that includes only
expenditures made particularly for the Atlanta Games, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
It does not include millions that the Department of Housing and
Urban Development is spending to rehabilitate public housing in
Atlanta in time for the Games, which is to start on July 19.
</P>
<P>
He said compared with the 8 billion U.S dollars the Spanish
government spent on the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the U.S.
government's role in the 1996 Olympics has been very small. The
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, the city of Atlanta and
the state of Georgia will bear most of the costs.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the Atlanta committee is spending 1.7
billion dollars raised from private sources on the Games.
</P>
<P>
The federal expenditures will include 104.9 million dollars for
transportation and 69.8 million dollars for security.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government is putting more than 2,500
federal law enforcement agents and 8,500 military personnel to
ensure security during the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Olympics committee is providing 12,000 to 13,000
private security agents in addition to 4,800 state and local law
enforcement officers.

<HEADLINE> Avramovic Urges Reform to Cure Sick Economy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Yugoslav National
Bank Dragoslav Avramovic said today the Yugoslav economy was
"sick" and the disease must be cured through a democratization of
property relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Yugoslav parliament, Avramovic said the economic
problem should be resolved also through a liberalization of
imports, lifting of administrative restrictions on the economy and
a reorganization of the economy through property transformation
and privatization.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's economy "is afflicted with many weaknesses, such
as low foreign exchange reserves and the 15 percent monthly
interest rate which represents a time bomb," Avramovic told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Noting there are several ways of resolving this problem, the
well-known economist said the burden of taxation on the population
and for business activities must be drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
"This would enable enterprises to contract less debts and to
get operating capital, and would raise the standard of living of
the population," the nation's top banker said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament members, the bank governor
criticized the government for high budget expenditures and for
being unable to reduce them.
</P>
<P>
"Printing money is another possible solution, but this would
plunge the country into an inflationary catastrophe within two
weeks," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"If it is impossible to reduce taxes and interest rates and if
money cannot be printed, then the only way to get capital is to
turn to foreign sources, unless the federal and republican
governments are ready to reduce their budgets by 50 percent,"
Avramovic said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia wanted desperately to rejoin the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) so as to get a large sum of loans from
international financial institutions and creditors to boost the
devastated economy of Yugoslavia which had suffered sanctions for
three and half years until late last year.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the failure of the negotiations with the IMF
early last month, Avramovic, who headed the team for the talks in
Paris, said the issue of sole succession was the main reason for
the failure, as IMF representatives rejected Yugoslavia's stance
on continuity and said Yugoslavia could apply for admission as a
new member.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, insisted on
being the sole successor of the old Yugoslav federation in hopes
of taking over the federation's 700 million dollars in gold
reserves and 250 million dollars in foreign currency assets frozen
in foreign banks since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic has openly disputed with the government in economic
policies and in conditions for rejoining international financial
organizations. The National Bank Council today called on
parliament to remove the bank governor from his current post so as
to end the deadlock in the bank council's work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Vice-Premier and Finance Minister Jovan
Zebic today accused Avramovic of planning to usurp the central
monetary institution in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is that one man aspires to be the Yugoslav
National Bank and wishes to seize authority of governments and
other state institutions and to dictate to us how we should act in
our affairs," Zebic said in a parliament debate.

NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks were pushed up
again today by another mild reading on inflation that sent

</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 3.53
to 600.78, its first finish above 600.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose this morning after the government reported that
consumer prices climbed 0.4 percent in April, but that excluding
the volatile energy and food sectors, the core rate of inflation
was just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The markets were also helped by a Commerce Department report
that retail sales dropped by 0.3 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Both reports indicated economic growth is not strong enough to
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates at
its next policy meeting on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices improved for the third straight session, with the
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipping to about 6.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Doctors to Treat Elderly in Short Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of doctors trained to
treat older people is "woefully inadequate" in the United States,
according to a study released today.
</P>
<P>
At least 20,000 physicians with geriatric training are needed
to provide appropriate care for the current population of over 30
million older Americans, said the study provided by the
Washington-based Alliance for Aging Research.
</P>
<P>
Medical schools lack teachers of geriatrics, and too few
medical students are choosing the courses that are available, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 126 medical schools, only 14 require a course
in geriatrics and fewer than 3 percent of recent medical school
graduates select such courses, the study added.
</P>
<P>
The alliance issued a report four years ago warning of the
shortage. It led to certification of 2,700 more doctors as
geriatricians for a total of 6,784 nationwide. But the alliance
noted the total U.S. physician population is 684,414 and the
emphasis on geriatrics is beginning to diminish.
</P>
<P>
With the nation faced with a rapidly aging American population,
the alliance called for an urgent need to start giving incentives
to medical students and schools to become interested in
geriatrics.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Germany
may join to develop cutting-edge technology for future aircraft
and unmanned vehicles to fill European and U.S. military needs
beyond the mid-2000, the weekly U.S. Defense News said in its
latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The potential project would revive research efforts by the two
countries on highly maneuverable vehicles and tailless flight, the
paper quoted industrial and government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The effort is seen as an adjunct to work on an experimental
aircraft called X-31 which was terminated in 1994 by the United
States because of a funding shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The 250 million U.S. dollar program was terminated by the
United States in December 1994 due to lack of funding, despite
pleas from the German Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1986 agreement launching the X-31 program, Germany
funded 25 percent of the program while the United States shared 75
percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether a similar funding split would be
maintained in a new program, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The X-31 technology demonstration program was aimed at
enhancing fighter maneuverability, using engine thrust as a method
of flight control rather than highly visible tails and control
flaps.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Contributes Funding for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- As part of the international
effort to rebuild war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the World
Bank's Board of Executive Directors today approved the financing
for three projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 40 million U.S. dollar financing, the World Bank
will contribute 10 million dollars for the War Victims
Rehabilitation Project, the total cost of which is some 30 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 to 70,000 war victims will benefit from the
project. It is one of the many projects intended to alleviate the
heavy costs of lost productivity and long-term disruption of the
social fabric of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 250,000 people were killed and
175,000 injured during the war while about 5,000 people lost limbs
and require prostheses.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will contribute another 10 million dollar loan
toward the total project cost of 32 million dollars to help the
Emergency Education Reconstruction Project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank will provide a 20 million dollar credit
to help restore safe and reliable heating to Sarajevo apartments
which had been disconnected from the district heating system as a
result of war.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1995, the number of apartments served by the
district heating system had fallen from 50,000 to 16,000, while
the number of household gas connections had increased from 15,000
to 85,000, of which about 60,000 are self-made connections.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Bank Council Demands Governor Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the National Bank
of Yugoslavia (NBY) demanded today that the Federal Assembly
urgently dissolve the NBY Council or sack its governor Dragoslav
Avramovic to end the deadlock in the NBY's work.
</P>
<P>
A letter, signed by six council members, said that such a
decision aims to prevent "further economic damage at this crucial
period for our country."
</P>
<P>
It said Avramovic had changed his conduct following recent
talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Paris which
"the council cannot explain or accept."
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav delegation headed by Avramovic held talks in Paris
with IMF representatives early last month in hopes of restoring
ties and requesting fresh credits from the financial organization
and other creditors, but the negotiations failed to achieve any
results.
</P>
<P>
The council said further cooperation with the governor "is
impossible" and Avramovic first clashed with the vice-governors,
then with his deputy, and then made "a series of tactless
statements, illogical demands and unfounded accusations" against
the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic, the top banker of the country who saved the national
economy from collapse in early 1994, said the government should be
blamed for the failure of the negotiations because Yugoslavia
insisted that it be the sole successor of the old Yugoslav
federation disintegrated in 1992, which was rejected by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council on Monday evening rejected Avramovic's
demand that he alone take charge of negotiations with
international financial institutions, mainly the IMF and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The council said in a statement released today that contacts
with international financial organizations came within the
competence of the Yugoslav government, the National Bank and other
banks.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Avramovic's demand to be solely in charge of
the talks "has already caused a lot of damage in (the process of)
creating conditions for carrying out a credit and monetary policy
and for increasing production and exports."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Starts 4-Day State Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here this afternoon for a four-day state visit, indicating
that France would back the European Union (EU) proposal for a
partial lifting of the EU ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, the first French president to visit Britain since 1984,
was welcomed by his host Queen Elizabeth II at the Horse Guards
Parade ground before riding in an open carriage to the Buchingham
Palace for lunch.
</P>
<P>
The Buchingham Palace announced that the French president was
served with the best British beef fillet with noodles, which is
carefully prepared for Chirac in an effort to persuade France to
support an early lifting of the global ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
France was the first European country to declare a unilateral
ban on British beef when the British government announced in March
a possible link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for London earlier today, Chirac told reporters
that the French government would back an EU proposal for a lifting
of the embargo on some beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
However, Chirac maintained that the BSE problem required a
European solution and that the ban as a whole must be lifted by
the EU Commission with scientific backing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was quoted
by the BBC television as saying there were clear indications that
France would eventually support a partial lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Chirac and British Prime Minister John
Major Wednesday morning, the beef crisis will also be considered
to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The French president is also to make a rare address to both
houses of parliament Wednesday afternoon, in which he will urge
Britain to play a full part in the development of European
integration.

<HEADLINE> US to Deploy Aircraft to Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
announced here today that it would begin deploying 34 military
aircraft to Qatar at the end of June as part of an Airpower
Expeditionary Force (AEF).
</P>
<P>
The AEF deployment is to include F-15s, F-16s and KC-135s from
the Air Force bases in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and
North Dakota, the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Bruce Riedel told
reporters at the Pentagon that the aircraft would participate in
Operation Southern Watch, which enforces the no-fly zone over
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that the decision to deploy the U.S. aircraft
to Qatar came after the talks last week between U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry and Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassim al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Perry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the
sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Qatar and its
Gulf Cooperation Council partners, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Riedel disclosed that in a separate agreement between the two
nations, the United States had also begun prepositioning
land-based equipment in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A full battalion had already been deployed and another brigade
and some headquarters elements were currently being deployed, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Muslims, Croats Agree on Defense Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's Muslim and Croat
officials have agreed on a new defense law to integrate and
strengthen the military forces of their federation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after their one-day talks with American and
European officials. The accord cleared the last hurdle before the
United States begins a program to arm and train federation forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a kick-off meeting early this morning, U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told leaders of Bosnia's
Muslim-Croat Federation that only when the armed forces of Muslims
and Croats in Bosnia were integrated under a new defense law, the
United States could help train and arm the federation military.
</P>
<P>
Christopher stressed that Washington believed the federation
was the cornerstone of the Bosnian peace, and the United States
would continue its efforts to help strengthen the federation
created two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Farms' Grain Stocks Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Stocks of wheat on Canadian farms
dropped by the end of March to their lowest level in the past
seven years, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of wheat on Canadian farms were 8,6 million tons, 1.4
million tons less than those at the end of March 1995, the federal
fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
Recent U.S. reports of major winterkill losses for winter wheat
and delays in spring wheat planting indicated that wheat may
become even more expensive in the months ahead, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
And Canadian farm stocks of barley sank to 4,4 million tons,
the lowest level since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Strong demand in both domestic and international markets,
coupled with lower than normal carry-in supplies, lowered farm
stocks of wheat and barley to 30 percent of post-harvest levels,
it added.
</P>
<P>
However, farm stocks of canola were the highest on record,
standing at 1,95 million tons by the end of March. This, the
agency said, has resulted from increased international competition
for export markets.
