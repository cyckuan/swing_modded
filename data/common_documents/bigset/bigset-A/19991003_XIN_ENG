<HEADLINE> Nyerere's Health Improves Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The health of Tanzania's
former president Julius Nyerere admitted to a London hospital for
leukemia has improved slightly but he is still in a critical
condition, an official statement said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Saint Thomas Hospital said the 77-year-old
African statesman has hopes for recovery but still needs a life
support machine in the next two to three days, said the statement
issued by the President's Press Secretary Geoffrey Nkurlu.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was
admitted to the hospital eight days ago. He is under
round-the-clock intensive care with his families at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has asked Tanzanian people
to pray for Nyerere, while the first lady Anna Mkapa is offering
help in London, Nkurlu said.
</P>
<P>
Medical checks have found that Nyerere's blood pressure is
normal, jaundice complications are decreasing, and his lungs are
less affected.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, people kept on listening to
the radio or watching TV to learn the development of Nyerere's
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The illness of Nyerere has also caused concerns in other
African countries. Students at the University of Zimbabwe are
conducting prayers for the major figure in post-colonial Africa,
said the press secretary to Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye, who is visiting the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to gain independence from
Britain in 1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar isles in
1964 to form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

MEXICO CITY, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo expressed Saturday his condolences to the people who died
in the strong earthquake that hit the state of Oaxaca on September
30.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government will do its utmost to provide
assistance to the state of Oaxaca where the seism caused the
biggest damage.
</P>

Maldonado in the Oaxaca Pacific Ocean coast, some 350 kilometers
southeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican presidential office said that damage to schools
will prevent some 390,000 children from going to school next
Monday in Oaxaca, where the official death toll was 22.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes U.S. Allegations on Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Agriculture Ministry on
Saturday refuted U.S. allegations that Iraq has distributed only
60 percent of its agricultural imports in the first four phases of
the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said in a statement that
80 percent of the agricultural imports had been handed out while
the other 20 percent are scheduled to be distributed according to
the actual needs of the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the distribution figures had been
audited by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(UNFAO).
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant State Secretary Martin Indyk alleged in a
report recently Baghdad should be responsible for the sufferings
of the Iraqi people because it only distributed 60 percent of its
agricultural imports.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman accused Washington of spreading lies and
deliberately ignoring the aggressive attitudes of the U.S. and
British representatives at the U.N. 661 Sanctions Committee in
impeding Iraq's agricultural contracts with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British envoys at the Sanctions Committee suspended
11 agricultural contracts in the fifth phase of the oil-for-food
program and seven contracts in the sixth phase, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that those blocked contracts include veterinary
appliances, special generators for poultry incubators, special
vehicles for transporting chickens, 7,000 tons of soybeans and
1,800 irrigation units.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and Britain of delaying or
suspending the endorsement of its contracts, arguing that the
humanitarian program has failed to alleviate the sufferings of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also refuted another allegation made by Indyk
that Iraqi government prevented growing rice in the country,
saying that rice-growing areas reached 80 percent of the arable
land in southern Iraq's top rice-growing provinces of Najaf and
Qadissiya.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's central and
southern regions are facing famine as a result of drought and
local authorities have characterized the situation as "desperate".
</P>
<P>
The international aid agencies have reportedly not yet
responded to the worsening humanitarian crises in these regions
despite their announcement to resume relief operations last week.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations suspended aid operations in the country
after the killing of the UNICEF doctor, Ayub Sheikh Yarow, last
month.
</P>
<P>
The most serious regions are the Gedo, Bay and Bakol where
death toll exceeds 23 people mainly children and elderly everyday.
 Reports from Bakol region indicate that 12 people die every day
for famine and starvation after over 20 villages surrounding the
main town of Huddor had fallen short of water.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people and their herds are now on the move
towards the main towns of Huddor, Tieglow and Baidoa in search of
water and food. " But the concern is that the children, elderly
people and the cattle can't make the long journeys on foot," said
Hussein Abdi Mohamed, a local doctor operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
Similar crises are also being reported in the central regions
of Galgudud and Mudug. Yussuf Hassan Eyow, the governor of
Galgudud region, said most of the water wells in the region had
dried up while others can not operate for lack of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Eyow said there's serious food and water shortages in the
regions and warned against humanitarian catastrophe unless
something is done quickly.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Ask for Review of Uruguay Round: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will ask for a review of the
Uruguay Round trade pact because its implementation is not in the
interest of developing countries, Egyptian Minister of Trade and
Supply Ahmed Gowaili said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have a general understanding that the
Uruguay Round's application was "highly arbitrary," Gowaili said
while addressing the inaugural session of the general conference
of the G-15 chambers of commerce and industry.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round, a trade pact named after the country where
the negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
predecessor of the World Trade Organization (WTO), began in 1986,
lays down procedures for opening up markets.
</P>
<P>
The developing states have blamed the Uruguay Round for working
for "the good of developed countries and against that of the
developing world," Gowaili said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would push for a review of the pact at next month's WTO
meeting in Seattle, the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference of the G-15 chambers of commerce and industry is
to focus on the impact of world policies on the development of the
developing countries and to deal with the challenges of the new
world order, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said Egypt will host a G-15 summit in 2000. The country
organized a summit in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, formed in 1989, comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports "Disastrous" Conditions in Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United
Nations humanitarian operations has said that thousands of people
were starving to death in an area of the Republic of Congo, U.N.
officials said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, reported "disastrous" conditions in Kinkala,
some 80 kilometers from the nation's capital of Brazzaville, with
thousands close to death because of severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, 10 people a day have died from starvation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The first U.N. humanitarian mission since fighting broke out
last December in the African country travelled with a military
escort to Kinkala Wednesday. The team included relief workers from
U.N. agencies, donor and government representatives, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Mello appealed to the donor community to provide
urgent and generous funding to U.N. agencies and non-governmental
organizations in the Republic of Congo to enable them to provide
much-needed food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Congo was caught up in the turmoil from the
large neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo several years ago.
The conflict resulted in more than 10,000 deaths in Brazzaville
alone.

<HEADLINE> SAfrica VP Urges to Reduce Dependence on Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Vice
President Jacob Zuma urged on Saturday to reduse his country's
dependence on the sale of gold.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said at the opening of the annual summit of
the National Economic Development and Labor Council (Nedlac) at
Gallagher Estate in Midrand near Johannesburg that despite the
"meteoric" rise of the gold price there was a need to find ways to
reduce South Africa's continued dependence on the sale of gold.
</P>
<P>
"This makes us extremely vulnerable to such price fluctuations
and the whims of nations that, while consuming large amounts of
gold, do not have any role in its production," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
It was encouraging that the percentage of exports accounted for
by gold had declined by 55 percent to under 20 percent over the
last 20 years, Zuma said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Plan to Better Health System in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
presented goals and guidelines aimed at rebuilding an efficient
and modern health service for Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, by
using international humanitarian aid, U.N. officials said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The six-month plan, launched Friday in Kosovo, was developed by
the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK), which is in charge of the civil administration in the
Serbian province, and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The plan strives to guide immediate relief efforts, while also
focusing on international aid towards long-term development of a
system to be sustained by the future autonomous Kosovo government,
which is expected to be set up in the wake of proposed elections
organized by the U.N. Mission.
</P>
<P>
"UNMIK is firmly committed to leaving behind a better system
than it found when it assumed the responsibility for the interim
administration in Kosovo," said Hannu Vuori, UNMIK head of
health and social services.
</P>
<P>
A key aspect of the strategy, crafted in consultation with
Kosovar officials, is to reorient the current "hospital-driven"
system towards one focused on family medicine and preventive care.
It also lays out targets for improving children's services and
maternity and mental health care.
</P>
<P>
Since August, UNMIK has attempted to maintain a multi-ethnic
staff at the hospital. Responding to incidents during the past
week, the U.N. Mission began providing armed escorts for some
workers.
</P>
<P>
It is of a big challenge to the U.N. Mission to maintain a
multi-ethnic society in Kosovo simply because most of Serbians and
other non-Albanians were pushed by force out of the autonomous
province, the Yugoslav Government has said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Major Hospitals Paralyzed in Doctors' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean junior doctors' strike
has entered its 11th day and paralyzed Zimbabwe's major hospitals
including Harare Central hospital.
</P>
<P>
Senior doctors and consultants are currently manning the
institutions where only patients in serious conditions are
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Nyasha Masuka, spokesman for the walkout doctors, told the
Zimbabwe News Agency Saturday that the doctors were still holding
consultations with the ministries of Public Service, Labor and
Social Welfare and Health and Child Welfare to resolve their
problems.
</P>
<P>
Masuka said the strike would continue until the government meet
their demands.
</P>
<P>
The government on Friday announced an increase in the junior
doctors' on- call allowances from 472 Zimbabwean dollars (12.4
U.S. dollars) to 1,500 Zimbabwean dollars (39.4 U.S. dollars) a
call on week days and 1,750 Zimbabwean dollars (46 U.S. dollars)
on holidays and over weekends.
</P>
<P>
However the doctors have rejected the offer saying they wanted
their basic salaries to be reviewed because the on-calls were
overtime and not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
A junior doctor in Zimbabwe earns a gross salary of 15,000
Zimbabwean dollars (394 U.S. dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
The country's ailing health delivery system has suffered
setbacks because of financial constraints and brain drain to
neighboring countries and Britain where salaries are much better
than at home.

<HEADLINE> Lions to Be Moved from Marloth Park in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Mpumalanga Parks Board
(MPB) announced Friday that it would move the resident lions of
Marloth Park, where a person was killed and eaten by a pride
earlier this week, to a holding facility in the Kruger National
Park.
</P>
<P>
The MPB said in a statement that the lions would be tested for
bovine tuberculosis and the final decision on where to move them
would be made, based on the outcome of the tests.
</P>
<P>
The plan, however, is likely to face resistance from residents
of this small town on the Kruger National Park's southern border
in the Mpumalanga Province in northeastern South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Marloth Park property owners association Chairman Brian
Welby-Cooke said there is no conclusive evidence that these lions
were responsible for the death of a man on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that it had also not been conclusively proven that
once a lion had eaten a human they would necessarily become
man-eaters.
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey of owners, 95 percent voted against the
removal of lions in the area.
</P>
<P>
The area is unique as it allows wild animals to roam freely
through the town and the majority of residents do not want this
changed.
</P>
<P>
Officers from MPB will meet with Welby-Cooke and a delegation
of property owners on Saturday to discuss their plan.
</P>
<P>
Jan Muller of the MPB said a group of between 22 and 24 lions
entered the area last year from the Kruger National Park and were
trapped in the town by a flooded river.
</P>
<P>
They subsequently settled in the area and some lost their fear
of humans.
</P>
<P>
At least nine of these lions were responsible for an attack on
stock in a neighboring farm. Six were killed by farmers and the
other three were darted and taken back to the game reserve.
</P>
<P>
"This means that about 12 lions have remained in the area. We
believe that some of these could have been responsible for the
attack on Tuesday night," Muller said.
</P>
<P>
"Because we were unable to isolate the attackers and check one
of their stomach contents for human remains, we have decided to
relocate all of the resident lions."
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the resident lions would not, however, mean
the end of lions in the area, as other lions from the Kruger
National Park will still be able to enter and leave the area.
</P>
<P>
Muller said the hunt for the lions would probably start next
week.
</P>
<P>
Komatipoort police station commissioner Captain Vusi Mdakane
said no workers in the town were reported missing and the dead
person, believed to be a solar panel thief, seemed to have come
from outside the area.
</P>
<P>
He said police were going to nearby villages with the torn
remains of a pair of dark blue trousmrs to see if anyone could
identify them. They were also watching for missing persons reports
in the area to identify the victim.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed medical reports indi30:e the victim was a man.
</P>
<P>
Marloth Park Game Ranger Johan van der Walt said this was the
fourth attack in the area but the first fatal one.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Says Good Friday Deal Could be "Finished" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams said on Saturday that the Good Friday peace
deal was finished if pro-British unionists continued to prevent
the nationalist minority from sharing power.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to a youth conference of Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, held in the Ireland Republic capital of
Dublin, Adams accused the Ulster Unionist party of engaging in a
high risk strategy to keep Irish republicans out of a
power-sharing Northern Ireland executive.
</P>
<P>
He said if Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble "does not
face up to his responsibilities then the Good Friday agreement is
finished," the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has refused to set up a power-sharing administration
with Sinn Fein until the Irish Republican Army (IRA) hands in
weapons from its 30-year-long war against British rule.
</P>
<P>
He delivered the warning ahead of a round-table meeting with
Trimble on Monday as part of a review of the peace process chaired
by U.S. Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Trimble was expected to speak at a youth conference of his own
party in Belfast later on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Observe Strike on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
will observe a dawn-to-dusk hartal (destructive strike) on Sunday
to back its demands including the resignation of the government
and early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The four parties of the opposition alliance -- the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and
the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) -- brought out
separate torch processions in the capital city on Saturday in
support for Sunday's countrywide shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The four parties gave the hartal call simultaneously on
September 22 to intensify their "one-point demand" to oust the
Awami League government.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the BNP issued here Saturday afternoon said
hospitals, ambulances, medicine shops, restaurants and vehicles
meant for carrying journalists and emergency power and water
supply will remain out of the purview of the strike program.
</P>
<P>
This will be the 11th hartal program of the opposition alliance
this year.
</P>
<P>
Destructive strike is very common in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties call strikes to oppose the ruling party while
the latter adopts anti-strike activities, often resulting in
clashes and causing heavy economic losses.

<HEADLINE> High-level DPRK Official to Visit South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific Committee Chairman of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Yong-sun is
expected to visit South Korea at the invitation of Hyundai Group,
said Saturday the South Korea's largest business group.
</P>
<P>
DPRK leader Kim Jong-il had permitted Kim Yong-sun's visit for
further Hyundai-DPRK economic cooperation, said Hyundai Group
Chairman Chung Mong-hun, who had just returned after a five-day
visit to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed many things (with Kim Jong-il) and I believe the
talks will infuse a new vitality into inter-Korean cooperation,"
said Chung Ju-yung at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Kim Yong-sun will come to Seoul in December when
another inter-Korean basketball matches are held," said Chung Mong-
hun at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Kim Jong-il's directive, a DPRK basketball team,
originally slated to visit Seoul in early 2000, will come in
December as a return visit to the Hyundai basketball team which is
now in Pyongyang for friendship matches, said the Hyundai chairman.
</P>
<P>
During Chung's visit, Hyundai and the DPRK committee agreed to
expand the ongoing Kumgang Mountain tour program by attracting
foreign tourists to the mountain area, and the committee promised
to grant Hyundai exclusive right to operate the expanded tour
program.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to establish an industrial
complex on DPRK's western coast.

<HEADLINE> Resurgence of Gold Bodes Well for South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The recent rise in the gold
price was good news for South Africa's economy as it save some
jobs in the gold mining industry, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there will be some saving of jobs," he told
reporters at Johannesburg International Airport on his return from
the annual joint meetings of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the impact of this will be felt long into the
future. The comeback will allow for longer planning horizons in
the industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
The gold price rocketed by several U.S. dollars an ounce
earlier in the week after an announcement on Sunday by the
European Central Bank that its 15 members would abide by a cap on
gold sales of 400 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the most important element of the European Central
Bank's decision was the message that gold remained significant in
the management of monetary reserves.
</P>
<P>
Lobbying by South Africa among central banks undoubtedly
contributed to the European decision, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
But Manuel cautioned against over-optimism about the future of
the gold mining industry.
</P>
<P>
"There will always be difficulties, especially given the fact
that a number of mines are as marginal as they are," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ore bodies are deep and the ore grades are not as high as
they were, making extraction very expensive."
</P>
<P>
On the past week's meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, he
said the focus was clearly on debt relief and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The spotlight fell largely on Africa, and new countries to
qualify for debt relief included Tanzania. Zambia was also in
line.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reduce poverty had taken a new direction, and the
World Bank and the IMF would now work together to oversee this
programme, Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh approach provided for poor countries to submit relief
 strategies with targets which they had drawn up themselves.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the Southern African Development Community members
would have to work together in some respects, especially with
regard to training and retaining public servants adept in
financial management.
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that we have a high quality of service in
our treasuries," Manuel said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government to Place Niigata Chuo Bank Under State Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's
Financial Reconstruction Commission (FRC) decided Saturday to
place Niigata Chuo Bank, a second-tier regional bank, under state
control.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the decision at an emergency meeting in
response to a request by the troubled bank on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank will continue operations as usual and its deposits
will be fully protected by Japan's semi-governmental Deposit
Insurance Corp. (DIC).
</P>
<P>
Niigata Chuo, based in Niigata on the coast of Japan Sea, is
Japan's fifth second-tier regional bank to be declared insolvent
by the FRC under the finance-system revitalization law that was
enacted by the Japanese parliament last October following Kokumin
Bank, Kofuku Bank, Tokyo Sowa Bank and Namihaya Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided Saturday to provide unlimited,
unsecured loans to Niigata Chuo for its daily operations.
</P>
<P>
The administrators will try to find financial institutions to
take over the bank. If they fail to do so within a year, the bank
will be turned into a bridge bank, a state-controlled organ
charged with taking over deposit-taking and lending operations
until an acquirer can be found.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which had developed a capital deficit of 14.1 billion
yen (134 million dollars) by the end of September last year, told
the FRC that it may soon become unable to pay depositors because
depositors had withdrawn more than 100 billion yen (947 million
dollars) in the period between June 10 and September 30.
</P>
<P>
The bank's board of directors decided Friday to give up an
attempt to rehabilitate the bank on their own and appealed to the
FRC to be under state control.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Former Militants Ask for Permission to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Scores of former Egyptian Islamic
radicals on Saturday asked the government to allow them to set up
a political party which they said will peacefully advocate Islamic
principles.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five people signed a petition submitted to the
government's Committee of Parties' Affairs, requesting permission
to form The Party of Sharia, or Islamic creed, according to
Mamdouh Ismail, a leader of the group.
</P>
<P>
"The party's goal is to win the right to express the hopes and
wishes of a large sector of the Egyptian people who want to see
Islamic law implemented peacefully," Ismail said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ismail, a lawyer who defends Islamic militants being tried for
anti-government activities, expressed hope that the party will be
legalized "to create an atmosphere of confidence between the
Islamic groups and the government."
</P>
<P>
It is doubtful that the government, which does not recognize
religious groups, will grant the permission. It has rejected a
similar request from a less-radical group on the grounds that its
political agenda resembled that of existing parties. All political
parties in Egypt are required to have government approval.
</P>
<P>
Among those who signed the petition and the party's political
manifesto are former militants or relatives of imprisoned members
of Egypt's two largest radical groups, al-Gamma al-Islamiya, or
the Islamic Group, and al-Jihad al-Islami, the Muslim Holy
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
Both groups led an insurgency aimed at toppling the secular
government and replacing it with strict Islamic rule. More than
1,200 people, mainly policemen and militants, were killed in the
violence that began in 1992 but has quieted down in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Many of those who signed the petition, including Ismail, spent
years in jail for participating in the 1981 assassination of
President Anwar Sadat or other violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's main rebel leaders
Foday Sankoh and Johnny Koroma Saturday played down their
differences and reassured that they would go home to implement the
Lome peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
 Sankoh told a joint briefing in Liberia's capital Monrovia
before leaving for Sierra leone that they have put their
differences behind them, according to reports reaching here.
However, the two leaders did not specify their internal
differences.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Freetown to help consolidate the peace and
contribute to the transformation of our society," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have now agreed that enough time has been wasted and it's
high time that we return home and put this process on the road,"
said former military ruler Koroma after two days of talks with
Sankoh in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"We were able to clear any misunderstandings or disagreements
that were impeding the ongoing peace process," said Koroma.
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to the role of Liberia's president Charles
Taylor in bridging their differences.
</P>
<P>
"Sankoh and I have agreed that there will be no more war in
Sierra Leone. The war is now over and it is now time to jaw-jaw,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In another latest development, the west African peace-keeping
force of ECOMOG has ordered all representatives of the factors
involved in Sierra Leone's crisis out of the capital Freetown for
one week to enable them to start disarmament exercise in the
country.

<P>
ECOMOG Field Commander Gabriel Kpamber said in a statement
released Friday that ECOMOG is demanding free and safe access to
every part of the country under the control of the rebels.

"This should be done with a view to paving a way for immediate
 construction of arms collection sites and demobilization centers
in designated locations all over Sierra Leone, " the statement

QUITO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha volcano
has already entered a phase of slow eruption with spewing of
ashes, lava and violent explosions in its crater.
</P>
<P>
The National Polytechnical School Geophysics Institute reported
Saturday that hot, incandescent rocks have been observed in the
dome, or hardened lava stopper of the crater, that rise because of
the pressure exerted by the magma toward the surface.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon was observed Wednesday night by the crew of a
commercial airliner who saw a "red spot" in the crater of the
mountain 4,794 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The Pichincha volcano has two main peaks, the active Guagua
Pichincha, 12 kilometers west of Ecuador's capital city of Quito,
and the inactive Rucu Pichincha, which stands as a natural barrier
between the volcano's crater and Quito.
</P>
<P>
Guagua Pichincha has been and is still an active volcano. It's
last major eruption was in 1660 and lasted nine days. Quito was
covered by 25 centimeters of ash and volcanic fragments. No one
was killed.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Urges Africa to Develop Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Sunday said it is impossible to fight the AIDS pandemic
and reduce poverty in a continent plagued by weak economies.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks at the Lusaka International Airport
shortly before he left for the Victoria Falls town in Zimbabwe
where he would attend the 3rd Southern Africa International Dialog
(SAID).
</P>
<P>
The president, who described the summit as very important to
the African economies, would be among 14 other heads of state and
government scheduled to attend the conference whose focus would be
on the problem of HIV/AIDS and the growing level of poverty in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said it is impossible to talk about poverty alleviation or
HIV pandemic by third world countries at the moment because of the
huge money required to tackle the issues.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the meeting would also focus on how science and
technology could be utilized to maximize production of goods and
services in order to improve economic performance in Africa and
reduce its dependence on the West.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that third world countries could cooperate and make
their economies better and hence improve their trade thereby
translating into independence from the West," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the wars that are going around in Africa could
only be minimized with bigger and stronger economies, because some
of the wars stemmed from bad sharing of the wealth or the lack of
it at all by the countries involved.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Sunday
issued a strong warning against fake foreign investors pretending
to be manufactures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Jazzman Chikwakwa
said that a number of foreign traders have entered this country
under the cover of being manufacturers to set up big industries
and yet are just traders importing clothes into Zambia and running
super markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the commerce ministry has embarked on a program to
scrutinize all investors and flush out of the country anyone found
violating the terms of the contract.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister urged the investors failing to make it on
their own in the manufacturing industry to go into partnership
with Zambians in the same sector or leave so that space can be
created for serious and committed investors.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will continue to facilitate the visits
by experts from the business sector in developed nations to Zambia
as this is the only way to expose small scale entrepreneurs to the
outside world and make their operations more viable, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime and Defense
Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh said Sunday his country took
peace as a strategic option in Middle East affairs and was keen
to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Jordanian position during his meeting with
Italian Chief of Defense Staff Mario Arpino, who is visiting
Amman over bilateral ties and the peace process in the region,
Jordan`s official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Petra said the Italian general praised Jordan`s role as a peace
broker in the region, and expressed appreciation for the Hashemite
leadership which had gained international respect for the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been playing a key role in narrowing down the
differences between Israel and Arabs since it signed a peace
treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Amman supports the struggle by the Palestinians to establish
of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital while
trying to maintain normal diplomatic and economic ties with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to give up the part of the holy city it captured
in the 1967 Middle East War. Jerusalem is apparently one of the
most sensitive issues in the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Calls for Balance Between Development, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday called upon the developing countries to
enhance construction projects and programs to enable greater
participation of the rural folk in socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
A transport policy needs to strike a balance between three key
issues -- the environment, the economy and users' preferences, he
said in his speech at the opening of the week-long 21st World Road
Congress here, which was read out by Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that roads and other models of transportation
represented the key to enhance quality of life.
</P>
<P>
He said the dilemma facing many developing countries is to
balance development and environment, adding that in Malaysia
sustainable development with the impending emphasis on the
protection of the environment has been given priority.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although the world subscribes to various
environmental declarations including the 1992 Rio summit where the
"rich" would contribute to the poor to prevent those countries
from cutting trees for development, the contribution from the rich
was not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Malaysia, adequate measures were taken to
minimize environmental damage in major development projects
including road construction.
</P>
<P>
The 21st World Road Congress, with its theme being "Is
Privatization of Road Infrastructure the Answer for Accelerated
Road Development in the 21st Century," was jointly organized by
the World Road Association and the Malaysian government, and has
attracted some 2,000 participants, including more than a dozen of
ministers, from some 90 countries.

the Central Government will give more support to ethnic minority
areas, and introduce more funds, technology, and trained people to
those areas.
</P>
<P>
The government should help ethnic minority areas build
infrastructure like water conservation, transport,
telecommunications, and energy supplies that will play an
important role in economic development, he said, and should work
to eliminate poverty in ethnic areas and promote the development
of central and western China where most ethnic groups live.
</P>
<P>
Education in those areas should be improved, he continued, with
more science and technology for ethnic groups and more ethnic
minority people trained.
</P>
<P>
Contradictions among the people of various ethnic groups and in
ethnic areas need to be properly dealt with and disputes should be
solved promptly. An effort will be made to fight sabotage of
national splittists, he emphasized, adding that it is in the
interest of all Chinese to increase national unity and maintain
unification.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 50 Injured in Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and about 50
others were injured in Bangladesh on Sunday during the
opposition-organized dawn-to-dusk countrywide hartal (destructive
strike).
</P>
<P>
One activist of the major opposition -- the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) -- was gunned down in a clash between pro-
and anti-hartal activists in Sherpur district, about 150
kilometers north of here, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour battle at Sherpur town between supporters of the
opposition and anti-strike activists of the ruling Awami League
also left 20 persons injured, including one constable, a
superintendent of police was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 people were injured during the shutdown in northeastern
Netrakona town, about 140 km from Dhaka, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said some 50 opposition marchers were arrested by
police in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led opposition alliance, which also comprises the
Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote
(Islamic Solidarity Front), enforced the strike to press home
their demands including the resignation of the government and
early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The government, on its part, enforced tight security in the
capital with a call for citizens to go to work as usual and bring
the vehicles on the streets, and the Awami League and its front
organizations brought out processions in Dhaka to protest the
nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the strong presence of police and
para-military Bangladesh Rifles, traffic was thin in the streets,
and only some rickshaws, mini-cabs and a few buses were seen
plying in the streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Almost all schools and shopping centers remained shut although
police authorities had earlier assured adequate security for
keeping shopping centers open.
</P>
<P>
The dawn-to-dust strike came two weeks after opposition parties
enforced a three-day work stoppage in mid-September as part of
their movement to unseat the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition blamed the government of "inefficient, corrupt,
undemocratic and subservient to India," and the government denied
these charges.

<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua)-- For two days the people of
Beijing have been strolling the streets enjoying the beautiful

New China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Ten million pots of flowers have been put at many intersections
and along major streets, turning the city into a sea of flowers.

000 pots of flowers in various designs.
</P>
<P>
People have taken to the streets to see all the flowers during

Beijing is as beautiful and attractive as it is and workers have
spent almost half a year preparing the decorations, using about
200,000 pots of fine flowers.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Start Exporting Sugar Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will start
exporting surplus sugar in November this year, the first of its
kind in the history of the Horn of Africa country, the Capital
weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 tons of sugar, worth 22 million U.S. dollars, are
expected to be exported by the end of June, 2000, the Ethiopian
Sugar Industry Support Center (ESISC) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The total sugar production this year in Ethiopia was reported
to be 275,000 tons, much higher than last year's 175,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sugar for export will come from the Finchaa Sugar
Factory's output, ESISC said.
</P>
<P>
The Finchaa Sugar Factory, the fourth of its kind in Ethiopia,
was inaugurated in April 1998 with an investment of 1.8 billion
birr (about 220 million U.S. dollars). It was designed to produce
85,000 tons of sugar a year.
</P>
<P>
Sugar export is expected to help diversify Ethiopia's economy
and reduce its dependence on coffee export, which currently
accounts for around 60 percent of foreign currency earnings.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Catholic Church Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua)-- Beijing's 300-year-old Xuanwumen
Catholic Church, which is believed to be the oldest Catholic
church in China, reopened this morning after a couple of months of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
This cathedral is the head of the Beijing Diocese. It was
begun by the Franciscan priest, Giovani da Montecorvino in 1605
and later enlarged by the Jesuit Adam Schall, in 1650. In 1904, it
was rebuilt after a major fire.
</P>
<P>
As the first Catholic Church in China, South Church (its former
name) has seen the unfolding of China's modern history and is a
rather valuable relic, according to Joseph Liu, the secretary-
general with the Beijing Catholic Church Administrative Commission.
</P>
<P>
But after centuries of wind, rain, and earthquakes, the
cathedral was in dire need of repairs, Liu says. Repairs were
delayed for years because of a lack of funds. At the beginning of
this year, the Beijing government took a look at the situation and
decided to appropriate 1.3 million yuan (149,000 U.S. dollars) for
major repairs.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project began in August and included interior
repairs, repairing the cross, and installing new windows, and the
old church has been given a complete facelift.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Officials to Meet Again on Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Palestinian Safe
Passage Committee is scheduled to meet again Sunday evening to
iron out differences over the opening of the safe passage linking
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the
Committee can settle the contentious issues concerning the opening
of the passage soon.
</P>
<P>
The passage will be opened on Sunday as scheduled but due to
some differences between the two sides, its opening has been
postponed, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met at Neveh Ilan Hotel
near Jerusalem for more than five hours Saturday evening on the
opening of the passage.
</P>
<P>
Orit Messer-Harel, Spokeswoman of the Israeli Public Security,
announced after the meeting that the two sides decided to postpone
the opening of the route and they "agreed to meet in the coming
days to overcome the differences."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after midnight, Ben-Ami said he hoped the
two sides will reach an understanding soon based on two key
principles: security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The two sides during their talks failed to narrow gaps over
which side should issue the magnetic security cards and where. And
they also disagreed over whether Israel is entitled to arrest
Palestinians suspected of security offenses as they use the
passage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiating team, led by Minister of Civil
Affairs Jamil Tarif, went to consult with Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat after the talks broke up.
</P>
<P>
The passage, linking Gaza and the West Bank city of Hebron, has
to be opened October 1 under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed
early September. But the opening has been postponed for two days
until Sunday by the Israeli side due to Israel's Jewish holiday.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Celebration activities should
be organized to have the Hong Kong people to know more about China
's mainland, said Anson Chan, administrative secretary of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I like the way the carnival is organized to represent the
theme of the history and development of modern China so that
participants can learn more about China while enjoying themselves,
" the secretary said at a garden carnival in celebration of the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
sponsored by the organizations of public servants Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that it is of great significance to have more
activities initiated to demonstrate the dramatic progress China
has made over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts in the past 50 years, China has been turned
from a poor, closed agricultural country into one with the fastest
economic growth in the world, she said, adding that China has also
played an important role on the world political stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, she said, by the year 2020, China
will become one of the three world's largest economic powers. "The
dramatic achievements it has made is a great encouragement to us,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Hong Kong and the mainland have been as close
as lips and teeth, she noted. Apart from serving as a bridge for
China's foreign trade, Hong Kong is an important partner of the
mainland in the economic development, scientific research and
exchange of talents, she added.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Hong Kong will continue to do its best
in China's reforms and modernization, she noted.
</P>
<P>
There are more and more opportunities for Hong Kong public
servants to make contact with officials in the mainland, she said.
The SAR government has in recent years launched a variety of
activities to strengthen the coordination and exchanges in all
fields to promote a mutual development, she added.

<HEADLINE> More Women Representation Expected in Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian woman leader
has urged all parties in the country to field more and deserving
women candidates to run for the nation-wide elections in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald Sunday quoted Woizero Haile-Michael, head
of the Women's Affairs in the Prime Minister's Office, as saying
that political parties must provide women candidates with special
support.
</P>
<P>
Woizero said despite the fact that over 50 percent of the
electorate constitute women, the number of women candidates for
the next elections is very low because of their fear to engage in
politics and the mistaken outlook of the society towards women.
</P>
<P>
She called on political parties to emulate the country's
consitutional provision that advocates affirmative action for
women, and embrace such a provision in their programs, not only
for the benefit of elections but to guarantee women's
participation in all areas of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
She said that her office was preparing to provide the necessary
support to women, with a view to raising women representation in
the House of Peoples' Representatives from the current seven to 15
percent and that of the state council from eight to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, some 58 political parties across
Ethiopia have announced that they will participate in the national
and regional elections due on May 14, 2000, the second of its kind
since August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Urged to Fight Drug Abuse in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Minister of State
Sharrif Nassir has decried the massive illegal drug abuse in the
port city of Mombasa and urged religious leaders to help the
government stop it.
</P>
<P>
Nassir warned that although strong religious education has been
 instilled in youth, the majority still use drugs and end up
messing up their lives before adulthood, according to Sunday
Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The minister Saturday urged parents to monitor their children
closely so that they can detect early signs of drug abuse and take
necessary measures to stop the habit.
</P>
<P>
With the rampant drug abuse, the future is bleak for the
country's youth, many of whom have dropped out of school and
engaged in immoral behaviour, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Drug abuse among adolescents has become a serious social
problem in the eastern African country, which leads to rising
school violence and drop-out rate.

<HEADLINE> UK Police Probe Alleged Thefts at Buckingham Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- British police were investigating
a series of alleged thefts of royal treasures from Buckingham
Palace, Queen Elizabeth's London residence, local newspapers
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman gave no details of the
investigations, but played down a report in the News of the World
that "fabulous jewels and heirlooms" had been looted, including a
necklace belonging to Princess Anne.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an accurate story," the spokeswoman said, adding that
the items which were allegedly stolen were "items of intrinsic
value, but not highly valuable."
</P>
<P>
"They were of no personal or sentimental value to any member of
the Royal Family," she said.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World newspaper said the haul included an
ornament given to Queen Elizabeth during a state visit, fine wines,
silver cutlery and clothes created by top international designers.
</P>
<P>
"Private apartments have been systematically ransacked," it
said, adding that the value of goods looted stood at tens of
thousands of pounds (dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times said stolen goods also included an Olympic tie-
pin given to Princess Anne when she competed in the 1976 Montreal
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 palace staff are expected to be questioned about
the thefts, carried out over several weeks. They are believed to
be the work of insiders with access to private offices and
apartments.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, thieves broke into heir-to-the-throne Prince
Charles's apartments at St. James Palace, making away with several
sets of pens, tie-pins, watches and brooches of historic and
sentimental value.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, a former Buckingham Palace porter pleaded
guilty to stealing a 350,000 pound (580,000 U.S. dollars) 17th
century painting from the royal collection.

ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti Railway
Company has imported two modern locomotives made in France at a
cost of 4.9 million birr (600,000 U.S. dollars), the Capital

The 102-year-old railway company, jointly owned by Ethiopia
and Djibouti, currently has 14 locomotives with a total capacity

LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's top 100 Internet
millionaires have amassed a fortune worth four billion pounds (6.
61 billion U.S. dollars), mostly in the last four years, according
to a survey published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The survey said Britain's top cyber tycoons were richer than
their rivals in continental Europe, though still well behind their
counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Most of their companies have yet to make a profit but the
expectation that they will become major players in the new e-
economy has given them sky-high valuations.
</P>
<P>
Britain's richest e-millionaire is Paul Sykes, 56, with an
estimated personal fortune of 500 million pounds (800 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Number two in the top 100 list is Kevin Leech, also 56, who
made his fortune by backing biotechnology concern ML Laboratories
and then went on to fund two online firms that have gone public on
Nasdaq, the U.S. stock market. His personal value is put at 250
million pounds (400 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The youngest e-millionaire is Benjamin Cohen, 17, who launched a
website aimed at the Jewish community earlier this year with just
150 pounds (240 dollars). Jewishnet.com is now worth an estimated
5 million pounds (about 8 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Police Chief Warns of New Terror Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's chief police
officer warned on Sunday that dissident republican guerrilla
groups posed a growing threat of violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said
the republican splinter groups were attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
He also threatened to resign if Britain ordered him to cut the
size of his force, as a result of a recently completed review of
policing in Northern Ireland, before the threat from dissident
guerrilla groups was reduced.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said in a BBC interview that the Roman Catholic
republican splinter groups had the "firm intention" of engaging in
violence, but had been deterred by police and the army.
</P>
<P>
But there was no evidence that the Irish Republican Army was
involved in the threat of renewed violence, Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted his force must remain strong enough to protect the
public from any future resumption of guerrilla violence.
</P>
<P>
The policing report by former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten
has angered Protestants and police officers with its suggestion
that the Royal Ulster Constabulary's full-time strength be reduced
from 13,000 to 7,500.

ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's position on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has remained unchanged and it
would wait for the U.S. Congress action with regard to removal of
sanctions before taking decision on signing of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
This was stated Sunday by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz at a press conference on return from a 12-day trip to the
United Nations and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our position stated by Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif at last year's session of the U.N. General Assembly
session," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif told the world body that Pakistan would
accede to CTBT in an atmosphere free of coercion and pressure.
</P>
<P>
"That action has not been taken, the pre-requisite has not been
met," Aziz said, referring to lifting of the discriminatory
sanctions imposed by the United States against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and several U.S. law-makers during his visit, said Washington did
raise the issue of signing of CTBT with him.
</P>
<P>
"They told me that the action is now with the U.S. Congress,"
Aziz said, adding that "I don't know how adequate that action will
be, but we will wait for the outcome of that action."

ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Sunday indicated that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif may
meet his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the sidelines
of the Commonwealth Summit in the South African city of Durban in
November.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions during a press conference held here, Aziz
said, "Talks should start as soon as possible. One opportunity
will be in Durban at the Commonwealth Summit in mid November,"
stressing that the dialogue should start "in whatever the way".
Another chance for a possible meeting of the prime ministers from
the two hostile neighbors will be the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit in Katmandu, capital of Nepal,
scheduled for November 26, according to Aziz.
The prime ministers' meetings will mark the resumption of stalled
bilateral talks between the two South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Vajpayee held a meeting in Pakistan's eastern city
of Lahore in February this year. However, the foreign secretary
level talks could not be resumed as agreed due to the collapse of
Vajpayee government and the eruption of military conflicts in the
disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The two arch-rivals have been under international pressure to
resume dialogue for the peaceful settlement of bilateral disputes,
especially the long-standing Kashmir issue.

<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen people were killed and 22
others injured in two separate road accidents in northern Egypt,
the national Al-Ahram daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One accident took place Saturday on the Cairo-Alexandria Desert
Road in the governorate of Gharbia, 80 kilometers north of the
capital, the Arabic-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A tractor ran into a truck which was carrying 35 people of one
family on their way back home, killing eight of them and injuring
22 others.
</P>
<P>
The other accident occurred also on Saturday in Suez, 120
kilometers east of Cairo, when two cars crashed into each other,
claiming eight lives.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the causes of the accidents are underway,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt due to over speed, poor road
conditions and neglect of traffic rules and regulations. Official
estimates put the annual death toll at nearly 6,000 people and
injuries at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
A government committee is looking into the rising number of
fatalities on Egyptian roads, especially rural roads, which local
medias have dubbed "roads of death."

<P>
NAIROBI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is not among the least
developing countries,  Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said
Saturday while talking about the omission of Kenya from the list
of countries whose debts are to be written off by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper Sunday quoted Moi as saying Kenya only
owes the United States 58 million U.S. dollars in bilateral aids
and another 67, 000 dollars in commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
What Kenya needs from the United States is preferential trade
and investments, Moi said when addressing a fund-raising function
for a high- school.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana said that
54945
Kenya did not meet the criteria for a 100 percent debt write-off.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has neither been at war nor been unable to service its
external debt obligations and these are factors that were
considered in giving countries debt reprieve, Godana said.
</P>
<P>
If Kenya had received a debt reprieve, it would be denied
access to credit "especially from the Japanese government who is
our principal donors" , he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in our interests to push for a debt write-off
because there are some countries which spend up to 108 percent of
their total revenue on repaying debts owed by their governments,"

LUSAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A suspected orphan smuggler in

Sampa, one of the first African missionaries of Hope for
Vulnerable Children in Africa, said the suspect is obtaining
passports for the children.

which is believed to have the highest number of vulnerable
children.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Second Africa Liberation to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has called for a
second liberation in the African continent to make it a meaningful
participant in the new world trade and investment globalization.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa made the remarks Saturday in a speech
read by Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye at the Third
Herbert Chitepo Memorial Lecture held at University of Zimbabwe in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has jumped on the globalization bandwagon unprepared,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Since Africa was so divided and weak, the courage to protest
and stand up for the interests of its people has diminished and
become unfashionable, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that we cannot escape from globalization and we
should not try to. But we need to stand up for our interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the biggest challenge for Africa was how it can
build, develop and sustain its capacity to be a meaningful player
in the globalizing world.
</P>
<P>
He cherished the united and spirited fight for a new
international economic order by the then Non-Aligned Movement and
G77 in the 1970s, saying these were instrumental in pursuit of
that just demand.
</P>
<P>
"For once we promoted an economic agenda for the South on a
global scale, the Western industrialized countries had to work
extra to scuttle that agenda," the president observed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on debts, he said Tanzania has spent twice as much
money servicing its debt than it has spent on education and
health.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that despite the unbearable debt burden, African
governments do not seem to be united in demanding deeper, quicker
and broader debt relief and cancellation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Interceptor Passes Crucial Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Saturday
conducted a test of national missile defense system which
intercepted and destroyed an unarmed missile on a 25,600-kph
collision course over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
An unarmed missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. A "kill vehicle", which lifted off from the Kwajalein
test range in the South Pacific about 21 minutes later,
intercepted and collided with the target above the ocean.
</P>
<P>
"It was a successful intercept," said Sheryl Irwin, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Defense. "It did everything
it was supposed to do, and it did it perfectly."
</P>
<P>
This was the first test of the "kill vehicle" missile's ability
to destroy a target by smashing into it. Neither missile carried
an explosive.
</P>
<P>
Two more tests are scheduled before a June 2000 deployment
readiness review by the Pentagon and a presidential decision on
initial deployment, expected shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Deployment of a possible 20 interceptors in Alaska by 2001, if
approved, would put the United States in violation of the Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty with Russia.

<HEADLINE> EU to Foster Trade With African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
foster trade with Zambia and other African countries alongside
giving aid, an EU official has said.
</P>
<P>
The EU political affairs representative in the United Kingdom,
William Sleath, told reporters in Lusaka at the weekend that time
had come for mutual trade between the Africa Caribbean Pacific
members to which Zambia belongs and the EU.
</P>
<P>
"More political dialog is required alongside the tradition of
aid. This is the only way forward," Sleath was quoted by Sunday
Times of Zambia as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU would face considerable pressure at the World
Trade Organization summit next month over the one sided trade
trends between Africa and the EU.
</P>
<P>
"We shall have to face up to the criticism of unbalanced trade
between the EU and Africa. We want a large volume of trade between
Africa and the EU. This is one of the issues to be discussed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The trade imbalance resulting mainly because of the EU-South
Africa trade agreement which effectively makes it difficult for
other Southern African countries to penetrate the European market
was another issue that required immediate dialog, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ministry of Agriculture on Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The lack of talent, unfair
financial levies, sluggish markets and discrimination in obtaining
bank loans suffered by rural township enterprises have hindered
the development of China's rural economy which has progressed
tremendously since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the workforce of township enterprises, the "
secret weapon" in the rapid development of rural industries, is
too low to meet the requirements for upgrading manufacturing
technology, the Business Weekly reported today, quoting Minister
of Agriculture Chen Yaobang as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent of the employees of township enterprises have
received college education, experts at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of rural surplus laborers is huge,
totaling about 200 million, and most of them are poorly educated.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to step up the development of the rural economy, China
will provide more access to its rural markets to increase the
inflow of foreign investment, according to Tang Zhengping,
director-general of the Department of International Co-operation
of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China needs a net foreign investment of 225.6 billion U.S.
dollars (at 1995 price) between 1996 and 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Robust domestic demand for organic food and quality packaging
is creating opportunities for foreign investors in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Tang was confident of prospects for foreign investment
especially if China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of a market-oriented mechanism, rural
economic reform will follow global economic development, thus
creating a favorable environment for foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government will adopt preferential policies for the
development of rural infrastructure to pave the way for the
development of foreign-funded joint ventures in rural areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture is encouraging township
enterprises to consider opportunities for setting up factories in
co-operation with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
It China becomes a member of the WTO, economists predict the
country's agricultural markets, such as grain, cotton, vegetable
oils and wool, will have to compete with foreign products in the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
But China's entry to the WTO will also promote sales of Chinese
fruits, aquatic products and meat on the world market, Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Third Southern Africa
International Dialogue (SAID) conference opens Sunday in the
resort town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, to chart the course for
smart partnerships within the region, Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
About 13 heads of state and government andover 400 businessmen
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region,
together with delegates from other parts of the world, are
expected to attend the four-day conference to seek ways for
enhancing regional economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome message to the delegates, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe called on all countries in the region to pursue
economic development through the promotion of peace, political
stability and the creation of smart partnerships.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this year's dialogue should focus on the region's
greatest challenge of working out strategies for empowering the
indigenous majorities who have been victims of socio-economic
inequalities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the conference would come up with
practical measures, which will result in the formation of business
linkages in many economic sectors in the region.
</P>
<P>
"All of us in the region have come to realize that the ideals
of empowerment and the search for greater investment, growth and
development can, and indeed should be harmonized. After all,
empowerment policies are only realizable under conditions of
growth. This is why we urge big businesses -- local and
international -- to realize that the quest for empowerment and the
 pursuit of profit need not conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day dialogue under the theme "Economic
Empowerment Through Smart Partnership", the participants are
expected to deliberate on technology and business development
opportunities, the role of business in economic empowerment for
smart partnership projects and the social agenda for economic
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
SAID is a platform for debating regional economic issues and is
modeled along the lines of Malaysia's Langkawi International
Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
This year's session is the third after the inaugural dialogue
held in Kasane, Botswana in 1997 and the second held in
Swakopmund, Namibia last year.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a crime prevention foundation of Zambia, the
national chairman appealed to its members to work closely with the

JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has indicated that Israel has been conducting secret contacts
with the Syrians as part of an American initiative to try to
reactivate the peace talks between the two rivals.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's Television Channel 2 Saturday

</P>
<P>
"I confirm, it is true. It is not mediation, it's an American
initiative in which there is a concrete effort with the Syrians to
bring about a meeting," said Levy.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the main mediator between the Syrians and
the Israelis. But the Israeli government was not telling the
Europeans or Jordanians to cease their attempts to serve as
bridges.
</P>
<P>
Levy denied allegations by the Syrians that the late prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin had made promises regarding Israel's total
withdrawl from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"Rabin wanted to know what the Syrian concept of peace was,
but any talk of implicit promises is nothing more than an
interpretation of Rabin's message," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off three years ago after
th hardline Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu took the reins
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts have been intensified recently to bring the
two sides to talks again over the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, the southern territory of Syria, was
occupied by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Tadayuki Okada, riding
a Repsol Honda, won the Australian 500cc grand prix at Phillip
Island on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Okada passed Italian Max Biaggi three turns from the finish to
win after Kenny Roberts had led by a big margin only to experience
tyre problems with his Suzuki bike four laps from home.
</P>
<P>
It was Okada's third GP win of the season and the eighth of his
career and gave Repsol Honda an unexpected bonus after top rider
Alex Criville finished in fifth place with a broken left hand.
</P>
<P>
Roberts looked set for an all-the-way victory with his Suzuki
consistently pulling away from his rivals, but he suffered tyre
problems and was overtaken at the top of the home straight four
laps from the finish.
</P>
<P>
Biaggi took the lead and looked set to win the Australian GP,
but Okada beat him under brakes on a bend and stole away for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
Criville leads the world championship by 41 points from Okada
with three races left in the series.
</P>
<P>
Roberts picked up six points for his 10th placing and lies
third 51 points behind Criville.

<HEADLINE> Safe Passage Opening Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua)-- The opening of a safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was slated for Sunday,
has been postponed due to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators'
failure to resolve their differences in a meeting Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met at Neveh Ilan
Hotel near Jerusalem for more than five hours, but after
midnight the two sides did not iron out their differences over
who would issue magnetic security cards and Israel's demand of
arresting suspects on the passage.
</P>
<P>
Orit Messer-Harel, spokeswoman of the Israeli Public Security,
announced after the meeting that it was decided to postpone the
opening of the route and the "two sides agreed to meet in the
coming days to overcome the differences."
</P>
<P>
She said that the main sticking point was disagreement
between the two sides over which side should distribute the
cards and where. Another obstacle was a disagreement over
whether Isarel is entitled to arrest Palestinians suspected of
security offenses as they use the passage.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiator, led by Minister of Civil Affairs
Jamil Tarifi, went to consult with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat after the meeting broke up.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami issued a statement
after midnight saying he hoped the two sides would reach an
understanding soon on the basis of maintaining two key
principles, security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The passage, linking Gaza and the West Bank city of Hebron,
was supposed to be opened October 1 under the Sharm El Sheikh
peace deal signed early September. But the opening has been
postponed for two days by the Israeli side due to the Israel's
Jewish holiday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India's Lok Sabha Polls Enter Final Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- India's long-drawn 13th Lok
Sabha election entered the fifth and final phase Sunday in 118
constituencies spread over 11 states in the country amid tight
security measures.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 million voters are eligible to decide the
electoral fortunes of 1,087 candidates, including Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
As the final phase of polling began Sunday morning, the country
is witnessing a clash of political heavyweights in Amethi and
Lucknow Lok Sabha constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, where Sonia
Gandhi and Vajpayee are in the fray.
</P>
<P>
For Congress President Sonia Gandhi, her victory in both Amethi
and Bellary Lok Sabha constituencies appears to be crucial for her
survival, as a defeat in any of these constituencies could
establish the stamp of a "foreigner being rejected by Indian
voters."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the polls Saturday, The Pioneer, one of India's
leading newspapers, predicted the BJP-led National Democratic
Alliance (NDA) will have a comfortable lead in the 13th Lok Sabha
election.
</P>
<P>
An exclusive survey commissioned by The Pioneer said that the
BJP-led NDA is set to cross the 300 mark while the Congress and
its allies will obtain 165 seats. Other parties will get 71 seats.
</P>
<P>
The survey forecast 41 percent vote for the BJP and allies, a
gain of 3.3 percent. The Congress and its allies are expected to
secure 35.4 percent of the vote, a jump of six percent over the
last election.
</P>
<P>
The survey (post-poll in most constituencies and pre-poll in
some) was conducted by the Research and Development Initiative in
the last week of September with representative sample of 80 Lok
Sabha constituencies covering 16,800 eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, buoyed up by reports of a turnaround in its fortunes
in Uttar Pradesh and some other states, the Congress has come to
the conclusion that it would emerge as the single largest party in
the 13th Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said Saturday, "There is no
doubt that the Congress will form the government." He also did
not rule out the possibility of the Congress forming a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Home Minister L.K. Advani, who is also the BJP
campaign chairman, attempted to demolish this "myth" by insisting
that while the NDA would get a clear majority, the honor of being
the single largest party would go to the BJP, and not to the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The latter, as he put it, did not have "a ghost of chance."

BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai media are rather
satisfied with the performance of the Thai Olympic soccer team
which played Kazakhstan goalless in the Olympic qualifying
tournament Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand plugged their defense tight to leave hosts Kazakhstan
frustrated as their Group C opener of the Sydney 2000 Olympic
Games qualifying tournament in Almaty ended in a goalless draw
yesterday,"the Sunday Nation said.

Another major newspaper, Bangkok Post, also said on Sunday that
the Thais, mostly under-19 players from Thai Farmers Bank club, "
did well in the cold weather".
</P>
<P>
Both newspapers said the Kazakhstan started well and dominated
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
But the Thais were able to quell their opponents' desire to
play their trademark attacking soccer and were rewarded with one
valuable point from the match.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Robots Help Improve Product Quality, Save Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 3 (Xinhua)-- According to today's China Daily,
China has made great achievements in exploring and developing
robot techniques which could improve product quality and save
human labor.
</P>
<P>
For the past two decades, the Robotics Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics (RIAA) have made great breakthroughs in its
research which pushed forward the application of robots.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of robots, superior to conventional
industrial robots in obstacle avoidance and fault tolerance, such
as three-fingered dexterous hands robot and window cleaning robot
have been applied in some universities since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The application of robots will ensure better standardized
quality than human work. At the same time, more human power will
be freed to do work requiring high capabilities," said Wang
Tianmiao, director of RIAA.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 2,000 robots in use in China now. Some of them
are used in submarine exploration and dangerous mining. But most
of them are mainly used in car manufacturing and in the production
of household appliances.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the commercialization of the robotics industry will
accelerate with strong government support for scientific and
technological innovation," he added.

NANNING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s Motorola will help
the capital of China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to set up
an emergency telephone network similar to the "911" service that
is available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after P. Y. Lai, president of Motorola (
China) Electronics Ltd., had a look at the investment environment
in Nanning recently. He said that Nanning is a beautiful, clean
and well-planned city with great development potential, but that
it would have more appeal for overseas investors with an emergency
service network.
</P>
<P>
This will be a major emergency telephone network with use for
reporting fire alarms, injuries and traffic accidents, and will
have many other social services as well. Local people can get
rapid service just by remembering a simple phone number.
</P>
<P>
The network is expected to cost 90 million yuan for equipment
and installation. Motorola has agreed to provide a design and
computer system for the network.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecom Sector Suffers Major Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
manufacturing sector, influenced by extensive reforms in the
telecom service structure, is expected to suffer a sharp decline
in both market demand and corporate profits this year, the
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The telecom industry completed a fixed-asset investment of 55.3
billion yuan (6.66 billion U.S. dollars) during the first eight
months of this year, the report quoted minister of Information
Industry Wu Jichuan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wu estimated that total investment this year could reach 120
billion yuan (14.46 billion dollars), a decline of 20 percent when
compared with last year's 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale telecom infrastructure investment of recent
years has become a key force in bolstering sales growth for
telecom equipment suppliers, especially locally emerging
manufacturers which enjoy preferential government support.
</P>
<P>
However, telecom service restructuring, mainly focusing on the
break up of China Telecom that began early this year, severely
affected the normal development plan of telecom instrasturctural
construction.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen-based Zhongxing Telecom, one of the country's major
telecom equipment suppliers, suffered a decrease in the growth of
its net-profits of 9.15 percent during the first half of this year,
compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Telecom service reforms also hit foreign telecom suppliers,
most of which have reported business declines in the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
Telecom equipment manufacturers have turned to the
establishment of China Mobile Telecom Corp,the most profitable arm
of China Telecom, in hopes of finding profits.

<HEADLINE> China to Ease Control on Silver Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to lift the decades-old ban on free trading and pricing of
silver in three months in a bid to boost demand and solve the
surplus problem.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation is a prelude to a similar market-driven
program for gold, today's Business Weekly quoted an official from
the Gold Economic Development Research Center as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, only a few domestic dealers will be granted access to
the silver market after the government's deregulation, according
to Liu Shan'an, deputy-director of the center.
</P>
<P>
There is no accurate timetable for the government to open
silver and gold markets to overseas traders.
</P>
<P>
Trading and pricing of gold and silver have been under the
monopoly control of the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, since the early days of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the pilot silver exchange markets will likely be
established in a non-ferrous metals wholesale market on January 1,
2000, in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Only domestic dealers will be allowed to make spot silver
transactions using the renminbi currency.
</P>
<P>
Silver exports will remain under the control of the central
bank. Now, any company that wishes to handle exports of silver are
required to get a licence from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission will implement a quota
system on silver exports beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
China's silver output stood at 1,300 tons last year. But the
domestic market could only absorb 600 tons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Launches Country-Wide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP)-led opposition alliance has started its planned country-wide
hartal (destructive strike) on Sunday morning with the aim to
unseat the government and enforce an immediate parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the opposition alliance have urged the
countrymen to make Sunday's hartal a success and force the
government to quit by intensifying the oust-government agitation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, BNP-led opposition alliance observed non-stop 60-hour
hartal from September 14 to 16 in protest against "police attack"
on opposition leaders and workers during their demonstration
against the Awami league government on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to set up as many as 20 temporary
police camps in and around the important markets, business houses
and shopping malls in the capital to ensure adequate security to
the business community and their establishments.
</P>
<P>
The authorities urged the business community to keep their
shops, markets and commercial establishments open, rejecting the
opposition's hartal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Observer Sunday quoted Commissioner of Dhaka
Metropolitan Police A.K.M. Shamsuddin as saying that ten platoons
of additional Para-military Bangladesh Rifles would join the
police force to strengthen security measures. A total of 5,300
policemen backed by riot-police and armed police battalion will be
deployed in the city during Sunday's hartal.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
remained static at 2.02 percent for the week ending September 18,
despite a marginal increase in overall Wholesale Price index
(WPI).
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, during the week, annual
rate of inflation remained unchanged at 2.02 percent compared to
8.61 percent in the corresponding last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate, which has been hovering below two percent since
July 3, rose above the two percent mark for the first time in 10
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Annual rate of increase in prices has been ruling low this year
mainly on account of comparison with a higher base last year, when
prices of vegetables increased abnormally due to lower
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is, however, expected to move upwards with
international oil prices firming up. There are also indications
that demand for manufacturing items is picking up.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar CRPP Condemns Embassy Seizure in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Committee Representing the
People's Parliament (CRPP) of Myanmar, mainly formed by the
opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), Saturday condemned
the seizure of the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok and the taking of
hostages by Myanmar armed men on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts are contrary to the principles which the CRPP and
the NLD are constantly defending in the name of justice, human
rights and peace," the CRPP said in a statement released here
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply appreciate the decision of the Thai government to
reject the use of force and applaud the courage and diplomatic
skills of the deputy foreign minister (Sukhumbhand Paribatra),"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to draw the attention of the world to the fact
that this act of violence at the Burmese (Myanmar) embassy in
Bangkok is an effect of the many acts of injustice and cruelty
repeatedly perpetrated by the military regime in Burma (Myanmar).
Violence breeds violence," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Saturday's government statement, the
armed men, which had stormed the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, left
the embassy compound to an unknown destination with two
helicopters provided by the Thai authorities after negotiations
between them on that day at 1 p.m. Bangkok time. The incident
ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The government Information Sheet said that the Thai authorities
are now questioning those who were held hostage for further
information, adding that no one has been hurt during the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government warned that "it is important to make
these criminals realize that no matter under what pretext or
disguise it might have been staged, the peace loving people of the
world community will not tolerate the criminal and the terrorist
activities they have committed."
</P>
<P>
Five armed men with AK (47) rifles, who are all Myanmar
students living in Thailand, stormed the Myanmar embassy in
Bangkok at 10:50 a.m. local time on Friday and held the embassy
staff and their families together with a number of foreigners.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Veteran forward Tyrone Corbin
was rescued from the NBA scrap heap today when he was signed by
the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, although as a 14-year veteran, Corbin
must receive a minimum of $1 million for one year. This is his
second stint with the Kings, who continue to deepen their roster.
</P>
<P>
Corbin was a casualty of a major retooling by the Atlanta Hawks.
He was waived as the Hawks drafted two frontcourt players, traded
for forward-center Chris Crawford.
</P>
<P>
In 996 games with eight teams, Corbin, 36, has career averages
of 9.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.19 steals. His best campaign was
with Minnesota in 1990-91, when he averaged 18 points and 7.2
rebounds for the second-year team. He averaged 7.5 points and 3.1
rebounds for Atlanta last season.
</P>
<P>
After making the playoffs for the first time in three years
last season, the Kings have fortified their bench. Guard Jon Barry
and forwards Scot Pollard and Lawrence funderburke were re-signed.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Send Pippen to Blazers in 6-For-1 Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Superstar forward Scottie
Pippen is headed for the Portland Trail Blazers who gave up six
players to get him.
</P>
<P>
One of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Pippen was dealt by the
Houston Rockets just days after blasting teammate Charles Barkley.
He had requested a trade earlier this summer and got his wish
today.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who acquired Pippen in January from the Chicago
Bulls, received forwards Walt Williams, Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon
and Carlos Rogers and guards Ed Gray and Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely excited," Blazers president Bob Whitsitt said
at a news conference in Portland, Oregon. "He's excited about our
chances of winning a championship."
</P>
<P>
"The deal is what we got," Rockets vice president of basketball
Carroll Dawson said. "We deal in reality."
</P>
<P>
While playing for the Bulls, Pippen, 34, won six NBA titles in
an eight-year span alongside Michael Jordan. But he quickly grew
disenchanted playing with fellow superstar forward Barkley, also
one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players.
</P>
<P>
Pippen lashed out at Barkley earlier this week during a taping
of an interview for ESPN Sports Century, calling the outspoken
power forward "fat" and "selfish".
</P>
<P>
Barkley said he was "disappointed" in Pippen, who demanded a
trade after last season and expressed a desire to be reunited with
old coach Phil Jackson, who now guides the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to last season, Barkley signed a one-year, $1 million
contract so the Rockets could bring aboard Pippen with a five-year,
$67.2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
"We wished each other well," Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. "I had no problems with him."
</P>
<P>
The Rockets received six players to made the trade work under
salary cap rules. Pippen, who averaged 14.5 points, 6.5 rebounds
and 5.9 assists last season, is slated to make $14.75 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
All six players are reserves. Williams, Cato and Augmon figure
in Houston's plans and Gray may help fill the bench. Rogers and
Shaw barely played last season and may be released.
</P>
<P>
"The future looks pretty bright here," said Dawson, whose team
suddenly has a young look with the offseason acquisitions of
rookie guard Steve Francis and former Utah Jazz swingman Shandon
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
One of the most talented players in the league, Pippen's
scoring average was the lowest since his rookie season of 1987-88.
He underwent surgery after the Bulls won the 1998 NBA championship
to repair two herniated disks in his lower back. Pippen has made
the NBA All-Defensive First Team the last eight seasons and is a
seven-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
"The resume's too long to read," Whitsitt said. "What Scottie
Pippen brings to us is a commitment to winning, a tremendous work
ethic, tremendous versatility. He's a great ballhandler, a great
defender. Just the way he plays with fit in with all the other
athletes we have."
</P>
<P>
But Pippen also is a notoriously headstrong players. He once
sat out the final seconds of a playoff game against the New York
Knicks because he was not going to take the final shot.
</P>
<P>
Pippen also called Bulls general manager Jerry Krause "a
chicken" for failing to renegotiate his contract before the 1997-
98 season, when he earned a relatively paltry $2.77 million.
</P>
<P>
Pippen has averaged 17.9 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.1 assists
over a 12-year career. He was drafted fifth overall in 1987 by
Seattle, which traded him to the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Wilson Hails Wednesday Courage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny
Wilson hailed his side's courage following their five-star
Hillsborough performance against Wimbledon at English premier
league match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday players produced an electrifying display, none
more so than Belgian international striker Gilles de Bilde.
</P>
<P>
De Bilde was on the score sheet twice in a 5-1 rout of
Wimbledon as the Owls finally brought an end to the worst league
start in their history.
</P>
<P>
There were also goals for Wim Jonk, Petter Rudi and Gerald
Sibon, with only John Hartson replying for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
But this was a performance full of commitment and heart, one
which Wilson had long been demanding from his players and while
the Wednesday boss was rightly proud of his side, he also warned
they are not yet out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
With Wednesday still propping up the Premiership, Wilson said:
"This was a terrific win.
</P>
<P>
"I said to the lads that it took a hell of a lot of courage to
play like that today, particularly given the crisis we are in.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think there will be a better result up and down
the country over the next few weeks because of our situation and
given the pressure we are under.
</P>
<P>
"But we mustn't get carried away with just one win, although
from our point of view this sets us up to go forward.
</P>
<P>
"But we are still bottom of the league. I know the fans will
think we have turned the corner, but there's still a lot of work
to do," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee approved on Saturday to add both skeleton and women's
bobsled to the competitive agenda for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Skeleton is a sport in which an athlete rides a sled head-first
down an ice track.
</P>
<P>
The IOC executive board also approved the addition of men's and
women's 1,500-meter races in short-track speedskating, men's and
women's cross-country ski events, and men's combined sprints in
Nordic Combined.
</P>
<P>
The action came a day before the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
makes a presentation to the IOC board.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake organizers had asked for approval of the new sports
and events at the IOC session in Seoul, South Korea, in June. But
the IOC said then it needed more information from international
federations to make sure the sports met the requirements for
inclusion in the games.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Property Sector Firms, Recovery Needs Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asia's property markets
have shown signs of renewed life in recent months, but lower
prices, higher vacancy rates and falling profits in much of the
region indicate a slower recovery.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, a low interest rate
environment and the faster-than-expected regional economic
recovery have eased the crisis in the property sector. Singapore,
the Philippines and Malaysia have seen residential markets
improving in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Filinvest Land, a Philippine firm engaged in affordable
middle-income housing, reported a 7.6 percent drop in net profit
in the first half of the year on a year earlier, but said that
sales reservations were 96 percent higher than the first half of
1998.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, many property companies have started to return to
profitability, mainly due to a steady recovery in home prices
since the market touched bottom last year.
</P>
<P>
DBS Land, Singapore's major play in the property sector,
reported in July a 174 percent surge in its interim profit.
</P>
<P>
"I think quite a few companies will return to black. But
whether they will be as astounding and spectacular in their
turnaround as DBS Land remains to be seen," said Yeo Wei Kwong,
analyst at Fraser Securities.
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates, coupled with a robust economic recovery,
have fueled rises in residential sales in Southeast Asia in the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, short-term interest rates in Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have been cut by 7.3
percentage points on average. The lower cost of bank loans has
encouraged people to buy homes.
</P>
<P>
But economists said the better-than-expected economic
performance in the region is a major factor which boosted consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Last year, most Southeast Asian nations experienced a severe
economic recession, with the region's gross domestic product (GDP)
contracting by 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This year, however, all Southeast Asian countries are expected
to see positive growth. According to a revised forecast by the
Asian Development Bank in September, Singapore's GDP would grow 5
percent this year. The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and
Indonesia are also expected to achieve a 2-3 percent GDP growth
this year.
</P>
<P>
With a low interest rate environment and a real economic
turnaround, the property sector could see significant improvements
in the later part of the year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But the huge amount of non-performing loans extended by
Southeast Asian banks to the property sector is the major cause of
the two-year-old financial crisis, and the sector has been hit
hardest during the crisis with a steep slide of prices and a high
vacancy rate.
</P>
<P>
The full recovery in Southeast Asia is likely to take some
years because of over-supply and huge debts owed by property
companies, according to dealers.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the battered sector could take two to three years
to fully recover due to a sharp imbalance between supply and
demand, said Mana Jiranapakul, senior associate director of a
property management group in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"My opinion is that it should take two to three years to see
the market pick up," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, over-supply and intense competition in the
office and high-end residential segments, fund problems for
low-end housing would also delay a fully recovery.
</P>
<P>
A large supply to come through in both the office and high-end
residential segments will take 12-18 months, with vacancy rates
picking up for segments in 2000, said Edgardo del Rosario, deputy
head of research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's problem is also very serious. It is reported that
some 11 million square feet of Kuala Lumpur office space, or 23.6
percent of the total, are currently vacant.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Malaysia's developers borrowed big to build their
projects. If they cannot make money, they cannot service their
loans, which account for 25 percent of the financial system's
total lending.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, economists are calling on Southeast Asian
governments to make more efforts to revive the property sector.

<HEADLINE> Italian Cyclist Fails Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy cyclist Simone Lo Vano has
failed a joint blood and urine test and was unable to compete in
the world championships next week, ANSA news agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lo Vanuo, a time trial specialist, was the reigning national
champion at under 23 and world junior champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
No details were available for the test, which forms part of a
national anti-doping campaign, checks the red corpuscle count in
the blood and the amount of creatine in urine.
</P>
<P>
The move comes four months after national cycling hero Marco
Pantani was prevented from starting the penultimate stage of the
Tour of Italy after the race leader failed an identical blood test.
</P>
<P>
A blood test failure is usually linked with use of the banned
drug EPO, which increases a rider's resistance to fatigue,
although Pantani has strenuously denied the charge of doping.
</P>
<P>
Creatine is a naturally-occurring substance which improves
muscle performance, but whose levels can be artificially boosted
by taking it in concentrated tablet form.

<HEADLINE> Seven People Killed in Coach Crash in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and some
30 injured Saturday when their coach hit the side of a tunnel on a
motor-way near Genoa in northwest Italy.
</P>
<P>
According to police reports issued Saturday evening, the coach
left the small town of Castel Madama, 25 kilometers east of Rome,
at 2:30 a.m. local time carrying some 40 people who were heading
for Turin to attend a wedding.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened at 6:15 a.m., when the coach hit the
right side of the entrance to a two-kilometer-long tunnel,
crashing through safety barriers and sending a number of
passengers flying through the coach windows.
</P>
<P>
The owner-driver of the coach, Vincenzo Salviani, who was among
the victims, is believed to have fallen asleep at the wheel just
before entering the tunnel and slamming into the tunnel wall,
causing the coach to overturn.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, 10 of the people injured in the accident
were reported in critical condition in hospitals in and around
Genoa.
</P>
<P>
Six children, aged between three and 11, who were aboard the
coach, were hospitalized with injuries. One 11-year-old girl was
said to be in serious condition with fractures and contusions.
</P>
<P>
A woman passenger hospitalized in Lavagna, near Genoa, reported
that she had seen the driver nodding off just seconds before the
accident.

<HEADLINE> China Spends Heavily on Earthquake Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China had spent 1.4 billion yuan
(168 million U.S. dollars) on earthquake resistance before the end
of 1997, the Business Weekly today quoted an official with the
Ministry of Construction as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qu Qi, division chief of the ministry's earthquake resistance
office, said that China has placed emphasis on earthquake
resistance since the devastating 1976 Tangshan earthquake which
killed more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in the wake of disastrous earthquakes that
have occurred in Turkey, Greece and China's Taiwan island within
the past several months.
</P>
<P>
The National Code for the Seismic Design of Buildings (GBJ11-89)
, which was effective since 1989, required that buildings should
not be damaged by minor tremors, should be repairable after medium
ones, and should not crumble because of major ones, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, permanent buildings and structures are required to
withstand tremors up to magnitude 8.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies should apply for approval from local
construction authorities to start a high-rise construction project,
and ask the ministry-approved committee of seismic experts to
examine designs and evaluate the overall anti-quake capacities.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Ministry of Construction said China's high-
rise construction has mushroomed in recent years in the urban
areas. The country was in an active earthquake period during the
time of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
China is revising the GBJ11-89 code to help disseminate
technological advances and experiences gained in resisting
earthquakes that have been accumulated during the past decades, Qu
said.
</P>
<P>
About 600 earthquakes measuring magnitude 6 or above have been
recorded in China during this century, killing at least 550,000
people. This is more than half the total of quake casualties in
the world during the period.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Reports Falls in International Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's
international reserves dropped to 7.859 billion U.S. dollars at
the beginning of October after speculation against the peso in the
week preceding the elimination of the exchange band.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Republic Bank released on Saturday said that
this level of reserves is 415.4 million dollars less than one
month before.
</P>
<P>
There were strong attacks against the peso in the five market
working days between September 20 and 24, forcing the central bank
to spend its reserves to maintain the dollar price within the
limits of the exchange band.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's board of directors determined on September
25 to suppress the exchange band mechanism starting last Monday
and to let the value of the dollar fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
The peso recovered 0.225 percent of its value at the close of
the week, closing Friday in the interbank market at 1,990 pesos
per dollar, against 1,994.49 pesos one week ago.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Urges U.S. to Assist in Anti-Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the
Colombian armed forces General Fernando Tapias on Saturday urged
the United States to provide assistance to the fight against drug-
trafficking in his country.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wanted, it could see drug trafficking end in two
or three years. What we are asking for is to do it," Tapias told
the press before leaving for Washington on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tapias said that despite the U.S. cooperation with Colombia in
the war against drugs, illegal crops have gone from 30,000 to 100,
000 hectares in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The general said that some 1,500 people, in addition to 1,000
members of the armed forces, die every year in the war against
drug traffickers and fighting with guerrilla and paramilitary
groups financed by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. will provide us with technology and we will
bear the possible cost of human casualties. Let us join hand and
go ahead," said Tapias.
</P>
<P>
Tapias, to be accompanied by Defense Minister Luis Fernando
Ramires on his U.S. tour, is scheduled to meet with U.S.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's President Visits Evacuees From Volcano Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad
on Saturday visited the 198 people who were evacuated from their
homes near the active Guagua Pichincha volcano, which is located
12 kilometers west of Quito.
</P>
<P>
The president promised all necessary assistance for the Quito
municipality as well as Tungurahua and Chimborazo provinces that
are threatened by possible eruptions of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Quito Metropolitan Municipality had got half
of the 800,000 U.S. dollars budgeted to deal with the emergency,
and pledged the cooperation of the capital citizens with the
people evacuated from the Loa community near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Quito's residents have been put on "orange alert" since last
Monday after they were given white and yellow alerts against
volcano eruption. The orange alert warning is a level below red,
which would indicate Guagua Pichincha could erupt in hours or days.
A yellow alert means a possible eruption in weeks, months or years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official reports, seismic activities of
the volcano diminished Saturday and rocks were observed falling on
the dome, which would indicate an impending eruption.
</P>
<P>
The Pichincha volcano has two main peaks, the active Guagua
Pichincha, and the inactive Rucu Pichincha, which stands as a
natural barrier between the volcano's crater and Quito.
</P>
<P>
Guagua Pichincha's last major eruption was in 1660, when Quito
was covered by 25 centimeters of ash and volcanic fragments in
nine days of eruption. But no one was killed in that eruption.

<HEADLINE> Blatter: Asia not to Boycott 2002 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Ootober 2 (Xinhua) -- Asia will not boycott the
2002 World Cup as it has formally agreed to a plan for the number
of places in the tournament, FIFA president Sepp Blatter said in
Las Vegas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of any boycott has been set off with a red card
somewhere and will not come up again," said Blatter.
</P>
<P>
However, Blatter admitted that Asian delegations were not happy
about the plan, under which Asia, that has four automatic berths,
will have a chance for a fifth spot against Europe's 14th place
team, instead of a playoff against the Oceanian champion.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot have happiness for everybody, it is not possible,"
Blatter said. "But we have peace in the football family now."
</P>
<P>
For the 1998 edition, Asia had three automatic berths and got
another spot when Iran won a playoff with Australia, the Oceania
champion.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, Asia gets four automatic berths for 2002, with its
third team in qualifying playing Europe's 14th place team for a
fifth berth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two-day meeting of the FIFA executive committee
also set the dates for the next World Cup, which will be jointly
hosted by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will play host to the opening match of the next
World Cup on June 1, 2002, with the final to take place June 30 in
Japan.
