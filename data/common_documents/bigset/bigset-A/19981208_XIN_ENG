<HEADLINE> Concerted Efforts Needed Against Crime: Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President
Specioza Hazibwe Monday urged African countries to strengthen
cooperation and collaboration in prevention of crimes and
treatment of offenders.
</P>
<P>
She made the call here when opening the African Regional
Preparatory Meeting for the Tenth United Nations Congress on the
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.
</P>
<P>
"As we join the rest of the world in globalization, no tribe
or society can claim ownership to a culture. We should
internalize globalization in the real sense and should have the
global way of dealing with crimes," the senior Ugandan official
said at the three-day conference.
</P>
<P>
She urged participants at the meeting to pay special attention
to crimes in African countries which are in the process of
development.
</P>
<P>
"African leaders have a commitment against crimes which are
complicated by worsening poverty, internal strife and rapid
population growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
All African countries should strengthen technical cooperation
and information exchange in this field, she added.
</P>
<P>
Hazibwe also asserted that it is very important that common
people should participate in the campaign against crimes.
</P>
<P>
This preparatory meeting was attended by more than 100
delegates from African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tenth U.N. Congress on Prevention of Crime and Treatment
of Offenders is scheduled to open in Geneva in 2000 and the last
one opened in Cairo, Egypt, in 1995.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Withdraws More Troops From Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Monday
withdrew more troops from Lesotho after a September military
intervention in the neighboring kingdom, a senior officer said in
Maseru, the capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
About 200 South African National Defense Force (SANDF) troops
left Maseru in the morning for Bleomfontein, a central city about
150 km west from Lesotho border, said Colonel Hannes van der
Merwe, commander of the combined South African and Botswana
troops.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 30 South African military engineers would return
to Pretoria, and 150 troops would go back to Grahamstown, a city
between Port Elizabeth and East London.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 650 South African military men, who are operating
in the northern districts of Lesotho, would returned home during
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In September, a nationwide turmoil erupted in Lesotho when
opposition parties in the country claimed the May 23 election was
rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress of Democracy.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili, South Africa and Botswana sent their troops, in the
name of the South African Development Community (SADC), to
Lesotho to help quell riots.
</P>
<P>
The maximum number of troops that South Africa sent into
Lesotho were about 3500.
</P>
<P>
About 650 SANDF and 500 Botswana Defense Force troops who
constituted the fighting element of the SADC task force, would
remain in Lesotho to ensure that the security situation in the
country returned to normal, SANDF said.

<HEADLINE> India Says Not to Soften Stand on Anti-dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said
Monday that it would not soften its stand towards Western
countries on anti-dumping laws.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Indian
Parliament, Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hedge said he denied the
suggestions that India was soft either in terms of law or action
towards Western countries in dealing with anti-dumping rules.
</P>
<P>
Hedge said goods imported from countries including the United
States, China, Japan, Korea and Canada were subjected to
anti-dumping laws in India.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied the reports that the newly created
directorate of anti-dumping was hesitant to take action against
big countries.
</P>
<P>
On economic sanctions imposed by some countries and
international organizations following India's nuclear tests last
May, Hedge said the impact so far had been minimal.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, any precise quantification of the impact of
the sanctions might be difficult and the government was closely
monitoring the likely impact of the restrictive economic measures.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder at Odds with Simitis over EU Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, December 7 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder Monday disagreed with Greek Prime Minister Kostas
Simitis over Bonn's demands for a cut to its European Union budget
bill, which will be an issue of dispute for the bloc's Vienna
summit later this week.
</P>
<P>
"There are clear differences of opinion," said Schroeder at
news briefing with Simitis after his talks with the Greek leader.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest European Union paymaster and wants to
slash his net annual EU contribution. An agreement must be reached
by the end of 1999 when the EU's current financial arrangements
expire.
</P>
<P>
Bonn wants to cut EU spending on farm subsidies and reform
infrastructure development aid as a means to finance its budget
rebate. Greece, as one of the EU members which has profited from
both programs, is opposed to that.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the bottom of the scale," said Simitis. He holds EU
should continue capital transfers from the EU's northern states to
the southern members. "Europe must not only be politically united
but must also have economic unity if it is to hold together",
Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Germany's calls to freeze the EU budget, Simitis
said: "We are of a different opinion. We do not believe freezing
the budget would help."
</P>
<P>
But Simitis expressed optimism that agreement could be reached
on the so-called Agenda 2000 reform which covers revamping the
budget, farm subsidies and infrastructure aid.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that despite the different interests solutions can
always be found," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany will take over the rotating E.U. presidency for the
first half of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Namibian PM in Tanzania to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister
Hage Geingob arrived in Dar es Salaam Monday for a three-day
state visit to Tanzania, to boost bilateral relations especially
in trade.
</P>
<P>
Geingob was greeted at the Dar es Salaam International Airport
by his Tanzanian counterpart Frederick Sumaye, as well as Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
He was then driven to the Sheraton Hotel in the city for a
private lunch before holding official talks with Prime Minister
Sumaye in the afternoon. An official dinner is arranged for him
in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Geingob will visit the Dar es Salaam port Tuesday and then fly
to Zanzibar isles for an overnight stay, according to a program
issued by the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
He will come back to Dar es Salaam where he is expected to
attend celebrations to mark Tanzania's Independence Day Wednesday
at the National Stadium before flying to Johannesburg in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
His delegation includes Minister for Finance Nangolo Mbumba,
Minister for Tourism Phillemon Malima, Deputy Minister for Higher
Education Buddy Wentworth, Deputy Minister for Information and
Broadcasting Ignatius Shixhuameni and SWAPO Deputy Secretary for
Transport Maxton Joseph.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Namibian Prime Minister will also pay a
courtesy call on Tanzania's former President Julius Nyerere, a
veteran African statesman.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian foreign ministry officials said the visit of
Namibian Premier is expected to consolidate bilateral ties in the
political, economic, social and cultural domains.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had excellent politico-diplomatic relations
dating back to the 1960s when the Namibian people were struggling
for their national liberation with Dar es Salaam serving as the
rear base.
</P>
<P>
Geingob's visit will stimulate investments and commercial
relations between Tanzania and Namibia, both of which have a lot
to share in terms of trade in various commodities such as coffee,
cashewnuts and rice as well as experiences in fishery and mining
sectors, a foreign ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Dar es Salaam, the Namibian prime minister
paid a private visit to north Tanzania viewing game in the
Olduvai Gorge and Ngorongoro Crater at the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Poland Denies Olympic Bid to Be Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Polish Olympic officials denied
Monday that Zakopane's bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympic Games
had been changed into a joint bid with neighboring Slovakia,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"There was some kind of misunderstanding. Nobody's talking of
a joint bid," secretary general of the Polish Olympic Committee
Janusz Tatera was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tatera was responding to rejection of a Polish-Slovak
agreement by Juan Antonio Samaranch, President of IOC.
</P>
<P>
Both Zakopane in Poland and Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia are
bidding to host the 2006 Olympics. Other competitors are Sion,
Switzerland; Turin, Italy; a joint bid by Helsinki, Finland, and
Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making a
three-country bid that includes regions of Slovenia and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Polish and Slovakian officials announced Sunday that if
Zakopane wins and cannot get permission to hold the downhill
skiing in Tatra National Park, the races would take place at
Poprad.
</P>
<P>
"Poland and Slovakia together? It's too late," Samaranch said
when asked about the agreement. "We have six bids from Europe and
we will be meeting about it next week. Now to change the bids
would be too late."
</P>
<P>
But Tatera said the agreement announced Sunday would only
involve cooperation, rather than a joint candidacy. He said if
Zakopane wins the bid, it can still make changes concerning the
venue of particular events, reports continuted.

<HEADLINE> Greater European Role on Cyprus Issue Underlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Europe (CE)
can make greater contribution towards a solution of the Cyprus
problem, Andras Barsony, President of the Political Committee of
Council's Parliamentary Assembly, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barsony, after calling on Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides
and House of Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou, said,
"Probably the key issue of the solution is a much wider and much
more effective guarantee, on both the security and civilian side."
</P>
<P>
Barsony said he had a "very fruitful" exchange of views with
Cyprus' President on "the elements of a possible solution".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the CE role, Barsony said it "should be much
more significant on the civilian side", as it is not a security
organization.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the existing guarantors of Cyprus' independence
(Britain, Greece and Turkey) could be replaced by the NATO, he
said "it could be a future option, of course it depends on the
parties".
</P>
<P>
He said that experience of the past 25 to 30 years have shown
that more security is needed on Cyprus and that Greece and Turkey
"transferred" their differences here.
</P>
<P>
"A wider international guarantee would put out the issue of
the continuous Turkish-Greek conflict from the island's political
life," Barsony added.
</P>
<P>
Barsony also pointed out that non-NATO members who have
fundamental interests in the region, such as Russia, should also
have a role.
</P>
<P>
CE, with 32 members, was founded in May 1949 to achieve a
greater unity between its members and to facilitate their economic
and social progress.

<HEADLINE> Annan Issues Message on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is the message
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, issued here on Monday, on
the occasion of the 50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, to be marked on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Day 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today, we celebrate the
half-century of a United Nations milestone. We honor the highest
of human aspirations and renew our promise to conquer the worst of
human cruelty.
</P>
<P>
We pay tribute to the minds of those who conceived of these
human rights, and to the memory of those who died for them. And
knowing the power of human wrong, we reaffirm our faith in human
right -- that faith which ultimately will sustain humanity through
its darkest hours and help us defend our human rights where they
are most imperiled.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Day 1998 is a day for all of us who enjoy human
rights to imagine life without them -- and to think how hard we
would fight to retain them. It is a day for those who are still
denied their human rights to dream again of asserting them, and to
know that their dream is our dreams -- the dream of all human
rights for all.
</P>
<P>
It is a day for us to recall not only the rights attained over
50 years, but also the rights denied; to pursue the achievement of
justice by all and for all; to defend against the abuse of human
rights with greater vigilance than ever, and to pursue the
violators of human rights with greater persistence than ever. It
is the day to renew our commitment to globalizing justice in the
age of globalization.
</P>
<P>
I began this anniversary year by reaffirming the universality
of human rights, and by arguing that human rights are foreign to
no culture and native to all nations. From the streets of Asia
to the towns of Africa to the courts of Europe, this past year
has been a year of protest and progress.
</P>
<P>
Rights have been asserted where regimes once ruled; justice has
been delivered where impunity once reigned; and memory has been
honored where the powerful once enjoyed immunity. If only every
year were to offer such hope, and prove to all that human rights
cannot be denied where human beings live and breathe.
</P>
<P>
But that is our challenge. To make it so. To make every day
matter in the fight to broaden the horizons of human rights
until that day when no man is tortured, no woman is abused and
no child is denied his dignity -- when all human beings enjoy
their human rights.

<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The value of shares trade on
the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) fell sharply by 56.1 percent in
the third quarter of this year due to depressed investor
confidence, the Zimbabwe Financial Holdings has said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its latest economic bulletin released Monday
in Harare that "investor sentiment on the Zimbabwe stock market
remained depressed mainly due to high inflation and interest
rates as well as an unstable currency."
</P>
<P>
It said as a result local investors shifted their focus from
the equity market to the money market where short-term returns
were comparatively higher and more certain.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors' sentiment was affected by the financial and
economic problems facing other emerging stock markets,
particularly the economic turmoil in Russia and Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See All Human Beings Enjoy Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday voiced his hope to see that "all human beings
enjoys their human rights."
</P>
<P>
To safeguard Human Rights "is our challenge," he said. "To make
every day matter in the fight to broaden the horizon of human
rights until that day when no man is tortured, no woman is abused
and no child is denied his dignity -- when all human beings enjoy
their human rights."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks in his message on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, to be observed on December 10, which also coincides with
the World Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
"Human Rights Day 1998 marks the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights," Annan said. "Today, we
celebrate the half-century of a United Nations milestone."
</P>
<P>
"Human Rights Day 1998 is a day for all of us who enjoy human

"It is a day for us to recall not only the rights attained
over 50 years, but also the rights denied; to pursue the
achievement of justice by all and for all; to defend against the
abuse of human rights with greater vigilance persistence than

</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, 1.5 billion people must get by on
less than 1 U.S. dollar a day. In South Asia, half of all children
under 5 are malnourished. Only a third of the people in
sub-Saharan Africa are likely to live past 40.
</P>
<P>
"It is the day to renew our commitment to globalizing justice
in the age of globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Rights have been asserted where regimes once ruled; justice
has been delivered where impunity once reigned; and memory has
been honored where the powerful once enjoyed immunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement came as the world is marking the 50th
anniversary this week of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Adopted on December 10, 1948, in the aftermath of World War II,
the declaration was designed to prevent a repetition of the
horrors of the Holocaust and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the pronouncement that "all human beings are born
free and equal in dignity and rights," the United Nations document
set out to cover the range of human existence. It has become at
once the most quoted international document of modern times.

<HEADLINE> 100 People Evacuated in North Carolina State in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 people were
evacuated after a tractor-trailer crashed along Interstate 26 and
spilled a highly volatile and toxic chemical in North Carolina
State of the United States, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The truck, carrying a mixed cargo including sodium
hydrosulfite, overturned Sunday afternoon and sparked a fire that
was still burning early Monday. Troopers closed a 13-kilometer
stretch of the interstate in western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation describes sodium
hydrosulfite as a corrosive, spontaneously combustible material
that can burn skin and eyes. It is used in bleaching paper pulp
and in the production of leather goods.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters hoped to let the fire burn itself out, but they
worried that rain forecast for Monday could make matters worse.
The chemical can react explosively when it comes into contact with
water.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Health Delivery System Decentralized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps Monday said his ministry was
working on decentralizing the health system in areas designated
under the government land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
Stamps was officiating at a donation ceremony from the
Zimbabwean representative of the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) aimed at reinforcing the health delivery systems in the
resettled areas, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the land redistribution program had been left for too
long, his ministry still had hope the Health for All by the Year
2000 vision could be achieved if services were decentralized to
the resettled areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry wants to decentralize the health system in the
resettlement areas so that people settled there do not rely on
health facilities in major centers," said Stamps.
</P>
<P>
The assistance from UNFPA would be used in the improvement of
the health delivery system in resettlement areas.
</P>
<P>
Stamps received five million Zimbabwean Dollars (about 140,000
U.S. Dollars) from the UNFPA.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The 19th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) opened here Monday evening with an aim
to cementing regional cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was set up in Abu Dhabi in May 1981 when the leaders of
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates held their first summit.
</P>
<P>
The alliance was intended to enhance coordination, cooperation
and unification in all fields of the six member states in the
strategic and oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
One of its main targets is to establish a common market, to
unify customs duties, industrial policies and investment laws as
well as to set up a unified currency.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has three main structures, namely the Supreme Council,
the Ministerial Council and the Secretariat General based in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the group meet once a year to develop their plans
for collective security and economic unity.
</P>
<P>
The six countries produce nearly 13.5 million barrels of oil
each day, or one fifth of the world's total. Their oil reserves,
which are estimated at 465 billion barrels, account for 45 percent
of the total global oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The GCC members, whose economy depends heavily on oil earnings,
have suffered a hard hit in the current oil price slump resulting
from oversupply and flagging demand.

<HEADLINE> Incidence of Childhood Asthma in Greece Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of childhood
asthma in Greece had increased fivefold over the past 20 years
mainly due to parent smoke and bad ventilation, according to the
findings of a study released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was recently conducted by the Greek Pulmonary
Society in Iraklion, Thessaloniki and Ioannina, showed that about
two in 10 Greek children suffered from asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Greek island of Crete, the number of primary
school students suffering asthma attacks after gymnastic sessions
was triple the number of the other two regions. This appeared to
be due to either to genetic reasons or to the fact that the warm
climate on the island contributed to the spread of allergens,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Asthma was more prevalent in urban centers, but still present
in rural regions, where certain crops could bring about an asthma
attack.
</P>
<P>
Kostis Kotordis, president of the society, said that smog was
just not able to create as serious a problem as cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
Homes were not aired properly, allowing allergens in dust to
circulate, a problem that had increased with advent of double
glazed windows, experts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Hails Lebanese New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala Monday
praised the formation of the Lebanese new government and voiced
U.S. support for the new regime.
</P>
<P>
"Everything that I've heard and seen in Lebanon leads me to
report to the president (Bill Clinton) how much promise and
enthusiasm there is for the government," Shalala said after a
meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
"We had a very good meeting with President Lahoud. We
transmitted to him the president's strong support for him and
his government, and how impressed we were with his cabinet
appointments," she added.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, 62, a former army commander, took over from his
predecessor Elias Hrawi last month. He designated Lebanon's
four-time prime minister Salim Hoss as the new head of government
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-man new cabinet announced by Hoss three days ago was
made up of many fresh faces, a government described by local media
as "clean and honest" in contrast to the previous one charged with
corruption.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process and the issue of south
Lebanon, Shalala said the U.S. is committed to a comprehensive
peace and settlement in the region which will also cover
south Lebanon issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israel's occupation.

<HEADLINE> French President Calls for Respect of Cultural Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday called for the respect of cultural diversity and dialogue
when dealing with the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made to the UNESCO marking the 50th anniversary of
the birth of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris,
Chirac said that the fight for human rights remains a "violent
reality."
</P>
<P>
"We don't succeed either through containment, nor by giving
lessons. It is through dialogue, cooperation and technical
assistance that we move ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the fight for human rights has brought
about fruits, the principles proclaimed by the Declaration 50
years ago are still being mocked at.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the fight for human rights is also one of
"economic fight" because economic development and democracy go
hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that "an agenda on globalization" be submitted to
the United Nations General Assembly before 2000 to establish
economic, social and judicial rules around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom without law, it is absolute power of the strong over
the weak. It is the incumbent duty of the international community
to work out the rules of this new world order," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac warned against the negative effects coming down from the
modern information technologies such as the information highway
being developed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also warned French citizens against the danger of racism and
xenophobia which are being promoted by forces such as the National
Front.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Further OPEC Output Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh Monday called for a further cut in the output
ceiling of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriies
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
"Iran wants a reduction of 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) or
higher in OPEC's output ceiling," Zanganeh was quoted by the
official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh's appeal came amid reports that Iran and Saudi Arabia,
the two oil producing giants in the Persian Gulf, have held
consultations aimed at recovering the sluggish oil market.
</P>
<P>
Before a year-end meeting of the OPEC in Vienna in November,
Zanganeh held talks with his Saudi counterpart Ali al-Naimi on
ways to lift the sagging oil prices. But they failed to work out
any measures.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's average oil price has been cut nearly by half over the
past year because of a global oil glut brought on by its ill-timed
decision last winter to boost production, coinciding with Asia's
economic crisis and falling demands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 11-nation oil cartel failed to achieve a further
output cut at the Vienna meeting due to the internal differences
among its member states.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh did not comment on talks between Iranian and Saudi
officials, but said that Iran produces crude oil according to its
OPEC-determined quota and has so far observed the reduction in its
crude output.
</P>
<P>
Iran's quota is 3.94 million bpd according to the OPEC decision
in November last year, and its current production was reported at
around 3.6 million bpd after the OPEC agreed to a cut of 2.6
million bpd earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders have recently urged the OPEC members to
cooperate closely in order to save the flagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the OPEC may discuss measures for the
further output cut before its next group meeting in March.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Trying to Get More From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is trying to get more
than 2,000 million U.S. Dollars from its donors to support the
country's socio-economic programs in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the high-profile World Bank-organized
Consultative Group Meeting, popularly known as the donors'
meeting being held in Sheraton Hotel here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our total financing gap is 2,176 million U.S. Dollars over
three years of which 1,191 million Dollars will be met from money
already committed and 985 million Dollars is what we require them
(the donors) to commit themselves to this week," Secretary to the
Treasury Emannuel Tumusiime Metebile said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference has drawn delegates from more than 20
countries and more than 20 funding agencies. President Yoweri
Museveni is expected to address the conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Ugandan government is asking for more donations,
most of the donors are pressing for more accountability of their
donated money and urges the government to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that as Uganda is developing its
economy at a rare rate, quite a big sum of the donated money has
been embezzled by corrupt officials in the government.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has gotten more than 800 million Dollars from donors in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Speed up Railways Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- African States are urged
Monday to achieve adequate development policy and pursue and
accelerate the restructuring process of the railway sector.
</P>
<P>
The call is made by Omer M.M. Nour, President of the Union of
African Railways (UAR), at the opening ceremony of the four-day
26th general assembly held at the United Nations Conference
Center here.
</P>
<P>
The president said that economic development and commercial
relationship between States and regions have changed to a
world-wide system including liberalization of the transport
system based in a competition between different modes.
</P>
<P>
"The UAR should sum up and analyze the different experiences
on restructuring," he says, adding that "the restructuring of the
railways companies and their transformation into market oriented
commercial enterprises should be willingly, persistently and
rigorously carried out."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, A.M.A. Dirar, Director of Economic
Development and Cooperation Department of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), says privatization and commercialization of
railway operations are now strong on the agenda of many African
governments and are regarded as the major solutions to the
problems of undercapitalization and inefficiency in the railways.
</P>
<P>
This is a new concept not only in Africa, but also worldwide,
he said, adding that the UAR needs to address this issue
critically and assist its members in carrying out the
privatization process successfully.
</P>
<P>
The growing private sector participation in railway business
will influence membership and decision making in the UAR, he
said, hoping the UAR to re-examine and re-shape itself so as to
be able to meet the challenges of today in the railway
sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The four-day UAR annual meeting will hold deliberations
focusing on the ways of privatizing African Railways.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Meet all EMU Entry Criteria, Says Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece would meet all the
economic targets that would allow Athens' entry into the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by January 1, 2001, a Greek bank
official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference held by the Hellenic-American Chamber,
the National Bank of Greece Governor Theodoros Karatzas said that
Greece was a stone's throw away from meeting EMU entry criteria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek stock market had made a healthy
contribution to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Stock Exchange's capitalization at the end of
October stood at more than 58 billion U.S. dollars despite a
global financial crisis, up from 34.7 billion dollars at the end
of 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the Athens bourse had also enjoyed a
higher rate of growth than other markets in Europe and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Greece's National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou also expressed optimism that Greece would realize its
goal of joining the EMU in 2001.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in post-war that a Greek government was
attaining its targets, he said, adding that this had boosted
Greece's international credibility and resulted in international
financial organizations taking Greece's EMU entry for granted and
recommending to their clients to purchase Greek state securities.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday informed the Security Council that the Afghan
parities had agreed in principle with the deployment of U.N.
civilian monitors in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President of the Security Council, Annan
said with the agreement of the Security Council, accordingly, he
would intend to establish a Civil Affairs Unit within the United
Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), which would be
initially staffed by 12 civilian monitors.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the primary objective of the unit would be to
monitor the situation and, through their presence, seek to
promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter
massive and systematic violation of human rights and
humanitarian law in the future.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the deployment of civilian monitors would supplement
the core role of UNSMA, which is to assist his Special Envoy in
his peacemaking activities in Afghanistan, monitor the overall
political and military situation, and maintain contacts with all
Afghan factions, as well as with Governments and organizations
concerned with the future of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would send an assessment mission to the
Afghanistan, as soon as security conditions permit, in order to
determine the exact mandate, composition and location of the
civilian monitors.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will meet on Tuesday on Annan's proposal
of deploying the civilian monitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Palestinians were
injured in West Bank cities on Monday when Israeli soldiers
clamped down their demonstrations for the release of Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 Palestinians were lightly hurt as they clashed
with Israeli soldiers who guarded a Jewish holy site near
Bethlehem. The demonstrators threw stones at the soldiers, who
responded with rubber-coated bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
On the ourskirts of Ramallah, eight Palestinians were wounded
during their clashes with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers near the
Israeli-controlled Jewish neighborhood. And three Palestinians
were injured.
</P>
<P>
And a Palestinian was seriously wounded when an Israeli
civilian fired at the demonstrators with a gun after his car
was stoned by them near east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli soldiers were wounded in the clashes with the
Palestinians all over the West Bank, according to the Israeli
radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian demonstrators also confronted with
the Palestinian police in some locations as the latter tried
to stop them from moving out the Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
In Nabulus, about three thousands protesters marched toward
the Jewish patriarch Joseph's tomb on the outskirts of the
city. And they were confronted with dozens of the Palestinian
policemen, who tried to halt the march with clubs. Three of them
were injured.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Palestinian Prisoners Association on
Monday called for a new Palestinian intifada (uprising) until all
three Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails were freed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces said Monday the Palestinians would
continue and possibly intensify their demonstrations as the
U.S. President Bill Clinton was expected to arrive in the region
on Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Okayed to Reoccupy U.N. Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly (GA) session on Monday morning adopted by consensus a
Credentials Committee recommendation for Cambodia to reclaim its
U.N. seat, a spokesperson for the GA President announced.
</P>
<P>
Jadranka Mihalic, the spokesperson, told a press conference
that the GA plenary session adopted a special report by the
Credentials Committee on the credentials of Cambodia, and the
Cambodian delegation is seated at the General Assembly after its
seat remains vacant for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The adoption was made without a vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Credentials Committee cleared the way on Friday last week
for Cambodia to reoccupy its U.N. seat after the committee acted
without a vote and without any speeches at a closed-door meeting
that lasted only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
The GA made the decision after the swear-in of the new
Cambodian coalition government on November 30, which is headed
by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a statement, voicing
his welcome to the new government in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, Cambodia's Head of State King Norodom Sihanouk
sent Annan a letter naming Cambodia's new U.N. delegation.
</P>
<P>
Those credentials named Ouch Borith, previously Cambodia's
deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, as the new
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Credentials Committee decided in September 1997 to leave
Cambodia's seat vacant when it was claimed by rival factions
following a coup two months earlier in which First Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh was unseated by co-premier Hun Sen.

reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary group reportedly held the meeting over the
weekend in County Cavan, not far from the Irish Republic's border
with Northern Ireland, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has recently denied that it was planning such a
meeting, and rejected reports that it would discuss arms
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The failure of groups including the IRA to decommission arms
has led to fears that the peace process in the province may
falter.
</P>
<P>
Last week talks between Northern Ireland parties at Stormont
Castle on the establishment of cross-border bodies and an
executive body on the new Northern Ireland Assembly stalled amid
wrangling over arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland First Minister, David Trimble, has said he
would not allow Sinn Fein to take up seats in the executive, until
the IRA begins to give up weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is equally adamant that it has a right to be sit on
the executive regardless of what the IRA does.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern held a 15-minute telephone
discussion on Monday about the hold-up in the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders plan to contact the various parties over the
next few days in a bid to force progress before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urged to Take Initiative in Reducing Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Press and Mass
Media Minister Demetris Reppas Monday urged the Cypriot government
to take initiatives in reducing tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting by Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides,
Reppas, who is also Greek government Spokesman, said "this is a
time of challenges, with many opportunities which we should make
full use of, so that they will not be lost".
</P>
<P>
"We must have the initiative of making the moves," said
Reppas, who is on a one-day visit to Cyprus, adding that pressure
should be exerted on all those who can directly or indirectly
contribute to a fair and just solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support to efforts for a reduction of tension
on the island and said "bold decisions" were undertaken by the
government of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that the arena which Cyprus and Greece must choose
should not be that of "armaments, aggravation and juxtaposition".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in january 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense, a move
rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch preemptive
strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said the S-300 anti-aircraft missile "is an aspect of
the issues which concern the Cyprus problem", and it should be
handled within this perspective.
</P>
<P>
He said "if the deployment of the missiles really strengthens
Cyprus' armament and helps promote efforts for a Cyprus
settlement, then it will be a wise choice".
</P>
<P>
However, he added new conditions and new circumstances should
be examined before making choice.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that what is significant is to "reach as near as
possible to the target of reducing tension in the region and of
course, a solution to the Cyprus problem".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup. Turkey now has a military
force of more than 35,000 to protect the break-away Turkish
republic Northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Expecting to End Civil War Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is expecting to end the
civil war in his country by Christmas, Southern African
Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka based SABA quoted Kabila as saying that a
cease-fire was possible. He made the comments during a surprise
meeting with Namibian President Sam Nujoma, a key ally in his
four-month struggle against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who visited Namibia last Friday, said that he was
ready for the upcoming peace talks, to be held in Lusaka on
December 14.
</P>
<P>
However, he also warned that his conditions for a cease-fire
would include the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops from
the DRC's territory.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese leader said if Rwanda and Uganda wanted to
remain in Congo (K), former Zaire, peace would be far from coming
to the region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kabila was also due to visit Angola,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe this week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Crackdown on Medicare Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday proposed a crackdown on Medicare fraud and abuse that could
save the federal government some 2 billion U.S. dollars in health
payments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton unveiled a package of legislative initiatives that
would help the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) combat
wasteful or abusive practices in the Medicare system, such as
padding drug prices or billing for services that were delivered
barely or not at all.
</P>
<P>
"This happens more often than you think," Clinton said. "By
passing these common-sense measures to fight Medicare waste and
fraud, Congress can do more than help save taxpayers money.... We
can help ensure that the system that has served our parents and
grandparents so well will be there to serve our children and
grandchildren."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan includes eliminating markups in the prices
Medicare is charged for drugs, so Medicare would pay only what a
drug costs the provider. Medicare covers only certain drugs that
must be administered by a doctor or in a hospital, such as those
used for dialysis or organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
An inspector general's report by the Department of Health and
Human Services found that markups for 22 drugs cost Medicare
hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Medicare paid more than
twice the average wholesale price for certain drugs, and in one
instance paid roughly 10 times the wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the HCFA would have authority to recover
twice the amount owed by insurers that allow Medicare to pay
claims they owe and to impose fines for failing to report legal
settlements where Medicare should have been reimbursed.

<HEADLINE> 6 African States Discuss Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from six
African countries are gathering here Monday to discuss how to
improve learning in rural primary schools of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Uganda
and Zambia as well as representatives from bilateral and
multilateral agencies are participating in the five-day workshop
beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the workshop are to gain better
understanding of processes which help improve learning outcomes
in rural primary schools; to provide a forum in which the
participants contribute to the exchange of experiences and to
generate new ideas for action.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read on his behalf at the workshop, Zambian
Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda said population growth and a
heavy debt burden are factors, among others, which are slowing
down socio-economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said rapid population growth means not only a short-term
sacrifice of per capita income growth but also tighter
constraints in extending education.
</P>
<P>
In most cases the rural area is the most affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up till 1966 the education cycle in Zambia consisted of seven
years of primary education, five years of secondary education and
four year of higher education, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said in the new national policy on education the government
has adopted a new system in which every Zambian child will have
nine years of basic education (7-5-4).
</P>
<P>
The breakdown is grades one to four lower basic, grade five to
seven middle basic, grade eight to nine upper basic and grade 10
to 12 high school with the last four years being for higher
education (9-3-4), Miyanda said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is one of a number of activities which the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and the World Bank are organizing within the framework
of the more comprehensive U.N. Special Initiative for Africa.

Cooperation Council (GCC) to succeed in bringing about more
benefits to the peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
"GCC leaders are capable with their wisdom and sight to add new

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes Renewal of UN Civilian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Canada
welcomed Monday the United Nations Security Council's decision to
renew the UN Civilian Police Mission in Haiti(MIPONUH) for one
additional year.
</P>
<P>
The Mission will again comprise up to 300 civilian police
officers, and will continue to assist the Government of Haiti by
supporting and contributing to the professionalization of the
Haitian National Police. Canada will again provide 24 police
officers and six Canadian Forces armored personnel carriers. As
part of Canada's broader bilateral development assistance program,
22 Canadian police experts are offering technical assistance to
the Haitian National Police.
</P>
<P>
The Mission was renewed after the President of Haiti requested
that the United Nations support further development of the Haitian
National Police. The Mission's new mandate will expire on November
30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Haitian National Police made great progress in the past
year with the support of MIPONUH," said Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"However, much remains to be done. The renewal of the MIPONUH
mandate is a reflection of the continued commitment of the
international community to further democracy, justice and the
respect for human rights in Haiti," added the Canadian Foreign
Minister.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  Annan Stresses Partnership Between U.N., GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan Monday stressed the importance of the partnership
between the U.N. and the Gulf cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the GCC summit here,
Annan said that "the partnership between the U.N. and GCC is
of the utmost importance -- especially in the field of
peacemaking and preventive diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"The global challenge we face in today's world requires the
international community to build bridges across regions and
sub-regions," he said, adding that "these bridges are two-way
avenues for cooperation in which every country can and must
play its part within its means and its areas of strength."
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first U.N. chief to address the GCC summit,
said Regional organizations such as the GCC are U.N.'s most
important partners and allies. "They serve to both complement
and support the U.N.'s work," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, Annan said that the only way to
lift the U.N. sanctions on Iraq "is for Iraq to comply fully
with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"I was saddened and burdened, therefore, by the Iraqi
decision in October not to cooperate with the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq narrowly averted a U.S. military strike in the last minute
in November by backing down its October decision and to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Opposition Group to Hold Meeting in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese opposition leader said
here Monday that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) of Sudan
will discuss possible actions against the government in a meeting
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
former Sudanese Prime Minister al-Sadeq al-Mahdi said the NDA
meeting will come in light of the need for an understanding at the
highest level of the group.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify the date of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting, he discussed with Moussa the
situation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
NDA, an umbrella group of Sudan's opposition factions, includes
the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), a major rebel group in
the south, led by John Garang, and the Ummah Party, led by
al-Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
SPLA has been fighting since 1983 to press for increased
autonomy for the southern third of Sudan, which is mainly African,
Christian and animist, from the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
SPLA and the Sudanese government have held several rounds of
talks on autonomy in the south, but failed to reach an agreement
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi said that NDA leaders will also hold talks with
Egyptian officials in a bid to consult with Egypt on the Sudanese
issues.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mahdi expressed appreciation for Egypt's key role in helping
resolving the Sudanese issue, saying that "the time has come for
the Egyptian role to contain the Sudanese crisis."
</P>
<P>
Egypt hosted a similar meeting of NDA in August, which was
opposed by Sudan.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt argued that its move was aimed at helping secure
Sudan's territorial integrity. It fears that a possible
disintergration of the southern neighbor could endanger the Nile
River, its main source of water.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
against President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also accused Sudan of harboring Islamic militants, who
attempt to topple the Egyptian secular government and install a
strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting of Sudanese rebel groups is announced at a
time when a thaw in the ties seems to have set in after the two
sides expressed readiness to improve the bilateral relations and
exchanged visits by senior officials.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sanctions Create Losses of 23 Billion Dollars: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Libya told the United
Nations in a report issued here on Monday that it had lost some
23.64 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year in the wake of
sanctions imposed since 1992 in connection with the Lockerbie
airliner bombings.
</P>
<P>
"The financial losses sustained since the sanctions were
imposed on April 15, 1992, continue to mount," the 21-page report
said, "As at December 31, 1997, they came to roughly
23,641,923,728 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan report listed such most-affected sectors, which
suffered "enormous damage in terms of human and material loss," as
health, agriculture, animal husbandry, transport, industry,
economy and energy.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security Council because
of Libya's failure to hand over for trial in Britain or the United
States the two Libyans accused of planting a bomb aboard a Pan Am
airliner that exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on
December 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The Sanctions, broadened in 1993, include a ban on
international flights to and from Libya, an arms embargo, a
downgrading of diplomatic ties, a freeze on some Libyan assets
abroad. However, there is no embargo on oil exports, the main
earner of foreign exchange for Libya.
</P>
<P>
In August this year, Tripoli offered cooperation with London
and Washington by agreeing to hold the trial of the two suspects
by a Scottish court in the Netherlands, but it refused to let the
two Libyans, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who flew to Libya for a
meeting on Saturday with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, failed to
bring a solution to the long-standing issue.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait tends to buy
U.S.-made Paladin howitzers to arm its land forces, Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti Army was in dire need of the U.S.-made howitzer
guns to fill the shortage suffered by the land forces," he said in
answer to a question by MP Mubarak Al-Duwaila on the purchase of
the U.S.-made guns.
</P>
<P>
On reasons for the option, Salem said the reports on the
purchase by the Ministry of Defense to the Supreme Defense
Council, which have not been made public, were based on
"operational testimonials and documents as well as on the
recommendations of the competent committees and army commanders."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kuwait plans to equip up to three
battalions with howitzer guns and is studying offers worth of a
total of 750 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Several world big powers including the United States have been
bidding for a share of the weapons purchase on the part of
Kuwait. Washington is offering its M109 A6 Paladin howitzers.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed purchase is controversial in Kuwait
itself. Some of Kuwait's lawmakers have strongly criticized the
government plan to buy the U.S.-made howitzers, saying the guns
are outmoded and not compatible with the Kuwaiti armament
system.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Forms Long-Term Strategy to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Monday that it has
formulated a strategy till the year 2010 to promote economic
growth while bringing down the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, Egypt is expected to raise its the annual
economic growth rate to 7 percent while bringing the unemployment
rate to less than 3 percent, Minister of State for Planning Zafer
el-Beshri told a forum here organized by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
El-Beshri said that his country has removed hurdles hindering
foreign investments and is expediting economic reforms to increase
the growth rate, Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt started economic reforms in 1991, featuring privatization
of state-run enterprises. One third of the 314 chosen state
enterprises have been sold under the reform program, sponsored by
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The reform program, which was carried out in three stages from
1991 to 1998, was designed to upgrade Egypt's financial and
currency systems and expand the role of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has offered Egypt a total of 4.5 billion dollars
in long-term loans since 1970, el-Beshri said.
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts, Egypt's gross domestic product has
grown from 2 percent to the current 5 percent, inflation fallen
from 20 percent to below 5 percent and foreign currency reserves
climbed to 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But privatization also caused the rise of unemployment. The
International Labor Organization (ILO) said last month in a report
that that 11.3 percent of Egypt's 17.7 million labor force are out
of work.
</P>
<P>
ILO maintained that Egypt has to sustain an annual economic
growth rate of 6 percent over the next five years to pull down the
unemployment rate to 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
During his speech at the forum, Kamal Darwish, vice president
of the World Bank for the Middle East and North Africa, spoke
highly of the success Egypt has achieved in the economic reforms
and the cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bank will continue cooperation with Egypt
and go on with financing the country's development projects.

<P>
In a letter to members of Congress, Clinton said Iran had been
removed from the list after the United States concluded that Iran
had carried out a successful program to eradicate cultivation of
opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
While Iran continues to serve as a transit point for opiates
heading for Europe, there is no evidence to suggest that
significant quantities arrive in the United States, Clinton said
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also deleted Malaysia from the list on grounds that the
country has not been used significantly as a transit point for
U.S.-bound drugs.
</P>
<P>
By deleting Iran and Malaysia, the list of drug problem
countries was reduced to 28.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said in the letter that the two countries still
bear watching as the drug traffic could resume or even increase as
the region recovers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision to write off Iran from the drug list came at
a time when the administration is reaching out to Iran, attempting
to establish a political dialogue for the first time in almost two
decades. But officials insisted that politics did not intervene in
the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy said the removal was based on
a precise legal determination under a 1961 law, and did not
reflect any larger issues in U.S.-Iranian relations, which have
thawed slightly under Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"It did not include any political consideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Republican Senator Charles Grassley and
Representative Benjamin Gilman expressed concern over news
reports suggesting possible removal of Iran from the drug list.
</P>
<P>
They said in a letter to Clinton that any effort to remove Iran
from the list is not based on substantive grounds but on the
"speculative hope that such a unilateral gesture will win
diplomatic points in Iran for some anticipated rapprochement."

<HEADLINE> W. Africa Conf on River Blindness Opens in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Vice-President John
Evans Atta Mills Monday called for collaborative efforts to
sustain the gains of the Onchocerciasis control program (OCP) to
eradicate river blindness from the sub-region, especially Ghana.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that we mop up every remaining small pocket of
infection," Mills told the opening session of the 19th Joint
Program Committee (JPC) of the Onchocerciasis Control Program
(OCP) in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
The one-week conference, sponsored by Ghana's ministry of
health, the Onchocerciasis Secretariat and the World Health
Organization (WHO), is being attended by health ministers and
representatives from eight countries in the sub-region, as well
as by affiliated international organizations, a special story
sent by Ghana News Agency (GNA) to Xinhua here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The JPC is made up of experts to draw action plans for the OCP
toward effective control of the disease of river blindness.
</P>
<P>
The conference is also to take stock of activities of the
program and assess preparations so far made by participating
countries to fully take over the responsibilities of the OCP
after its withdrawal by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reports show that prevalence of the disease, which was put at
between 80 and 90 percent in 1974 has been drastically reduced to
between zero and 50 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is caused by
small worms that are passed on to people through the bite of the
black fly.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the symptoms of the disease include intense body
itching, development of leopard skin, painless nodules and poor
vision.
</P>
<P>
Mills expressed the hope that given the technology, support
and right leadership and motivation, joint inter-state or
sub-regional efforts can work effectively for the common good.

<HEADLINE> Annan Stresses Partnership Between U.N., GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan stressed Monday the importance of the partnership between
the U.N. and the Gulf cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the GCC summit here, Annan
said that "the partnership between the U.N. and GCC is of the
utmost importance -- especially in the field of peacemaking and
preventive diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"The global challenge we face in today's world requires the
international community to build bridges across regions and
sub-regions," he said, adding that "these bridges are two-way
avenues for cooperation in which every country can and must play
its part within its means and its areas of strength."
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first U.N. chief to attend the GCC summit, said
Regional organizations such as the GCC are U.N.'s most important
partners and allies. "They serve to both complement and support
the U.N.'s work," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, Annan said that the only way to lift the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq "is for Iraq to comply fully with the
relevant resolutions of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"I was saddened and burdened, therefore, by the Iraqi decision
in October not to cooperate with the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq narrowly averted a U.S. military strike in the last minute
in November by backing down from its decision and to resume
cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, the
U.N. chief expressed hope that the Wye agreement signed recently
"will be implemented in all its aspects and will pave the way for
the resumption of negotiations on all tracks."
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, Israel will pull out its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for tougher
Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all parties concerned to make efforts in
pursuing a lasting solution to the conflict between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that violence launched by elements opposed to
the peace process have continued to cost lives and mar progress.
"They must be condemned," he said.

LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for

<HEADLINE> Iran to Test Electronic System for Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday an
electronic system to guide missiles or deviate their direction
will be tested in the ongoing Vahdat-77 (Unity-77) naval
maneuvers in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the maneuver Issa Golverdi told the official
news agency IRNA that in testing application of the mechanism
for deviating the missile direction, real missiles will be
deployed in the operational zones.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the coming two days, the system, named as
Mersad (Ambush), will be tested in both static and dynamic
fields.
</P>
<P>
Defensive readiness against missile threats from the other
side of the region is the main motive behind
research work on the electronic system, Golverdi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the deployment of the system plays a key role in
preserving security, interests and vital resources of the Islamic
Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The five-day military exercises kicked off in the
Persian Gulf waters on Friday. Golverdi said that several stages
of the maneuver have been successfully carried out.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Fade as Wall St Fails to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A European share rally faded
Monday despite a bullish performance overnight in Asia and a surge
on Wall Street last Friday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended slightly weaker as investors remained
on hold ahead of the Bank of England's rate-setting meeting later
in the week.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters poll of economists showed 23 out of 26 expected a
rate cut of at least 25 basis points. The FTSE 100 index closed
5.2 points, or 0.1 percent, down at 5,576.7 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market had drifted in a state of torpor as
early impetus from overnight rallies in New York and Hong Kong
faded.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index fell after early gains, with a lack
of signals to inspire the market preventing a traditional year-end
rally, traders said.
</P>
<P>
By 1515 GMT the electronically traded Xetra Dax was down 1.9
percent at 4,709.37 points. The floor Dax fell 1.2 percent to
4,718.93 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders in the Frankfurt market said that with a pan-European
interest rate cut last week, the prospect of another market
boosting near-term rate cut had been quashed.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks closed up 0.87 percent after the Dow's bullish
performance Friday failed to follow through at start of trade on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed up 32.63 points at 3,771.22 after
peaking at 3,794.94 earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the lackluster session to a lack of
investor interest, scant corporate news and preparations for euro
launch.

<HEADLINE> European, American Pillars Should Both Develop: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Tuesday called on European Union countries to
develop a common defense policy working in tandem with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the NATO foreign ministers council meeting, Cook
said that the Europeans should have the ability to react when
their interest and security were threatened.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France have joined in fostering a dialogue on
common European Union defense policy with the signing of an
agreement last week at Saint-Malo.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said that both the European and
American pillars within NATO should contribute toward the security
of the Euro-Atlantic area.
</P>
<P>
However, it was time for Europe to make its contribution by
restructuring the European pillar, to render it usable not only in
collective defense operations, but in crisis management,
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that no one or two European countries could monopolize
the EU on the issue of a common European defense policy. The
common EU defense policy needed transparency, tolerance and
enthusiasm to work, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to pursue the European Security and Defense
Identity (ESDI) together," stressed the British foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
The ESDI concept was first developed during the 1994 NATO
council at heads of state and government level and aims at
developing European defense capability within the framework of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
NATO has expressed its preparedness to allow European member
states to use the alliance's assets and capabilities in their own
operations.
</P>
<P>
But, Cook stressed, there would be no point if European members
failed to contribute to NATO military effectiveness in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is one of the three nuclear states within
NATO, said that he did not see the need for a change in the
alliance's nuclear deterrence doctrine that has been the core of
NATO strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
The United States and France are the other two nuclear states
in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher and Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy both publicly announced their
support for a no-first-use policy.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said after the council meeting that a growing
consensus was building up among NATO decision-makers that any
change would have to make both military as well as political
sense.

<HEADLINE> Albania Urges Compromise Among Kosovo Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani has appealed for compromise and coordination among
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian parties in dealing with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Rifat Blaku, deputy-chairman of the Kosovo
Parliamentary Party, on Monday, Meidani said Albania will try its
best to attain a fair settlement to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
But he added that all Kosovo political forces, which have been
divided on resolving the Kosovo issue, should coordinate in their
dialogue with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Meidani's appeal came after Kosovo's Albanian parties,
including the Kosovo Liberation Army, failed to reach a consensus
on the settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has repeatedly urged ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo to speak with one voice in order to strengthen their
position in negotiations with Belgrade.

PARIS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Haitians living in exile in
France and several French college professors have set up a
committee calling for the trial of former Haitian dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier, otherwise known as "Baby Doc", for crimes
against humanity during his rule from 1971 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Gerald Bloncourt, a Haitian
journalist, as saying that "the Committee for the Prosecution of
Duvalier" was created in Paris to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Duvalier, 47, fled Haiti to France in 1986 in the wake of
several weeks of riots in his country.
</P>
<P>
He and his father, Francois Duvalier, ruled Haiti with an iron
fist symbolized by the death squad "Tontons Macoutes".
</P>
<P>
Duvalier, who is living near Paris in a house rented by his
relatives and is without residency papers or income, has been
rarely seen in public since his mother died a year ago in a clinic
in the Paris region, according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Ministry said that it had no information on
the situation of Duvalier, who has been refused the status of
political refugee by the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Sauveur Vaisse, said that Duvalier was in France
two weeks ago and was very probably still in the country.
</P>
<P>
So far no warrant of arrest or extradition request has been
made against Duvalier, said French officials.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Education Crisis Poses Threat on Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of millions of children
are growing up without good basic education, posing a threat to
global peace and prosperity, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) warned in an annual report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF pointed out that modern technology is unprecedentedly
providing people with access to information, but it has widened
the gap between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy is that the technological advances have further
deepened the gap between the rich and poor, and between those
sufficiently affluent and educated to benefit from the new
learning technology and those disqualified by poverty and
illiteracy," said The State of the World's Children 1999 report.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF executive director, who is here for the
launch of the report, urged international cooperation in promoting
children's education.
</P>
<P>
Describing poverty and mounting debts as strangling developing
countries attempts to provide education for children, she urged
the developed countries to review the debts of developing
countries and to provide them with development assistance.
</P>
<P>
To achieve education for all children, the world needed to
spend an additional seven billion U.S. dollars per year over the
next decade, according to the report. "This is less than the
annual spending of Americans on cosmetics, or Europeans on
ice-cream."

<HEADLINE> Large Fund Ready for Anti-AIDS Campaign in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has allocated some 38
million U.S. dollars to campaign against AIDS in the current
Iranian calendar year to end March 20, 1999, an Iranian official
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Iran's Anti-AIDS Campaign Committee Nasser Yeganeh
said in Semnan, east of Tehran, that Iran has also received an
equivalent of 300 million rials (about 100,000 dollars) from
international organizations for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on the
sidelines of the gathering "Mobilization of the Youth against the
Disease AIDS," Yeganeh said the first case of AIDS was identified
in Iran in 1987.
</P>
<P>
There have been 1,443 HIV positive cases identified in Iran up
to last October, of which 206 have progressed to full blown
AIDS. Among those with full blown AIDS, 176 people have already
died.
</P>
<P>
Yeganeh termed educational and counseling services as the most
important programs of his committee. He said the current
educational programs cover 43 percent of the population in each
province while counseling services will be extended to 17 percent
of the population.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle United in Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Newcastle United was thrown back into turmoil when chairman Denis
Cassidy quit Newcastle United on Tuesday after controversial
directors Douglas Hall and Freddy Shepherd were restored to the
main company board.
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, a lifelong Newcastle fan who was appointed to the
position five months ago, stepped down with fellow non-executive
directors John Josephs and Tom Fenton after they were outvoted on
the Hall and Shepherd issue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trio said they felt they could not continue in the
circumstances and the premier league club also said BT Alex.Brown
had resigned as the company's stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
The departures were the latest in a long line of boardroom
upsets to bedevil Newcastle since the club was floated on the
stock market in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Shepherd and Hall were forced to step down earlier this year
after making controversial comments about the club's supporters
and their re-appointment prompted the resignation of the Newcastle
 plc chairman and its business advisor.
</P>
<P>
The two own a majority stake of more than 60 per cent and were
able to vote themselves back on to the board.
</P>
<P>
They were restored to the football club board -- but not the
main company board -- in late July, shortly after Cassidy had
been recruited as company chairman.
</P>
<P>
Their attempts to rejoin the main board caused a split among
directors, who voted four to three to bring them back.
</P>
<P>
John Fender, the fourth non-executive, sided with Chief
Executive Freddie Fletcher, Finance Director Les Wheatley and
Property Director Russell Jones in the vote.
</P>
<P>
BT Alex Brown, one of the City's largest stockbrokers has
ended its association with the club as a result of the boardroom
clash.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to further damage Newcastle's already
tarnished image in the City after a terrible year for the club.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle United fell 3p, or more than 3%, to 95p on the news.
</P>
<P>
A statement to the City published today read: "Newcastle
United plc today announced the re-appointment of Douglas Hall and
Freddy Shepherd to the board of the company with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
"The company also announced that Denis Cassidy, John Josephs
and Tom Fenton felt they could not continue as chairman and
non-executive directors respectively in these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The Board regrets that they came to this conclusion and
wishes to extend its thanks for their past valuable contribution."
</P>
<P>
Newcastle chief executive Freddie Fletcher has agreed to
become acting chairman, pending the appointment of a new
independent non-executive chairman and non-executive director.
</P>
<P>
After the high-octane excitement of the Kevin Keegan era,
things took a downturn last season.
</P>
<P>
The club was embroiled in a public war of words with
non-league Stevenage over the venue for their FA Cup fourth round
tie.
</P>
<P>
They went on to reach Wembley but were outplayed by Arsenal
and only made sure of avoiding relegation to Division One in the
final few games of the season.
</P>
<P>
But just as damaging was a News of the World article which
claimed Shepherd and Hall had insulted the fans and dubbed star
striker Alan Shearer "Mary Poppins".
</P>
<P>
The pair stood down in the face of anger from supporters but
returned in July with the task of reviving Newcastle's fortunes
on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
A poor start to this season saw Kenny Dalglish removed as
manager and Dutchman Ruud Gullit brought in as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
He has managed to lift them to 13th in the Premiership table
and recently spent seven million pounds on Everton striker Duncan
Ferguson.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Servicemen Enjoying A Better Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Things are a lot better for
Chinese soldiers these days as far as clothing, food, housing and
health-care are concerned, thanks to government efforts of the
past 20 years, military sources say.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s and early '90s, army uniforms have been changed
twice in design and materials, turning the shabby and laughable
uniform of the past into a more stylish one.
</P>
<P>
More money has been spent on improving the nutritional value of
military food to keep servicemen fit enough to deal with the harsh
military trainings and to prepare for any kind of warfare.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, the Central Military Commission has
increased per-capita spending on food 13 times, and, in 1984 and
1988, the military developed their own standards on nutrition and
amounts of food for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,100 food productions bases and over 1,400 service
centers have been set up in the army at brigade or regiment
level. It still gets 70 percent of its meat and vegetable from
farms managed by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Army headquarters have also paid more attention to improving the
housing and medical services available to soldiers, and 70 percent
of the officers have been moved into standard apartments, compared
with less than 10 percent in the late '70s. Over six billion yuan
has been spent on improving barracks.

The Frenchman has ended speculation about his future by

The Highbury board had been trying to persuade Wenger to
commit himself to the club since May, and his delay in doing so
fuelled speculation of a possible move abroad.

He was linked with Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona
but said: "I gave my word long ago, and that was more important
than my signature. I've signed now because everybody wanted it.

"There have been other clubs overseas who have been in for

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- One day after China's
overwhelming victory in the men's team event, the Chinese girls
snatched an even easier win and took the seventh straight Asian
Games team title on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan picked up the silver with 146.812 points, which was 7.362
behind China's winning total of 154.174. Kazakhstan was third
in 144.624.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese girls led all the way in the competition, topping
every apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Beam world champion Liu Xuan scored 9.850 in her specialty
event and floor world champion Kui Yuanyuan also got 9.850
points. Both marks were the highest of the day.
</P>
<P>
Kui also stayed first on the vaulting horse with 9.612 points.
Teenager Ling Jie scored 9.825 to lead all the gymnasts on the
uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
In her Asiad debut, Ling Jie is leading the top 24 athletes

points flaw on the floor and uneven bars respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Dismayed over Lukewarm Shows in Asian Games (Day Three) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China felt more sorrow as its
athletes still had lukewarm performances while Chinese Taipei got
every reason for cheers by taking three gold medals in the Bangkok
Asian Games on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As trump-card swimmer Chen Yan skipped today's 200m and
tomorrow's 400m freestyles due to diarrhea, China was left
empty-handed but five silvers from the swimming pool where only
Tsai Shu-Min of Chinese Taipei stopped Japan from celebrating a
clean sweep of five golds at stake.
</P>
<P>
"Just as expected, today was our darkest day in the games,"
said Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong, "for in all the five events,
we are in disadvantage against the Japanese."
</P>
<P>
Tsai won its first Asiad's swimming gold medal for Chinese
Taipei as she clocked the fastest timing of 2:00.89 in the 200m
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"The gold is a windfall to me, for I had no confidence to win
before the competition, and I will try my best to win more golds
in the later events," said the 18-year-old teenager who will
compete in another four disciplines.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shooters had to hold back their tears after winning
a lonely gold out of six although coach Zhang Heng found the
execuse of "dark horses" from the men's free rifle prone events,
which, in his view, have less technical merits than on-spot
display of skills.
</P>
<P>
Japan put another five gold medals into its credit, including
the day's first gold after Akihito Udagawa rode the best in the
men's cross country race.
</P>
<P>
The other four were all from the pool as Takashi Yamamoto won
the men's 100-meter butterfly, with the first swimming Asian
record, to lead a Japanese scoop of four out of five on offer.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Japanese clocked 53.34 seconds to beat the old
mark of 53.97 set by Chinese Jiang Chengji in the last Asiad, but
still felt unhappy as "I tried to beat my personal best of 52.88,
but in vain."
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guomin, another gold hopeful for China, was later beaten
in the 400m individual medley by 18-year-old Takahiro Mori who
clocked 4:20.98 against Xiong's 4:22.57.
</P>
<P>
"Our officials encouraged us last night to beat China in the
games, which gave me energy and motivation as only the younger
generation will make the differences in future," said Mori.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Masami Tanaka, 19, won the women's 200m breaststroke
before its quartet won the last swimming gold of the day in the
men's 4x200m freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Claiming a hope for three out of six golds, the Chinese
shooters only reapt one from the women's air pistol team event,
while the men's free rifle prone golds went to Thailand and Igor
Pirekeev of Turkmenistan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pirekeev, an Atlanta Olympian who registered 593 points to top
the qualification, produced stable performance to lead all the way
to the title in the individual final.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's three-men squad collected a total of 1,758 to give
the host its second shooting gold following Monday's victory in
the women's air rifle.
</P>
<P>
However, China still had the most gold medals of seven as its
weightlifters and divers returned with two apiece and each from
shooting, gymnastics and cycling, all through its women athletes.
</P>
<P>
After three day's competitions, China overtook Japan for the
top position in the medal tally with 13 golds, 16 silvers and 11
bronzes, while Japan fell to second 12-9-12 and South Korea
remained in third 7-4-6.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Naeem U.
Hasan hosted a reception here Tuesday evening to mark the 13th
anniversary of the signing of the SAARC Charter.
</P>
<P>
The seven-nation SAARC was established on December 8, 1985 with
the signing of the charter by the heads of state or government
from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The charter outlines the objectives, principles and general
provisions of the regional grouping, which, among others, aim to
accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The most significant achievement in recent years was the
operationalization in December 1995 of the SAARC Preferential
Trading Arrangement, under which three rounds of trade talks have
been completed, offering over 5,720 items of product for
preferential entry among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC aims to set up a South Asian free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, other senior
government officials and foreign diplomats attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
The reception also offers an opportunity for Hasan to bid
farewell as his three-year term expires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan diplomat Nihal Rodrigo has been picked up by his
country to head the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The post of SAARC secretary general is rotated in alphabetical
order among the member states.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Forces of the anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance have attacked the Taliban's position along the
Nishgam-Nuray highway in Kunar province of Afghanistan, injuring
two commanders of the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The News Network International Tuesday quoted an opposition
spokesman as saying that they had inflicted heavy losses on the
Taliban militia, seriously injuring two commanders.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance said that they
want to open a new front in eastern Afghanistan against the
Taliban as the militia is faced with an acute shortage of manpower
in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the launch of fresh attacks in eastern
Afghan provinces would make it difficult for the Taliban to
simultaneously concentrate on different fronts in northern and
eastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The recent killing of medical college students in Jalalabad by
Taliban security guards has evoked resentment and anger of the
local people against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban forces are now trying hard to cash on the
opportunity and make the local people stage a general uprising
against the Taliban.

BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese cyclist Udagawa
Akihito won the gold medal of the men's cross country event while
Chinese girl Ma Yanping dominated the women's race at the 13th
Asian Games cycling tournament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Udagawa clocked a winning time of two hours five minutes and
seven seconds to cover cover the five-lap, 32-kilometer route in a
scenic hillside resort in Nakornratchasima province, some 130
kilometers northeast of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Surajit Jirojwong took advantage of his familarity
with the site and grabbed the silver in the men's race in 2:12:00,
while Chinese Li Fuyu dashed across the finish line one minute and
10 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
Li Fuyu lead a field of 13 bikers in 23:56 when he finished the
first lap, which runs 6.4 kilometers. He was followed by Thai
Surajit and Japanese Udagawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the unfortunate Chinese bumped into unexpected
trouble, as his tyre was pricked not long after the second lap
started. It took him about four minutes to change tyre, which
dragged him to the ninth place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Udagawa took the chance to take over the lead and
maintained the first position till the end of the match.
</P>
<P>
Li successfully surpassed the several bikers from South Korea,
Hong Kong of China and his compatriot Ma Ye to finish third.
</P>
<P>
In the women's competition, Ma Yanping led the field of eight
competitors from the very beginning, and finished the four-lap
match in two hours seven minutes and 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Kobayashi Kanako and Thai C. Singupatham won the
silver and bronze medals in 2:11:45 and 2:17:34 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japanese mountain bike coach Sugiyama Kiichi said after the
race that he is quite satisfied with the two golds and three
silvers in the first two days of the Asiad cycling competitions.
</P>
<P>
He expected four or five more golds in the following cycling
competitions, but he admitted that China is the main rival for
Japan especially in women's events.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team leader Li Xin said that the Chinese male
cyclists, including Li and fourth-placed Ma, were not as
experienced as their Japanese rivals.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the Chinese men's team has never beat the
Japanese in Asian Tournaments," he said, "Though we are becoming
stronger, we have to admit that there is still a gap between us."
</P>
<P>
Thailand has surprised the participating teams with its
extraoridnary good performances. Gen. Youthana Kumdee, president
of the Thai Amateur Cycling Association, was "very happy" about
it.
</P>
<P>
With the gold medal won by Thai Phannaro Kongsamut in Monday's
Down Hill competition and the silver and bronze Tuesday, Kumdee
said he had every reason to believe that cycling in Thailand will
have a brighter future with "more sponsors coming to support the
sport".

<HEADLINE> New Strategy, Open-Door Policy High on NATO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The revision of NATO strategy
and maintaining its open-door policy will be the main items on the
agenda of next April's Washington summit of the western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said after Tuesday's NATO
foreign ministers council meeting that the meeting was as a
tune-up for the summit set to celebrate the alliance's 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers tasked the NATO council of permanent
representatives, the alliance's day-to-day decision-making body,
with preparing the final text of the strategic concept for
approval at the summit.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the new strategic concept must be "fully
consistent with the alliance's new security environment" and
should reaffirm NATO's commitment to collective defense and the
transatlantic link.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the council meeting said that the new
strategic concept should commit NATO to be ready with a full range
of capabilities to enhance security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area in the next century and to implement
non-Article V crisis response operations outside the NATO
geographical area.
</P>
<P>
Article V of NATO's Washington Treaty entitles the alliance to
self-defense in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
NATO has invited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join
it while more central and eastern European countries aspire to
join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general stressed the alliance would keep its
door open to other applicant countries, but NATO observers believe
that it is unlikely to issue invitations at the Washington summit
for more countries to start another round of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
A senior NATO official told the press last Friday that the
alliance was considering initiatives to make some of the applicant
countries for NATO membership feel more secure in their
preparation for accession.
</P>
<P>
But the official declined to elaborate on the details of the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Countries that are believed to have a better chance for what
NATO is considering as binding promises include Slovenia, Romania
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia and the Baltic countries of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania are also applying for NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> Japan Harvests Gold in Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Takashi Yamamoto broke the
Asian record in the men's 100m butterfly to start Japan's sweep of
four swimming golds out of five at the Asian Games on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers had to swallow the bitterness after they only
managed five silvers.
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto clocked 53.34 seconds to eclipse the old Asian mark
of 53.97, set by Chinese swimmer Xiong Guoming in the Hiroshima
Asian Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Japanese was followed by Zhang Xiao of China in
54.40. Han Kyu-Chui of South Korea came third in 54.83.
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto was not satisfied with his performance. "I tried to
beat my personal best of 52.88, but in vain. It's a little
disappointing."
</P>
<P>
"It is a certainty for me to win here since nobody can match me
in Asia," said Kinki University student. "My goal is to win in
Olympics and world championships."
</P>
<P>
Tsai Shu-Min ruined the otherwise perfect day for Japan as she
snatched the first-ever Asian Games swimming gold for Chinese
Teipei over 48 years.
</P>
<P>
She touched home first in 2:00.89 in the women's 200m freestyle
final, beating China's 16-year-old prodigy Qin Caini into second
place. Japanese Sachiko Yamada was third.
</P>
<P>
"The gold is a windfall to me. I had no confidence of winning
before the competition," said the 18-year-old Tsai.
</P>
<P>
"Now I will try my best to win more golds for Chinese Taipei,"
added Tsai, who will enter 400m freestyle, 4x100m freestyle,
4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medlay relay.
</P>
<P>
Takahiro Mori put Japan back onto the winning track when he
timed 4:20.98 to claim the men's 400m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Japanese was followed by Chinese veteran
swimmer Xiong Guoming, who clocked 4:22.57. Ratapong Sirisanont
of Thailand came in third in 4:24.15.
</P>
<P>
Mori felt a lot of drive to win the gold. "Our swimming
officials held a meeting with us last night, and we decided to
beat China in the pool," he said. "That decision gave me energy
and motivation."
</P>
<P>
"Chinese young swimmers performed very well," said Mori, "But
our young generation are also fully fledged. It is the younger
generation that will make difference in the Olympics or world
champioships."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Masami Tanaka, the 19-year-old high school student,
snatched the women's 200m breaststroke title in 2:28.44, beating
Chinese Qi Hui into second spot.
</P>
<P>
"Although I was a little tired, I was full of confidence,"
Tanaka said. "The win will help boost my confidence in the later
events."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese swimmers denied China's last chance for gold in
the men's 4x200m freestyle relay, in which they triumphed in
7:30.53.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese timed 7:34.11 for silver and the South Koreans
got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"Just as expected, today is the darkest day for Chinese
swimmers," said Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong.

<HEADLINE> Finland Cancels Nicaragua's 18-Million-Dollar Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government
announced Wednesday that it will cancel Nicaragua's 90-million
Finnish markka (18 million U.S. dollars) debt due to the heavy
damage inflicted by Hurricane Mitch on the central American
country.
</P>
<P>
Finland hoped the remission may help Nicaragua launch its
recovery plan, said a Finnish senior official.
</P>
<P>
The two long-term loans to Nicaragua in 1988 and 1991 were used
to buy fertilizers, papermaking facilities and to provide energy
for the capital, Managua.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1991, Finland loaned nearly 200 million markkas to
Nicaragua, of which 103 million markkas were already cancelled in
1993.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of November, the Finnish government provided
three million markkas in emergency aid to Nicaragua and other
central American countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Steel Manufacturers Doing Away With Open Hearth Furnaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Wuhan Iron and Steel Group
started using its revolving furnace No.1, an improved open hearth
furnace, today, meaning that all of its open hearth furnaces have
been replaced by the more advanced revolving furnaces.
</P>
<P>
The replacement project cost 650 million yuan and took eight
months to complete. A senior official at the company says that the
conversion simplified and shortened the production process,
reduced energy consumption, and cut the cost per ton by 200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The cost is expected to be recovered in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
The official says that putting in a new revolving furnace
factory of the same size would cost 2 billion yuan, so the
conversion process was the most cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
According to a Metallurgical Industry Administration plan from
earlier this year, China will stop the use of all open hearth
furnaces by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of open hearth furnaces at Wuhan and the Anshan
Iron and Steel Group is expected to bring the nation's annual
open-hearth steel production down to 3 million tons from 5 million
tons next year.

BANKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympic judo champion Nakamura
Kenzo of Japan said here on Tuesday that he never expected a loss
in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said after he crashed out of the 73kg class final that
he took the Games too lightly.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a piece of cake to win the Asian Games gold,"
he said. "But I found my rival was very strong right after I
stepped on the mat."
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Japanese was defeated by Boldbaatar Haliun of
Mongolia, who won the first-ever Asian Games gold medal for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said: "His feet moved so fast that I could hardly grab
his clothes."
</P>
<P>
As the Japanese overestimated himself, Boldbaatar had made full
preparation for the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"I have been training hard in the past few months," He said.
"Since I have lost all three encounters with him, I told myself
that I must win this time. I used all my strength and did my best,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Exhibition on Ethnic Groups' Education Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A National Ethnic Textbook
Exhibition opened in Beijing today, with textbooks in 30 ethnic
group languages used by primary and middle school students on
display.
</P>
<P>
Xia Zhu, director of the Education Ministry's Ethnic Education
Bureau, said at the opening, "I was the son of poor Tibetans, and
lost my parents and became orphaned at the age of 7. It was the
government that helped me complete my college education. I used
the Tibetan language all through my schooling and Chinese in my
daily life."
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a bilingual education system and more than
10,000 schools use both ethnic languages and Chinese for teaching
some 6 million students. China publishes more than 3,500 textbooks
of various kinds in 30 languages for 21 ethnic minority groups,
with 100 million volumes, annually.
</P>
<P>
Xia says that China's Constitution and other laws state clearly
that there is equality and freedom in the use of ethnic
languages. The Central Government this year plans to add 2.2
billion yuan (265 million US dollars) to ethnic groups' education
to make it obligatory in ethnic regions.
</P>
<P>
Xia says that being located in economic backward areas make
ethnic groups' education costly and difficult and there are
still problems that need to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
There are 53 of China's 55 national minorities that use more
than 80 languages, including nearly 30 written ones. The Hui and
the Man have used the Han or Chinese language for a long time.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Air India, the government air
fleet, sustained a loss of 1.29 billion rupees (30.73 million U.S.
dollars) in the first half of the current financial year beginning
from April 1, Civil Aviation Minister Kumar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Indian
Parliament which has been in session since Monday, Ananth Kumar
cited increased expenditure and reduction in yield as main reasons
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons the minister listed for the loss were rising
interests costs, increased competition and operational costs, rise
in wage bill and other staff costs, depreciation in rupee value
and spurting landing, handling and navigational charges.
</P>
<P>
Air India, mainly on international flights, had accumulated a
loss of 1.81 billion rupees (47.6 million dollars) in the
financial year of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Kumar said that a committee of experts has been set up under
his ministry to comprehensively examine the reasons for the loss
and suggest strategies to turn around the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Air India and India Airlines, which is mainly on domestic
flights, have accepted suggestions by the international
consultancy firm A F Ferguson &AMP; Co's for a merger of the two
corporations in a three-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
The joint board of directors of the two airlines decided Monday
to implement the merger in a phased manner beginning with the
merger of various departments such as operations and engineering
of both airlines.
</P>
<P>
A report by Ferguson recommended a two-tier structure
consisting of a holding company and a joint management group.

PHNOM PENH, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's acting head of
state Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen Tuesday
met separately with visiting Advisor to the People's Government of
Yunnan Province of China Linghu An and his party here.
</P>
<P>
Linghu is also chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He and his
party arrived here Monday for a five-day visit to Cambodia at the
invitation of Sok An, minister of cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Chinese delegation to visit Cambodia after
Cambodia's new government was formed on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh briefed the visitors on the current political
situation in Cambodia. He said Cambodia has entered a new era of
national reconciliation and believed that FUNCINPEC and the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP), the two parties in the coalition
government, will have good cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides spoke highly of the
Sino-Cambodian relations and agreed that there exists great
potential for further development of the two countries' economic,
trade and agricultural cooperation, and more efforts should be
made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said promotion and development of the two countries'
friendly and cooperative relations are not only beneficial to the
economy of the two countries but also to the stability and
development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and Hun Sen invited Chinese provinces to come and
invest in Cambodia's infrastructure and agriculture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry On European Veterinary Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today that China hopes that the
European Union will deal properly with matters raised in its
veterinary report on China, for the healthy development of
Sino-European relations.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question that the EU might continue its
import restrictions on Chinese poultry, Zhu said, China has
taken note of the EU report in September on China's animal
epidemic prevention and quarantine system and quality guarantee
system. It exaggerates the problems without referring to
specific cases, and its purpose is to maintain restrictions of
poultry and meat imports from China, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, China has had a cooperative attitude
towards EU legislation, he said. In keeping with EU regional
management requirements, China has selected the city of Shanghai
and Shandong and Jilin provinces as key areas and has spent
hundreds of millions of yuan improving local enterprises, local
systems, and solving problems discovered by the EU's inspections.
</P>
<P>
The report reflects the EU's intention to hinder normal trade
through technical barriers, Zhu said, adding that it infringes on
the interests of Chinese enterprises and on those of European
customers, and will have a negative impact on the development of
trade and economic relations between China and the EU.

people, were unemployed in November. In eastern Germany, the
jobless rate stood at 15.9 percent, with 1,201,200 people out of

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Official on Coastal Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Guangyao, deputy-director
of China's Environmental Protection Administration, has said that
there is a serious pollution problem in the country's coastal
waters.
</P>
<P>
He says that, even though an effort has been made to protect
the coastal environment over the past decade, the amount of
pollution continues to expand and the water quality to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Major pollutants include inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus,
organic pollutants, and oil. Recent studies show inorganic
nitrogen and phosphorus in the Bohai Bay, Yellow Sea, East China
Sea and South China Sea well beyond state standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhu says that land is still being reclaimed from the sea at
will in some regions, damaging coral reefs and mangrove swamps,
and resulting in serious marine ecological problems.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs have decreased from 50,000 hectares in the 1950s to
15,000 hectares and the amount of coastal wetlands has been
reduced by a million hectares, nearly half of the country's total
coastal wetlands. The damage to forests in some coastal areas is
also very serious.
</P>
<P>
This has decreased biodiversity and increased marine disasters,
Zhu says, and urban waste water has become an important source of
pollution along the coast.
</P>
<P>
China is striving to focus efforts on combating pollution in
the Bohai Bay, which has serious problems, so as to advance
off-shore environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia made an impact in the
Asian Games judo competitions when Erdenet-Od H. and Boldbaatar
Haliun won two gold medals for the world's biggest inner-land
country on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Boldbaatar, a father of one, stunned reigning world champion
Nakamura Kenzo of Japan in the men's 73-kilogram category to take
the gold.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura, also gold medalist at the Atlanta Olympic Games in
1996, looked in top form but the 27-year-old Boldbaatar was
stronger.
</P>
<P>
"I met him three times and lost all of them," Boldbaatar said.
"I told me I must win the fourth."
</P>
<P>
Boldbaatar, who won a bronze in Hiroshima four years ago, said
that he felt no pressure before the Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
"We are very familiar with each other's techniques, and I only
wanted to use all my strength and try my best," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third place in the 73kg went to Uzbekistan's Andrey
Shturbabin and South Korea's Kim Dae-Wook.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's first gold was won by Erdenet-Od in the women's 57kg
class when she edged Chinese Shen Jun with a unanimous decision
from three referees. Neither of them could score after the five
minutes competition.
</P>
<P>
The day was also a disaster for twice world chamion and Olympic
bronze medalist Jung Sung-Sook of South Korea, who suffered a
surprise defeat to the 21-year-old Chinese Shen in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Shen was shocked by the referee's decision and said it was
unfair to her.
</P>
<P>
"When I stood on the mat waiting for the referee's decesion, I
belived I must be ruled the winner, because I had an andvantage in
the match," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Liu Wugong, coach of the Chinese national team, said Shen
deserved the silver.
</P>
<P>
"The Mongolian enjoyed an edge over Shen," Liu said. "She
should not complain about that."
</P>
<P>
Jung and Kusakabe Kie of Japan finished joint third in the
category.
</P>
<P>
The women's 52kg final was an affair between South Korea and
DPR Korea.
</P>
<P>
Kye Sung-Hui of DPR Korea, gold medalist in the 48kg at the
Atlanta Olympic Games, proved too much for Kim Hye-Sook of South
Korea, who won the event in last year's world championships in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
China's Li Ying, who fell in the first round to Kim Hye-Sook,
won all the other matches and wound up for bronze medal, which was
shared by Japan's Nagai Kazue.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former Minister Questioned on Car Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former industry and
trade minister Tunky Ariwibowo Tuesday came to the Attorney
General's Office to be questioned over the Timor national car
project.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office also questioned Hadiyanto,
treasurer of the Dharmais Foundation, one of the seven foundations
handed over to the government by former president Soeharto last
month.
</P>
<P>
Hadiyanto arrived an hour later after Ariwibowo, who had served
as minister in two Soeharto cabinets, and the questioning was held
in the main building.
</P>
<P>
Their appearance at the Attorney General's Office set the stage
for Wednesday's much anticipated questioning of Soeharto himself.
</P>
<P>
The Timor national car project, which received special tax
privileges from the Soeharto administration, was developed by
Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra.
</P>
<P>
Timor was the sole recipient of an import duty and luxury tax
exemption from late 1996 to January 1998 when the International
Monetary Fund insisted Indonesia stop the preferential treatment.
The tax exemption made the car 60 percent cheaper than its
counterparts on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib described the project as a
graft-infested project designed entirely for self-profit.
</P>
<P>
"The national car program stipulated in Presidential Decree No.
42/1996 was a program of nepotism because it was designed solely
to profit the family," Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
The project had caused the country losses of 1.55 billion U.S.
dollars, Ghalib said in a statement distributed to members of the
House of Representatives Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the issuance of the presidential decree on the project
and regulations backing the project were made possible merely
through collusion between Hutomo and related government officials.

HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has imported from
Germany Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) machine, the
first of its kind in the region, which is capable of serving more
patients suffering from tendopathies and pseudarthrosis.
</P>
<P>
The machine has been installed in the 13-year-old Shock Wave
Therapy Center of the St. Paul's Hospital located on Hong Kong
Island.
</P>
<P>
"The ESWT is effective in most cases that have been resistant
to usual conservative methods such as medication, physiotherapy
and steroid injection," said Dr. Christine Bachmann, chief of the
Shock Wave Therapy Center of Germany, at a press conference here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The procedure is simple, safe, non-invasive and hospitalization
is unnecessary. Both X-ray and ultrasound can be used for
localization purposes. The effectiveness and success of such
treatment is 70 to 80 percent, Bachmann said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- "Poverty is human rights
violation, and freedom from poverty is an integral and
inalienable human right," Samuel Nyambi, United Nations Resident
Coordinator and United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
Resident Representative, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here to mark the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Nyambi
said: "As Africa today is experiencing a wave of democratization,
most African country leaders are convinced that peace,
development and democracy are mutually reinforcing."
</P>
<P>
He noted that UNDP's overriding and central priority is
poverty eradication within a Sustainable Human Development
Framework, adding that without the basic democratic, social and
cultural rights it would be difficult to attain the development
objectives and most particularly food security which is the most
challenging aspect of African continent.
</P>
<P>
"UNDP places human rights, good governance and sustainable
human development as interdependent and mutually reinforcing
conditions for eradicating poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Judith Lewis, World Food Program (WFP) Resident
Representative, said at the press conference that there are an
estimated 800 million people around the world who do not have
adequate access to food.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the principal objectives of WFP is to save the
lives of people whose ability to gain access to food has been
curtailed.
</P>
<P>
"Eradicating hunger, which afflicts one out of every seven
people on earth, cannot be achieved without creating conditions
that help people become more self-reliant," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hamaoly Lamine Conde, regional office director of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), said the UNESCO will put the emphasis on children in
general and street children in particular during the program of
activities to mark the 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of the program are, first to promote
the education for human rights, peace and democracy; second to
draw attention of the public on the condition and needs of the
street children; and third to promote the work of all those who
work with the children in need.

<HEADLINE> UAE Ready to Talk with Iran over Islands: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has informed Iran that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is
ready to resume talks with it over the three disputed islands in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan in Abu Dhabi, Annan talked with Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on phone Monday night to inform
him of the emirates' readiness.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Iranian Foreign Ministry Tuesday said
the U.N. chief told Kharrazi that Zayed voiced his country's
desire to resume bilateral talks with Iran at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kharrazi said that "as we have announced time and
again, we welcome visits by UAE officials to Iran to hold
bilateral negotiations and to eliminate misunderstandings between
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
And there are areas of common interests and cooperation between
Iran and the UAE, he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan is in Abu Dhabi to attend the summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) that opened Monday. The GCC groups
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and
the Lesser Tunbs at the mouth of the strategically important
Strait of Hormuz in 1971 after British forces withdrew from the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the islands were claimed by both Tehran and Abu
Dhabi. Their diplomatic relations were lowered to the level of
charge d'affaires in 1992 after the UAE lodged a protest against
Iran's full control on the islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran has since been insisting on solving its
"misunderstandings" with the UAE through bilateral talks, while
Abu Dhabi called for an international arbitration of the issue.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Government Adopts Wiretapping Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Tuesday approved an amendment bill to protect secrecy in
communications and restrict wiretapping by police and security
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised bill, investigators will be required to cease
wiretapping if they fail to receive court approval within 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the amendment demands that in case of emergency, the
law enforcement authorities have to inform the court of whom they
have wiretapped, for what reason, and for what period before
obtaining court approval.
</P>
<P>
The range of crimes in which wiretapping is permitted would be
also reduced. Furthermore, those who are found to have engaged in
illegal wiretapping or to have revealed illegally wiretapped
conversations would be subject to up to 10 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Wiretapping by the government became a hot issue after the
opposition Grand National Party accused the government in the
National Assembly's audit and inspection of state-run Korea
Telecom in October of having illegally tapped opposition members.
</P>
<P>
In a recent joint statement, the ministers of justice, defense
and the head of the national intelligence agency promised to
revise the law in order to prevent law-enforcement authorities
from abusing wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
The amendment is expected to pass the National Assembly, or
parliament, during its current session, which ends on December 18
this year.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Xinhua HK Branch Serves as Bridge Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch has been playing an increasingly important role in
promoting the communication and cooperation between Hong Kong and
the mainland since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The branch, an institution authorized by the Central People's
Government of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), has served as a bridge between the mainland and the SAR
under the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
During the one and half year after the Chinese government
resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, which had been
under the British rule for over 150 years, the Xinhua Hong Kong
Branch has helped 1,600 groups or 30,000 of Hong Kong people to
visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,100 groups or 15,000 people from the mainland have
visited the SAR with the assistance of the branch.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Xinhua branch has been working for the promotion
of the exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the
mainland ever since it was established 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, more and more Hong Kong
people from various walks of life expressed their eagerness to
enhance their understanding of the motherland and to exchange and
cooperate with people in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the obstacles to the exchange and cooperation
between the mainland and Hong Kong caused by the British rule have
been gradually removed after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, there are more exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides in the economic, social and
cultural fields after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, 26 students from eight universities and
colleges in Hong Kong went to Tibet, a mysterious place in their
minds, with the Xinhua branch helping them contact departments
concerned in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
During their 9-day stay in Tibet, these students toured the
beautiful highland of the southwestern autonomous region of China
and visited some Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
They found a true story of Tibet which is totally different
from what they learned from the Western media. They said that
their trip was very fruitful and thanked the Xinhua branch for
erecting a bridge for them to Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more and more people have come to Hong Kong
from the mainland with the help of the Xinhua branch. They not
only saw the great vigor of Hong Kong under the concept of "one
country, two systems" after its return to China but also realized
that Hong Kong still plays a unreplaceable role in China's opening
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with the help of the Xinhua branch and other
institutions, organizations and foundations in Hong Kong, a large
number of people from the mainland have learned advanced knowledge
and expertise in the fields of law, accounting, medicine and
management from Hong Kong and this has helped a lot in China's
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In the course of contacting people from various walks of life
in Hong Kong, the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch has continuously
conveyed the opinions and suggestions from the Hong Kong people to
government departments in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the branch and the Chinese General Chamber
of Commerce of Hong Kong collected views among local business
people on the investment environment of the mainland, with a view
to helping the mainland improve the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch, said that
Xinhua will, as always, act strictly under the policy of "one
country, two systems" and do its utmost to promote the exchange
and cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland, playing a
better role as a bridge for the economic development and common
progress of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Land Grants Accord for HK Container Terminal 9 Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
signed a land grants agreement for the construction of Container
Terminal 9 (CT9) with three joint developers here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These include Asia Container Terminals, Modern Terminals
Limited, and Hong Kong International Terminals. They will invest
over 10 billion HK dollars (1.28 billion U.S. dollars) in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on CT9 is a clear demonstration of their
commitment to Hong Kong and their confidence in the long term
prospect of our container port and economy," said Patrick Lau,
Acting Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, at the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Now, there are eight container terminals at Kwai Chung and on
Stonecutters Island which are privately owned and operated, with a
total of 19 berths for ocean-going vessels.
</P>
<P>
The new terminal will have six berths and a design capacity of
handling 2.6 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of
containers a year.
</P>
<P>
Together with the facilities at Kwai Chung, the new terminal
will be able to cope with forecast growth in demand of the Hong
Kong Container Port until the early 2000s.
</P>
<P>
Construction work will begin in mid-1999. The first berth of
the new terminal is expected to come into operation in 2002 and
the remaining berths at five or six months intervals thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Marcos Family Given 1 Year to Decide on Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Tuesday that he gives the Marcos family one year
to decide on compromise talks with his government to settle the
tug-of-war over the family's alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Estrada said his administration
is willing to negotiate with Imelda Marcos on the disposition of
her family's alleged ill-gotten wealth as long as the process will
speed up the recovery of the assets, prove advantageous to the
government and hasten the use of the money for pro-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
"We've waited more than 12 years, so we can wait about one
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his economic advisers have determined that the
negotiations will speed up the recovery process.
</P>
<P>
"It has already taken 12 years, and nothing has happened so we
might try through negotiations so it will be faster and at least
we can get hold of the money and spend it on the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda has rejected the proposed compromise talks and has
announced plans to file a 500 billion peso (12.5 billion U.S.
dollars) suit against the alleged cronies of her late husband,
former president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Imelda claimed that her husband entrusted these properties to
his cronies at the height of his power.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes U.S. Proposals on NATO Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- France has expressed opposition
to wide-ranging U.S. proposals to allow unilateral action by NATO
and warned against division of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at the NATO foreign
ministers' meeting which started in Brussels on Tuesday that
"collective defense" should remain the foundation of NATO.
</P>
<P>
He rejected U.S. proposals that NATO assume responsibility in
controlling the proliferation of arms of mass destruction, and
that the alliance take action in times of crisis without the
mandate of the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said the proliferation of arms of mass destruction is
one of the risks faced by the NATO, but not the only one.
</P>
<P>
He also said NATO should not be the only "player" in
controlling that problem, but "one player among others".
</P>
<P>
As for the proposal of how to deal with crises, Vedrine said it
was not "justified" that NATO should look for "a new federal-style
concept" on that subject.
</P>
<P>
"There, we could run the risk of thinning down the alliance and
dividing the allies," he said, stressing that all missions
involving the deployment of troops should be approved by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels was held in
preparation for the Washington summit of the alliance scheduled
for next spring.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Embassies Ready to Assist Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian embassies in foreign
countries will provide whatever assistance they can to the
Attorney General's Office in investigating the wealth of former
president Soeharto abroad, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing with a commission of the House of
Representatives (DPR), Alatas said the embassies could not be
expected to do investigative work but they certainly could act as
intermediaries between the Attorney General's Office and the
governments of the countries where they are based.
</P>
<P>
"We will do this after we have received a relevant request from
the Attorney General or the police," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Foreign Ministry had not received any such request
from the Attorney General's Office, Alatas said, adding he was
expecting to see the two offices eventually cooperating in the
probe.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday reaffirmed his intention
to question Soeharto Wednesday, saying his office had already
found a number of things to serve as evidence in the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has repeatedly said that he has no money stashed
overseas. But he disclosed that he had 22 billion rupiah (3
million U.S. dollars) deposited in three banks in Indonesia, and
that his personal property includes two houses in Jakarta and five
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the property of Soeharto and his family has
reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> NATO Authorizes Extraction Force Operation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO foreign ministers on
Tuesday authorized the operation of the extraction force as the
back-up for the international truce verifiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, meeting in their year-end council,
authorized an activation order for the NATO-led force, codenamed
Operation Joint Guarantor, of which the first troops had already
arrived in Macedonia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
NATO will rapidly deploy the 1,700-strong extraction force in
Macedonia to provide the ability to withdraw Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) verifiers in an
emergency, the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance urged both the Yugoslav
authorities and the leaders of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to
maintain "scrupulously" the ceasefire and comply fully with the
United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We remain firmly convinced that the problems of Kosovo can
only be resolved through a process of open and unconditional
dialogue between the authorities in Belgrade and representatives
of the Kosovar leadership," said a statement issued from the
council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led extraction force, which was formed at the request
of the OSCE, consists of troops from France, Britain, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonia-based special force was designed to react within
30 to 60 minutes if weather permits to pull out the international
verifiers from Kosovo or to rescue of verifiers taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
In a deal reached between Yugoslavia and the OSCE, it is the
responsibility of the Yugoslav authorities to guarantee the safety
of the 2,000-member verification mission.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Poses Threat to School Life in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The fast spread of HIV/AIDS
has posed great threat to the education system in Kenya, a senior
official with the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest data show that "22 percent of girls between the ages of
15 and 19 are HIV positive, whereas four percent of boys in the
same age group are HIV positive" in Kenya, according to Chrispin
Wilson, chief of UNICEF's Kenya Office.
</P>
<P>
"It is now undeniable that the entire education system of this
country is under threat of HIV/AIDS," he said at the launching
ceremony of the 1999 State of the World's Children report here.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a child whose very life is threatened since he
or she has no access to the vital information needed about
protection against HIV/AIDS, and little chance to develop the
life skills that can help to ensure their survival in the age of
AIDS," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In the worst affected provinces of Kenya, he said, teachers
are dying of AIDS with alarming frequency, leaving school-rooms
in towns and villages without anyone to instruct the pupils.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of children in the east African country have been
orphaned by the fatal disease and thus denied access to basic
education, and their number is "rapidly increasing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chrispin called for more efforts on the part of the Kenyan
government to give priority to anti-AIDS education in schools
countrywide.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka said the gross enrollment rate of the country's primary
school rose to 84 percent in 1998 from 76 percent in 1996, but
still far below 95 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this (trend) continues as we work toward achieving
universal primary education by 2010," said Musyoka.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about six million pupils in about 17,000
primary schools in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sets Conditions on "Bridge Financing" for PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday set four conditions for a possible "bridge-financing" plan
to keep Philippine Airlines (PAL) on air, a move that would tap
private banks and "strategic partners" in PAL's rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
At his regular press briefing here, Presidential spokesperson
Jerry Barican said that private banks and government financing
institutions would provide loans to PAL only after certain
conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
"The government's policy remains unchanged. There will be no
government bailout or subsidy to PAL," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the implementation of the bridge-financing scheme
must meet the following conditions:
</P>
<P>
-- PAL's continued operation is commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
-- PAL will be subjected to the usual credit evaluation.
</P>
<P>
-- The financing package will involve a consortium of private
banks and strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
-- This package will form part of a rehabilitation plan
approved by PAL creditors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview Tuesday morning, Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu stressed that any financing plan for PAL involving
government financial institutions and private banks would have to
be in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said PAL can borrow from these commercial institutions
while waiting for fresh investments to be infused into the
airline.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Seeks to Increase Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is seeking ways to
increase next year's exports to about 10 billion U.S. dollars, the
Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The target was set by the Ministry of Trade in an import-export
plan submitted to the prime minister for approval, the
English-language daily said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, agriculture, forestry and marine products will
account for 37 percent of the total export, and light industrial
and handicraft products over 38 percent. The goal for heavy
industries is set at more than 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve these goals, the ministry plans to expand
export markets with focus put on markets in the Commonwealth of
Independent States, Eastern Europe, the European Union, China and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This year, Vietnam's total export value is estimated at 9.3
billion dollars, up 0.3 percent from last year, but the growth is
far behind the expected increase of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese authorities blamed the regional crisis for decreased
buying power in the major importers of Vietnamese products.
</P>
<P>
Devalued regional currencies have also hurt the competitiveness
of Vietnamese goods, especially textiles, garments, rubber, shoes
and marine products that are also exported by other countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials admitted that the low competitiveness of
Vietnamese products and heavy dependence on Asian markets also had
negative effects on Vietnam's exports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Let Foreigners Observe General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign observers will have the
chance to monitor Indonesia's general election on June 7, 1999,
Abu Hasan Sadzili, chairman of the special committee on the 1999
general election, told reporters here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible for them (foreign observers) to come to
Indonesia and observe the election," Sadzili said.
</P>
<P>
He said many international organizations have approached him,
asking if they could observe the election, the first to be held
since former president Soeharto resigned from office following
massive rioting in the country in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have expressed their enthusiasm -- usually from
the United States and European countries. Even the United Nations
will send a team," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sadzili said his committee has also asked local groups, such as
the Independent Committee of Election Observers and universities,
to join in the monitoring of the election.
</P>
<P>
They will be supervised by the Supreme Court, he said, adding
that their observations will be passed on to the committee on
election monitoring which will review them.
</P>
<P>
"If it sees any dishonesty, the committee will follow it up
with the court," Sadzili added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has said his government will
invite observers from the United Nations Development Program, the
United States, Germany, France, Japan and Australia to see for
themselves if Indonesia's general election is held democratically.

<HEADLINE> At Least 18 People Killed in Somali Faction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were
killed and more than 32 others, mainly civilians, wounded in a
fierce fighting between tow factions in Baidoa Town in southern
Somalia, reliable sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and those
of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid Monday night was the
worst armed clash ever in the important town, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of kiosks and poorly-built residential houses were
similarly destroyed by the heavy shelling from both sides in the
fight for control of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle told reporters in
Mogadishu Tuesday through VHF radio that his forces have killed
ten of Aidid's men and destroyed five battle wagons during the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Aidid's men in the field said Tuesday that
they had lost six of their fighters while 14 others have been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The militia spokesman claimed that Aidid's men had the upper
hand in the fighting, saying the RRA had left 25 dead in the
town.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports from Baidoa indicated Tuesday that it is
calm but tense in the town under the control of Aidid's forces.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the forces of Aidid are still chasing
pockets of retreating RRA men at the outskirts of the town while
the bewildered civilians are checking what is left of their
houses and business stalls for possible restart of normal life.

<HEADLINE> China Regrets Over EU Report on Quarantine System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed regret over
the European Union's critical report on the country's quarantine
system and the proposal to continue an import ban on China's
poultry, insisting the problems were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chusheng, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said that the report was written
after an EU veterinary inspection to China last September and
"fully demonstrates the EU's true intention of obstructing normal
trade by the use of technical barriers."
</P>
<P>
He went on, "It will harm not only the economic interests of
relevant companies in China, but also the interests of consumers
in EU nations, thus bringing a negative influence on the further
growth of Sino-EU economic and trade relations."
</P>
<P>
The European Union recently published the new report on China's
methods for preventing animal epidemics, quarantine and quality
guarantee systems and related processing plants.
</P>
<P>
Hu said it exaggerated problems without referring to specific
cases.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that over the past two years since the import ban
was imposed, China has been careful to respect and cooperate with
certain EU regulations.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the relevant EU laws, China took specific
action to rectify any problems following previous inspections,
particularly in Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin, which have the
highest livestock raising levels in the country, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the hope of the Chinese Government that the EU will
consider the general interest of Sino-EU relations and handle this
issue properly in order to clear obstacles for a healthy
development in those relations," Hu concluded.

<HEADLINE> 130 Million Children in Dire Need of Education: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 million children
of primary school age in developing countries are growing up
without access to basic education, according to a U.N. report
released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 State of the World's Children report said that girls
are the most affected, with 73 million of them lacking access to
primary school education.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly a billion people, two thirds of them women, will enter
the 21st century unable to read a book or sign their names --
much less operate a computer or understand a simple application
form," said the report from the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
"They will live, as now, in more desperate poverty and poorer
health than most of those who can. They are the world's
functional illiterates and their numbers are growing," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report urged governments worldwide to work in partnership
with multiple sectors of the society in order to have a better
chance of achieving the goal of education for all.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for an expansion of the education
revolution throughout the world which emphasizes access to high
quality learning and a child-right centered approach.
</P>
<P>
It cited child centered learning, curriculum relevance,
lessons conducted in local languages and proximity of schools to
homes as some of the factors that can enhance the quality of the
school experience for all children.
</P>
<P>
Others are security, supply of safe drinking water and
latrines and rooting out gender bias from textbooks and
materials.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President Decides Not to Sack Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung on Tuesday voiced his decision not to sack his Defense
Minister Chun Yong-taek blamed responsible for recent military
accidents, despite mounting pressures from the public and the
opposition Grand National Party (GNP).
</P>
<P>
However, President Kim issued a "stern warning" to the minister
and urged military leaders to ensure there will be no more
accidents in military camps, presidential spokesman Park Jie-won
said.
</P>
<P>
The president has once considered replacing the minister, but
decided not to do so because of Chun's contributions to military
reforms and successful management of defense affairs, Park said.
</P>
<P>
"The president also noted that military accidents actually
decreased by 37 percent this year and that no defense minister has
ever been dismissed for an accident," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chun Yong-taek said on Monday that he would step down
voluntarily if another accident were to occur.
</P>
<P>
In the past four weeks, 11 South Korean soldiers were killed by
tanks, explosions and car crashes.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented accidents, an air force anti-aircraft
missile accidentally launched last Friday wounded three people,
scaring the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a GNP spokesman said the defense minister must be
replaced as the accidents were the results of lax discipline and
the rock-bottom state of morale.
</P>
<P>
The opposition attributed the lax military discipline and lower
morale to President Kim's engagement policy toward the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on President Jiang's Visit to Japan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
recent visit to Japan has achieved important results and apart
from summarizing the past and looking to the future it will be
conducive to promoting the growth of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made these remarks
here this afternoon at a routine press conference when asked to
comment on the visit, the first state visit to Japan by a Chinese
head of state.
</P>
<P>
He said it also took place at an important time in history with
the imminent approach of a new century.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, President Jiang and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, while taking into consideration the past, exchanged
views on the future development of bilateral relations and
international issues of common concern and reached important
consensus, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration was also issued, added Zhu, pointing out
that this is the third significant document aimed at guiding the
development of bilateral ties following the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Zhu quoted the declaration which stated that facing up to the
past and correctly evaluating history are important basis for the
development of bilateral relations. The Japanese side admitted its
aggression against China for the first time, and expressed again a
deep introspection and apology for the grave suffering of the
Chinese people caused by that war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side had reiterated that it will abide strictly by
the principles concerning the Taiwan issue enshrined in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, will stress that there is only one
China, and that Japan will never support Taiwan's independence,
has no ambitions itself in Taiwan and will restrict activities
with Taiwan to non-official and regional contacts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu stated, both the historical and Taiwan issues
constitute the main principles in Sino-Japanese relations, and a
correct understanding and treatment of the aggression against
China launched by Japanese militarists linked to a proper handling
of the Taiwan issue form an important political basis for
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side hopes that the Japanese side will keep its
commitment and promote a new process of bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in various fields, in accordance with the principles
defined in the bilateral joint statement and treaty of peace and
friendship, Zhu noted.

Kong and Macao in transport.
</P>
<P>
Ming said that Fujian will first promote two-way tourism
between its coastal city of Xiamen and Taiwan's Jinmen Island,
just off the coast of Xiamen, and trying to turn Xiamen into a
port city for Taiwan compatriots to travel and do business in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Ming made the remarks at a tourism promotion event that opened
today in the city of Quanzhou. This is the first time Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao tourism personnel had attended a meeting here.

Zhu continued that the two sides agreed that to ensure sound,
stable and lasting Sino-Japanese relations in the new century is
in the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries,
and that they would both make positive contributions to peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the two sides, in the spirit of learning lessons
from history and to face the future positively, announced the
establishment of a friendly and cooperative partnership devoted to
peace and development, which highlighted the direction of progress
in bilateral relations and marked a new stage in the development
of bilateral ties, noted Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have also discussed long-term prospects and worked
out an overall plan for the future growth of bilateral ties,
agreeing to strengthen non-governmental friendly exchanges
including the youth program, conduct forward-looking cooperation
in high- and new-tech industries and environmental protection, and
make efforts to help overcome the financial crisis in east Asia
while promoting regional stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
As to the repeated questions about why the Sino-Japanese joint
declaration was not signed, Zhu stressed that President Jiang had
answered the question at a press conference in Japan, but that he
would reiterate it.
</P>
<P>
Zhu explained that during the discussions between the two sides
on the matter of a joint declaration, they did not consider the
issue of signing at that stage, and there was no such an
arrangement in the schedule agreed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony after the talks between Jiang and Obuchi
was for the three cooperative documents, not for the declaration,
added Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, there have been similar documents drawn
up between China and many countries that were not signed. However,
this factor will not have any impact on the effect of these
documents, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Dalai Lama's Splittist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes any plans
by the Dalai Lama, under any circumstances, to visit foreign
countries to engage in political activities in a bid to split the
nation, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
China also objects to officials from other countries meeting
the Dalai Lama in any capacity or form, spokesman Zhu Bangzao
informed a routine press conference.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China noticed that France had invited the
Dalai Lama to attend celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of
the issuing of the International Declaration of Human Rights, and
to take part in a luncheon with the French President, Jacques
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to express our deep concern and displeasure
about this and have made serious representation to the French
Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued that it is common knowledge that the Dalai Lama
is not just an ordinary religious figure but a political exile who
has engaged in nefarious activities aimed at causing rifts in
China's national solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who has relentlessly advocated the independence
of Tibet while still supposedly taking part in dialogue with the
Chinese central government, continues to travel the world on
propaganda campaigns to publicize globally the issue of Tibet, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has never once ceased these activities and is
therefore cheating, commented Zhu.
</P>
<P>
When he ruled Tibet, went on Zhu, he cruelly violated the basic
human rights of Tibetans, and therefore certainly does not qualify
to take part in activities to celebrate the human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has now demanded that France should consider the long
term, smooth and wide ranging Sino-French relations, and that to
prevent them from being damaged, France should not agree to the
Dalai Lama attending the above event, the lunch with President
Chirac or any official meetings, Zhu added.

Tian's coach Zhang Ting said the next two years are very
important for his protege if he wants to beat Sautin.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not can he beat Sautin to win the Olympic gold in

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior trade official today
urged all China's official business organisations stationed
overseas to help domestic companies expand their export portfolios
and secure more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of China's Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, outlined his suggestions to more than 200
commercial counselors, who operate in some 180 countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the final day of a six day working conference
held in Beijing, he added that the counselors should provide
accurate and up to date commercial information from abroad for
China's domestic companies. He stressed that it doesn't matter
whether they are state-owned or private.
</P>
<P>
He included in the package such data as local laws on economic
cooperation and trade, market demand statistics, assessment of the
investment environment and the supply of relevant company analysis
reports.
</P>
<P>
Sun told the delegates that they should bear in mind the
need to help cultivate a new form of bilateral and multilateral
economic and trade relations between China and relevant countries
for the 21st century. "You must focus your attention on increasing
exports by every possible means and to help secure and make use of
overseas investment," he added.
</P>
<P>
An important aspect of their work, Sun said, was to make great
efforts to promote investment in China from major transnational
companies.
</P>
<P>
In order to help further boost China's export, the
counselors should also make major efforts to increase and
encourage the use of domestically produced materials for the
overseas processing sector, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Enjoys Booming Business in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
has enjoyed marked growth in both passenger and cargo traffic
since it was officially inaugurated on December 8, 1995.
</P>
<P>
A simple ceremony was held at the departure hall of the airport
Tuesday morning to mark the third anniversary of its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
"After three years from the airport's inauguration, we can make
an objective assessment of this infrastructure's value to the
territory's development," said Joao Manuel de Sousa Moreira,
chairman of the board of directors of the Macao International
Airport Company.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Asian financial crisis has severely affected
airport activities worldwide. In Macao's case, it has caused the
flight suspension of two airlines from South Korea and one from
Malaysia. "Despite this negative scenario, we have maintained the
traffic growth."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the airport handled 1.95 million passengers and 45,540
tons of goods, increasing 50 percent and 81.84 percent
respectively over 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that passenger and cargo traffic this year
might reach 2.2 million persons and 64,000 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the airport has handled over 5.3
million passengers and 130,000 tons of cargo. It now serves 13
airline companies which operate 390 flights each week to 25
destinations around the world.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Macao has signed bilateral air service agreements
with 26 countries, and agreements with another eight countries
have been initialed.
</P>
<P>
With the competition of the large airports situated in Hong
Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, the Macao airport will have
to search for its own market and create appeal to the airlines
interested in flying to the region, the chairman said.

<HEADLINE> SFOR to Stay in Bosnia at Current Force Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO foreign ministers agreed
on Tuesday that the NATO-led multinational SFOR will stay in
Bosnia at its current force level with the same mission.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, NATO decision-makers said that the
stabilization force will continue to assist and coordinate closely
with the United Nations and other international institutions such
as the International Police Task Force, the International War
Crimes Tribunal and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will continue to focus on the implementation of
the civil aspects of the Dayton peace accord that include the
return of refugees, reform and restructuring of local police, and
the building of democratic institutions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But NATO stressed that SFOR's presence cannot be maintained
indefinitely or its presence should reduce the responsibility of
the local authorities to ensure the stability of the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance said that it would continue to
support the efforts of the international community to help Bosnia
develop as a single, democratic and multi-ethnic state.
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Rehn, a United Nations special envoy to Bosnia,
demanded in early November that SFOR remain in Bosnia for more
years.
</P>
<P>
She said that it would be difficult for the United Nations to
stay in Bosnia while others are leaving.
</P>
<P>
SFOR is the continuation of the NATO-led peace-making force of
IFOR that entered Bosnia after the Dayton peace accord was signed
in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been considering reducing the SFOR force level or
replace it with a small-size deterrence force (DFOR) altogether.

<HEADLINE> S. African Business Confidence Slightly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A marginal increase in
South Africa's business confidence indicated that the depressed
mood of the past six months could be stabilizing, the South
African Chamber of Business (Sacob) has said.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by Sacob Monday showed that the business
confidence index increased to 84.8 in November from 84.4 in
October and September.
</P>
<P>
"Although the stabilization is still tentative and vulnerable
to further shocks, at least it ends the year on a more positive
note," the Business Day newspaper Tuesday quoted Sacob economic
policy director, Ben van Rensburg, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the Rand, a slight decline in the
consumer price index, rising share prices and better retail sales
were among the positive factors contributing to the rise, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
On the down side, there was a deteriorating employment climate
in manufacturing, a lower gold price, a fall in export volumes
and a further decrease in new vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
Sacob said next year should be seen as a year of
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that the South African economy would grow by 1.5
percent next year compared with 0.2 percent projected for this
year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher on Renewed Interest in Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
rallied for the second consecutive session Tuesday as interest in
banking and telecommunications stocks led the general market
higher.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended the day 15.6 points firmer at
2771.7 points.
</P>
<P>
Yet while the all industrials index benefited from the interest
in banks, gaining 38.1 points to 4956.7, the resources sector
succumbed to continuing weak commodity prices, dropping 4.9 points
to 989.3.
</P>
<P>
"The market finished up in line with the firmer close on Wall
Street," Morgan Stockbroking's Simon Reed said.
</P>
<P>
"Interest continued to focus on banking and the
telecommunications sectors," Reed said.
</P>
<P>
The banking index stacked on 80.1 points to 6306.1 as
speculation about big bank mergers was again brought to the fore.
</P>
<P>
ANZ added 24.5 cents while Westpac gained 27 cents. Among the
other banks, NAB lifted 17 and the Commonwealth improved 18 cents.
</P>
<P>
In a recently typical move, Cable and Wireless Optus was the
most traded stock as interest in the telecommunications sector
continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
C&AMP;W Optus closed steady at 2.97 Australian dollars, with 15.76
million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
Telstra followed its competitor on the volume turnover table,
rising 11.2 cents with 10.48 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, weaker commodity prices took their
toll on an already dim outlook for the sector.
</P>
<P>
BHP dropped 10 cents and Rio Tinto slipped 19.3 cents while WMC
managed to lift six cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index gained 4.1 points to 1116.0 points with the
bullion price up 2.10 to 294.40 U.S. dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 384.46 million stocks traded for 1.18
billion Australian dollars (719.8 million U.S. dollars), with
rising stocks outnumbering falling stocks 633 to 547 and 419
stocks steady.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Marginally Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
marginally stronger Tuesday, after languishing within a tight
range during the session amid sluggish pre-Christmas trade.
</P>
<P>
Arab Bank foreign exchange dealer Scott Young said there had
been good offers for the domestic currency in Europe Monday night
and that had been the only action of the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished here at 61.85 U.S. cents from 61.73 at
Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
During the day it traded between 61.73 and 62.03 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Overall the market was still looking at the Australian dollar
from a pessimistic point of view as commodities prices continued
to struggle, Young said.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index closed weaker again
Monday night, down 0.24 to finish at 194.86.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 21 U.S. futures markets. It is not
weighted to Australia's exports and does not include coal, iron
ore and wool but traders follow it as an indicator for the
commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Current commodities prices were bringing a "dark cloud" over
the Australian dollar, Young said.
</P>
<P>
Young said a strengthening U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen
Monday night may also have hindered the Australian dollar, but not
a lot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the cross rates, the Australian dollar was buying
74.35 Japanese yen from 73.41 and 1.0386 German marks from 1.0355.

ZHENGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) --A record number of 10,000
entrepreneurs from all over China attended the first ever
Trade Fair staged here, three times more than expected.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Fair, which ended today, focused on East-West
cooperation among Township-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It saw 1,752 contracts with a total trade value of 15 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 counties and villages from various
provinces forged new economic ties with interested partners.
</P>
<P>
The central and western parts of China enjoy rich natural
resources and contain two thirds of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
However, the regions have long lagged behind other parts of
the country in terms of economic development because of a shortage
of funds and a poor environment.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Fair, which will now be an annual event, is aimed at
promoting economic cooperation between rural enterprises in the
eastern coastal and the central and western areas of China

<HEADLINE> Observers Hail Conduct of Local Elections in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- International and local
observers have expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the
local government elections held in Nigeria last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a report from a Commonwealth Secretariat team
which monitored the elections, Commonwealth Secretary-General
Chief Emeka Anyaoku said in a statement Monday that he was
delighted at the evident enthusiasm of the Nigerians during the
Saturday elections.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku pointed out that the massive turnout throughout the
country reflected the desire of the Nigerian people to achieve
the transition to democratic civilian rule in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC) of Nigeria for working closely with the political parties
to facilitate an inclusive and transparent electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth has been engaged with the transition program
in the most populous African country by providing technical
assistance and experts to the INEC in the areas of logistics,
training and advice.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member Commonwealth observers team was present in
Nigeria for the Saturday's polls.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said that the Commonwealth will send a similar team
for the state and federal elections in January and February next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Director of the African Division of the U.S.-based
International Republican Institute (IRI), Lloyd O. Pierson, said
in a statement issued Monday that the elections were peaceful,
voters were enthusiastic, and efforts were made to observe
electoral rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
The IRI mission which arrived in the country in September to
observe Nigeria's entire transition process fielded observation
teams in three states and the federal capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Pierson promised to sponsor an extensive observation effort
during Nigeria's forthcoming state and federal elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), a coalition of 45 human
rights non-governmental organizations in Nigeria, said at a press
conference Monday that the voter turnout was reasonable and
impressive "compared to the turnout in elections in the recent
past."
</P>
<P>
The TMG which was formally accredited by the INEC to monitor
the election nationwide deployed more than 1,000 observers all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the TMG, the Saturday elections were largely
peaceful and free of rancor in many voting centers across the
country despite some isolated cases of violence reported in some
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel Arap
Moi is expected to arrive here next week for an official visit,
the daily Iran News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan ambassador to Tehran al-Haj Mohammed Soba told the
daily in an interview that Moi's visit is aimed at boosting
political, economic and cultural ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Soba hoped Moi's upcoming visit will lead to easing of travel
regulations and visa requirements between Iran and Kenya so as to
facilitate mutual visits by traders and tourists to each other
country.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance between the two countries is in Iran's favor
due to Kenyan purchases of Iranian crude, paraffin wax and textile
materials, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kenya is trying to bring about a more
proportioned trade balance between the two countries by promoting
exports of Kenya's major products including tea, coffee and
tropical fruits such as pineapples and mangoes.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is studying the possibility of using Iran as a transit
route for getting its products to the markets in the Commonwealth
of Independent States, the Kenyan envoy said.
</P>
<P>
He also named tourism as one of the fields for Tehran and
Nairobi cooperation, saying Kenya is willing to transfer its
experience in the tourist industry to Iran.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
dropped Malaysia and Iran from its list of drug-producing
countries, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted U.S. President Bill Clinton as saying in a
letter to Congress Monday "This year I have removed Iran and
Malaysia from the list of major drug producing countries and
designated them as countries of concern.
</P>
<P>
"Although Malaysia's geographic location makes it a feasible
transit route for heroin to the United States, as had been the
case in the past, we have no indication that drugs significantly
affecting the United States have transited the country in the past
few years," Clinton was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said the gesture may temporarily loosen bilateral
tensions between the two countries following U.S. Vice-President
Al Gore's "provocative" remarks on the "reform movement" launched
by former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and U.S.
financier George Soros' call for the ouster of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

PARIS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government will spend one billion francs (170
million U.S. dollars) to finance the Commissions of Emergency Social
Aid to help the unemployed and the poor. The government is faced
with a new wave of protests by the unemployed during the
Christmas-new year season.
</P>
<P>
-- Accidents of violence are on the rise in Algeria two weeks
from the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. About 70 people have been
killed since the beginning of December in attacks attributed to
``Islamic terrorists.'' Five people were injured in a bomb explosion
Monday in a commercial district of Algiers, while a car bomb attack
was staged against a residential district in the capital last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has fired his chief of
administration, Valentin Yumachev, who was dubbed ``Rasputine on the
payroll.'' Yumachev would be replaced by the secretary of the
Russian Security Council, Nicolai Bordiouja, who was a former
general of the KGB.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of foreign students studying in French colleges has
dropped from 12.5 percent of the whole students' corps of France 10
years ago to the present 8.5 percent. Formalities, bureaucracy and
immigration policy are blamed for the falling enthusiasm of foreign
students to study in France.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Salaries to Rise Above Inflation in 1999: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan private sector workers
can expect a 1999 salary rise above the inflation rate, shows a
survey conducted by a management and audit consultants company.
</P>
<P>
The Price Waterhouse Coopers firm predicted in a survey last
week that 1999 salary increases will average 12.6 percent for
management and 13.9 percent for staff, according to an East African
Standard report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That will be above the anticipated average annual inflation
rate of 10 percent in calendar 1998, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
But the salary increases will be lower than that in 1998 which
registered an average 12.8 percent increase for management and
14.7 percent for staff.
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse Coopers surveyed 117 companies in 10 sectors
for their report, which human resource analysts said would be the
benchmark for salary increases in Kenya in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report put the highest paid executive in Kenya at a salary
of 1.31 million Shillings (nearly 220,000 U.S. Dollars) per month
while the lowest average salary for managers in the private
sector is 10,327 Shillings (some 172 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
And the lowest paid position among the private companies
surveyed is 4,292 Shillings (about 72 Dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Public sector salaries are still very poor in the country,
ranging from the legislated low minimum wage of 2,852 Shillings
(48 Dollars) to 61,000 Shillings (1,017 Dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
However, allowances are normally several times the net salary
in the public sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 7 (Xinhua) -- All U.S. infants will be
vaccinated against the leading cause of diarrhea, the country's
top doctors said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect against the large number of children who
need to be hospitalized, we need to give the vaccine to
everybody," said Dr. Neal Halsey of the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Each year, diarrhea causes three million American children
sick, with 55,000 of them hospitalized and 40 killed. The total
costs amount to some 400 million U.S. dollars nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. experts also said that in developing countries
with poor health care, diarrhea kills about one million children a
year. The vaccine promises to reduce by up to 80 percent the worst
cases of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, they added.
</P>
<P>
Three doses of the vaccine are recommended at ages of two
months, four months and six months after every U.S. baby is born.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Airlines, Cathay Still Engaged in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific Airways is still in the thick of negotiations for a stake
in Philippine Airlines (PAL), a senior Philippine official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, Secretary of Finance, said the major
remaining concern is the constitutional limitation over Cathay's
participation in the policy and decision making in PAL.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Espiritu said the government will revive
its bridge financing program for PAL only if it can get foreign
airlines and companies to invest in it.
</P>
<P>
PAL earlier submitted its program to rehabilitate the airline
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that while Cathay remains concerned about the
constitutional limitation, it has shown willingness to accept the
conditions of a management-proposed "industrial peace" pact.
</P>
<P>
The conditions, he said, include retaining most of PAL's
employees, with a package of benefits for employees and officers
who are willing to retire now.

<HEADLINE> DPR Korea Has Potential to Become Diving Power, Says Chinese Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea has everything ready to become a diving power,
a Chinese coach said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Zhou Jihong said she was surprised at
difficulty of their dives when she gave lectures in DPR Korea in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
"China's future arch rival in diving is neither Japan nor
South Korea. It's DPR Korea," said the diver-turned-coach.
</P>
<P>
DPR Korean Ri Ok-rim finished fourth in the women's
three-meter springboard diving, after Chinese Guo Jingjing and
Yang Lan, and Kazakhstan's Irina Vyguzova.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said DPR Korea had a strong gymnastic background and
full support from the government, which both were prerequisites
for being a diving powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
"DPR Korea will make itself as a diving power in future,"
Zhou said, "just as we did 20 years ago."
</P>
<P>
Zhou won China's first-ever Olympic diving gold medal in the
1984 Games in Los Angeles, United States.

<HEADLINE> More Sino-Foreign Cooperative Research Groups in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) --Vast personnel resources and the
potentially huge domestic market are the main factors persuading
increasing numbers of key global businesses and institutions to
set up Sino-foreign research cooperatives in China.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology told
Xinhua today that there are already at least over 70 Sino-foreign
cooperative research groups currently operating throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
They have come from the United States, Britain, France, Japan,
Germany and Canada, amongst other countries, to establish such
professional partnerships in big Chinese cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which contain large numbers of
Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the focus is on high-tech sectors
such as information, biology and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy, which is
attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has established a
joint research center with the German company Benze to develop
packaging material for electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Institute say the research is important to help
extend the service life of the products which in the long term
improves customer confidence.
</P>
<P>
Now, computer giants Intel and Microsoft have also established
research institutions in China for the development of their
products.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaoqi, director of the International Cooperation
Department of the State Science and Technology Ministry, said that
the focus of Sino-foreign cooperation had been transformed from
the simple exchange visits of twenty years ago.
 Today, he pointed out, there is a two-way process of importing
and exporting each other's technology, which has been boosted by
the ongoing establishment of Sino-foreign research organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believed that this multi-layered international
cooperation has benefited China's social and economic development,
as well as encouraging research into a wide range of cutting edge
sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures China now established scientific
and technological cooperation agreements with more than 150
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years China has invited a total of more than
700,000 foreign experts to help it realize modernization and adapt
for the new millennium, and sent more than 300,000 of its own
scientists and technicians for training abroad.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor to Refund U.S. Bank: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Convicted Ugandan Mayor Nasser
Sebaggala will be forced to refund the 44,000 U.S. Dollars he
fraudulently withdrew from Bank Boston.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala mayor is most likely to be ordered to refund the
money in addition to serving a jail term between 21-27 months,
U.S. Assistant Attorney Theodore Chuang made the remarks in
Boston, the United States, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's newspaper New Vision Tuesday quoted Chuang as saying
that in majority of cases of fraud, the courts order for
restitution in addition to fines or imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
If the court makes an order for restitution, the mayor will
not have the risk of facing civil suits, the assistant attorney
added.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was convicted last Friday of eight counts including
cheating Bank Boston, transporting forged checks and making false
statements to customs officers.
</P>
<P>
He has been under detention at a U.S. federal center at Rhodes
Island and will be sentenced on February 23, 1999 by District
Court Judge Reginald Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was arrested on June 13, 1998 in the U.S. after
attending an international conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
His conviction sent shock waves to Uganda's capital city.
</P>
<P>
Some people said that Sebaggala's fate has been engineered by
the Ugandan government because he is not a member of the ruling
National Resistance Movement while others argued that he is at
fault.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala is the first directly-elected mayor of Kampala. He
edged to victory in April elections with controversial academic
qualifications.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn of Resurging Sexually Transmitted Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have warned
that a resurgence in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) will
exacerbate the AIDS problem in China and urged related departments
and the general public to adopt preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
STDs, including gonorrhea and syphilis, virtually disappeared
over the past four decades, but are once again on the rise,
according to Professor Ye Shunzhang from the National STD Control
Center (NSCC).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health recently confirmed that the number of
STD patients is most likely between two and four million people,
with that of carriers of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
suffering from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) also
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
"Experts predict an increase in HIV infections in the future,
with a likely drop in infections resulting from intravenous
injection of drug due to the strengthened anti-drug campaign,"
according to Ye.
</P>
<P>
Some 66 percent of an estimated 300,000 HIV carriers in China
were infected as a result of sharing contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that China should not follow the same path
travelled by some African countries where unprotected sex sparked
virtual HIV epidemics. They also point out that rampant
prostitution provides a ready source for sparking STD and AIDS
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The actual number prostitutes and customers brothel frequenters
is much bigger than the known figure, according to Zhang Konglai,
chairman of nongovernmental AIDS monitoring network.
</P>
<P>
A recent Beijing AIDS education exhibition confirmed that 20
percent of prostitutes are STD patients, with one in every 100
infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a cross-century program designed to control
both STDs and AIDS. The goal of the program is to maintain the
annual increasing rate for STDs under 15 percent by the year 2002,
compared to some 16 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The State Council program encourages the use and promotion of
condoms, sex education for college and high school students, and
additional training for medical professionals treating STD cases.
</P>
<P>
The program calls for more than 85 percent of medical
institutions above the county-level to offer standard services for
diagnosing and treating STDs by the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer, Telephone Firms Propose Fast Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. computer and
telephone companies on Monday announced a proposal to speed
availability of high-speed Internet access services.
</P>
<P>
According to Intel, one of the companies that launched the
initiative, the proposal was presented to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) as a mean to encourage telephone
companies to invest in high-speed services for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Other companies involved include Bell Atlantic, Compaq,
Gateway, GTE and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Intel said that the proposal, once adopted by the FCC, would
establish a set of ground rules that support rapid investment in
high-speed infrastructure by the telephone companies while
ensuring a competitive playing field.
</P>
<P>
The initiative came one week after the White House announced an
effort with the FCC, the Commerce Department and U.S. trade
representative to push for increased private investment in
high-speed networks so that consumers and businesses can be free
from slow Internet service.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, which calls for the promotion of
competition in the local exchange data communications market,
incumbent telephone companies will give competitors greater access
to their central offices and all Internet service providers will
continue to have access to the broadband networks of the telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unnecessary restrictive regulations will be lessened
on the incumbent telephone companies. For instance, the regional
Bell companies, which now are allowed only to offer local
services, will be able to provide long-distance data
communications if such freedom would substantially reduce the cost
of delivering high-speed Internet connections to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The widely-touted asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL)
is among the high-speed Internet access services -- the goal of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
This is a technology that uses existing phone lines for
high-speed Internet access up to 30 times faster than today's
modems. A new modem would be required and telephone companies
would need to install new equipment. Once the service is
installed, consumers would never need to dial their Internet
service provider again because ADSL is always on.
</P>
<P>
Also, people can talk on the phone and surf the Web at the same
time on the same line.

BEIRUT, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Poisonous fumes from a leaking
gas boiler killed four Lebanese children as they were taking a
shower at their home, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Zeinab Kamal Allam, 13, and her siblings Sarah,
8, Zahra, 6, and Ali, 5, were found Sunday by their mother, who
was downstairs at the time in the family's ground-floor shop in
eastern Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Her suspicions were aroused when the door had been locked for
some time and no voices could be heard coming from the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
By the time the door was broken down, the children were
already unconscious, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the four children were sent to a downtown
hospital, where they were pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
A public prosecutor has ordered an investigation into the
children's death, a police source said.
</P>
<P>
Forensic tests showed the victims had all inhaled lethal
quantities of butane gas.

BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China's ace diver Guo Jingjing
set her sights on the 2000 Sydney Olympics after she easily won
the women's three-meter springbaord of the Asian Games here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Guo, who got the highest score of 66.120 points
with her concluding reverse 1-1/2 somersaults with 2-1/2 twists,
amassed 547.470 points to win the gold. Her teammate Yang Lan

</P>
<P>
Much-touted Irina Vyguzova of Kazakhstan only managed the

</P>
<P>
"My next major goal is to win in the 2000 Sydney Olympics," Guo
said. "I know it won't be easy, for the rivals there will be much
tougher than here."
</P>
<P>
"As I know, as long as I make no big mistakes, the gold should
be mine, so I feel no pressure throughout the competition, " Guo
said.
</P>
<P>
"After the games, I will work harder in preparation for the
2000 Olympics," she added.
</P>
<P>
Guo, who risked no dive with difficulty degree higher than 3.0,

</P>
<P>
"I have tried it, but my dive is not consistent," she said.
</P>
<P>
The only diver who had ever threatened Guo was her teammate.
The 19-year-old Yang took the lead from Guo after the first dive
with inward 2-1/2 somersaults, which was awarded 61.200 points.
</P>
<P>
But Guo won it back with her second dive, which earned her 63.9
points, and she never relinquished it.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Kids Raise US$300,000 for Zambian AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Fifty thousand pupils in
Finland have raised about 300,000 U.S. Dollars in one day for
Zambian children orphaned by AIDS, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The money was raised through Taksvarkki, a Finnish
non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Oliver Kanene, information officer of KEPA
Zambia, a Finnish NGO partnership program, as saying that the
money would be given to Zambian AIDS orphans for various support
activities such as building orphanages and providing clothing,
food and primary education.
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising by students in Finland will continue until
March 1999, during which more money is expected to be generated
for Zambian orphans.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Zambia will have 600,000 children
orphaned by AIDS by the year 2000. However, The traditional
extended family system in the country is breaking down and
orphans usually have no one to look after them.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish NGO Taksvarkki annually picks a country and theme
in the Third World to support. The pupils and students work at
any nearest company for one day while on the same day adults can
donate a day's salary to the cause.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was picked this year and the problem was identified as
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Next year, child soldiers in Sudan will be the beneficiaries
of the annual benevolent event, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Companies Pledge Not to Sell Ancient Forest Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 major
U.S. companies pledged Monday to phase out using and selling
products from trees harvested in the world's ancient forests,
according to reports from the companies concerned.
</P>
<P>
The companies involved in the project, to be formally announced
Tuesday, include Nike Inc., Dell Computer Corp., IBM Corp.,
Lockheed Martin Corp. and other 21 corporations, which agreed to
conduct an internal audit and stop purchasing wood and other
materials from companies who use products made from old-growth
lumber.
</P>
<P>
Environmental organizations say only 20 percent of the world's
old-growth forests are left and only five percent are in the
United States. Old-growth forests consist of trees hundreds of
years old that shelter many animal, bird and insect species.
</P>
<P>
In October, U.S. environmentalists began a nationwide campaign
to pressure Atlanta-based Home Depot Inc., the country's largest
retailer of home improvement supplies, to stop offering products
made of ancient redwoods and other old-growth lumber, such as
Amazon mahogany and lauan plywood from Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
They demonstrated outside 70 of the 713 Home Depot stores on
October 14, which shocked the companies concerned.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the campaign to save the ancient forest has been
intensified during the past two years and the promise by the 25
U.S. companies is a major success for the environmentalists.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has emerged
as a key player in efforts to resolve the civil war on the Comoro
island of Anjouan which is said to have claimed 40 lives.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni said
Monday that South Africa was one of the countries playing a
mediating role in solving the Comorian Crisis in accordance with
an Organization of African Unity (OAU) resolution.
</P>
<P>
But there was no indication that South African soldiers would
form part of a possible OAU peacekeeping force, the Star

</P>

The fighting in the Comoros started Saturday after an
assassination attempt on self-styled Anjouan President Abdallah
Ibraham by supporters of "prime minister" Abdou Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to prevent Ibraham from re-joining the federal
Comoro state. It is said that since leading Anjouan into
independence in 1997, Ibraham has grown disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
His rivals, however, are still fiercely determined that
Anjouan remain independent and so have violently opposed his move
to open negotiations with the federal government in capital
Moroni.

<HEADLINE> Kenya-EU Trade up 1.28 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between Kenya and
the European Union (EU) has topped 77 billion Shillings (around
1.28 billion U.S. Dollars) so far this year, a senior government
official said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is a major trading partner with Kenya and most of
Kenyan goods are destined in the European market, the planning
and national development minister, George Saitoti, told local
press here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman in office of the African Caribbean
Pacific (ACP) Council of Ministers, Saitoti just provided a
meeting in Brussels. He also attended another meeting in
Stockholm focusing on the dialogue for democratic development for
renewing the ACP-EU partnership in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
European investors have great interest in the East African
region with particular interest in the Kenyan economy, the
minister was quoted as saying by Kenya Times Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that what to be done is to package the investment
opportunities in Kenya so as to attract investors using ACP-EU
co-operation as a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
With regard to trade, Saitoti said that ACP countries are
committed to provisions of World Trade Organization (WTO) as a
regulator of international trade.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the position of ACP in future with regard to
WTO's threat to ACP states is to preserve preferential access of
ACP goods into EU market while re-orienting ACP economies to
global competition.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Economic Statistics Show Blurred Picture: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics on Vietnam's
socio-economic development will show a blurred picture, the
Vietnam Investment Review (VIR) said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The English-language weekly said "the decline in foreign
investment, disappointing budget collection and the growing trade
deficit among other problems have severely affected ambitious
development targets set by the government."
</P>
<P>
The VIR quoted a government report circulated among senior
government members as saying that in the first 11 months of 1998,
the number of foreign direct investment projects decreased 29
percent, while registered capital contributed by foreign
investment fell 49 percent in comparison to the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report, only released at government levels, blamed the
Asian financial crisis as the principal reason for the decline,
said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
The government report claimed that as figures stood at the end
of November, Vietnam has signed official development aid deals
totaling 1.26 billion U.S. dollars, of which 1.13 billion dollars
have been received in loans.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit for the whole of this year is expected to rise to
2 billion dollars, accounting for approximately 22 percent of the
total value of exports and three percent higher than the target
approved by the National Assembly earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the government report, as of mid-November total
budget collection stood at 4.1 billion dollars, meeting 82.6
percent of the year's target, of which 3.2 billion dollars or 79.1
percent came from the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Total budget spending in the past 11 months stood at 4.67
billion dollars, meeting 80.2 percent of the set target.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the budget deficit stood at 568 million dollars,
meeting 66.3 percent of the target approved by the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Hui People in Guangxi Enjoy Normal Religious Life (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: The following is
the ninth of a series of stories featuring the fast-changing life
and culture of the Zhuang, Hui, Miao, Yao and other seven main
ethnic groups in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
which will mark its 40th founding anniversary on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Over many years, Bai Yumei, an elderly Hui woman of Jiucun
Village of Lingui County, Guilin City, often felt sad that she was
unable to read aloud the Koran during daily prayers because she
did not understand Arabic.
</P>
<P>
However, that situation ended three years ago when the Guilin
City Islam Association invited Ma Zhengsheng, an ahung from Gansu
Province, to the mosque of the Jiucun Village to perform those
duties.
</P>
<P>
China has a Hui population of 8.6 million, with the majority
living in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the northwest and
the rest scattered around the country. Maintaining the religious
tradition of these far-flung Chinese Muslims is considered no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
"The religious atmosphere here is quite different from that of
Ningxia and Gansu," pointed out Ahung Ma.
</P>
<P>
Ahung Ma said he was quite surprised upon arrival to find that
only a few villagers, mostly the elderly, prayed.
</P>
<P>
He also discovered that only a few of the male villagers had
retained the Hui habit of wearing the traditional white cap, and that
almost all the women had given up wearing the equivalent white
scarf.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Reclaim Land from Polders Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese water conservancy
experts believe that reclaiming land from the sea will be
one of the effective ways for China to increase land resources to
cope with its growing population.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang Linquan, deputy secretary of the China Water
Conservancy Institute, said that such land reclamation projects
must be carried out whilst also improving the environment of
rivers and marine locations.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 water conservancy officials and experts met in
Xiaoshan City of east China's Zhejiang Province to discuss various
methods for reclaiming land from the sea and also considered the
ongoing protection of the marine ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics China has reclaimed 1.06.6
million hectares of land from the sea in the past 50 years,
reckoned to equal almost the total arable land area of Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
With a per capita arable land space of less than 0.33 hectare,
Zhejiang Province has itself reclaimed 160,000 hectares from
coastal areas in the past half a century.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China can convert half of the existing 2
million hectares of available coastal regions for use as potential
proper land mass.

"It is sad that we are losing so many religious customs. Now we
are helping re-establish normal religious activity in the area,"
Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers, however, commented that in the past they were poor
yet still had to spend a lot of money to invite an ahung from
Guilin to preside over religious, festive or marital ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to fast-improving living standards in recent years
the Hui people have been able to build mosques in their own
villages.
</P>
<P>
And as a result of Ahung Ma's presence, the mosque is becoming
as busy again as the other 35,000 plus mosques in China. Many
young villagers are also taking a more active role in their
religion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many villagers have installed bathing facilities so
that they can take a shower before praying, as required by
custom.
</P>
<P>
"In the past we had to worry about how to make a living and so
neglected our religion," said Bai Xianfa, a member of the Jiucun
Village Islam Association. "Now people have become wealthier they
have more time to attend the mosque," he added
</P>
<P>
Officials in the autonomous region stress that though there are
only just over 19,000 Hui people living in Guangxi, their religion
and customs are fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Yi Tixiang, an enterprise manager, said that his religious
beliefs have never detrimentally affected his career. On the
contrary, he said, his leaders have always demonstrated their
support for the Hui staff and wish them well on Muslim festivals.

<HEADLINE> Injuried Chinese Gymnast Keeps hope for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Lu Yufu, one of China's top
gymnasts who injured his knee last Wedenday in pre-Asian Games
prectices here, is still keeping alive his hope to compete in the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Chinese gymnastics team head coach
Huang Yubin said to Xinhua here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yufu was sent home on Sunday and received a thorough
exemination on Monday at the No. 3 Hospital of Beijing Medical
College (BMC), the best hospital for sports injuries in China.
</P>
<P>
"They called from Beijing Monday night and said Lu's injury was
not as serious as we thought before," said Huang, "the professors
said his front and collateral ligaments were only partly
disrupted, not severed as we worried.
</P>
<P>
"The professors will give an operation on the knee, and Lu may
need two or three months to recover before he could compete
again." added Huang.
</P>
<P>
Lu was not the first Chinese top gymnast to suffer such an
injury. "China's former world and Olympic champion Huang Liping
also tore his knee ligament but he made a successful comeback with
the help of doctors and professors at No 3. Hospital of BMC."
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Lu, a key member of the team which won the 1997
world championships, tore his knee ligament in practice on
vaulting horse, his specialty in which he holds the world unique
movement named "Lu Yufu Jump".
</P>
<P>
"Lu is the leading gymnast in vaulting horse and floor
exercises. He is also very strong in all-around event," Huang
said, "I hope he could come back before next September's world
championship if the treatment goes well."
</P>
<P>
Lu's backup Zhao Sheng performed well on the pommel horse and
the rings to anchor China's victory in Monday's team competition,
the seventh in a row for China since the 1974 Asian Games.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Want Museveni's Brother Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Some Members of Parliament
(MPs) of Uganda demanded that Salim Saleh, President Yoweri
Museveni's younger brother, be tried for over the Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) saga.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Tuesday morning that she did not know whether
the president had responded to the MPs' demand.
</P>
<P>
Saleh should not be left to go scot-free and instead he should
be imprisoned for possible perjury, Tuesday's New Vision daily
quoted some MPs as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
They argued that Saleh admitted buying the 49 percent shares
in the UCB through Greeenland Investment, a fact he even denied
before Parliament in November. Lying under oath is a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Saleh, also a senior presidential advisor on
security and defense, admitted secretly buying the shares of a
Malaysian company in the UCB through Greenland Investment where
he is a shareholder. The next day he tendered resignation and
was accepted by the president.
</P>
<P>
Museveni described his brother's resignation as a curtain
raiser in the country's campaign against corruption among
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs predicted that the worst for the government is yet to
come. They said Saleh had always been referred to as
indispensable and this had partly contributed to his misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
The Westmont, another Malaysian company, bought the 49 percent
shares of the UCB in 1997. According to the agreement between
the Ugandan government and the company, the buyer is not allowed
to transfer the purchased shares.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Parliament to Debate Environment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan parliament is
expected to debate after the Christmas holidays the bill on
environmental law that has already been approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor-General Aaron Ringera said at the Indian Ocean port
city of Mombasa Monday that the government had reached a
milestone in finalizing a draft framework on environmental law.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament is going on recess so it is not possible to
present the motion before the present session," Ringera said.
"However, efforts are being made to table it at the first
available opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's East African Standard newspaper quoted Ringera as saying
that the bill was a framework of legislation that set out various
institutions used to enforce environmental standards and
addresses all aspects of environment.
</P>
<P>
"We had separate legislation dealing with water, forestry and
factories but with this new bill, we are going to have a more
comprehensive legislation developed with a lot of expertise," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added a common kind of legislation is likely to be enacted
in all the three east African countries -- Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Sending Less Greeting Cards to Protect Trees, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Attractive cards offering
seasons greeting at Christmas, New Year's and other special
occasions are on the one hand very nice, but on the other hand
consume an exorbitant number of trees.
</P>
<P>
One tree is needed to produce 4,000 greeting cards, according
to a survey conducted by China Environmental Protection Fund
(CEPF).
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that Beijingers alone sent over 30 million
greetings cards during 1997, with the volume consuming over 10,000
trees which had grown for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer cards equates to more trees", according to the CEPF, the
Communist Youth League of China and both the All-China Federation
of Trade Unions and All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Bajiao Middle School and 10 other elementary
and middle schools in Beijing recently urged Mayor Jia Qinglin to
promote the campaign of "fewer cards to protect trees".
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of Beijing Daily frontpaged a letter from the
Mayor expressing his appreciation and support for the students.
</P>
<P>
"We will be able to save large forest areas if everyone will
send one less card," according to the mayor, who urged people from
all walks of life to answer the children's call and act to protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The CEPF urges people to mail fewer greeting cards in future to
help save forests.
</P>
<P>
The organization noted that telephone calls and E-mail provide
good alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Dragonair, a regional airline headquartered in Hong Kong, has
announced it will not send greeting cards to clients and
business partners during the forthcoming holiday season as part of
an effort to help preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese environmentalists point out 250,000 trees are required
to produce the one billion cards mailed worldwide on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
The production of paper for greeting cards also threatens the
environment when paper mills, especially smaller ventures lacking
adequate waste processing facilities, discharge untreated
wastewater into rivers.

<HEADLINE> Support for New Zealand Labor Party Rising: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the National
Party,
the ruling party in New Zealand, and the Labor Party, the major
opposition party in the country, has widened in the latest New
Zealand
Herald-DigiPoll survey, which shows the latter could govern if an
election were held now.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Tuesday that
the
poll put support for the Labor Party at 51 percent among committed
voters,
up five points on the previous poll in August. Support for the
National
Party is down one point to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minor parties are the biggest losers in the swing to the
Labor
Party, with support for the Alliance dropping four points to six
percent
and support for ACT NZ dropping below the five percent threshold
for
gaining seats under the current voting system.
</P>
<P>
NZ First has regained a small amount of support, rising two
points to
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll has a margin of error of 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest polls show that the support rates for the Labor
Party
always have been close to 50 percent. According to the results of
these
polls, the Labor Party with its own votes plus the votes it gets
from
minor parties that fail to obtain at least five percent of the
nationwide
party votes would be able to organize a single party government.
But the
Labor Party has up to now kept its promise of forming a coalition
with
the Alliance if it wins in election.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Reform Roading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Transport
Minister Maurice Williamson gave a press conference here Tuesday,
announcing Government's wide-ranging proposals to reform roading.
</P>
<P>
"Our road system is struggling to keep up with changing
demands. This is evident in urban congestion and our difficulties
in funding major new developments. In many areas roads are
carrying traffic loads they weren't designed for, pushing up
maintenance costs and making them less safe," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposals, which are issued in a consultation
document, the roading activities of the country's 74 territorial
local authorities would be amalgamated into between four and eight
local road companies to run local roads. Transit New Zealand would
continue to operate State highways but would become a
government-owned company. Transfund New Zealand would continue its
role of providing road funding and would also become a
government-owned company.
</P>
<P>
The document also includes proposals to enforce the Road Use
Levy to clearly distinguish it from the general taxation on fuels
and to permit public road companies to introduce tolls on specific
roads and facilities and introduce congestion prices to restrain
traffic demand on heavily used routes.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will ensure roads will not be privatized, the
present network will be retained, communities will continue to
have a say in road management and everyone will have the same
access they have today, Minister Williamson said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Resume Fish Exports to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will resume fish exports
to the European Union (EU) at the beginning of the next year, said
Kenyan Planning and National Development Minister George Saitoti.
</P>
<P>
On his return Sunday from a crucial meeting between the African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) and the EU, Saitoti said
that the country's fish exports had featured during the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyan fish will be allowed in the EU market by the end of
the month," Tuesday's East African Standard quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A technical evaluation team from the EU recently visited fish
producing regions of the east African countries, namely Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries banned Kenyan fish exports in January this
year over the outbreak of cholera at the height of the El Nino
induced rains.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's fish exports is estimated at four billion Shillings
(67.2 million U.S. Dollars) every year with major markets being
in Holland, Britain, Spain, Japan, Israel and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Development Bank Urges Moodys to Exhibit Objectivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Development Bank (SDB) today urged Moodys to exhibit greater
objectivity in order to determine the bank's correct credit rating.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Moodys' recent decision to lower the bank's
long-term credit rating from A3 to Baa1 was deeply regrettable.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SDB, China's largest government
policy-oriented bank, has played a major role in raising funds for
accelerating infrastructure construction. He also pointed out the
comprehensive government support in terms of capital, liquidity
and various other areas have ensured the bank's healthy financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance recently reaffirmed its full
support for the SDB, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Moodys acted irrationally in lowering the SDB's rating to
a level which fails to tally with the bank's actual situation," said
the spokesman. "We sincerely hope Moodys wills make an effort to
fully understand actual conditions in China and the status of the
SDB in order to issue an objective correct rating."

<HEADLINE> Solution to Myanmar Problems Be Attained By People:UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- "The solution to the problems of
Myanmar must be attained essentially amongst the people of that
country," a spokesman for Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the
United Nations, was quoted by the U.N. Information Center in
Yangon as saying.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions raised in an article in the International
Herald Tribune on November 26, the spokesman said Annan's
discussions with the Myanmar government and those of his special
envoy with the government and Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary
of the opposition National League for Democracy, are confidential
in character and cover a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has often repeated his concern that a
member of the U.N. should be so isolated from the international
community and would very much hope to assist in finding ways for
Myanmar to address the concerns that have led to that isolation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In that effort, he (the secretary-general) reserves the right
to consult closely with interested and influential governments and
with agencies and programs of the U.N. system," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, Senior-General Than Shwe, Chairman of
the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), met with
Kofi Annan when he attended the Kuala Lumpur Second Informal
Summit Meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
they had discussions on Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In October this year, the U.N. chief sent his special envoy
Alvaro de Soto, Assistant U.N. Secretary-General, to Yangon again
to look into the situation in Myanmar. Soto met with both Lt. Gen.
Khin Nyunt, First Secretary of the SPDC, and Aung San Suu Kyi.

COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) Tuesday launched the 1999 State of the World's
Children Report at a ceremony here, which coincides with the
celebration of World Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
Colin Glennie, UNICEF Representative in Sri Lanka, told the

billion people or a sixth of the world's population are illiterate
and most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued annually by the Executive Director of
UNICEF, focuses this time on education for all with emphasis on
education of girls and quality of education. It aims to raise the
level of awareness and stimulate discussion on the state of
children.
</P>
<P>
Glennie said that education for all is "one of the best
investment" governments can make in achieving sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress over the past
decades, but much remains to be done about the quality of
education and education reform.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Deputy Minister of Education and Higher Education
Viswa Warnapala also spoke at the ceremony, pledging that Sri
Lanka would ensure universal primary education by 2001, which is a

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Wants Expanded Trade With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to stress
the need for expanding bilateral trade with India at a
Bangladesh-India trade review that starts here Tuesday, to narrow
a widening trade gap in India's favor.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was likely to take up some issues to remove
hindrances to exports to its mighty neighbor at the review, which
is taking place against the backdrop of Dhaka's growing concern
over the huge trade gap, The Independent daily newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The trade review would end Wednesday with the signing of
documents to renew the existing Bangladesh-India trade agreement.
The renewal takes place every three years since the signing of the
agreement in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was expected to take up the zero tariff issue for
wider access of the country's exports to the Indian market, as an
important remedy to reduce the trade gap, now at about 40 billion
taka (825 million U.S. dollars) a year, and twice as much if
informal trade figures were added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that despite repeated appeals by Dhaka, New
Delhi has yet to grant zero tariff access to substantive
Bangladesh exports, excluding a few irrelevant items.
</P>
<P>
Items such as chemical fertilizer and dry fish were previously
given zero tariff but were not imported from Bangladesh, and
spring water, which was not produced in Bangladesh, was in the
zero tariff category.
</P>
<P>
Items like tea and jute carpets, Bangladesh's two major
exports, have not yet been given reduced tariff facilities by the
Indian side, which had only reduced tariff on some items that
Bangladesh occasionally exported, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was facilitating the access of Indian goods by
allowing unloading of trucks at its border Customs posts, but
Bangladesh exporters did not enjoy the same facility in India,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries remains heavily in favor of
India. During the last fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998) till May
this year, Bangladesh imported 921.73 million dollars' worth of
goods from India, while its exports to the latter stood at only
65.58 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh mainly exports raw hides, leather, vegetable fat and
textile goods to India, and imports textile items, vegetable
products, mineral products, base metals, vehicles and consumer
items from India.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Flood Control Projects Yield Encouraging Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The investment of Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China in flood control
projects has paid off as they helped reduce losses caused by
flooding this year.
</P>
<P>
When you invest one yuan (about 8.28 U.S. dollars) in flood
control projects, you will get at least 40 yuan in return. This
has become the common sense among the people in the city of
Guiping and Pingyuan County.
</P>
<P>
Flood control projects enabled Guiping and Pingyuan to reduce
losses resulting from this year's heavy summer flooding by more
than three billion yuan, or 40 times more than total investments
in related projects.
</P>
<P>
Various other cities in Guangxi have had similar experiences.
One is Wuzhou, a major industrial city, whose 50 million yuan
investment to reinforce levees reduced losses caused by this
year's devastating flooding by some two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou, the region's industrial base, was hit by the worst
flooding on record in 1996, with economic losses soaring to over
7.7 billion yuan. The city has since launched a large-scale flood
control project at a cost of over 1.1 billion yuan, part of which
comes from the central government.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Welcomes U.N. Resuming Cambodia's Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's acting head of
state Prince Norodom Ranariddh Tuesday gave a warm welcome to the
United Nations' decision to resume Cambodia's seat.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that now that Cambodia has a legal new
coalition government and a National Assembly which were formed in
accordance with the Constitution and the results of the election,
it was very normal to resume Cambodia's U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia needs the U.N. seat because it will help a lot to our
country' economic construction and social development. We hope the
U.N. and the international community will resume their aid to
Cambodia," said the prince, who is also President of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It will also greatly help Cambodia to fully return to the
international community, and to strengthen the cooperation and
relationship between the two parties," Ranariddh stressed.
</P>
<P>
The 53rd General Assembly session on Monday adopted by
consensus a Credential Committee recommendation for Cambodia to
reclaim its U.N. seat which had been left vacant since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Ouch Borith, previously Cambodia's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was named as the new
ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lankan Parties Ready for Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nominations close Tuesday
afternoon for Sri Lanka's elections to North Western Provincial
Council (NWPC), which comprises the two districts of Kurunegala
and Puttalam.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and independent candidates will be seeking
election to 35 seats in Kurunegala and 15 seats in Puttalam
district.
</P>
<P>
Following the dissolution of the provincial council in
mid-November, the Elections Commissioner has called for the
nomination of candidates from December 1 to 8 for new polls.
However, the major parties began to propose their candidates only
when time is running out.
</P>
<P>
The two main contenders for the elections are the ruling
People's Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United National
Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
The UNP handed over its nominations for the Puttalam District
Monday together with the Sri Lanka Progressive Front (SLPF). The
PA is expected to hand over its nominations for the Puttalam
District Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the PA and the UNP together with the Jantha Vimukthi
Peramuna are expected to hand over their nomination lists for the
Kurunegala District Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Parliament Monday Deputy Minister of Health S.B. Nawinna and
UNP Member of Parliament Jayawickrama Perera resigned their seats
to lead their respective parties at the elections. One of them
will be the next Chief Minister of the NWPC according to the
results of the election.
</P>
<P>
The election is expected to generate violence and the UNP has
sought police protection for their candidates when they hand over
nominations at Kurunegala Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They have made representations to the Inspector General of
Police Lucky Kodituwakku that they had information that the PA was
preparing for violence at Kurunegala Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elections to five other Provincial Councils in the country,
which were scheduled for last August, were postponed indefinitely
on grounds of security.
</P>
<P>
The government sought to pass legislation to legalize the
postponement but the Supreme Court ruled that the draft
legislation was ultra vires the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Now the government proposes to hold the elections in the course
of next year for the five Provincial Councils.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the Provincial Council elections are widely
seen as mini-general elections at which the government tests its
strength and the opposition its popularity.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Say Artificial Snow Harmful to Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Commission for
Protecting the Alps on Monday called for a curb on artificial snow
facilities in the Alpine mountains, warning that too much such
snow designed for skiing would be harmful to the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, less snowfall in recent years has
prompted skiing companies to resort to man-made snow in their bid
to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Moroder, head of the commission, cited serious
consequences caused by oversized man-made snow: endangering
aquatic species, shortening growing period of alpine plants and
leaving behind harmful chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the number of artificial snow facilities
stood at 549 in 1996, covering some 6,600 hectares in the Alps.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Urges Australia to Accept Nuclear Waste Dump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
publicly urged its ally Australia to accept a proposal by an
American company to establish a dump for the world's nuclear
waste.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gallucci, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy on
weapons of mass destruction, Tuesday told an Australian national
radio that the proposal would not only be profitable for Australia
but would also be a service to the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Australia could play a role in that, I think it would make a
tremendous contribution to international security," he told
Australian Broadcasting Corporation News Radio.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Australian federal government has offered no
public support for the plan, and last week Environment Minister
Robert Hill denied "any ministerial" discussions about it.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based company Pangea has been quietly floating the
proposal for two years.
</P>
<P>
It was forced to go public with its plans last week when green
groups uncovered a promotional video extolling Australia's
qualities as a dump site.
</P>
<P>
Australia had a history of being active in promoting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, the
envoy said.
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think that the economics would be very
favorable for a commercial arrangement that involved addressing
the needs of so many countries who do not have the geology for the
long term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste," he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the majority of its 18 million population living in
coastal cities, Australia has vast and uninhabited desert inland
on its continent, which covers 7.68 million sq km.
</P>
<P>
Gallucci acknowledged that the U.S. had produced much of the
world's spent nuclear fuel but said he doubted it would be
possible to site the dump there.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know enough about the geology of the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think the politics in the United States would
sustain (the idea of storing the world's nuclear waste in the
US)."
</P>
<P>
"We're having difficulty storing our own spent fuel ... I don't
know that we could succeed in storing the spent fuel from all the
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is fundamentally a political issue ... (based on) the
resistance of people to taking in other people's spent fuel."
</P>
<P>
Gallucci said if Australians decided the proposal was not in
their public interest that would be their sovereign right.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- World champion Chen Yan of
China withdrew from the women's 200-meter freestyle in the Asian
Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Chinese pulled out of the heats of the women's
200-meter freestyle for a bad physical strengh, said Chinese coach
Han Mingyan.
</P>
<P>
"She had the trots last night," Han said, "We sent her to the
village clinic this morning to receive some treatment."
</P>
<P>
"As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,"
Han added.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong said Chen will enter the
women's 200m individual medley. "I'm sure she will take part in
that event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen's poor form was a good news for her Japanese rivals. "The
medicore form plaguing Chen will give us more chances to win",
said Japanese swimming team leader Tsuyoshi Aoki.
</P>
<P>
Chen, world record holder in the women's 400m individual
medley, lost to Yasuko Tajima of Japan in her specialty by a
surprisingly big margin of over seven seconds on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She only managed a bronze with a time of 4:47.34, well below
her own record of 4:34.79.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Asian Exports Continue to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- When a financial crisis hit Asia
18 months ago, economists expressed confidence that the sharp
currency depreciation in local currencies would boost exports and
that the faster export growth would drive the region out of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
But 18 months later, analysts found that Asia's exports were
still declining rather than increasing on the back of devalued
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Why did currency devaluations fail to spur an export recovery?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the strong dollar should be partly blamed for the
failure.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, while currencies in Southeast Asian
countries depreciated by 30 percent to 70 percent, export growth
in local currency terms has increased dramatically in these
countries. But when the local currencies have been changed into
dollars, export revenues have declined substantially in the
region.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of 1998, exports in Thailand and
Malaysia sank 4 percent and 10 percent respectively in dollar
terms. South Korea saw only 3.6 percent growth for the first half
of the year, but negative growth in recent months. Indonesia's
exports also dropped 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The collapse in export prices has a more grave effect on the
export growth, since it is cancelling out much gains in export
volumes.
</P>
<P>
When local currencies have remained on a downturn in the past
year, Asian exporters in the crisis-hit countries have been
competing to lower their dollar prices. As dollars are worth more
in local currency terms, exporters can afford to lower prices
without hurting profits.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, export volume grew by 16 percent in the first
three months of this year, but the gains were crushed by an
equivalent fall in export prices.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. government report, import prices for Asian
products have dropped by 15 percent to 20 percent recently,
compared with a 5 percent drop in prices for European products.
</P>
<P>
While Asian exporters are competing to lower their prices,
over-
capacity in the region and weaker demand of electronics on the
world
market have also crushed export prices.
</P>
<P>
Chip makers were hit during the first six months of this year
by a massive drop in dynamic random access memory prices on global
markets as
semiconductors from Japan, China's Taiwan, the United States and
South Korea flooded markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices of 64 megabit DRAMS have dropped to around nine dollars
from around 14 to 15 dollars at the beginning of the year, while
prices of 16 megabit DRAMS have dropped to around 1.5 to 1.8
dollars recently from about 10 dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As electronics products have accounted for over 50 percent of
the total export revenues in some Asian countries, the region has
been hurt badly by the lower prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Asia is paying a high price for relying too
heavily on electronics for export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Besides, much of the stagnation in exports comes from weak
demand in the Asian region itself, and particularly in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, about half of products were exported to countries
within the region. But after the regional crisis, most countries
have cut their imports.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese markets sucks 12 percent of Asia's exports, but
Japan's economic recession and the weak yen trimmed its imports
from Asian countries by more than 10 percent for the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Higher prices for imported materials after currency
devaluations and a shortage of working capital are also squeezing
export industries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
All these problems which are affecting Asia's exports may
continue for some time, because diversification of export products
may need years to complete. A rebound in prices depends on the
supply and demand on the world market and the squeezing export
financing could be eased only
after banks reduce their non-performing loans, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As Asia's growth engine, the region's exports could hardly
contribute
more to an economic recovery in 1999, they said.

<HEADLINE> Clash for Judo Between Tradition and Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Judo
Federation (IJF) president said here on Monday judo should usher
in reform as it's getting more and more popular in the world but
Aisa's chief said no.
</P>
<P>
The IJF president Park Yong Sung said that judo has become an
international sport, so it should be changed at the request of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Judo has become a world's sport like football, basketball and
volleyball," Park said. "It does not belong only to Asia, Europe
or Africa."
</P>
<P>
But Jagdish Tytler, president of Asian Judo Federation (AJF)
said that judo has changed enough and should have no more radical
reform.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is the birthplace of judo," Tytler said. "It's time for
Asia to stand out. Asia should dominate the sport."
</P>
<P>
Judo, founded by Japan in 1882, became an Olymic medal event in
1964, and enjoyed a rapid development since.
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta Olympic Games, Belgium and France broke the
manipulation of Japan and South Korea to take one gold medal
apiece.
</P>
<P>
Hcws Vandeweghe of the Netherlands, a veteran sportswriter of
monthly Sport International, said that there are a lot of judo
clubs in Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
"The two gold medals from the Atlanta Olympic Games was really
a promotion for the sport," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, western countries insisted the athletes must play in
colorful sportswear on the mat instead of the tradional white
colors to fit the need of television broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Under such pressure, the IJF passed a proposal that judocas can
choose either white or blue in the future international
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that the decision may boost the popularity of judo,
Tytler said that there had been enough changes to the sport.
</P>
<P>
"To enter the Olympic family, judo is not what it was," he
said. "The original rule has been changed, the color has been
changed, what they will do with judo?"
</P>
<P>
Tytler, who has been AJF president for four years, said Judo
has a deeper meaning than a face-to-face match between two
athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Judo has an spiritual meaning," he said. "It should remain a
sport which can purify people's heart."
</P>
<P>
But Park, a reformer who was voted the IJF president in 1996,
put it more simple: "Judo is judo. It's just a sport for gold
medals. I don't understand the Japanese' meaning."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Introduce Compulsory Reinsurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to introduce
a compulsory reinsurance system in the country in an effort to
develop its insurance market.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the introduction of the system, jointly sponsored
by the state-run Myanma Insurance and the Yasuda Fire and Marine
Insurance Co Ltd of Japan, was held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Myanmar Deputy Minister of Finance and Revenue
Brig. Gen. Than Tun said the issuance of licenses to private
companies to take part in insurance business is an initial step in
introducing compulsory reinsurance systems in developing countries
like Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in September, the Myanma Insurance also held a seminar
with the Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Group of Australia to
discuss liability insurance, social insurance and health and
workers' compensation insurance.
</P>
<P>
After the enactment of the country's Insurance Business Law in
June 1996, Myanmar opened up its insurance sector to local private
and foreign businessmen as part of its efforts to develop the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three Japanese marine and fire insurance companies
-- Mitsui, Yasuda and Tokio -- have signed memorandums of
understanding with the Myanma Insurance to set up insurance joint
ventures.

<HEADLINE> Australia Seizes Record Cocaine in Single Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia seized a record haul
of 225 kg of cocaine off its east coast Monday, Australian Justice
and Customs Minister Amanda Vanstone announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine seized from a yacht off Coffs Harbour on Monday
afternoon, about 600 km northeast of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence operation over several months by Australian
Customs Service and Australian Federal Police paid off as officers
impounded the yacht and cocaine with an estimated street value of
30 million U.S. dollars, the minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The previous record cocaine haul was in 1994 when 174 kg were
found in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.
</P>
<P>
A federal police spokesman said two Australian men, a Spanish
woman, and the British skipper were arrested in the operation, and
more were expected.
</P>
<P>
The drugs seized had been stored in a dinghy attached to the
vessel, the spokesman said, adding the bust followed a six-month
undercover operation.
</P>
<P>
He said it was believed the yacht, Ketch Maeva, had started its
journey from South America.
</P>
<P>
The seizure comes two months after federal police, customs and
the Australian navy smashed an international drug ring and
recorded Australia's largest ever drug haul.
</P>
<P>
On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 400 kg of
high-grade heroin was seized.

Tajima easily won the 400m medley on Monday with her clocking
6.82 seconds ahead of the 20-year-old Wu and 7.40 faster than
Chinese Chen Yan, the world record holder over 400m.
</P>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Colombian
President Andres Pastrana on Monday called on Latin American
governments to take further measures against widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Mexican Senate, Pastrana also called for
joint anti-drug and anti-crime actions to curb growing discontent
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president ascribed poverty in Latin America to
economic globalization. "Never before has so much wealth been
concentrated by so few people, but never before have so many
people depended on the minimum to survive," Pastrana told the
Mexican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"Employment is the new name of peace," Pastrana said, stressing
that widespread drug-related violence and corruption in the region
could be controlled if the governments acted "with intelligence
and humanity".
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, who arrived in Mexico on Sunday night for a two-day
official visit, will sign six cooperation accords on fight against
drug, trade, education, tourism and culture.

He is accompanied by several cabinet members and a 100-strong

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will not join the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and remain an
independent oil producer, Mexico's Energy Secretariat announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement rejected rumors that Mexico would join OPEC
with Russia and Oman in an effort to lift oil prices from a nearly
12-year low.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Mexico and the two other countries would lose
more than they could gain by joining OPEC, which would commit them
to a policy of cutting crude output. Mexico has expressed
unwillingness to make further output cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Secretariat affirmed that Mexico would continue to
cooperate with OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to boost world
crude prices.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, together with OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela,
were instrumental in convincing other countries to cut their
production this year, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's state-owned oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex),
exported 1.65 million barrels a day in September.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Open Java, Bali to Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
open Java and Bali islands to foreign mining investments under the
eighth generation Contract of Work (COW) which is being drafted by
the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Jakarta Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Mining at the ministry Rozik B. Soetjipto
said the current policy which only allowed domestic investors to
develop the mining resources on both islands was considered by the
ministry ineffective given the fact that domestic investors mostly
cooperated with foreign investors instead of developing the
resources on their own.
</P>
<P>
The domestic holders of the mining contracts initially only
asked for technical assistance from foreign investors. But at a
later stage, the foreign partners not only provide technical
assistance but also finance the projects.
</P>
<P>
"The domestic investors only hold the contract but in reality
it's the foreigners who develop and finance the project. That's
why we have decided to open Java and Bali to foreign mining
investors," Rozik told the annual mining discussion at the Mineral
Technology Research and Development Center here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate General of Mining issued a decree in 1986 to
forbid foreign mining investors from developing the mining
resources of Java and Bali.
</P>
<P>
The policy was aimed at increasing the role of domestic
investors in the country's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Rozik said geologists believe Java, especially its southern
belt, and Bali are rich in gold reserves and industrial minerals,
like kaolin and zeolite. The largest gold mine in Java is the
Pongkor gold field in West Java owned by state general mining
company PT Aneka Tambang.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the government would impose stricter rules
on mining investment by foreign contractors on both islands than
on other islands. They will be only allowed to hold a much more
limited contract area compared to those elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet made a final decision on the maximum size of
the contract areas on Java and Bali. We are currently thinking
about imposing a 25,000 hectares maximum," Rozik said.
</P>
<P>
Under the normal COW, investors may apply for an unlimited
contract area but they are only allowed to retain a maximum
contract area of 62,500 hectares at the start of production. The
remaining contract areas must be relinquished to the government
during exploration.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Tighten Citizenship Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government proposed
to tighten up requirement for citizenship under a new act on
Monday to parliament, the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The act requires that immigrants must physically spend at least
three years in Canada in a five-year period before they can
qualify for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"Permanent residents who obtain citizenship will have
demonstrated their deep commitment to Canada. And that commitment
is possible only if the person is physically in the country,"
Citizenship and Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said.
</P>
<P>
"Physical presence makes it possible to better understand
Canadian society, its values and its culture," the minister told
the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The current act stipulates that a Canadian permanent resident
must have at least three years of residence in Canada within a
four-year period prior to citizenship application.
</P>
<P>
However, it has led to many discrepancies in interpretation.
Some courts ruled that keeping a home in Canada for three years
would meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law also requires that people should be functional
in English or French to qualify for citizenship.

<HEADLINE> Reno: No Independent Investigation on Clinton-Gore Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno on Monday declined to order an independent counsel to
investigate President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore over
political advertisements financed by the Democratic Party during
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
Following a 90-day preliminary investigation, Reno concluded
that further investigation by an outside prosecutor was not
warranted.
</P>
<P>
She said her announcement marked the end of the Justice
Department's investigation into whether the so-called issue
advertisements violated the federal criminal law.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the allegations was whether Clinton and Gore
tried to circumvent campaign spending limits through the 46
million U.S. dollars in television advertising that was paid for
by the Democratic Party, but designed to promote their re-election.
</P>
<P>
Reno's decision was particularly good news for Clinton in a
week when he faces a possible impeachment vote by the U.S. House
of Representatives Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I have found there are no reasonable grounds for further
criminal investigation," Reno said in a two-page statement.
</P>
<P>
"I have determined that there is clear and convincing evidence
that neither the president nor any other covered person acted with
criminal intent in connection with the issue advertisements," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, already the target of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's investigation, could have been dogged in his last two
years in office by an outside prosecutor if Reno had decided more
investigation was needed for the campaign allegations.
</P>
<P>
The White House hailed Reno's decision. "As we have said all
along, the president and the Clinton-Gore campaign complied with
the spirit and letter of the law. We are gratified by this
decision," White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress, who have long demanded an
independent counsel to investigate the 1996 campaign, strongly
attacked Reno's decision.

BELGRADE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovich on Monday accused the United States of blocking
Yugoslavia's return to the international community, said the
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovich was quoted as saying in an interview with a local
paper Courier that it was some big powers, first of all the United
States, that have exerted pressure on Yugoslavia in an attempt to
seek their strategic interests in this region.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper Vecernje Novosti, U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Saturday announced a six-month extension of the
U.S. sanctions on Yugoslavia on grounds of Belgrade's failure to
meet international demands.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yugoslav prime minister argued that his nation has
met all the demands to reinstate itself in international
organizations and financial bodies.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil Fail to Agree on Free Sugar Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Brazil and
Argentina on free sugar trade within the South Common Market
(Mercosur) have turned out to be bitter as the two sides failed to
reach any agreement, a Brasilian diplomatic source said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is among the few items whose trade is restricted within
the four-nation bloc, which consists of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Argentina has slapped a 22 percent tariff on Brazilian sugar,
which gets government subsidies to keep alive a dying alcohol-fuel
sector and to protect hundreds of thousands of cane growers from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Ministry's director of integration affairs,
Renato Marques, said the talks would have to start again from
scrap.
</P>
<P>
The sugar disputes are threatening the unity of the Mercosur
bloc, already under shadows of grievances over milk and car trade.
</P>
<P>
South American economists said the road to free trade in the
region, which used to be smooth, has been made rough by the Asian
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Costs Indonesia 238 Mln dollars Since May: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's corruption cases
recorded from May through to the second quarter of the 1998-99
fiscal year ending March 31 have cost the country a loss of 1.76
trillion rupiah (238 million U.S. dollars), the Indonesian
Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Development and Finance Supervisory Body (BPKP)
Soedarjono told lawmakers in a hearing here on Monday that
corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices had been recorded
since the Development Reform Cabinet under President B.J. Habibie
took office in May.
</P>
<P>
Soedarjono said the cases were divided into corruption (TPK) or
pure corruption cases, and non-corruption cases (non-TPK), which
are technically not corruption cases, but which resulted in
causing damage to the nation.
</P>
<P>
As of the second quarter of the current fiscal year, TPK cases
accounted for 219 billion rupiah and 205.5 million U.S. dollars
while non-TPK cases made up 27.9 billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Those figures bring total losses indicated by the BPKP to
246.9 billion rupiah plus 205.5 million U.S. dollars. With an
exchange rate of 7,400 rupiah a U.S. dollar, the losses total over
1.767 trillion rupiah," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soedarjono said the BPKP has investigated 8,435 development
projects worth 21.2 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Our findings show that of the total project value,
irregularities in 21 departments as well as non-departmental
bodies have caused a loss of 117.3 billion rupiah. The largest
contributors to the loss are the Mines and Energy, Public Works,
Culture and Education and the Transportation Departments,"
Soedarjono said.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie, who took over from Soeharto on May 21,
pledged thorough reforms in order to create a government free of
corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Walk to Work From U.S. Space Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts stepped out
of the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour on Monday for their first
space walk.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the walk was to connect wires between a U.S. and
a Russian module, said the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
With 135 tools at their disposal and working at 240 miles above
the Earth, Jerry Ross, NASA's four-time space-walker, and James
Newman, a 42-year-old physicist, clamped the electrical connectors
for power and data flow between the Russian module Zarya and the
U.S. module Unity -- the first two components of the international
space station,
</P>
<P>
Monday's space walk, one of the three scheduled during
Endeavour's 12-day flight, will take the astronauts six hours.
When all the 40 connectors are joined, flight controllers will
turn on the power inside the fledgling station.
</P>
<P>
NASA's officials said that the U.S-built Unity, a connecting
passageway, needs the solar power generated by the Zarya control
module to survive.

BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
has increased its landscaped areas by 149 million sq.m. over the
past two decades since the introduction of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of 1997 indicate a 34.2 percent
coverage for landscaped areas, up 12 percent from that in 1978,
with the per capita coverage rising by 3.8 sq.m. to 7.8 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
The increased coverage has largely been attributed to extensive
landscaping projects in urban, suburban and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Beijingers enjoy greenery throughout the year, and breathe much
cleaner air due to large-scale suburban afforestation and the
Sanbei (north, northwest and northeast China) Shelterbelt

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's automobile
output and sales in January-November this year fell by more than
22 percent from the same period last year, a national car maker
group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.5 million cars were produced in Brazil by last
month, 22.76 percent less than by November 1997, while automobile
sales dropped by 22.55 percent, with over 1.4 million cars sold.
</P>
<P>
Car demand in the country fell by 21.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the overall decline to rising stockpiles,
high interest rates and soaring unemployment.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil received more than four billion U.S. dollars from
its car sales abroad in the January-November period, up by 16.11
percent from the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Car plants dismissed nearly 10,000 workers in the
past year, while giving temporary leave to 13,000 others, keeping
less than 100,000 employees on the job.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian army maintains
sufficient fighting capacity despite a shortage in military
expenditures, Commander of Army Peter Shulyak said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held by the Defense Ministry,
Shulyak said that before the year 2000, the army would focus on
training the newly-founded No.1 missile division, its containment
forces and airborne mobile troops.
</P>
<P>
He said the army headquarters would also make efforts to
increase the number of tanks and build helicopter troops as
planned.
</P>
<P>
However, Shulyak pointed out that due to a lack of financial,
material and technical guarantees, the army finished only 70
percent of its shooting training programs, 4.6 percent of its
vehicle driving programs and 40 percent of the air unit's flying
programs.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more than 30,000 officers were ill-housed and
had not been paid for three to six months.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian army currently boasts an army staff of 180,000,
with an establishment of five corps, 11 tanks and mechanized
divisions, seven mechanized brigades, two artillery divisions, two
training divisions and 40 other brigades of various services.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian ground forces account for 56 percent of the
country's total military staff excluding the civilian members.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Infant Deaths Down, Life Expectancy Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. infant mortality rates
reached their lowest level in history last year and the average
life expectancy of Americans rose to an all-time high of 76 years,
as shown by official statistics released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Teen pregnancies, as measured by the number of live births,
fell by 3 percent, continuing a downward trend that started six
years ago, according to data compiled by a research arm of the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 infant mortality rate, a measure of the number of
deaths before a baby turns one year of age, was 7.1 deaths per
1,000 births. That was about 3 percent lower than the 1996 rate
of 7.3 deaths per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
The drop in infant mortality was recorded despite a 7.5 percent
increase in the number of low birth-weight babies, and an increase
of about 2 percent in the number of births by women in late
childbearing years. Pregnancy and birth complications are more
common among older women.
</P>
<P>
Medical science is combating such potential complications by
developing improved ways to treat and care for underweight and
premature babies, said Bernard Guyer of the Johns Hopkins School
of Hygiene and Public Health, who analyzed the government data.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the improvement in infant death rates, "We still
rank pretty poorly" compared with other industrial countries,
Guyer added.

<HEADLINE> New Power and Heating System Saves Energy in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A new power and heating
installation is expected to improve the utilization rate of energy
and save one third on the cost of electricity in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The new system code-named "Energy-Loving Island" is designed to
replace the traditional boiler in buildings and to serve both as
heater and power generator. The energy, fueled by light diesel oil
or natural gas, can be transferred to large power grids to provide
a constant power supply and avoid possible power outages caused by
routine power grid checks or accidents.
</P>
<P>
The system will be used at the Pudong International Airport and
the Japanese-funded Global Financial Center in Pudong. The method
is already being used in the western world. Statistics show that
10 percent of the total power in Europe, even 30 percent in some
countries, is generated this way.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 3,000 high buildings or skyscrapers and an
economical and safe way to supply them with electricity has long
been a concern of the local government.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Economic Commission decided to study the use of
such a system in the mid-1980s and the first pilot system was set
up in 1995 in the Central Hospital of Huangpu District.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Jingdezhen, known as China's
porcelain capital in eastern Jiangxi Province, will use its
historic and natural resources to develop tourism in the coming
century.
</P>
<P>
A number of old villages, roads, virgin forests, and valuable
historic relics, including 30 old porcelain kilns, two
1,000-year-old brick pagodas, and 136 buildings that are about 500
years old, have been discovered in the city.
</P>
<P>
Jingdezhen has a history of porcelain making that goes back to
the Five Dynasties period (907-979 A.D.). The name "Jingde" comes from
an emperor's reign title in the year 1004 of the Song Dynasty
(960-1279). It is the only city in China named for a reign title.
</P>
<P>
With its advanced porcelain-making techniques and important
place as a communications link between Jiangxi, Anhui and Zhejiang
provinces, Jingdezhen has been a center for porcelain, handcrafts,
and agricultural products since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

The two pacts reached between the four Mercosur countries --
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- have to be ratified by
the Mercosur council, which is made up of the finance and foreign
ministers of the four countries, before being signed by their
presidents.
</P>
<P>
The justice ministers of the six countries set the norms for
the treaties during a meeting in Brasilia last month.
</P>
<P>
The pacts, however, do not include the extradition of political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The agreements are expected to speed up extradition of drug
traffickers and terrorists between Mercosur countries and their
partners, officials said.
</P>
<P>
But the pacts do not allow Brazil to request the extradition of
its citizens committing crimes in other countries due to a
constitutional ban on such a practice.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Quit OPEC Membership, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia signaled it might
quit as member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), citing the organization's failure to stabilize
the world oil prices, Antara News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"After we make considerations, Indonesia has decided it may
quit OPEC," Rachmat Sudibyo, member of the Mines and Energy
Minister's expert staff said.
</P>
<P>
Many parties had previously pressed the government to abandon
its OPEC membership on the grounds that the organization failed to
control the world crude price which now slumped to 9.8 U.S.
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil observer Bahrawi Sanusi said the crude price's slump, the
first since the OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, on November 25,
indicated that the organization did not serve its members'
interest.
</P>
<P>
The organization lacked discipline in controlling oil prices,
he said, adding that almost all the 11 OPEC members had violated
their quotas but none of them were subjected to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo said, however, Indonesia needed to think of the bad
impact of its wish to abandon its OPEC membership.
</P>
<P>
"This (the wish) will eventually give an impression that OPEC
is powerless," he told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia did not want that to happen.
</P>
<P>
As an OPEC member, he said, Indonesia would keep on discussing
with other OPEC members the proper quota of each OPEC member.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Venezuelan president-elect Hugo
Chavez announced on Monday that several foreign states have
recognized his triumph in Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I have received phone calls from Argentine President Carlos
Menem and from the White House," Chavez said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was one of the first to recognize Chavez's
victory in the election.
</P>
<P>
After preliminary results revealed that Chavez, 44, had
defeated his rival Henrique Salas Romer, U.S. ambassador John
Maisto met with leaders of the Movement To Socialism, one of the
parties making up Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole.
</P>
<P>
Maisto said his government would back the winner of the
presidential election, whoever he was.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States denied Chavez a tourist visa
because he had headed a coup attempt against then President Carlos
Andres Perez in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans New Migrant Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Committee
(BMC) of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
has suggested new economic measures in managing the city's many
and ever increasing migrants from other Chinese regions.
</P>
<P>
The measures were put forth in a newly finished report of the
Social and Law Committee (SLC) of the BMC's Standing Committee
after a four-month investigation, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, SLC members listened to the reports
from the Beijing Migrants Managerial Office (BMMO) and municipal
governmental departments involved in all aspects of a migrant's
life, carried out on-the-spot investigations in several migrant
neighborhoods, and held symposiums on the topic.
</P>
<P>
The SLC suggested three economic measures to facilitate
Beijing's management of its migrants.
</P>
<P>
The first is to adopt a higher managerial fee on those
migrants coming to the city to run a business or work for one.
</P>
<P>
"Since Beijing doesn't collect an extra Urban Facility Charge
of 50 yuan (6 US dollars) per month on each migrant like Shanghai,
Beijing's managerial fee is actually too low," said BMMO official
Ding Lin.
</P>
<P>
This includes increasing the original 15 yuan (1.8 US dollars)
professional categories fee waivers, and charging more for people
living in Beijing's eight downtown districts with their families.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommends the municipal government impose
taxes on property, operation, the use of the land of cities and
towns, defending city construction, as well as education fee for
people leasing houses.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a settlement fee, the report suggests, should be
imposed on State-owned businesses employing migrants.
</P>
<P>
"Through this, we can somehow level the costs of employing
migrants and of local people, which is always much higher than the
former," Zhang said.

<P>
SHENZHEN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwan clothing manufacturer
recently resumed operations in the Shenzhen, a leading special
economic zone in south China.
</P>
<P>
The manager said the good investment convinced him to resume
operations in the city.
</P>
<P>
Similar cases became quite common during the first nine months
of the year, with the number of Taiwan businesses in the zone more
than doubled the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the trend to the improved work
efficiency of the municipal government, and the city's efforts to
provide national treatment to overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that Shenzhen's 2,600 Taiwan-funded
enterprises involve investments of over 2.7 billion U.S.

<HEADLINE> Bad-boy Wise Gets Three Game Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Controversial Chelsea skipper
Dennis Wise was given a three match ban Monday following his
latest run-in with officialdom.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of England confirmed the suspension
after the England midfielder was sent off against Everton last
Saturday for two bookable offences.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said Wise had been given a mandatory
one game ban for the dismissal - plus a further two matches
because it was his third red card of the season.
</P>
<P>
Wise will now miss the Premiership matches with Tottenham on
December 19th, the trip to Southampton on Boxing Day and the
visit of Manchester United three days later.
</P>
<P>
He was sent off in a pre-season game, which meant he started
the campaign with a three-match ban. And he was sidelined for
another four games after being red carded for a terrible tackle
on teenager Darren Byfield in a Worthington Cup tie with Aston
Villa.
</P>
<P>
He had just returned from that latest ban on Saturday when he
was given an early bath for two clumsy challenges on Danny
Cadamarteri and Marco Materazzi.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli chose his words carefully after
the Everton game - mindful that Wise had gone into print on the
morning of the match to say he "couldn't change his style".
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is for everybody not to comment on Wise,"
Vialli said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the referee performed that well in the first
half but for the sake of Chelsea, for the player and for the
English game it's best that nobody comments on the situation," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Stadium Twin Towers 'Have to Go' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior figures at Wembley
stadium admitted Monday that they will have to demolish the twin
towers when the stadium is redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
The world-famous landmarks appeared to have won a reprieve
last month after news of their demise was released, but now it
seems that only replicas will survive.
</P>
<P>
The latest admission is likely to anger Brent Council, which
gave redevelopment the go-ahead on the basis of the towers'
survival.
</P>
<P>
The local authority has warned that planning permission could
be taken away if the 75-year-old towers were to be removed in the
300m scheme.
</P>
<P>
Wembley Stadium vice-chairman Jarvis Astaire told a sports
forum on Monday: "The towers will have to go because the entire
stadium will need widening. But I believe replicas will be built."
</P>
<P>
Work on rebuilding the stadium has already been delayed from
its original start date of next May and is now not expected to
begin before next autumn.
</P>
<P>
A Celine Dion concert is being held there next summer and
England are hoping to stage their European Championship qualifier
against Luxembourg at Wembley on 4 September 1999 before the
bulldozers move in.
</P>
<P>
Fears for the towers were first raised following comments by
Football Association chief executive Graham Kelly.
</P>
<P>
He said he was uncertain if they would be "significant" to a
new 88,000-seat arena, forming the centrepiece of a bid to bring
the World Cup to England in 2006.
</P>
<P>
One option is to move the grade II listed towers to form a
gateway to the new national stadium.
</P>
<P>
But not only would that prove expensive, there is also no
guarantee they can be successfully relocated.
</P>
<P>
No decision on the future of the 126ft high towers can be
taken until Wembley becomes the property of English National
Stadium Trust, which is buying it from Wembley Plc for 103
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
With 120m having been granted by the English Sports Council,
that leaves 17m to be used during the design phase.
</P>
<P>
The FA aims to raise 200m towards the development costs
through the City.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players to Play Exhibition in Atlantic City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- With the lockout showing no
signs of ending, idle NBA stars will take part in a charity game
December 19 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but the participants
will not inlude Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the contest, which will feature at least 16 players
who have represented the United States in international
competition, were announced today by agents David Falk and Arn
Tellem along with Showtime, which will televise the contest from
the Atlantic City Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, however, will not be in uniform. Curtis Polk,
president of Falk Associates Management Enterprises, which
represents Jordan, said the Chicago Bulls guard did not want to
send a "mixed message" to fans since he has not decided whether
to return this season.
</P>
<P>
Players Association president Patrick Ewing will be among the
players and will be joined by Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim
Hardaway, Allan Houston, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Dominique
Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta and
Mitch Richmond. The rest of the participants will be announced at
a later date.
</P>
<P>
Portions of the proceeds for the game will be donated to
UNICEF and the rest will benefit the "bottom tier" of NBA players
most affected by the lockout, which is in its 159th day. Today's
news conference was also used as a vehicle to blame the NBA
owners for the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous opportunity to show how much the players
want to be on court," said Falk. "There has been confusion of
intention. Players want to be on the court. Unfortunately, the
lockout has prevented that. It gives the chance to say thanks to
the fans. It is a chance to show love for the game."
</P>
<P>
Most of the tickets will range between $25 and $50 with some
courtside seats selling for $1,000. The players will not be paid
and organizers predicted the game will generate revenue in "the
low seven figures."
</P>
<P>
"Our livelihoods are at stake. We have families and our
competitive juices are flowing," added Mourning. "Right now we
are being neglected and it's an unfortunate situation. That's why
were are playing these games."
</P>
<P>
NBA owners and the union met for 10 1/2 hours on Thursday in
New York but reported little progress toward ending the lockout.
NBA commissioner David Stern on Thursday publicly acknowleged the
possibility of canceling the entire season.

BONN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Injured double Olympic ski
champion Katja Seizinger said on Monday she would miss the season
and may even have to retire, local television quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a training crash in Italy in June, she damaged

shin.

As one of the most successful women in Alpine skiing,
Seizinger has secured 36 world Cup titles. She became overall
champion for the first time in 1996.
</P>

for determining the standings begin with the greater number of
points obtained in the matches between the teams in question.
</P>
<P>
2. If points are level between the teams in question, goal
difference resulting from the matches between the teams in
question determines the position.
</P>
<P>
3. If the above two are level, the greater number of goals
scored away from home between the teams in question determines
their position.
</P>
<P>
4. Overall goal difference only comes into play if teams are
level on all three of the above criteria.
</P>
<P>
5. To determine the best two runners up, the first criterion
is the highest number of points in all matches, followed by goal
difference in all matches, the greater number of goals scored in
all matches and the greatest number of goals scored away from
home.

<HEADLINE> Batty Transfer Fee Agreed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The long running saga of David
Batty's proposed return to Leeds looks to be over with news that
the club have agreed a 4.4 million pounds fee with Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Batty's agent said on Monday: "The move is
subject to a medical and finalising personal terms, which will
probably be tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have no reservations other than we hope the medical goes
according to plan and we don't foresee any problem with personal
terms."
</P>
<P>
Batty started as a trainee at Leeds in 1987 and helped them to
the League title in 1992, before leaving Elland Road in a 2.75
million move five years ago.
</P>
<P>
He had a transfer request accepted by Newcastle 10 days ago
but since then the two clubs have been arguing over a fee.
</P>
<P>
The Yorkshiremen had an original bid of 4 million rejected,
with the Magpies believed to be wanting closer to 6 million.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has agreed to waive 800,000 in signing-on
bonuses, negotiated when he signed a new five-year contract at
Newcastle in the close season.

<HEADLINE> Southeastern China Looking at Emerging Markets in EU, Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 11 countries in
Europe and Africa are emerging as markets for Fujian province in
east China.
</P>
<P>
Cao Degan, Fujian's Vice-governor in charge of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, told a recent seminar on the Asian
financial crisis that the euro and the growing African economy
could stimulate the province's exports and help Fujian get a
greater market share in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that Fujian could save money and time in various
European countries because of the removal of currency barriers and
Fujian's products could be exported to a port of any country in
the zone, then sold to other countries by retail.
</P>
<P>
Fujian exported 9.98 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in the
January-October period, up 3.47 percent on a year-on-year basis,
with exports to Europe increasing 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sources disclosed that foreign trade companies of Fujian will
focus on France and Germany next year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's Africa exports still account for little of its
total. However, its medium- and low-priced products, which are the
major part in its exports, fit some African needs, according to
Chen Zuwu, director of the provincial foreign trade committee.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade contributes a great deal to Fujian's
economy. Last year, its exports totaled 11.5 billion U.S. dollars
worth, ranking fourth in China. However, its foreign trade
suffered from the Asian financial crisis and the devaluation of
currencies in some Asian countries, where 70 percent of its
exports were going.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges End to Independent Counsel Statute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The independent counsel law
"is seriously flawed" and should be abandoned, a commission headed
by former Republican Senator Howard Baker and former Carter
administration Attorney General Griffin Bell said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The post-Watergate law that resulted in court-appointed
prosecutors for Iran-Contra, Whitewater and the Monica Lewinsky
matter covers 49 federal officeholders and "in effect... creates
miniature departments of justice, independent of the attorney
general, to prosecute particular persons," the panel said.
</P>
<P>
The law should be permitted to expire next year, said the panel
established three years ago by the University of Virginia's Miller
Center of Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans have taken turns complaining about
the law over the years, depending on who was under investigation.
Next year, many Democrats are likely to join the Republicans who
have traditionally opposed it. Even one of the independent counsel
law's authors, Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat, has said it needs
to be "radically reformed."

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the United
States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on
Monday met at the State Department in Washington for their third
session in four days.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the U.S. team was
led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman
while the head of the DPRK team was vice Foreign Minister Kim
Kye-Gwan.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are being conducted in a serious atmosphere. My
understanding is that they could continue tomorrow," Foley told
a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and DPRK negotiators met in New York last Friday and
Saturday with the agenda restricted to the U.S. demand that DPRK
allow inspection of the site at the village of Kumchang-ri,
where the United States alleged there was an underground building
site which could be connected with a revived nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has denied that the building work was
nuclear-related and has asked the United States to promise
compensation if a search proved negative.
</P>
<P>
The talks coincided with a trip to Asia by President Bill
Clinton's newly appointed coordinator of policy toward the DPRK,
former Defense secretary William Perry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Borrow Strongly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Consumers borrowing in this
country recorded a fastest increase in October since July 1996,
the Federal Reserve reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Credit outstanding grew at a 9 percent annual rate to a
seasonally adjusted 1.29 trillion U.S. dollars, according to the
U.S. central bank, which is up from rates of 4.9 percent in
September and 3.9 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing also helps explain why the U.S. personal savings
rate went negative for the second consecutive month _ for the
first time on record. The personal savings rate is savings as a
percentage of after-tax income. Another factor is that, in

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspectors to Start Surprise Visits to Iraq's Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspectors
were to start surprise visits to Iraq's suspected sites to test
Iraq's promise of resuming full cooperation with the United
Nations, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after meeting with the president of the
Security Council Monday morning, Butler said, "We are about to
begin visits to sites where we have, under our mandate, a reason
to go from the point of view of prohibited weapons programs."
</P>
<P>
Butler, executive chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, said that after those visits were finished,
either at the end of this week or early next week, he would be
able to submit a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
whether Iraq had kept its promise of full cooperation or not.
</P>
<P>
Butler said that since Iraq's restoration of cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors on November 14, he had renewed work in
four areas, namely access to document, monitoring, interviews and
visits to so-called "capable sites" which might have a potential
for use for forbidden purposes.
</P>
<P>
The executive chairman said the fifth area, where the work was
about to start, was investigation of sites where prohibited
weapons programs might exist.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council will not start to conduct
the comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions until the secretary-general proves that Iraq has
cooperated fully and unconditionally with the U.N. weapons
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Thick Icecap Found in Mars' North Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- NASA' scientists said that
the first close-up images of Mars's north pole taken by the Mars
Global Surveyor suggests there is a thick ice cap there, but it is
only half the size of the ice cap covering Greenland and only 4
percent of the Antarctica's entile ice sheets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San
Francisco Sunday, they said that the ice cap measures 750 miles
and is 1.8 miles thick.
</P>
<P>
Water trapped in the ice cap is not enough to have carved the
deep gullies on the Mars' surface as we have found, they said. and
the ice cap is about 10 times less than the minimum volume that
scientists previously thought it would be enought to fill an
ancient ocean.
</P>
<P>
The ice cap locates in a deep basin at the north pole of Mars,
and the basin might have been created by an asteroid impact
similar to craters on the Moon.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that the new images raise more questions about
past conditions on Mars such as how did the ice cap form and how
old the ice cap is.
</P>
<P>
NASA said that it would send another one or two satellites to
study Mars in the near future.

WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States
congratulated Hugo Chavez on his election as president of
Venezuela Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart applauded the Venezuelan
people "for their display of democracy at work in electing their
new president."
</P>
<P>
"The elections were peaceful and the results were tabulated and
reported promptly. We congratulate Mr. Chavez on his impressive
victory," said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government declined to grant a visa to Chavez two
years ago because of the coup attempt he led against a predecessor
government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he expects any tensions with the United States to
have subsided by the time he takes office on Feb. 2
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said heads of state
normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the U.S., and that
"the U.S. government is prepared to take the necessary steps to
address any request for a visa that President-elect Chavez may
make."
</P>
<P>
Foley added, "We hope that American business will continue to
have opportunities in Venezuela." "That's one of the important
issues on our agenda," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> National Y2K Chiefs to Meet at United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- With the countdown for
the "Year 2000" effect on computer systems, heads of national
programs for tackling the problem will meet for the first time on
an international basis at the United Nations on December 11, UN
Department of Public Information said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Assessment of the severity of the impact of the so-called
Millenium Bug, or Y2k effect, brought about when dating systems
within computer software become inoperative at the moment of
transition from years starting with "19" to those starting
with"20", vary widely.
</P>
<P>
The impact on developing countries is even more of an unknown
quantity. Although computer systems are much less pervasive in
developing countries than in those with advanced technologies, a
larger share of their systems likely rely on older software that
has not been updated to offset the Millenium effect. Most
developing country governments and businesses have less money and
fewer local experts available to them than is the case in
industrialized countries, and a number of governments of
developing countries are preoccupied by natural catastrophes or
civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of unpreparedness in any one country can
rapidly spill over to other parts of the world," said Ambassador
Ahmad Kamal of Pakistan, who organized the meeting in his capacity
as Chairman of the UN Economic and Social Council's Working Group
on Informatics.
</P>
<P>
"The first step is awareness of the problem, and at this point,
many countries have barely begun to consider national responses,
and there is as no reliable overview of worldwide preparedness.
The Working Group meeting is designed to address these
difficulties, and facilitate a useful exchange of experience, "
said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting are Y2K experts from the United
Nations, the World Bank, the International Telecommunications
Union, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the International
Civil Aviation Organization, the Joint Year 2000 Council and the
International Technology Association of America.

climate of confidence, in which our relations can develop to
the full," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the first president to address the GCC summit from
outside the group in its 18-year history, said the GCC, for
nearly two decades, has promoted cooperation for development,
peace and stability in a region that has played an indispensable
part in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the fourth being held in the UAE since the
founding of the regional political, economic and defense
alliance in 1981, which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,

WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States pledged
Monday to keep pushing for a political settlement in troubled
Kosovo despite the refusal by the ethnic Albanians of a U.S.
proposal for the Serbian province's future.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Deputy Director James

CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa held talks Monday with his Mozambican counterpart Leonardo
Simao on issues in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the current conditions in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the Horn of Africa and issues in some other
African countries, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi
Annan, leaders of Rwanda, Uganda and DRCongo reached on November
28 a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting between rebels and
forces loyal to Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
As for the Horn of Africa, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Djibouti have disputes over territory and some other issues, which
are far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
Simao arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit, during which
he is expected to deliver a message to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak from his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano on
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Moussa briefed Simao on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, especially on the
Palestinian-Israeli track after the signing of the Wye peace deal,
the news agency said.

The Palestinians and Israel signed the agreement on October 23

<HEADLINE> White House to Call 14 Witnesses in Two-Day Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The White House will call 14
witnesses and use two lawyers to present its defense of U.S.
President Bill Clinton during two 15-hour days Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The presentation will challenge the impeachment evidence
without attacking the prosecutor who gathered it, officials here
said.
</P>
<P>
The White House sent a letter informing the House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee that presidential lawyer Greg
Craig will open the presentation Tuesday and "describe briefly and
generally the president's legal and factual defense" followed by
three panels of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff will make closing
arguments Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The White House also disclosed that one of its witnesses, Yale
law professor Bruce Ackerman, will argue that any impeachment
article approved by the House this year would not be valid when
the new Congress convenes January 6.
</P>
<P>
Among the witnesses are three former members of the House
Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach President Nixon a
quarter-century ago: the Reverend Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic
priest and former Massachusetts Democrat; Elizabeth Holtzman,
and Wayne Owens, both Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The panel was carefully chosen by presidential aides hoping to
use former lawmakers to lobby current committee members that
impeachment is too severe a penalty for Clinton's transgressions
in the Monica Lewinsky affair, and that there isn't evidence that
Clinton abused his presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee's inquiry enters a final, crucial phase
this week with two days of presentations from White House
witnesses and attorneys beginning Tuesday. The White House asked
for four days but grudgingly accepted half that time. The
committee will consider articles of impeachment later in the week.
</P>
<P>
The committee originally gave the White House one day to rebut
charges against Clinton in the Lewinsky affair. Clinton's lawyers
last week said they wanted three or four days.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the panel's Republican and Democratic chief
counsels are expected to make closing arguments and the committee,
from late Thursday into Friday, plans to consider articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
It appears almost certain that the Judiciary Committee, split
down party lines, will send to the full House at least one article
of impeachment charging Clinton with perjury in his denials of a
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Republican committee
members said they are also pushing for articles charging
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The House then would take up impeachment the following week.
Lawmakers on both sides said a House vote is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
Even if the House votes for impeachment, it is highly unlikely
at this point that a two-thirds majority in the Senate would vote
to convict and remove Clinton from office.

<P>
"There is a timetable that was established. I spoke to Chairman
(Yasser) Arafat about the necessity of living up to security
obligations and I have spoken to the foreign minister about the
importance of the Israeli side fulfilling its obligations.
</P>
<P>
"We think that Wye is very carefully written and we want to see
both sides carry out what they need to do," she added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the
Wye agreement at the White House on Oct. 23 after nine days of
intensive U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement offers the Palestinians a further 13 percent of
the West Bank in returning for security measures for Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the joint news conference, Sharon accused the Palestinians
of breaking the Wye agreement, indicating the Palestinian
Authority had not taken security measures.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent clashes between Israeli soldiers
and Palestinians against a background of Palestinians demand that
Israel set free more political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel released the first 250 of promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not
so-called security prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinians will not comply with the Wye agreement,
every part of it, Israel will not be able to continue, although we
would like to. We believe that every step should be taken and
everything should be done on a basis of mutual reciprocity,"
Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President
Bill Clinton intends to go to Israel on Saturday despite
Netanyahu's lack of enthusiasm for the visit.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Promises Not to Privatize Post Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government promised
Monday to set out a new commercial structure for the Post Office
but stopped short of delivering privatization.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson announced the level of profit
the Post Office paid to the Treasury would be cut from 80 percent
to 40 percent, freeing up the difference for investment.
</P>
<P>
He told the Commons an independent regulator would be
established for the post service.
</P>
<P>
"The government's role in the Post Office will be restricted to
the strategic level," he said. "The Post Office board will become
clearly accountable for its success or failure in running the
business."
</P>
<P>
He described his proposals as "the most radical set of reforms
since the modern Post Office was created in 1969."
</P>
<P>
The changes would allow the Post Office to engage in more
commercial activities and end its monopoly status in some areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson added, "We are ushering in the start of a confident,
bright new dawn for the Post Office and are looking to its
management and its workforce to seize the opportunities putting
right the neglect of the past."
</P>
<P>
The Post Office itself welcomed the reform, saying it wanted
more choice for its consumers provided this was balanced by its
own greater commercial freedom.
</P>
<P>
The global market for letters and packages is worth 20 billion
pounds (33 billion U.S. dollars) a year but is increasing and
forecast to reach 57 billion pounds (94 billion dollars) a year by
2010.

<HEADLINE> Vote on Early Elections Bill Put Off in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Israeli legislators postponed
a vote on a bill calling for early elections Monday night, after
Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu engineered a motion of
non-confidence in his own government.
</P>
<P>
By engineering the no-confidence motion, the prime minister has
gained at least one week during which he can try his best to
persuade his hard-line coalition partners not to act against the
government.
</P>
<P>
The motion enabled Netanyahu to avoid an immediate humiliation
which would have been caused by the passage of the bill at its
first reading, Israel Raido reported.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister is also confronted with the danger that
his government will collapse immediately if the no-confidence
motion is approved.
</P>
<P>
The bill seemed likely to be passed by a majority due to the
support of some coalition Knesset (Parliament) members, who
opposed the recent land-for-peace deal which Netanyahu signed with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Washington in October.
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for the dissolution of the Knesset and thus
early elections. Sponsored by the Labor party, it needs a
majority of at least 61 votes in all its three readings before it
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
"I don't wish (early) elections," Netanyahu said to reporters
as he was busy talking with his coalition members in the
Knesset before the bill was scheduled to be presented for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
"But if the majority of the Knesset members don't support
the policy (of the government), that's their choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to members of the Labor-led opposition, those
who sided against Netanyahu included at least four members of
his coalition, including Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed its preliminary reading in late July, just
one day before the Knesset went for a long summer recess.
But that reading needed only a simple majority to be passed.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the bill was originally presented as a protest
over Netanyahu's foot-dragging on the Middle East peace process,
but it is now supported by some of his coalition members because
he has signed a peace deal.
