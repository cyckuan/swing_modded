   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ The band played ``The Eyes of Texas are Upon
You,'' yet nobody who attended George W. Bush's second inauguration
as governor on Jan. 19 could pretend that only Texas was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with a day full of speeches, parades and thousands of
pounds of roasted meat was a buzz of excitement about the future of
Bush, who currently enjoys state approval ratings eclipsing 80
percent and yet, for now, is keeping his presidential aspirations
secret.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bush clan assembled on the platform, Bush used his
inaugural address to build on the idea of ``compassionate
conservatism'' which he introduced on election night last November.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clear attempt both to distance himself from the actions
of his Republican counterparts in Washington and to broaden the
appeal of his party. Bush spoke (in both English and Spanish) of
rallying ``the armies of compassion'' to give hope to all segments
of society.
</P>
<P>
   Extolling the virtues of economic progress, free markets and
free trade, the governor also issued a warning against putting too
much faith in material comforts at the expense of sacrificing
society's moral and spiritual core.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the next 140 days, the length of the Texas legislative
session, to prove that he can make good on these cloudy maxims and
keep some of the policy promises he made during the governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his agenda are plans to cut property taxes and end
``social promotion'' in public schools, whereby students move on to
higher grades without meeting basic standards.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, although over 40,000
children aged nine or ten failed the state's standardized reading
test during the 1996-97 school year, all but 4,400 of them were
promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he is also willing to support school vouchers,
a more controversial scheme both locally and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for Bush, Republicans dominate Texas for the first time
since the Civil War. With a majority in the state senate and, in
Rick Perry, the first Republican lieutenant-governor in Texan
history, the party is well-set to push its agenda through.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, too, have become vocal supporters of Bush,
making it more difficult for a unified Democratic opposition to
block the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush successfully navigates the legislative mine fields over
the coming months, while at the same time defining his political
philosophy for a national audience, he could then activate his
already formidable network of supporters and financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire (still, despite the maneuvers of bigger states,
the starting-point for any presidential campaign) he has a large
group of loyalists simply waiting for his word to start mobilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, in a letter to a supporter in that state, he
requested that the Bush faithful ``keep their powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush keeps his party (and the rest of the country) in
suspense. He muses openly about the effect of a presidential run on
his family life, and his wife candidly admits that she is
reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Hamlet, Bush seems driven to assume a family
responsibility of a different sort: to pick up the standard which
fell when his father, President George Bush, lost his reelection
bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There is a time factor, too. At a press conference on Jan. 20 he
was asked whether, if he decided against running this time around,
he would consider doing so in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   He answered that he was very conscious of ``the tides of
history'' creating ``windows of opportunity.'' ``Should I wait,''
he said, ``the window would probably be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some questions still hover over the governor's past, especially
his reckless youth. Yet, for the time being, Bush can enjoy the
benefits of being an undeclared front-runner without answering the
nagging questions that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There were no allusions to the goings-on in Washington during
his inauguration and, in the 80-degree Austin heat, it was easy to
forget them. Just when President Clinton had to confront his
accusers and jurors to report on the state of the union, Governor
Bush and his First Lady were waltzing across a stage to the
enthusiastic cheers of a crowd decked out in black ties and cowboy
hats. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a speech of rare eloquence, former Sen. Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas concluded the defense of President Clinton on
impeachment charges Thursday night, coupling an admission of
Clinton's sins and weaknesses with a plea for his acquittal for the
good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people now and for some time have been asking to
be allowed a good night's sleep,'' the silver-haired Bumpers told
the 100 senators, who hung on his every word as they very rarely do
for anyone. ``They're asking for an end to this nightmare. It is a
legitimate request.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that James G. Blaine of Maine had concluded, 20 years
after voting to convict President Andrew Johnson in 1868, that he
had ``made a bad mistake,'' because conviction would have created
chaos, Bumpers cautioned: ``So it is with William Jefferson
Clinton. If you vote to convict, in my opinion, you're going to be
creating more havoc than he could ever possibly create. After all,
he's only got two years left.''
</P>
<P>
   His warning gained weight from his excoriation of the
president's conduct with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern. Their illicit sexual affair underlies the two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may not have welcomed Bumpers' description of his
behavior as ``indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, shameless,''
or his acknowledgment that perhaps the president deserved no
compassion. But that surely undercut any thought that he was
standing up for Clinton out of unquestioning friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and discursive, strolling back and forth in the well of
the Senate, not standing stock-still behind a lectern as many
others have done, and eschewing legal fine points, Bumpers
introduced humor into the sober proceedings for the first time in
six tense days. Several of his self-deprecating sallies drew
guffaws. But he also spoke feelingly of the emotional devastation
Clinton has caused to his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons ``have been about as decimated as a family can
get,'' the former senator said, in one of the most explicit
comments any friend has made to date on the psychological toll of
the president's conduct. ``The relationship between husband and
wife, father and child, has been incredibly strained, if not
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers' powerful presentation may or may not have changed many
Republican minds, and Republicans have a majority in the Senate.
But he surely stiffened the backs of any Democrats who may have
thought even fleetingly of deserting the president, and that is all
Clinton ultimately needs _ the votes of 45 Democrats, which would
make it arithmetically impossible for the Senate to muster the
two-thirds vote it needs to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   A highly technical two-hour appearance by the president's
personal attorney, David Kendall, was reduced almost to the status
of a footnote by the Bumpers speech.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Kendall rebutted five separate charges of
obstruction of justice contained in Article II. Many of them were
also covered in Article I, the perjury article, and so Kendall
plowed relatively little new legal ground. His strategy was to
contrast in every instance the sworn testimony of the principals _
Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton's lawyer friend Vernon Jordan Jr.
_ with the ``mere suspicion and speculation'' on which he
disdainfully said the Republicans' circumstantial evidence rested.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the House managers who last week outlined the case
against Clinton of ``a concerted, partisan distortion'' of the
facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint echo of the ill-concealed hostility to the special
prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, that dominated Clinton's defense in
months gone by, Kendall introduced himself with the archly
understated comment ``Since 1993, it has been my privilege to
represent the president in the tortuous and meandering Whitewater
investigation, which approximately a year ago was transformed in a
remarkable way into the Lewinsky investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Acid also crept into his tone when he described Linda Tripp, who
taped conversations with Ms. Lewinsky at the behest of Starr, as
``that paragon of faithful friendship,'' and when he repeatedly
referred to the House managers as ``able'' or ``very able'' while
denouncing their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his presentation dealt at length with Jordan's search
for a job in New York for Ms. Lewinsky, which the Republicans see
as an effort to buy her silence. When he insisted that all of the
executives whom Jordan called told investigators that they felt no
pressure to hire her even though Jordan is universally known as the
president's best buddy, several Republican senators had difficulty
in concealing their disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers began by mocking himself. He said his audience on
Thursday was about the same size as all the audiences he had drawn
in his 24 years as a senator combined. His fourth term expired only
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take some comfort, colleagues, in the fact that I'm
not being paid,'' he said. ``And when I'm finished, you'll probably
think the White House got its money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, spoke caustically of the length and scope of Starr's
``five-year, relentless, unending investigation,'' describing it as
``maybe the most intense investigation not only of a president but
of anybody, ever.'' Javert's pursuit of Jean Valjean in ``Les
Miserables'' ``pales by comparison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, his rhetorical aim was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Bumpers asked, did Clinton, by his own admission deceive
his family, his friends, his Cabinet and the American public?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Bumpers said, answering his own question, ``he knew
this whole affair was about to bring unspeakable embarrassment and
humiliation upon himself, his wife, whom he adored, and a child
that he worshipped with every fiber in his body and for whom he
would happily have died to spare her this or to ameliorate her
shame and her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are none of us perfect. Sure, you say, he should have
thought it all out beforehand, and indeed he should, just as Adam
and Eve should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers responded directly to those, including Rep. Henry Hyde
of Illinois, the chief prosecutor, who have suggested that the
United States is diminished as a force in the world by having ``a
presidential perjurer'' in office. In truth, he said, ``this nation
has never enjoyed greater prestige in the world than we do right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In support, he cited comments made recently by President Carlos
Menem of Argentina, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic,
King Hussein of Jordan, and President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Like others on Clinton's defense team, he took the House
managers to task for having stretched evidence beyond the bounds of
common sense. But he softened his criticism with the comment ``It's
wanting to win too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, who spoke from notes scrawled on a yellow legal pad,
argued at some length that there was perjury and perjury, that some
lies told under oath were worse than others. There is ``a very big
difference,'' he said, between perjury about marital infidelity in
a divorce case and perjury in a murder case about buying the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To charge somebody with the first, and punish them as though
it were the second, stands our sense of justice on its head,'' he
told the senators, many of whom are also lawyers. ``There is a
total lack of proportionality, a total lack of balance in this
thing. The charge and the punishment are totally out of sync.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Bumpers traced the deliberations in Philadelphia in
1787 that produced the Constitution and its impeachment article.
But he added two arguments applicable to the question of whether
impeachment deals with public actions exclusively or both public
and private actions. The Republicans say the latter, and even the
White House counsel, Charles Ruff, said on Tuesday that he could
conceive of impeachable private actions.
</P>
<P>
   Not Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said that the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
whose definition has been so hotly debated, had been found at the
last minute in the English law ``under a category which said
`distinctly political offenses against the state.''' Second, he
said that in the penultimate constitutional draft the words ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' had been followed by the phrase ``against
the United States.'' That phrase was dropped from the final text
for stylistic reasons, he contended, ``because it was redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we doing here,'' Bumpers demanded of the senators.
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine, he urged that Hyde, who suggested that keeping
Clinton in office was an affront to those who fell on battlefields
from Bunker Hill to Saigon, talk to some of the Senate's own
``certified war heroes'' _ John Chafee of Rhode Island, who fought
at Guadalcanal, and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, who lost an arm in
Italy, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who won a Medal of Honor in
Vietnam. None, he implied, shared Hyde's view.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by calling on his former colleagues not to set a
precedent they would regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't, for God's sake, heighten people's alienation that is at
an all-time high toward their government,'' Bumpers said. ``The
people have a right, and they are calling on you to rise above
partisanship. They're calling on you to do your solemn duty. And I
pray you will.''
</P>
<P>
   A question-and-answer period will start Friday and probably run
through Saturday. It is not to exceed 16 hours, and senators are
required to submit all questions in writing, to be put to the
prosecutors and defense lawyers by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, presiding.

NASDAQ HALTS TURBODYNE STOCK TRADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trading in shares of Turbodyne Technologies was
halted Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange, one day after a
European exchange said it will punish the company for allegedly
issuing false and misleading press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Brussels-based Easdaq, Nasdaq's European counterpart, halted
trading in Turbodyne on Wednesday until Feb. 3 after an
investigation by its surveillance unit reportedly uncovered the
alleged wrongdoing. Easdaq said it is considering removing
Turbodyne from the exchange altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday halt triggered an automatic stoppage on Nasdaq on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In its written statement, Easdaq did not identify which
Turbodyne press releases contained the purportedly false or
misleading data but noted that the material was market-sensitive,
meaning it could have influenced investors to buy or sell the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne spokesman Peter Weichselbraun said he did not know
which statements Easdaq alleged were false. Weichselbraun said his
company has been in regular contact with the exchange since October
1998, when a short-selling investor claimed the company owned no
valuable technology.
</P>
<P>
   That claim, by New York-based trader Manuel Asesnio, prompted
Easdaq to request numerous documents from Turbodyne, Weichselbraun
said. ``But it seemed that we did not supply all Easdaq wanted to
see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne manufactures aluminum castings for the automobile
industry and has developed what it says are pollution-reduction
turbochargers for internal-combustion engines. The company in the
past year has announced several retrofitting deals for municipal
buses, mostly in European cities, but continues to generate nearly
all of its revenues from its castings business.
</P>
<P>
   Before the halt in trading, Turbodyne stock closed Wednesday at
$5.34375 per share. Its 52-week high is $17.12, set in July.

<P>
   Back in the summer of 1995, Tom Daschle hit on an idea that now
bears remembering.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was half a year into his job as the Democratic leader in
the Senate, and he was casting about for a way to resist the
formidable momentum of the Republican Contract with America.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of discussions with Mark Mellman, his pollster,
Daschle decided that the Republicans were most vulnerable on the
issue of Medicare, the popular government health program for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the Contract did not actually propose cuts in
Medicare, only cuts in its rate of growth: if Democrats screamed
``Cut!'' loudly enough, electoral comeback seemed certain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ensuing year, all Democrats from President Clinton on
down adopted Daschle's clever ``Mediscare'' idea. It worked
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Contract with America has been replaced, in some ways
at least, by the grand spectacle of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in 1995, the House Republicans have united behind a
radical scheme, and are clamoring for the Republican majority in
the Senate to endorse it. Just as in 1995, the Senate Republicans
may be observed wincing at the zeal of their House counterparts,
but agreeing, more or less, to go along with them.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as in 1995, it falls to Daschle to organize the
Democrats' counterattack. The question is whether Daschle's
spectacular success with Medicare will now be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, Daschle seems unsuited to the role of
saviour-in-chief of the Democratic Party. He is a plain man from
the South Dakota prairie; his staunchest admirers concede that he
is not especially clever or charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   He became the Democrats' leader in the Senate partly thanks to
luck: one opponent lost his seat just before the leadership contest
in 1994, the other challenged him too late to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   He has never given an exciting speech, and stands for no
particular policies. One adviser, asked what motivates the man,
falls silent for a while, then says lamely that he wants to improve
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a curious way, Daschle's plainness distinguishes
him. All senators, the saying goes, see a future president when
they look in the mirror; but Daschle, judging by his appearance as
well as by his controlled ego, uses mirrors sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   He stands out by not trying to stand out; and his modesty
endears him to the big egos that surround him.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues appreciate the fact that Daschle does not hog the
limelight, or put his own image before that of his party; they
trust him to listen to their ideas without rushing to the nearest
microphone to take credit for them.
</P>
<P>
   And so Daschle is able to act as an honest broker, finding
common ground among fellow Democrats in the Senate. In a private
meeting last year, one senior senator declared that ``this little
sucker has done an amazing job of uniting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's quiet skills are now on display in the impeachment
battle. A month ago, the betting was that the Senate Democrats
would speak with many tongues: some would be happy to see Clinton
strung up, others would be determined to obstruct the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, many tongues have spoken: last Sunday, for example,
fully 19 senators popped up on the television talk shows. But,
remarkably, nearly all the Senate's famously independent souls have
conformed to party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want an extended trial with witnesses; Democrats
want a truncated trial without them.
</P>
<P>
   This is an embarrassment for the Republicans, and a victory for
Daschle. At the beginning of this month, Trent Lott, the Republican
leader in the Senate, promised a bipartisan process; and Daschle
encouraged him to believe that this was possible by striking a deal
(despite White House protests) on how the first stage of the trial
should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   But, having staked his credibility on bipartisan comity, Lott
finds himself trapped. He can either cave in to Democratic demands
for a short trial, or he can go ahead without Democratic support _
and so lay himself open to the charge of rank partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Having trapped Lott in this way, Daschle is now torturing him
mercilessly. Lott invited Democrats to attend a meeting with
President Clinton's prosecutors from the House; Daschle declined
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that a bipartisan group work on the prickly issue
of witnesses; Daschle called this premature and refused Democratic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards Daschle was subtly accusing Republicans of
railroading their schemes through the Senate. ``Given the comments
of Republicans, it appears to be inevitable that witnesses will be
deposed,'' he said meekly.
</P>
<P>
   So long as Daschle keeps his caucus together, there is no way
that the Senate's 55 Republicans can muster the 67 votes needed to
remove Clinton from office. Instead, if the Republicans choose to
extend the impeachment trial, they may remove some of themselves
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will see impeachment as a partisan witch-hunt, and may
make their displeasure known at the polls; if this happened in a
big way, the Democrats might even retake control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Next year 13 Republican senators are up for reelection in states
that voted for Clinton in 1996. If the Democrats pick up six seats,
Daschle will become the Senate majority leader. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>

    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   All of which leaves Republicans spitting with fury. Back in
1995, they attempted to enact a Contract with America full of
(mainly) sensible ideas; but, when the Democrats got in the way,
and the Republicans let the government close down rather than give
in, voters rounded on Republicans for their ``extremism.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Republicans are trying a president who has shown
contempt for the law; but, when they suggest that the trial should
involve witnesses, they are seen as ``partisan harpoon-carriers out
of the black pit,'' as one Republican senator puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Daschle, the most effective partisan in both episodes,
is barely noticed. He is so modest, so nice, so unassuming. &QL;

CLIPPERS' MARTIN COMES MARCHING HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Calif. _ Smoke from the NBA post-lockout signing
derby has lifted to reveal what Darrick Martin and the Clippers may
have needed all along:
</P>
<P>
   Each other.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the team itching to make a much-publicized
``upgrade'' at point guard re-signed the '98 model, Martin, to a
one-year deal worth $500,000. He made a jump shot or two more than
$400,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who arrived at College of the Desert just in time for
the opening of training camp, insists he isn't bitter about the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of this business,'' said the former UCLA
star, who waited while the Clippers' flirtation with other
available point guards ran its course. ``I've been able to overcome
obstacles ever since I started playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who averaged 10.6 points and 4.1 assists per game in his
two seasons with the Clippers, is eager to prove he should have
been at the top of the team's shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy proving people wrong,'' said Martin, whose deal
includes what the 5-foot-11 lefty refers to as ```attainable''
incentives. ``I'm not trying to throw anything in anybody's face;
I'm just very happy to have a chance to play and to be able to stay
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his chances of returning to the Clippers were
``50-50'' on Wednesday, with Orlando and Sacramento active in the
bidding. Along with the opportunity to be a starter, conversations
with new coach Chris Ford and Elgin Baylor, the team's vice
president of basketball operations, were key factors in his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In professional sports, you never say `no', you never shut a
door, you never burn a bridge behind you,'' said Ford after the
Clippers' door seemingly closed for Sherman Douglas, a New Jersey
free agent who played for him in Boston and Milwaukee. ``We've
always been talking about Darrick and the possibility of bringing
him back. A lot of people, including himself, didn't think he had
the kind of year he hoped for last year. Hopefully, we can find a
way to bring him back to the way he played his first year here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers now are $3.2 million under the salary cap, and
Baylor didn't rule out the possibility of additional moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to talk to teams,'' said Baylor. ``But the
deals some people wanted to make we didn't find acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Baylor center-power forward Brian Skinner, the Clippers'
choice with the 22nd pick in the 1998 NBA Draft, signed a contract
that pays the $653,000 per season allowed by the league's new
collective bargaining agreement.... James `Hollywood' Robinson
arrived late but was in attendance for the evening practice
Thursday.... The team's five-man, free-agent invitee list includes
former Long Beach State forward Juaquin Hawkins. The others are
veteran NBA guard Scott Brooks (UC Irvine), guard Chris Smith
(UConn), a veteran of foreign hoop wars, 7-0 center Mark Blount
(Pitt) and ex-Nevada-Las Vegas forward (Tyrone Nesby)....
Single-game tickets will go on sale Saturday at noon at the Sports
Arena and at TicketMaster outlets, except those at Robinsons-May.
The Clippers will lower each $15 seat at the Sports Arena and
Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (a combined total of about 5,000 seats)
to $10 for the entire season. Free tickets for the Clippers'
exhibition game with the Lakers on Jan. 30 at the Sports Arena will
also be available then.

<P>
   ANKARA _ Those who criticize Turkey's human-rights record can
take some comfort from the fact that Turks seem to be treating
animals better than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the story of a collie abandoned in the Aegean port of
Izmir was splashed on the front page of a mass-circulation
newspaper, Hurriyet. The dog apparently ``went on hunger strike
because of a broken heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of readers rang up, offering to adopt the unhappy
fellow. Dog-loving, it seems, is the latest fad.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things this is odd because, despite Turkey's
government-enforced secularity, Islam has long frowned on dog
ownership. Orthodox Muslim teaching says that dogs are unhygienic:
they must not be nearby when Muslims pray.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just one reason for many Turks' recent dogginess:
actively secular Turks like to show off their dogs partly to
demonstrate how European they are.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, dogs were, at best, exotic. Some breeds were on
display alongside tigers and giraffes in Ankara's zoo. What changed
the canine status was the Soviet Union's collapse, and the ensuing
influx of Russian suitcase-traders, whose wares included pedigree
puppies going cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred spaniels, Dalmatians and Rottweilers started selling
fast, for as little as $5 a pooch. Enterprising Turks began to
trade in dogs, tripling the Russians' prices but still offering
furry bargains to middle-class Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Pet shops proliferated: there are now 40 or so in Ankara, the
capital, alone, plus 60 dog clinics and three ``dog hotels'' in
case owners have to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The sales boom has given a boost to animal-rights groups, and
politicians have also spotted the trend. New laws to make
maltreatment of animals a crime are going through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There was a burst of public debate this month when it emerged
that fur trappers were using meat laced with arsenic to lure foxes
to their doom.
</P>
<P>
   The latest posters of Mesut Yilmaz, Turkey's recently deposed
prime minister, who hopes to get his job back after the election
due in April, display him alongside not just his family but also
his Great Dane, Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   A popular television program has even shown Turkey's would-be
``first dog'' going into labor and then basking with her new pups:
vote-catchers, so Yilmaz hopes, all seven of them. &QL;

SEAGRAM LAYS OFF HUNDREDS IN UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The long-expected hammer has fallen on about 500
employees at Universal Music Group in the first round of job cuts
at what has become the world's largest music company.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit Thursday were two well-known Hollywood-based labels
that were left with little more than skeleton staffs. A&AMP;M Records
saw about 170 of its 200 employees depart and Geffen Records lost
115 of its 145 employees, according to sources who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts had been rumored for months, dating back to Seagram
Co.'s announcement last spring that it would buy Dutch music giant
PolyGram for $10.4 billion. Specifics began to emerge last month
when Seagram announced it would significantly reduce employment as
part of a reorganization of the new Universal Music Group, placing
its 15 labels in four groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's surprised,'' said a Geffen employee who asked to not
be identified. ``Honestly, it was like we came into work today to
get laid off. Right now, everyone's out celebrating at the Rainbow
Room across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal-based Seagram, which bought control of Universal
Studios and MCA in 1995, announced last month that A&AMP;M and Geffen
would be combined with Los Angeles-based Interscope Records. In
recent weeks, insiders reported, some functions at A&AMP;M and Geffen
were turned over to Interscope employees.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's slashing within its music group is far from over, with
the next round expected to start within seven to 10 days, possibly
targeting the sales staff. Further moves could cut up to 2,500 of
the remaining 15,000 jobs in the combined music-group work force, a
level of layoffs needed to meet Seagram's goal of generating $300
million in annual cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives, including A&AMP;M chief Al Cafaro and Geffen
chairman Eddie Rosenblatt, began receiving departure notices
earlier this week. On Thursday, which had been dubbed ``D-Day,''
most affected employees received pink slips on arriving at work and
were asked to clear out by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's headquarters on La Brea Avenue and Geffen's on Sunset
Boulevard are expected to be put up for sale shortly.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M, founded in a garage in 1963 by trumpeter Herb Alpert and
Jerry Moss to sell Tijuana Brass albums, was sold to PolyGram in
1990 for $700 million. Key artists expected to remain include
Sting, Sheryl Crow and Bryan Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen was launched in 1980 by entertainment mogul David Geffen
and sold to MCA in 1990 for $550 million. Top acts include Beck,
Hole and Guns n' Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Deep cuts also came Thursday in New York as Island lost half of
its 100 employees, Mercury saw 90 of its 150 staffers let go and
Motown's work force dropped from 75 to about a dozen. Island and
Mercury are being combined with Def Jam, while Motown will become
part of Universal Records.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said no decisions have been made on dropping acts from
rosters but speculation has placed the number of cuts as high as
250. Rumors emerged that cuts would include any act that failed to
sell at least 200,000 copies of its most recent album.

   ANKARA _ Those who criticize Turkey's human-rights record can
take some comfort from the fact that Turks seem to be treating
animals better than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the story of a collie abandoned in the Aegean port of
Izmir was splashed on the front page of a mass-circulation
newspaper, Hurriyet. The dog apparently ``went on hunger strike
because of a broken heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of readers rang up, offering to adopt the unhappy
fellow. Dog-loving, it seems, is the latest fad.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things this is odd because, despite Turkey's
government-enforced secularity, Islam has long frowned on dog
ownership. Orthodox Muslim teaching says that dogs are unhygienic:
they must not be nearby when Muslims pray.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just one reason for many Turks' recent dogginess:
actively secular Turks like to show off their dogs partly to
demonstrate how European they are.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, dogs were, at best, exotic. Some breeds were on
display alongside tigers and giraffes in Ankara's zoo. What changed
the canine status was the Soviet Union's collapse, and the ensuing
influx of Russian suitcase-traders, whose wares included pedigree
puppies going cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred spaniels, Dalmatians and Rottweilers started selling
fast, for as little as $5 a pooch. Enterprising Turks began to
trade in dogs, tripling the Russians' prices but still offering
furry bargains to middle-class Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Pet shops proliferated: there are now 40 or so in Ankara, the
capital, alone, plus 60 dog clinics and three ``dog hotels'' in
case owners have to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The sales boom has given a boost to animal-rights groups, and
politicians have also spotted the trend. New laws to make
maltreatment of animals a crime are going through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There was a burst of public debate this month when it emerged
that fur trappers were using meat laced with arsenic to lure foxes
to their doom.
</P>
<P>
   The latest posters of Mesut Yilmaz, Turkey's recently deposed
prime minister, who hopes to get his job back after the election
due in April, display him alongside not just his family but also
his Great Dane, Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   A popular television program has even shown Turkey's would-be
``first dog'' going into labor and then basking with her new pups:
vote-catchers, so Yilmaz hopes, all seven of them. &QL;

ROBERTSON'S REMARKS DRAW FIRE AT CONSERVATIVE PAC MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 2nd graf to correct `Conservative Political Action COMMITTEE'
to `Conservative Political Action CONFERENCE'; adds editorial
refinements to last sentence of that graf. No other changes.) 
(ATTN: Va.) (bl) 
By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Pat Robertson's remarks that the impeachment
trial might as well be halted set off a firestorm among
conservatives meeting here Thursday. They condemned the television
evangelist and asserted that Republicans should not retreat from a
full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were indications at the annual conference of the
Conservative Political Action Conference that some of the most
vociferous detractors of President Clinton are pulling back from
the impeachment controversy. Few of the speakers concentrated on
impeachment or on the president's ethics _ a departure from similar
gatherings recently. Two candidates running for the Republican
presidential nomination _ the publisher Steve Forbes and former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander _ preferred to take shots at the
early front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, rather than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And several conservatives at the convention _ the same setting
where Paula Jones first emerged in 1994 to tell reporters that she
fended off a sexual advance from Clinton _ said they shared
Robertson's impatience with how the White House scandal has
dominated the capital. For example, Joyce Terry, a retired nurse
from Woodbridge, Va., said she agreed with him: ``That's my
concern. I feel they should move a little faster. They know the
facts. They know what's going on. Let's get with it and get it over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those misgivings, the overwhelming sentiment of dozens
of rank-and-file conservatives and their leaders was that the
Senate has a duty to pursue Clinton no matter the political
consequences. Most people said they were puzzled _ if not outraged
_ by the comments Wednesday by Robertson, the chairman of the
Christian Coalition, that Clinton had won ``from a public relations
standpoint'' and ``they might as well dismiss'' the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pat Robertson said, in fact, it's time for the Republicans
to give up _ and give in _ to Clinton, my membership in the
Christian Coalition is over,'' said Hazel Staloff, a computer
worker from Brooklyn. ``I don't think the party can be hurt when it
stands for what is right. It can only be hurt when it compromises
with evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Kroeger, a former staff member in the Reagan White
House, said of Robertson, ``I think he should have kept quiet
because he carried a lot of weight with conservatives. I don't know
why he said that because Congress has a duty there. To drop it,
where does that leave us?''
</P>
<P>
   The feelings of this potent wing of the Republican Party are
important because many politicians, particularly in competitive
races, are loath to alienate conservatives whom they need to get
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river at the Capitol, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the
lead prosecutor, said Robertson's comments ``shows that we're not
tools of the Christian Right. We don't necessarily always agree
with everything that Pat Robertson says.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Robertson sought to defend his comments on his television
program, ``The 700 Club'': ``What I was saying essentially is that
the president scored a public-relations triumph, and the
Republicans in the Congress gave him the platform to do that, and
consequently they undercut their own authority.'' He added: ``In a
sense, it's like saying it's the third quarter and the score is 50
to nothing and there's another quarter to play. The outcome seems
at this point settled, but I wasn't saying I favored that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, many participants at this conference said they
favored a full trial with a parade of witnesses. ``It doesn't
matter to me if it goes on for a year,'' said Dan O'Brien of Falls
Church, who teaches character to corporate executives. ``I'm not
deceived by the notion that the country's going to stop running
because of the impeachment trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingling among vendors selling T-shirts with slogans such as
``Another Member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,'' Preston
Noell, who heads a Catholic civic organization said he was eager
for the Senate to delve deeper into the impeachment matter. ``I'm
not sick and tired of it,'' he said. ``I don't think it's gotten
going yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, an outspoken conservative who
addressed the convention, said of Robertson after her speech: ``I
was surprised. We wouldn't have even fought the war of independence
if we had taken a poll.''
</P>
<P>
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said
flatly of Robertson: ``He's wrong.'' But he conceded that
``conservatives are of two minds _ they want it to go through the
process, but they'd like it to be over to the extent that it's all
that's talked about. Conservatives have always won when we can make
divisions based on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates also stayed relatively clear of
Clinton. Without mentioning him directly, Forbes assailed Bush and
his ``compassionate conservative'' ideology, saying,
``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no substitute
for a muscular substantive agenda.'' Forbes and Alexander also
attacked Bush by criticizing his father, former President George
Bush, and his slogan about a ``kinder and gentler'' America.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a social conservative who is also preparing to run
for president, took issue with Robertson in an interview. ``There
are two issues that ought never have to do with PR,'' he said.
``Declaring war and the profound question of whether the president
has violated the Constitution.''

NUMMINEN TO START IN ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defenseman Teppo Numminen became the first Coyotes player in
franchise history to be named a starter in Sunday's NHL All-Star
Game when he was selected to replace injured Detroit defenseman Uwe
Krupp on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen joins World All-Stars Teemu Selanne of Anaheim; Peter
Forsberg of Colorado; Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh; Nicklas Lidstrom
of Detroit; and Dominik Hasek of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp had earned a starting spot in NHL All-Star balloting.
Numminen was selected by the NHL's hockey operations department,
after consultation with the league's general managers.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, who is making his All-Star Game debut, leads Coyotes
defensemen in scoring with 24 points. He has appeared in 256
consecutive regular-season games, the longest current streak among
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Ice
Palace in Tampa. &QL;

When you've spent most of your career in the minor leagues,
everything about the NHL seems faster. Including road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually travel everywhere by bus,'' said center Trevor
Letowski, who was recalled from the American Hockey League
affiliate in Springfield, Mass., on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 21-year-old's third trip to the Coyotes since making
his NHL debut on Jan. 1. Not that he's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come for a day or a week or a month, it's all exciting
and part of the learning experience,'' Letowski said. ``I try not
to take it hard when I'm sent back. I look at it as when I'm here,
it's good for me, a bonus. I'll just keep taking little steps, and
maybe one day I'll be a regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Letowski, who was the Coyotes' sixth pick in the 1996 draft,
lasted about a day and a half during his first call-up. His second
visit kept him with the team a week, from Jan. 10-17.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his only goal on Jan. 13 against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like him. That's why he keeps coming back,'' Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``He has real good hockey sense. That's Number 1.
That's very difficult if not impossible to teach. He has good
vision of the ice, so that makes him a good playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's very quick with his deceptive shots. He's a real good
goal scorer at the American League level and potentially at this
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Letowski's quickness helps compensate for his lack of size (5
feet 10, 173 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``The game's definitely a lot quicker up here,'' he said. ``But
the biggest difference that I've noticed is the work ethic. Guys
are always going 100 percent.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Record pace &QL; 
 &QL; 
The team's 24 victories entering Thursday's game are the most at
the season's midway point in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The previous best was 19 set by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1984-85
and 1985-86 seasons. Those teams finished with 43 and 40
victories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick checks &QL; 
 &QL; 
Anaheim left wing and former Coyote Jim McKenzie missed his fifth
straight game Thursday because of a cut above his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center Bob Corkum (hip flexor) and left wing Brad
Isbister (groin strain) did not return to the lineup Thursday and
will take advantage of the All-Star break to heal.

ROBINSON HOPES BREAK REJUVENATES TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Los Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson said
Thursday he is hoping the All-Star break will rejuvenate his
players, not just physically but mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have nagging injuries and their groins are a little
tight,'' Robinson said. ``It's a great time for them to get a
little break and get away from the rink.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he may try to give his players more time away from
the ice when the season resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get stale,'' he said. ``And how many different ways can
you explain the game of hockey? If you just keep harping on them,
doing the same things, after awhile you do get stale. It's great to
get away from the rink once in awhile. We're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of practices on some days, Robinson said the Kings may
work on weight training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes don't lose their conditioning in one day,'' he said.
``We're going to look at doing a lot of gym work, especially guys
who play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Tipsy (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   After he scored his 500th goal earlier in the month, Luc
Robitaille's teammates presented him with a home-entertainment
system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Robitaille returned the favor by showing up at
the dressing room with Dom Perignon, which unfortunately for the
Kings is not the name of a high-scoring forward but a fancy brand
of champagne. Robitaille gave each of his teammates a bottle of
bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have been great,'' Robitaille said. ``I was trying to
think what to get them. What do you get guys who have everything?''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille gave them the champagne with one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   Said Robitaille, ``I told them, `Not on game day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring drought: The Kings' defensemen entered play Thursday
with a combined 10 goals, among the fewest of any team in the
league and two fewer than Dallas' Darryl Sydor (an ex-King) and St.
Louis' Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have more rounded goal-scoring,'' said Rob
Blake, who began the night leading Kings defensemen with three
goals despite missing 18 games this season due to injury and
suspension. ``Right now, the only guy scoring consistently is
Luc.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake led NHL defensemen with 23 goals last season, 11 on the
power play. Asked about his drop in goal scoring this year, Blake
said, ``Most of my goals come on the power play, and the power play
hasn't been that good. You need your defensemen scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he tough enough?: Robinson said this week that he has
questioned whether he is hard enough on his players, but Blake said
he doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry can say all he wants,'' Blake said, ``but it's up to the
guys on the ice to do it.''

<P>
   There are fantasy camps, army camps, summer camps and the
Republican camp. Just when you think you've seen them all, along
come the Suns. They are about to go camping in a strange,
unexpected way. It's no place to pitch a tent. More like a fit.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Camp Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are about to embark on the very difficult task of
preparing for a 50-game season.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty starts with the beginning. The Suns plan to open
training camp today. That's a day late. Practice was canceled on
the first day that NBA teams were allowed to start practicing.
That's not a promising sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns weren't the only team to sit out the opening day of
business after the lockout. The Chicago Bulls, post-Michael Jordan,
joined them on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a matter of manpower. On Thursday, the Suns
simply didn't have enough. With only Jason Kidd, Danny Manning and
Luc Longley under contract, the Suns didn't have enough bodies for
shirts vs. skins.
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge and assistants Scott Skiles and Frank
Johnson could boost the number to six for some three-on-three
scrimmaging. But they aren't planning to be player-coaches. Not
yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost humorous,'' Ainge said Thursday amid the bizarre
twists of Antonio McDyess' hesitancy to sign a contract in Denver.
``It's funny, but it can be hard to laugh if you're in my position.
I don't know what else to do except cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either that, or I just find myself laughing a lot lately.
I'm going: `Where am I? ``The Twilight Zone''?' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at least, Ainge had no idea whether his roster
would include McDyess, or Tom Gugliotta, or Rod Serling. He was not
able to schedule a practice because NBA rules prohibit organized
workouts with unsigned players.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent guard Rex Chapman and rookies Pat Garrity and Toby
Bailey have been in town. They are expected to sign but can't until
the McDyess-Gugliotta saga is settled.
</P>
<P>
   There are further indications that the Suns have designated
players who they expect to complete the roster. Chapman, Garrity,
Bailey, George McCloud, Horacio Llamas, Marko Milic and Gerald
Brown underwent physicals Thursday. That is the first step toward
signing a contract. But, they, too are waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating,'' said Garrity, a first-round pick from
Notre Dame. ``Actually, annoying is a better word. For a first-year
player, there's just no way of knowing what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity doesn't even have the comfort of asking veterans for
advice on what a rookie can expect in camp. There never has been a
camp quite like the one that is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   For Ainge, there's the further frustration of watching a summer
full of work get trashed. Ainge said he and his staff had planned
every detail of camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had practice schedules and drills, everything like that,''
he said. ``We were more than prepared.'' Much of Ainge's planning
was based on the assumption that McDyess would return. With him,
the team would revolve around a fast-paced game with an emphasis on
Kidd's passing and his high-flying dunks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gugliotta moves into the lineup, the philosophy may take
a turn toward a more deliberate, half-court style.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the roster's makeup, at this point the Suns appear to
be caught in a losing battle with time. NBA training camps are the
place where teams develop cohesion. But at this point, the Suns
have an unknown roster and only two weeks to get ready for their
season opener on Feb. 5 against the Clippers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a little bit of a struggle out of the gate,''
Suns President Jerry Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The hectic negotiations have left Ainge with little time to
consider training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly have not given it (camp) a thought yet,'' said
Ainge, who intends to conduct two-a-day practices throughout camp.
``I had everything planned. But now, we are on such a fly. It just
depends on when we can get together and when I can have all my
signed guys on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when that will that be, or how that will be. I'm
just going to have to adjust on the run. Hopefully, we'll have a
team running up and down the floor within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a zoo, or what?'' &QL;

L.A. LAND DEVELOPER HAS RECORD YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A surging real estate market propelled The
Newhall Land and Farming Company to its best sales year ever in
1998, the developer said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said on Thursday it sold a record number of
residential and industrial lots at prices well above 1997 appraised
values.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Newhall Land's net income increased
44 percent to $64.1 million, or $1.86 per partnership unit. This
compares with net income of $44.5 million, or $1.28 per unit, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues soared 47 percent to $304.7 million. Newhall Land's
sales were $207.7 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's revenues got a big boost from the second-quarter
sale of the Valencia Marketplace to Samuel S. Mevorach, a private
investor, for $111 million. The deal contributed $98 million to
revenues and $35 million, or $1.02 per unit, to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Newhall Land earned $1.8 million, or 5
cents per partnership unit, on revenues of $53.6 million. In the
1997 fourth quarter, the company earned $4.3 million, or 12 cents
per unit, on revenues of $55.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter results just about matched analysts expectations
on a per unit basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they have some good things in line for 1999 but
probably not much in the way of closings for the first half of the
year. It doesn't look like they have very much in escrow right
now,'' said Katherine Flores, an analyst at Sutro &AMP; Co. in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings probably will be weighted toward the third and fourth
quarters, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the industrial side of the ledger, Newhall Land closed escrow
on 111 acres, with some parcels fetching the highest price ever per
square foot for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow also closed on 1,232 residential lots and homes in
Valencia, the most in the community's history, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest single contributor to our record year was the
strategic sale of Valencia Marketplace,'' Thomas L. Lee, Newhall
Land's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
``Each of our core real estate segments -- residential, commercial
and industrial -- is benefiting from California's growing
diversified economy, low interest rates and a population expected
to increase by almost 18 million people over the next two
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the area is well-positioned to take advantage of
future growth trends, and continued development of industrial and
office-space parcels will create synergy with the housing and
retail markets.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land plans to complete about 150,000 square feet of
retail and office space along Town Center Drive. It will also
market about 1,400 residential lots this year, a key step in
reaching an annual absorption rate in Valencia of 1,500 homes,
including apartments, by year's end.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that it is ``highly
likely'' that a terrorist group will launch or threaten a germ or
chemical attack on U.S. soil within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Oval Office late in the day, Clinton said
he had been persuaded by intelligence reports that the United
States needs to bolster its defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to raise public awareness of this,'' the president said
in the 45-minute interview, ``without throwing people into
unnecessary panic. ''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted Americans ``not to be afraid or asleep. I
think that's the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Without providing specifics, Clinton warned that any attack with
germ or chemical weapons would prompt ``at least a proportionate if
not a disproportionate response.'' The United States has signed
treaties not to use chemical or germ weapons. He made the
assertions as the White House disclosed that the administration
planned to ask Congress for $2.8 billion in the next budget year to
fight terrorists armed with such unconventional weapons as deadly
germs, chemicals and electronic devices. Clinton insisted during
the interview that his drive to expand the budget for these
programs was rooted in the growing danger of such threats.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on some of the initiatives he intends to unveil on
Friday, Clinton said he is weighing a proposal from the Defense
Department to establish a commander in chief for the defense of the
continental United States, a step that civil liberties groups
strongly resist.
</P>
<P>
   Such a step would go far beyond the civil defense measures and
bomb shelters that marked the Cold War, setting up instead a
military leadership to help fight chaos and disarray if an attack
occurred. Pentagon commanders oversee regions around the globe, but
not the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear such moves could open the door to rising military
influence and a loss of individual rights, but Clinton insisted
that such erosions would never occur, even while acknowledging the
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to preserve civil liberties, resolve all doubt in
favor of that, and if there's a question, bring it to me,'' Clinton
said, while acknowledging there were specific concerns in areas
like computer security. He did not offer details on how he would
insure protection.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave the interview as his lawyers ended their
defense presentation at his impeachment trial in the Senate. Since
the Monica Lewinsky issue surfaced a year ago, the president has
given almost no interviews to major U.S. news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very end of the interview, he answered one question
related to impeachment by agreeing that the impeachment ordeal had
placed a great strain on his family and by expressing the hope that
the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political pressures, Clinton appeared relaxed and
deeply engaged in the complex scientific and policy issues raised
by what the White House has called 21st-century threats. He smiled
repeatedly, yet spoke of spending sleepless nights pondering new
security challenges after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new considerations, Clinton said he is weighing a
proposal to give anthrax vaccinations to police, fire, public
health, and other emergency officials in cities throughout the
country. That would be in addition to the current drive to
vaccinate more than 2 million soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say whether he himself had been vaccinated
against deadly germ agents, saying that the Secret Service had
advised him to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed to forge ahead despite congressional criticism
with cooperative programs with Russia aimed at providing jobs to
some 8,000 former weapons scientists who might otherwise be tempted
to work with rogue states or terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs he will highlight on Friday are developing
new vaccines, stockpiling antibiotics, and setting up emergency
medical teams in major cities and a corps of computer experts who
could respond quickly to electronic attacks.

 WASHINGTON: electronic attacks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his presidency under fire, it is unclear how much of the
proposed $2.8 billion in military funds and programs Clinton will
be able to get through the Republican-dominated Congress. But
lawmakers have usually supported White House efforts to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that of all the new threats, the one that ``keeps
me awake at night'' is the possibility of germ attack. ``A chemical
attack would be horrible, but it would be finite,'' he said, adding
that it would not spread. But a biological attack could spread, he
added, ``kind of like the gift that keeps on giving.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's presidency, terrorism has emerged as one of the
nation's thorniest security challenges, its dangers more diffuse
than those of the Cold War yet more immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had begun worrying about biological terrorism
and other unconventional threats six years ago, in February 1993,
after Islamic radicals exploded a bomb under the World Trade Center
in New York. The bombing one month after he came into office killed
six people and injured more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said his concerns about the danger of germ or chemical attack
were deepened by the Oklahoma City bombing, terrorist attacks in
the Middle East and Africa on U.S. embassies and facilities, and
reports that Iraq had retained some chemical weapons it claimed to
have destroyed. Clinton said he was also troubled by the activities
of a Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo, which attacked the Tokyo subway
system in 1995 with a nerve agent, killing 12 and injuring 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said terrorists were probably a greater danger than rogue
states which would be afraid to openly attack U.S. targets for fear
of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive who is accused
of masterminding the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa in August, has
``made an effort to get chemical weapons'' and ``may have'' tried
to get germ weapons. ``We don't know that they have them,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``a lot of what we've done already,'' some of it
secret, ``has delayed'' foreign efforts to develop and deploy
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ultimately, the best defense against unconventional
warfare and biological terrorism in particular would be scientific
strides in deciphering the genetic material in microbes and humans,
so vaccines could be tailored for quick response to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, would allow the defense to stay ahead of the
offense. His hope, he said, was that the United States would use
``each new wave of technology to close the gap between offense and
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he endorsed the Human Genome Project, a costly
federally funded effort to map human genetic material, saying it
would be an important part of the shield that his administration is
building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal interest in the threat, aides agree, has
become a powerful force behind secret meetings, actions and
directives meant to bolster antiterrorism work and to counter what
aides describe as a growing danger to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The budget outlined by the White House Thursday, to be formally
presented by the president on Friday at the National Academy of
Sciences, includes $10 billion to defend against terrorism, weapons
of mass destruction and ``cyber attacks,'' according to the White
House statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money _ about $8.5 billion _ is earmarked for the
defense of American embassies and other buildings and personnel
against conventional weapons like car and truck bombs. The rest is
divided among existing and new programs to counter biological,
chemical and computer attacks, especially those that could cripple
key parts of the government or the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted in the interview that such money would be
``well spent,'' despite detractors and skeptics of the new exotic
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the administration has almost doubled
the money spent to protect Americans against attacks with
unconventional weapons. In fiscal 1998, this budget was $770
million; in the new budget, it rises to $1,336 million.

NO STYLE POINTS, BUT ASU HANGS ON 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-ARIZ STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning no points for style, the Arizona State women's
basketball team came up with two critical defensive stops down the
stretch to edge Oregon State, 57-53, on Thursday night at Wells
Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (8-7, 2-4 Pac-10) won its first conference game at home in
advance of a 7 p.m. Saturday meeting with Oregon (14-4, 5-2), which
moved into the Associated Press national ranking at No. 25 this
week and promptly lost to Arizona, 78-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it with defense,'' ASU Coach Charli Turner Thorne said.
``We did focus on defensive mentality this week, that when we play
good defense consistently we're going to blow teams out.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen _ ASU lost a nine-point lead in the final
6:11 of the first half to fall into a halftime tie _ but the Sun
Devils were able to lead for the final 12:42 and most of all stifle
the Beavers (10-6, 2-5) at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 54-51, coming out of a timeout at 1:07, ASU forced Oregon
State to work the perimeter until Vanessa Morris missed a running
15-footer. The Sun Devils' Kristine Sand had good rebound position
and was fouled by Ericka Brosterhous, her fifth, but made only 1 of
2 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern then repeated: Morris missing a wild bomb, and
Oregon State's Sissel Pierce fouling Rachel Holt as they went for
the rebound. Holt, with 17 points, made 1 of 2 to put ASU up,
56-51, with 22.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Syesha Thomas, a 5-foot-6 senior guard who bothered ASU while
only playing 13 minutes, blew past Kitch Kitchen for a layup at the
14-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State pressed off a timeout, but Arnold fouled before ASU
could inbounds. Kitchen made one of her free throws to clinch the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the stops we needed in the second half,'' Holt said.
``We still need to work together in attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 Holt, for instance, got only seven shots and made six.
Including her, the Sun Devils shot 33.3 percent and were outscored
by four buckets. Without her, that percentage drops to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do a better job of getting her (Holt) more
looks,'' Turner Thorne said. ``We've got a lot of good scorers, but
we need to be a little smarter and see her a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Sun Devils had only 19 turnovers, nine fewer
than their average in conference games and one less than the
Beavers. They went into the game at a minus-7 in turnover margin in
the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guard is not confident of making that pass, I'd rather
not have her make it,'' Turner Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has four consecutive wins over Oregon State, its first
streak of that length against a Pac-10 opponent since the 1992 and
1993 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas led the Beavers with 11 points as she and Felicia
Ragland, with 10 points, were much more effective than the Wiersma
twins, Chassie and Cherrith, who combined for nine points. &QL;

JUST A LITTLE INDECISIVE, AREN'T WE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Antonio:
</P>
<P>
   So, what's up?
</P>
<P>
   I was in our office Thursday reading the sports wire when the
strangest thing happened. The AP moved an advisory: ``The Antonio
McDyess news'' ``conference scheduled for 3 p.m. in Denver has been
rescheduled for 5:30''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we learn it has been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   How long is indefinitely?
</P>
<P>
   What's the delay?
</P>
<P>
   Did a snowstorm hit Denver?
</P>
<P>
   Getting cold feet?
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a done deal. Jerry Colangelo conceded as
much through clenched teeth Wednesday night. Danny Ainge looked
like he was ready to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody said your mind was made up. Your friends and your
agents convinced you that you belong back in Denver. The money the
Nuggets have offered is less than you could make with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   But money isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is winning, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets aren't the Broncos, or the Rockies or the Avalanche.
There must be a comfort level playing for the No. 4 pro team in
town.
</P>
<P>
   That must have been some scene at McNichols Arena, with people
sitting there, expectantly, waiting, glancing at their watches,
wondering as time passed, ``What's going on? Where ``is'' he?''
</P>
<P>
   That's like the groom not showing up for his wedding. How mad is
Dan Issel? The Nuggets GM must feel like the father of the bride.
</P>
<P>
   What did you tell him?
</P>
<P>
   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember anything quite like this. But then Thursday was
like no other day in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone re-signed with Utah and ``cried.'' The world
champion Chicago Bulls disbanded. It was like watching the breakup
of the Soviet Union. Scottie Pippen went to Houston. In return, the
Bulls got Roy Rogers, who I thought was dead, and a horse to be
named later.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will join Charles Barkley in Houston. Barkley reportedly
signed with the Rockets while playing out of a sand trap at the Bob
Hope Classic in Palm Springs. The Chuckster will get $1 million
this season. And two strokes per side.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, who is either married or single, confirmed he
will play this season, too. Maybe. Somewhere. Sometime. He will
discuss his future tonight on TV with Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Suns signed Luc.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're praying they can close the deal and acquire the
letter ``k.''
</P>
<P>
   With you in Denver, the Suns know they need Luc Longley and Luck
_ and Tom Gugliotta _ if they hope to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Suns don't know ``what'' to do. Because they
``still'' don't know what ``you're'' going to do.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   Can't you decide?
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta flew to Phoenix on Thursday night. Do you expect the
Suns to stall the Minnesota free agent while you try to make up
your mind? Imagine Bryan and Jerry Colangelo and Gugliotta seated
around a table after a big Italian dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta: ``Wonderful. I'm stuffed. Well, where do I sign?''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan: ``Tom, how about coffee?''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta: ``No, thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Another dessert?''
</P>
<P>
   What's with you, Antonio? You know what Denver's offer is. Are
you having second thoughts because the Nuggets didn't tell you they
were renouncing the rights to your friend, LaPhonso Ellis? Is
``that'' what this is about?
</P>
<P>
   What do you want? Do you want to play in Phoenix? If so, a lot
of fans here would tell you to forget it. If you're this
indecisive, this uncommitted, then stay in Denver. The Suns would
be better off without you.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'm more forgiving. To me, this is where you should be.
Where you belong. Remember when you arrived last year? Ainge said
you and Jason Kidd are the future of the Suns. ``They can grow
together for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right.
</P>
<P>
   But it's your decision.
</P>
<P>
   Be a man. Make it. &QL;

MCCLENATHAN STEERS TOWARD TOP FUEL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If this is the season Cory McClenathan finally escapes another
driver's shadow, it all begins today in the ``Hot Rod Magazine''
PRO National Time trials at Firebird International Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event, which ends Sunday with final eliminations
beginning at 11 a.m., has attracted several National Hot Rod
Association Top Fuel, Funny Car and Pro Stock drivers searching for
last-minute clues on how best to approach the Feb. 7 season opener
at Pomona, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers committed to the Firebird event include John
Force, Eddie Hill, brothers Cruz and Tony Pedregon, Mike Dunn, Whit
Bazemore, Dean Skuza, Doug Herbert, Del Worsham and Gary Densham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking for the same thing, which is to go quick and
fast,'' said McClenathan, a four-time Top Fuel runner-up. ``We'll
be testing a different fuel pump, a different blower and different
tuning deals. The chassis also is a little different. The body is
probably three or four inches higher in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make a couple easy passes at first. We want to make sure
the new car is working like we want it too. By Sunday, I think
we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending NHRA Top Fuel champion Gary Scelzi,
McClenathan said, has set the current benchmark, forcing other
teams to beef up their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to Pomona, you want to be on top of your game
because it seems like nowadays we're counting points from right out
of the box,'' said McClenathan, driver of the Joe Gibbs-owned
dragster. ``It's just so competitive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the Winston car (Scelzi) is running really
big speeds. And look at (Joe) Amato and Bernstein. Bernstein
really, really came on strong toward end of the season, so (crew
chief) Lee Beard is doing some good things over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do. We have to become more consistent
in terms of (elapsed time) and speed. It used to be you'd get one
and not the other. We'd like to find both. We need to make a good
run in the middle of the track and also run in the 320 (mph) range
at the end of track.'' &QL;

DODGERS DELAY DECISION  
 LIKE FT. MCDOWELL, BUT WANT 2 MONTHS  
</HEADLINE>
  LEAGUE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL SOWERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Dodgers official says plans for a $20 million
spring training camp on the Fort McDowell Indian Community east of
Phoenix ``look fantastic'' but said the team probably won't make a
decision on relocating to the reservation for two months.
</P>
<P>
   That is disappointing news to tribal officials who were hoping
for an answer in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,500-member tribe, which has used generous casino profits
to build new homes and medical facilities on the reservation, now
wants to cash in on the Cactus League.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Council President Clinton Pattea has said the community
can't predict the future of gaming and must find other profitable
enterprises to sustain the tribe's new-found prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the tribe in November proposed the Fort McDowell
Four Peaks Sports Complex, a 12,000-seat stadium and six practice
fields, to lure the Dodgers out of Vero Beach, Fla., where they
have trained since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's proposal promises to have the six practice fields
ready for spring training in 2000. The stadium and five more
practice fields would be built over the next two years. Should the
tribe lure another team to share the facility with the Dodgers,
five more fields would be built and the cost would rise to
approximately $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilbert Jones, a longtime tribal council member, said if the
decision lags too long, ``we won't be able to make that date.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the tribe's business moves hinge on the Dodgers'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe recently announced plans to build a 250-room hotel and
18-hole golf course. But Jones said that if the Dodgers come, the
tribe will need to double the size of both.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wymbs, the team's special projects director, said the
Dodgers were impressed by the tribe's plans and the proposed
training facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's proposed training facility was designed by the HOK
architectural firm, which has designed major league stadiums around
the country and spring training facilities in Peoria and
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the team's enthusiasm, Wymbs said, ``We're still a
couple of months away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to gauge as to a definite time. There are a
lot of issues involved. There are the potential lease terms and the
shoring up of funding to be considered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pattea said tribal casino profits could build the camp or be
used as collateral for loans. He said the tribe also may sell bonds
to help pay for the stadium, practice fields and clubhouse. The
tribe would build the facility at no cost to the team and share in
revenue generated by stadium events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money part is no problem,'' Jones said. ``Our investment
firm has done a great job for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have considered other sites in Arizona and Las Vegas
but have narrowed their choices to Fort McDowell, whose training
facility would include a view of the Four Peaks Mountains and would
be one mile from the Verde River, or staying in Vero Beach. They
are considering the move because the Cactus League makes more sense
geographically than continuing to train in Florida. All four of the
Dodgers' rivals in the National League West _ Diamondbacks, San
Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies _ conduct
their training in Arizona, as do the American League's three West
Coast teams: the Anaheim Angels, Oakland Athletics and Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The team will report for spring training in Vero Beach in
mid-February in preparation for its April 5 regular season opener
against the Diamondbacks in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Wymbs said, the team's owners, Fox Broadcasting and
publication mogul Rupert Murdoch, are considering renovating Dodger
Stadium, which would be another large project.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Peterson, a marketing executive for US West, said the
Valley's business community is excited about the prospect that the
Dodgers will relocate their spring home to Fort McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are keeping our fingers crossed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US West hosted a November meeting among the Dodgers, other
businesses and Fort McDowell and wants to be the training camp's
most visible corporate backer. &QL;

EXPERT EXAMINING CHEST SUPPOSEDLY LEFT IN GOLD RUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With new doubts raised about the authenticity of a
battered chest found in Death Valley, a National Park Service
expert painstakingly examined its contents Thursday to determine if
they were really left behind 150 years ago by a lost Gold Rush
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Western Archeological and Conservation Center conservator
Gretchen Voaxs began analyzing the objects _ including gold and
silver coins, ceramic bowls and a flintlock pistol _ at about 9
a.m., but no word was released on her findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably going to be a million questions from all of
us as to what should be our next step,'' said Terry Baldino,
supervisory ranger at Death Valley National Park's main visitors
center.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials said it's likely that scientific analysis
will be necessary to verify the find, made by archeologist Jerry
Freeman of Pearblossom as he researched the possible route taken by
the lost gold miners trying to escape Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one noted Death Valley authority expressed new doubts
about the chest's authenticity because of a term _ ``grubstake'' _
used in a list of its contents purportedly written by pioneer
William Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   A gold seeker of the time would never have called the $52.75
left in the chest a grubstake, a concept that developed in the
waning years of the Gold Rush, said Richard Lingenfelter, a
research physicist at the University of California, San Diego, who
in 1986 wrote a comprehensive history of Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants, not wanting to be left behind as miners left
played-out gold fields in search of richer strikes, were willing to
provide supplies and food, or grub, for a stake in whatever was
found, Lingenfelter said. The earliest reference he has seen to the
term came from the late 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my way of thinking ... him writing `grubstake' is like
writing, I'll phone home when I get there,'' Lingenfelter said.
``It's a concept that just wasn't in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The chest was found in a rocky alcove high on 7,510-foot Pinto
Peak, in the Panamint Mountains that form Death Valley's western
rim. Inside it was a letter signed by Robinson, who ended up dying
200 miles and 26 days later on the outskirts of what is now
Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was one of a group who called themselves the Jayhawkers
_ a band of Illinois men who were one of several bands of pioneers
who got lost in late 1849 while seeking a shortcut to California's
gold fields.
</P>
<P>
   Too late that year to make it across the snowy Sierra Nevada,
several parties of gold seekers decided to take the southern route
from Salt Lake City across the California and Nevada desert to Los
Angeles. But instead of traveling all the way to Los Angeles _ a
long way from the gold _ most of the group headed for what they
thought was a shortcut across the southern Sierra Nevada discovered
several years earlier by mountain man Joe Walker.
</P>
<P>
   They were hundreds of miles from the real shortcut, however, and
ended up stumbling down into Death Valley, becoming the first
whites to see the lowest, hottest, driest place in North America.
Several died before they reached safety.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who with his adult daughters and a friend traced the
path of the lost ``forty-niners'' from Utah into Death Valley in
1996, said he believes the chest went undiscovered for 149 years
because it was hidden two miles from the Jayhawkers' generally
accepted route.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman believes Robinson was alone and lost from the group when
he hid the chest after his last ox died on the mountain.

SUN DEVILS KNOCKED SILLY BY SURPRISING BEAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-OREGON ST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Talent helps, but it sometimes takes more.
UCLA found out after coming into Gill Coliseum a couple of weeks
ago and leaving with a loss to Oregon State. Arizona State should
know this by now, too.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the Sun Devils forgot. ASU supposedly has better
players than the Beavers, but that mattered little Thursday in a
stunning, 81-51 Oregon State victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers (9-7, 3-4 Pac-10) outfought and out-thought the Sun
Devils, keeping their poise throughout. The Sun Devils (10-8, 2-4),
on the other hand, lost theirs. Emotions finally boiled over when
Coach Rob Evans, conducting a running dialogue with the officials
the entire game, stalked onto the court screaming with 5:53 left,
drawing a technical. But it didn't matter. ASU was long out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State had five players score in double figures. ASU had
just one, forward Bobby Lazor, who had 14 points. ASU made 20 of 62
shots (32.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils were without junior swingman Derrick Davis, who
stayed behind in Tempe because of academic difficulties and might
be lost for the season. But they did have sophomore point guard
Alton Mason, who flew to meet the team after learning he will be
academically eligible for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Dan O'Dowd picked up Mason at the airport in
Portland, and they arrived at the team hotel in Eugene at about 5
p.m., 20 minutes before the team bus left.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was the third ASU player this season to hop a flight and
join his teammates on the road on the day of a game. Freshman Kenny
Crandall and senior Mike Batiste also did it after gaining their
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's classroom struggles have been compounded by personal
tragedy. Since the start of the school year, his grandmother,
grandfather, aunt, and most recently, his father, have died. Mason
will leave today for his father's funeral in Nebraska and miss
Saturday's game against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Mason played solid defense on the Beavers' ace point guard,
Deaundra Tanner, but otherwise looked shaky in the first half. So
did his teammates. Oregon State plays a unique brand of ugly ball _
the Beavers lead the Pac-10 in field-goal percentage defense and
are last in shooting percentage _ but it often works, especially at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils missed nine of their first 10 shots, settled down
and took a 16-11 lead. Then they played perhaps their worst stretch
of the year, looking disoriented and out of synch, as the Beavers
went on a 20-4 run to open a 31-20 lead with 2:21 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty Beavers swarmed after every rebound, bringing Evans
off the bench several times to complain. The Beavers led at
halftime, 33-24. It was the Sun Devils' lowest first-half output of
the year, richly deserved. They made 9 of 31 shots (29 percent),
missing from inside, outside (0 for 7 from three-point range) and
everywhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste, whose play was especially uninspired, started the
second half on the bench _ and stayed there. The other Sun Devils
played with more of a purpose and began to execute their offense
and make some shots, pulling within two. But with a chance to tie
the score, Mason lost the ball and ASU failed to get even.
</P>
<P>
   All this did was make the Beavers play harder, and a 20-7 surge
pushed the lead to 55-40 with 10:10 to go. Then things got really
bad for the Sun Devils. Batiste had finally come in with 12:24, but
contributed little. &QL;

TWO TIED TO MOB ADMIT ROLES IN STOCK-MARKET SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two reputed mob figures pleaded guilty Thursday to
charges that they had participated in a conspiracy to manipulate
the price of a stock in a scheme the authorities have called the
most ambitious yet by organized crime to infiltrate Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Five other men also pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with
the scheme, which has been widely cited as evidence that organized
crime has trained its sights on the lucrative bull market after law
enforcement curtailed its influence in more traditional areas, like
garbage hauling and the garment business. A total of 11 people have
now pleaded guilty in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``The
guilty pleas in this case to extortion and stock fraud, the most
serious acts of racketeering charged in the indictment, fully
vindicate the public's interest in punishing and deterring
organized-crime infiltration into the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal racketeering indictment had charged in 1997 that
high-ranking members of the Bonanno and Genovese crime families had
cooperated to make millions of dollars and dupe investors in seven
states.
</P>
<P>
   As two federal prosecutors, Celeste Koeleveld and Douglas
Lankler, outlined the scheme during Thursday's court hearings, it
had involved a plan to inflate artificially the price of shares of
Healthtech International, based in Mesa, Ariz., which owns physical
fitness clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The crime family members bribed a group of brokers at a small
Wall Street brokerage house, Meyers Pollock Robbins, to sell
Healthtech stock to unsuspecting investors, prosecutors have
charged.
</P>
<P>
   After the brokers used high-pressure tactics to sell the stock
shares, the conspirators sold the shares they owned before the
price plummeted, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men who entered pleas Thursday in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan to securities and extortion conspiracy charges _
Rosario Gangi, 59, and Frank Lino, 61 _ were described in the
federal indictment as captains in the Genovese and Bonanno crime
families, respectively. In court, each man admitted to Judge Denny
Chin that he had participated in the scheme and knew that it was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthtech case was also notable because federal authorities
had inadvertently made public a copy of a sensitive prosecution
strategy memorandum that included a candid look at the strengths
and weaknesses of the government's case and the identities of
potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said disclosure of the memo ``had no influence'' on
the disposition of the case. She said the guilty pleas came after
defense lawyers were ``apprised of the strength of the government's
case'' and Chin ruled against the defense in pretrial motions. The
government had taken steps to ensure the safety of witnesses after
the memorandum was disclosed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Several defense lawyers in court Thursday generally agreed.
Gangi's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said access to the memo had not
ultimately changed the result for his client, although he said the
document had made ``interesting reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi could receive a term of 87 to 108 months in prison,
prosecutors said, which may run concurrently with a 70-month term
he is now serving in an unrelated case.
</P>
<P>
   Lino faces about five to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will be sentenced next May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charges are still pending against nine other defendants in the
case, including Gordon Hall, chairman of Healthtech.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is scheduled for trial next month, continues to
maintain his innocence, said his lawyer, James McGuire, ``and we
expect to proceed to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, Chin carefully questioned some of the
defendants about their roles in the scheme. One, Sal Taddeo, 30,
who worked at Meyers Pollock, told the judge that he knew that as
more shares were sold, the stock price would rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``And money would be made,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the intent to drive the price up?'' Chin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Taddeo replied.

A CASE OF COLD FEET STRIKES MCDYESS  
 BALKS IN DENVER; SUNS-GUGLIOTTA ON HOLD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While trying to explain Wednesday why Antonio McDyess had
spurned his team to sign a contract with the Denver Nuggets, Suns
President Jerry Colangelo said he was reminded of the Broadway hit,
``A Funny Thing Happened'' ``on the Way to the Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Turned out he had only seen Act I.
</P>
<P>
   With McDyess apparently history, the Suns turned their attention
Thursday to Minnesota Timberwolves free agent Tom Gugliotta.
Several NBA sources told ``The Arizona Republic'' that Gugliotta is
prepared to sign with the Suns, and two said he was on a flight to
the Valley on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But then the curtain went up on Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after arriving in Denver to sign a six-year, $67
million contract with the Nuggets, McDyess apparently learned that
the Nuggets had renounced the rights to his friend and former
teammate, LaPhonso Ellis, to fit McDyess under the Denver salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had been reported in Denver for days, McDyess had
been sequestered in Houston. The press conference was initially
pushed back 2{ hours, then postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is having second thoughts,'' a source told ``The
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver General Manager Dan Issel confirmed that when he told
reporters in Denver ``It doesn't look good'' and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   And so an already bizarre story took another weird twist.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess and his agents went to dinner, then were holed up in a
locker room at McNichols Sports Arena, the home of the Nuggets and
Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, three Suns players flew into Denver to speak with
McDyess. Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo confirmed that Rex
Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we have players who care,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he had been contacted by McDyess's agent Tony
Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if we're still interested,'' Colangelo said. ``The
answer is obvious. As long as we waited? Yes. Having said that,
we're always exploring our other options. We're not in a panic
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets officials were on standby and willing to wait all night
for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Suns had announced that the rights to 10 players
had been renounced earlier in the day, including those to McDyess _
which would preclude the club from re-signing him under the Larry
Bird exception. But the team had not actually submitted that list
to the league, so McDyess could still be re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Suns faced a dilemma. What if McDyess changed his
mind? The trip by the Suns' players indicates the club would
welcome him back.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Gugliotta?
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Gugliotta has not yet agreed to terms, but a person
familiar with the negotiations who asked to remain anonymous, told
``The Republic'' early Thursday that ``I think something will be
done sometime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta's agent, Richard Howell, told the ``Minneapolis
Star-Tribune'' newspaper that ``no deal is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Timberwolves inked Philadelphia free-agent power
forward Joe Smith to their $1.75 million cap exception in a
three-year deal, which indicates they're not expecting to keep
Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have this to consider if McDyess changes his mind: By
re-signing McDyess under his Bird exception, they can fill their
salary cap before adding his contract. Gugliotta must fit below the
cap. Thus, keeping McDyess would afford the club the chance to add
another significant free agent.
</P>
<P>
   They're different players, but both are All-Star caliber
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta had been offered a six-year $67 million deal by
Detroit, but turned it down. The Timberwolves were dangling a
seven-year, $86.5 million package. Denver also had pursued
Gugliotta with terms similar to Detroit's.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could offer a contract about the same as those that
Denver and Detroit could put on the table. Houston, the only other
team with competitive salary cap room, traded for Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   With McDyess in Denver, the Suns are Gugliotta's logical choice,
unless he decided to stay in Minnesota. And all indications are
that he wanted out of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   All of this just when it appeared the Suns' roster might be
falling into place in this whacky, lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, center Luc Longley signed his contract to complete a
sign-and-trade deal with Chicago. The deal still had to go through
the NBA office, which was swamped by contract signings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson's agent, Bradley Marshall, told KTAR radio in
Phoenix that his client has agreed to terms on a six-year contract
that would pay him $30 million and would sign it after Gugliotta
signed. But a Suns source said the report was erroneous, and terms
have not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   League sources told ``The Republic'' that the Robinson contract
can be done with the salary cap room the Suns have available, but
the deal could be part of a sign-and-trade scenario that would send
Robinson elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Robinson would go to Miami for
guards Brent Barry and Voshon Lenard. Barry was working out for the
Chicago Bulls Thursday in Chicago and could sign a straight
free-agent deal rather than agree to a sign-and-trade. &QL;

TEPPO CINCHES A TIE  
 COYOTES FAIL TO SCORE IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
 DUCKS-COYOTES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen demonstrated why he was named to the World
All-Star team's starting lineup Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman knocked in the tying goal with 10:16 left in
regulation as the Coyotes held on for a 3-3 tie in front of 16,210
at America West Arena on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had several opportunities to score in overtime, but
Anaheim goalie Dominic Roussel made several key saves, including a
one-handed grab of a Numminen shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also survived Keith Tkachuk's slashing penalty in
overtime as the NHL's second-best penalty-killing unit endured.
</P>
<P>
   The tying goal came when Keith Carney flipped the puck into a
crowd in front of the Anaheim goal and it bounced out to Numminen,
who knocked it in for his eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (24-11-7) maintain some momentum entering the
All-Star break. They have only one loss in their past six meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, which had lost three of their last four coming in, go
to 17-19-8 and look forward to the second half, when they are
traditionally a better team.
</P>
<P>
   When asked early Thursday what special problems Anaheim posed,
Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld named three: Teemu Selanne, Paul
Kariya and Steve Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They warrant special attention every time they're on the
ice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes learned that firsthand. The Mighty Ducks' top line,
which has accounted for 49 points in its past 11 games, was at the
heart of Anaheim's goal that made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, playing without Jeremy Roenick, who was ejected
after a game misconduct early in the second period, had tied it,
2-2, late in the second.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 seconds of a two-man advantage, the Coyotes worked
patiently to set up a play, and Mike Stapleton's slap shot was
tipped in by Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim bounced right back by sending in its No. 1 line.
Their speed resulted in a feed from Rucchin to Koriya, who scored
his 20th goal and gave the Ducks a 3-2 lead with 1:09 remaining in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was Anaheim that asserted itself in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' first score started out as a nice save by Nikolai
Khabibulin, but Anaheim's Ted Drury caught it on the rebound and
tapped it past the Coyotes' goalie with 14:28 remaining in the
opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes tied at 10:34 on a 2-on-1. Oleg Tverdovsky used his
speed to break away from the Ducks and feed Mike Stapleton, who
slapped it past Roussel for his fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment, the Coyotes' penalty-killing unit faltered.
With Jim Cummins on the bench for hooking, Fredrik Olausson's slap
shot was tipped near the crease by Marty McInnis to give the Ducks
a 2-1 lead that held through the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't what Schoenfeld wished for before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us have a strong first period,'' he said.
``When we were playing our best hockey, we were a very aggressive
team, we were attacking, we were generating a lot of scoring
chances and we were finishing checks in the offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would put our opponents back on their heels. I would like
to see us get back to that, especially against a team with an
explosive line like the Ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld saw some of that aggression in the second period, but
it turned ugly on an incident that started with a solid hit by
Roenick on Drury. Drury unloaded on the nearest man, Deron Quint,
and it mushroomed. Roenick ultimately tangled with Anaheim center
Travis Green, and the result was a game misconduct that means
automatic disqualification. &QL;

JOHN FREDERICK NIMS, 85, POET AND TRANSLATOR  
 ERNEST SCHIER, 80, NATIONAL CRITICS INSTITUTE HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Ind., Mass., Fla., Vt., Conn., Pa., S.D.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Frederick Nims, a poet, translator and author, died on
Tuesday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 85 and
lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Nims wrote eight books of poetry, beginning in 1947 with ``The
Iron Pastoral,'' in which he addressed life in Chicago. One poem,
``Penny Arcade,'' read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here heaven ticks: the weariest
</P>
<P>
   tramp can buy
</P>
<P>
   Glass mansions in the juke-
</P>
<P>
   seraphic sky.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books of poetry include ``Knowledge of the Evening,
Poems 1950-1960,'' nominated for a National Book Award; ``A
Fountain in Kentucky and Other Poems,'' ``The Kiss: A Jambalaya,''
``Of Flesh and Bone,'' ``Zany in Denim'' and ``The Six-Cornered
Snowflake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to his ``Selected Poems,'' published in
1982, he wrote: ``From the time I was 5 or 6, I thought poems were
a part of the natural world, as real certainly as the rabbits and
collies we kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Muskegon, Mich., Nims was a graduate of the University
of Notre Dame and received a Ph.D. in comparative literature from
the University of Chicago. He taught poetry at Notre Dame, the
University of Toronto, the University of Illinois at Urbana,
Harvard University, Williams College, the University of Florida and
the University of Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught abroad, as a visiting professor in Florence,
Milan and Madrid, and taught poetry at the annual Bread Loaf
Writers' Conference in Vermont, for more than 10 years. He was the
author of ``Western Wind,'' a textbook for introductory poetry and
creative writing courses.
</P>
<P>
   Nims' books of translations included ``Sappho to Valery: Poems
in Translation,'' ``The Poems of St. John of the Cross'' and, last
year, ``The Complete Poems of Michelangelo.'' He was editor of
Poetry magazine from 1978 to 1985 and editor of ``The Harper
Anthology of Poetry'' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Bonnie; a son, Frank, of Chicago;
two daughters, Emily Nims of Kalamazoo, Mich., and Sally Martin of
Gainesville, Fla., and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Schier, 80, National Critics Institute Head
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Schier, director of the National Critics Institute at the
Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., died on Tuesday
at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Schier was well equipped for his position at the Critics
Institute, having been drama critic of The Philadelphia Bulletin
from 1958 to 1982. Starting in the early 1940s, he covered theater
and film for several other newspapers, including The Times-Herald
in Washington from 1946 to 1954 and The Philadelphia Daily News
from 1956 to 1958. He was a founder and first chairman of the
American Theater Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the director of the International Young Playwrights
Project at the O'Neill center and served as dramaturge for the
National Playwrights Conference at the center from 1983 to 1989. He
was a consultant for the American College Theater Festival in
Washington (1978-89) and the Opera and Music Theater Conference at
the O'Neill center (1980-89).
</P>
<P>
   He was an adjunct professor in playwriting and performance
criticism at Villanova University and starting in 1985 he also
taught play writing and production at the O'Neill center.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Johanna Hall of Saugerties,
N.Y., and Jennifer Cole of Langhorne, Pa.; two sons, Harry, of
Rapid City, S.D., and William, of Levittown, Pa., and three
grandchildren.

WILDCATS NEED LATE PUSH TO TIP DUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ From his archrival's home to the Pit to the Mac,
Arizona guard Jason Terry doesn't care how loud it gets, how much
time is left, what the score is. Just give him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Terry swooped inside and pulled outside to score and helped the
ninth-ranked Wildcats burn Oregon, 85-83, on Thursday night in
front of 9,087 screaming fans at McArthur Court. Terry scored 37
points, 21 in the first half, and knocked in five three-pointers to
keep the Wildcats on pace to catch first-place Stanford in a huge
Pac-10 showdown next week in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Terry didn't need any last-second heroics for the
Wildcats. This time, his last shot didn't fall.
</P>
<P>
   His three-point attempt with 30 seconds left could have sealed
it, but clanked off the rim and the Ducks, down by one, had a
chance to regain the lead with four seconds left and Frederick
Jones at the line to shoot two.
</P>
<P>
   Jones missed the first, and the second, and freshman forward
Richard Jefferson muscled the rebound and was fouled with 2.6
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson hit one of two foul shots and Oregon called time with
2.2 seconds left to set up one last shot.
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Smith's long inbounds pass was broken up by Jefferson and
the Ducks weren't able to get off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   It should have figured the game would come down to the wire. No
two teams have been in more games decided in the final seconds that
Oregon and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Terry's defense against Arizona State's Eddie House in the last
seconds sealed Arizona's one-point victory in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up for a shot with four seconds left at New Mexico on
Saturday but the Lobos came back to win by one on buzzer-beater.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in four games that the Wildcats weren't
involved in a game that came down to the last shot, the last tick
of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward A.J. Bramlett, despite playing with four fouls,
scored on two straight drives that gave UA an 81-76 lead with 3:48
left. Comfortable, no.
</P>
<P>
   Darius Wright hit a three-pointer for the Ducks that brought
them to within two and then fed Frederick Jones inside that tied it
at 81 with three minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   After freshman forward Richard Jefferson threw the ball away,
Wright hit two free throws with 1:03 left to cut the deficit to
84-83.
</P>
<P>
   Terry worked the clock down to 30 seconds, before launching a
three-pointer that bounced off the rim and to a Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon lives by the three-point shot and had five in the first
15 minutes. UA combatted that strategy with a barrage of
three-pointers, connecting on six and taking a four-point lead at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Terry had 3 of 4 three-pointers and 21 points in the first 20
minutes. He scored all but 18 of the Wildcats' first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ducks took a 22-16 lead the 10-minute mark of the half,
there was Terry driving and pulling up for a jumper to cut into the
hard-hat section's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-pointer by Alex Scales gave Oregon a 27-20 lead
with seven minutes left in the half, freshman forward Richard
Jefferson, Terry and freshman guard Ruben Douglas all drilled
three-pointers in a 45-second span that gave Arizona its first
lead, 31-29. &QL;

 SONICS TO CLOSE OUT '90s WITH RETURN TRIP TO '80s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bewildered by Thursday's train wreck of a start by the
NBA?
</P>
<P>
   Here's all you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is gone. Latrell Sprewell is back.
</P>
<P>
   Good night, everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, some of you ghouls are still hanging around. Well, if
you're still hungry for a fix of the basketball macabre, check out
this ghostly scene from Seattle's hoops past at Thursday night's
first practice by the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Battling under the basket, for position for the rebound as well
as for the starting lineup, were Olden Polynice and Chris Welp.
</P>
<P>
   The mind reels.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice, a Sonic first-round draft choice three presidents ago,
washed out of here in 1991 to the Clippers when the Sonics had to
package him with two first-round picks just to get Benoit Benjamin.
You might recall that one of the most familiar pieces of American
furniture was named after Benjamin: The La-Z-Boy recliner.
</P>
<P>
   In Polynice's travels among three more teams since then, the
only thing certain about him is that he has gotten older.
</P>
<P>
   Husky basketball fans recognize Welp from the DeutscheDawg era
of Washington basketball, when he and fellow German native Detlef
Schrempf took the UW to a couple of NCAA tournaments. Since then,
Welp has played basketball in Europe, been an artist, read many
books, traveled the world and missed about three generations of NBA
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice and Welp in the Sonic middle. I swear, it's true.
Heading into the new millennium , the Sonics have armed themselves
from the '80s. It's as if Microsoft bundled an abacus with Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, who knows? The way the NBA game is played in this
broken season, it's like an Emerald Downs claiming race for
maidens: No charts, no Racing Form, no real clues.
</P>
<P>
   As the post-lockout, post-George Karl era began in Seattle
Thursday night with a 6 p.m. workout, chaos was king. Practice
began without either Polynice or Dale Ellis, both of whom wandered
in later after signing contracts and passing physicals.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters along the sidelines wondered, Whozzat? Where's
what's-his-face? How do you spell that name?
</P>
<P>
   Because the club signed seven fringe free agents, mostly for
practice fodder, the media relations department didn't have a list
of names and jersey numbers until after practice had begun.
Saturday mornings at the YMCA are better organized.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he managed the free-for-all, new coach Paul Westphal
agreed that he ``got most of the names, most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few guys who could help a little this season,
Sacramento free agent Billy Owens, hasn't made up his mind on a
team. The mysterious European rookie draft choice, Vladimir
Stepania, hasn't signed a contract. Don MacLean, the forward
acquired in the Jim McIlvaine deal, can't practice until the trade
is official. Michael Cage, the other guy in the swap, wasn't even
coming because the Sonics probably will waive him to free up space
under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Shirts and skins to 10 buckets, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, that's how it was,'' said a grinning Nate McMillan
after the first practice in his new career as assistant coach.
``It's been a headache, trying to get people signed, all the
decisions to be made, waiting on your boys to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But actually, it turned out to be be a real good practice,
considering.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, considering that this season shouldn't even be, a
game of 52-card pickup might have been considered OK.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday night's snapshot of the Sonic talent is
incomplete, it's a little hard to make any conclusions. But there
is some amusement in reflecting upon the basketball rhetoric in the
eight months since pro ball was last conducted in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, Vlade Divac, Jayson Williams,
Jason Caffey, Matt Geiger _ all were talked up as potential Sonic
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of the new labor agreement coupled with the
handsome salaries already being paid to the current roster has left
the Sonics with Polynice. And Owens, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice is 34 and wasn't cutting it last year in the backwater
of Sacramento. Should he make it here, Owens, another Kings
refugee, has the unusual distinction of having his scoring average
decline in each of the last six seasons. Not an easy feat for
someone, at 29, entering his prime.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever roster Westphal ends up with, it will be on a
forced march through two segments of the schedule that has five
games in six nights. During one stretch, they will play 16 games in
23 days.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, McIlvaine is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the best marketing slogan available.
</P>

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The weirdest NBA season just couldn't turn normal. The plan to
squeeze an entire offseason of deal-making, contract-writing,
trades, and signings into one afternoon with timing as precise as
the Manhattan subway system, all with 28 other teams rushing
through the same convoluted maze, somehow hit a snag.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen will join the Rockets, the team and his agent
pledged, likely sometime early this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not happen Thursday, and all the subsequent player
signings were placed on hold so the Rockets and Pippen's attorneys
could make their way through the new collective-bargaining
agreement to write a contract the NBA could approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem with the collective-bargaining agreement as
it was written last year and is written this year,'' Rockets owner
Leslie Alexander said at a news conference Thursday at Westside
Tennis Club. ``Because of that problem, we have to get it agreed to
by the league. It's going to take some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say how proud and happy we are to have him here.
We're working toward a good resolution. This guy does want to be a
Rocket real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen unsigned, the Rockets remained under the salary cap
and as such did not officially sign their own free agents _ Othella
Harrington, Matt Maloney, Matt Bullard and Eddie Johnson _ or Hawks
free agent Anthony ``Pig'' Miller and former Suns player John
Coker.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, who needed to be the first Rockets free agent
under contract, did sign Thursday in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets forwarded clarification on part of that deal to the
league but as of late Thursday had not received league approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets renounced their rights to their other free agents _
Mario Elie, Joe Stephens, Emanual Davis, Charles Jones and Clyde
Drexler _ to clear salary-cap room to sign Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Pippen deal did not go through the league's
approval process, everything else ground to a halt. The Rockets
needed to sign Pippen to fill the remaining salary-cap space before
they could sign their own free agents as Larry Bird exceptions to
the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Coker and Miller were to be signed to league-minimum contacts,
permissible for teams over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen could not complete the cap space, the rest of the
team could not be signed.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Roy Rogers, dealt to the Bulls as part of the
Pippen deal, did not pass his physical.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not affect the trade for Pippen or the delay on
gaining approval on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a deal completed sometime this evening (late
Thursday or early Friday),'' said Pippen's agent, Jimmy Sexton.
``It won't be a problem with the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just some issues with us getting the
collective-bargaining agreement so late we have to work through and
get it corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did have to do with parts of the contract as they relate
to Pippen's acquisition in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new sign-and trade deals are a little different,'' Sexton
said. ``There haven't been near as many of those done as this year
because of the new collective-bargaining agreement. So that makes
his deal a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sexton minimized the issues holding up the deal as typical,
only made more difficult by the logjam of contracts and deals
needing NBA approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely backed up right now,'' Sexton said. ``It's a
situation (in which) you have to wait until they have time to deal
with you. We have to wait until we get that accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 10 days are what's frustrating. Trying to cram six
months of work into 10 days is tough. This part isn't bad. Every
contract, this happens. This is not unusual. You have this on every
deal you do getting into the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going through different things on the contract,
things like that. This is not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   It canceled not only the news conference to introduce the team
but the practice Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich scheduled for
Thursday night to start training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the latest twist in the NBA's strange season still
in lockout knots, Pippen spoke as if the fine print would not
prevent what he had come to town to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be a Rocket,'' he said as if he already were.
``I'm happy to be in the city of Houston, and I'm looking forward
to bringing a championship here to this basketball team. I want to
thank all the fans that have been very warm to me around the city
in the little time I've been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just see I'm going to have a wonderful career here in
the city of Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   After six months of lockout limbo, and two weeks of deal-making
that followed, the rest of his teammates-in-waiting just had to
wait a night longer to begin the wonderful part.

IOC MEMBER WEARS A SECOND HAT: NBC'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Australia)  (js) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many years, NBC Sports was virtually a forgotten network
when it came to carrying the Olympics. Its competitor, ABC Sports,
led by Roone Arledge, had made the Olympics virtually its own. But
that changed in 1988 when NBC carried the first of three
consecutive Summer Games, and was transformed in 1995 when a
startling pair of deals brought it the rights to carry all five
Olympics from 2000 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic bounty cost NBC a bundle. For next year's Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, NBC is paying $705 million in cash.
For the scandal-scarred 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, NBC
will pay $545 million. The price tag for the next three after that,
including the 2004 Athens Summer Games, is $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A constant presence for NBC, from the fallow years to the fat
years, has been an Israeli named Alex Giladi. A confidante of Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic
Committee, Giladi has been an NBC executive since 1981, assigned to
build its international business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He developed relationships for us in Europe so we weren't
perceived as strangers,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC
Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Giladi, 56, has also served as a member of the IOC's radio and
television commission, an advisory panel with no role in television
negotiations, since 1985. In 1994 he became the first Israeli
elected to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules against Giladi's arrangement, nor any charges
from competing networks that Giladi helped NBC secure its
blockbuster Olympic deal. His presence in both hierarchies is
viewed as a coincidence, but it nevertheless provides a glimpse
into the business of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an engaging fellow, smokes big cigars, is very charming,
and is fond of quoting Samaranch,'' said Neal Pilson, a former
president of CBS Sports. ``But I don't think there's anything
improper. The question of whether Giladi should be an NBC employee
and an IOC member is up to the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   A.D. Frazier, the former chief operating officer of the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games, said he observed no unusual
influence from Giladi's being both part of Samaranch's inner circle
and an NBC executive. NBC's $456 million payment for the 1996
Summer Olympic television rights greatly exceeded ABC's when sealed
bids were opened in 1993, a year before Giladi became an IOC
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Alex's situation is weird? Yes,'' said Frazier.
``But did NBC save our bacon? Yes, thank God.'' He added: ``If Alex
used any undue influence, it sure cost NBC a lot. They got no
advantage from Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Giladi was traveling Thursday and unavailable for comment, but
in 1995 he said his dual positions constituted ``a wonderful
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said that Giladi has never negotiated an Olympic
television contract or has been part of creating a bid. ``Because
of my phobia for secrecy, I kept him completely out of that
stuff,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol did note that Giladi accompanied him and other NBC
executives to present their sealed bid for the Atlanta Games, but
said that Giladi did not know how NBC's $456 million bid was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol also said Giladi played no role in NBC's deal that
brought it the rights to both the Sydney and Salt Lake City Games.
Neither, he said, did NBC get inside information about Fox's $701
million offer for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alex knew about it, he didn't tell me,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said that he and a few NBC executives, but not Giladi,
crafted a single Sydney-Salt Lake blockbuster in the summer of
1995, as a possible alternative to a planned joint NBC-ABC bid for
the Sydney rights alone. While discussing the NBC-ABC proposal with
Robert Wright, the NBC president, Ebersol said that Randy Falco,
another NBC executive, suggested that NBC bid solo for Sydney and
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said that Giladi accompanied him and Falco on an Aug. 2
flight to Goteborg, Sweden, for a meeting with Samaranch to make
the 2000-2002 offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex was going with us as our liaison to the World Track and
Field Championships,'' Ebersol said. ``Alex asked, `What are you
going to pitch?' I outlined it for him and he said, `Not a chance.'
I got very angry and said, `I'm not going to deal with skepticism,
you'd better get positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Samaranch did not include Giladi.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Aug. 4, after Ebersol and Falco flew to Montreal to
meet with Richard Pound, the IOC member who negotiates television
contracts, the Sydney-Salt Lake deal was wrapped up. Ebersol said
that only after the deal was done did Pound tell him about Fox's
$701 million offer for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not something Alex knew about,'' Pound said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the timing of Fox's attempt to buy the Sydney
Games and NBC's two-Olympics coup, each coming in the same week,
was coincidental. Later that year NBC made its successful
pre-emptive bid for the three Olympics after that, an unprecedented
acquisition that reversed a bidding practice begun for the 1988
Olympics in which each network submitted sealed bids.
</P>
<P>
   Fox made its bid to Pound late on Monday, July 31, 1995, but it
did not conform to the IOC's bid contracts, said Pound, who did not
follow up with Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television, because
of NBC's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, NBC trumped Fox and any other network that hoped to
bid for future Olympic rights, including CBS, which had committed
$913 million for the rights to the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after NBC's deal was announced, Francois Carrard, the
IOC's director general, said Fox's bid ``was not credible enough.''
The IOC, some industry executives believe, regards Rupert Murdoch,
whose News Corp. owns Fox, with suspicion for the racy reputation
of his newspapers and his aggressiveness in bidding for sports .  &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Charles Barkley ducked into the scorer's tent
at the 10th tee at Tamarisk Country Club on Thursday and began
scribbling autographs, one after another.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But these signatures weren't for kids or memorabilia hounds.
They were on his new one-year contract with the Rockets. Barkley
rapidly signed and flipped pages.
</P>
<P>
   Then he raised up and said, ``This is an awful lot of signing
for such a little bit of money.''
</P>
<P>
   By NBA standards, Barkley, 35, couldn't have been more correct.
He signed for the minimum salary for veterans with 10 years of
experience or more, $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   That a golf game had to be interrupted for Barkley to sign his
contract is appropriate. After the NBA lockout wiped out three
months of the season, Barkley has played a lot more golf than
basketball since last season ended for him with a torn triceps
tendon. He's playing in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic with Michael
Jordan as he puts a lid on his golf season.
</P>
<P>
   As Barkley was penning his pact, a voice from the gallery
yelled: ``You should have held out for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said, ``There wasn't that much to hold out for.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, he was accurate. Barkley knew that if the Rockets were to
combine Scottie Pippen's talents with those of Hakeem Olajuwon and
himself, Barkley had to sign a contract that is worth less than
what he was making 10 years ago. That was so other dominoes could
fall as the roster was to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he thought he had to sign the contract because of a
pledge he made to the Rockets. He also knew that signing Thursday
was necessary because until he signed, the Rockets were hamstrung
and couldn't make any other deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's a good deal for me,'' he said. ``But I made
a promise to the Rockets a long time ago that if they got Scottie
Pippen, I would be back. And I didn't want to go back on my word.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's salary will rank him in the lower half of the NBA's
pay scale, but it gives the Rockets a chance to be serious
championship contenders, something they were not in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is pretty damn good,'' Barkley said. ``We're a lot
better this year than we have been the past two years. There's no
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we the favorites? I don't know about about that. We're
going to have to beat all the usual suspects in the West _ the
Lakers, Utah and Seattle. But with me, Hakeem and Scottie, that's a
damn good foundation. I like my team a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley added that his close relationship with coach Rudy
Tomjanovich was the primary factor in him returning to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy is the only reason I'm coming back,'' Barkley said. ``He
was the underlying factor for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was all smiles after signing the contract, even though
he had some anxious moments, even as late as Thursday morning, when
he went through a series of frantic cellular-phone calls with his
agent and the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be back,'' Barkley said. ``When's the first
practice?''
</P>
<P>
   Informed it was to start in a few hours in Houston, Barkley
said: ``Tell everybody I'll see them Sunday or Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Barkley may yet make the first practice. A
bottleneck in the NBA office caused by a deluge of signings and
other transactions led to the Rockets being forced to cancel
Thursday night's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Another bottleneck came when the league office requested the
Rockets to provide a series of unspecified clarifications regarding
Barkley's contract. The team provided the information and was
awaiting a response from the league office late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' season will begin Feb. 5 against the Los Angeles
Lakers. Barkley said he anticipates no problems getting ready for
the opener of the abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape,'' he said. ``I'm in a lot better shape
this year than I was last year before camp.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows. Barkley has lost the paunch that had become his
trademark during training camps past. He believes good conditioning
will be crucial this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for us is that we stay healthy,''
Barkley said. ``In a 50-game season, you can't afford to have key
people miss many games. So we've got to have Hakeem's knees in good
shape, and Scottie's back has to be OK. And I've got to stay
healthy, too. We're going to be playing three games in three nights
sometimes, which is stupid. So we have to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley added he believes the trio of himself, Olajuwon and
Pippen will be stronger than the one Clyde Drexler was a part of
the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a great player like Scottie Pippen, you can find a
way to help your team,'' Barkley said. ``He'll fit in fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Before signing his contract, Barkley had given every indication
he was wrestling with his decision. Seattle was offering twice as
much money.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived on the putting green at 9:40 a.m. His cellular phone
rang within minutes. It was his agent. After a 10-minute
conversation during which Barkley was overheard saying, ``I'm
either going to sign with the Rockets or Seattle today,'' he was
instructed to call the Rockets, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's group for Thursday's round at the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic _ including Michael Jordan, Roy Green and John Daly _ was
due on the tee at 9:58 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley teed off, then kept the cell phone to his ear throughout
the first hole, handing it off to a security guard only long enough
to hit his shots. Clearly, his mind wasn't on golf.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth tee, Barkley still wasn't concentrating on golf.
</P>
<P>
   After his tee shot, he said to caddie Brett Tyson: ``Can you
believe I'm getting screwed out of a million dollars?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Barkley's agreeing to a one-year deal also
reinforces what he has said many times: that money is not the
driving force for him to play basketball anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after making a bogey on No. 9, Barkley was waved to the
scorer's tent in between the ninth green and 10th tee. Mike Wells,
an assistant to Tomjanovich, presented Barkley with a document that
was about one-quarter-inch thick. Barkley said the signing was a
lot more than just a formality. He considered joining the
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was close with the Sonics,'' Barkley said. ``Vin Baker and
Gary Payton did a good job last weekend in Las Vegas working on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm breaking their hearts right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though $1 million is not an NBA star's idea of big money,
the signing must have eased Barkley's nerves. On the back nine, he
birdied a par-5, giving him a net eagle on the hole for his team.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT'S unofficially official, which fit on this day.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a day for the cut-and-dried. This was not a simple
case of crossing the last few ``t's'' and dotting the final few
``i's.'' This wasn't simple at all.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been, Scottie Pippen would have been an official
Rockets star Thursday. Instead, he is only waiting and waiting.
Like we all are.
</P>
<P>
   He is only another transplanted house-hunter, trying to tell the
West Loop from the East Belt, the Katy Freeway from the Gulf
Freeway, and waiting for that first day of work to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But he is someone this city finally laid eyes upon Thursday,
presumably becoming an instant Rockets hero, unofficially.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Pippen became the local media's newest best friend _
a guy who knows how to make a first impression and nudge his way
into hearts, even as the Rockets jersey was all but pulled off his
back with the lights on and the cameras rolling.
</P>
<P>
   As the day got longer and the deal shakier _ something about
contract wording and league-office hang-ups _ Pippen apologized for
the long wait and splurged for the refreshments.
</P>
<P>
   Free cheese sandwiches. Free cheese sticks. Free cheese pizza.
And beer. Angioplasties will be extra at a date to be named, but
why worry about such things like that now?
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will be a Rocket. Don't worry about a thing, the Rockets
told us. Don't worry about a thing, Pippen told us. It probably
will become official today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long night, and it will be longer,'' Rockets owner
Leslie Alexander said. ``But here's Scottie.''
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough there was Pippen, talking about being happy to
be here, about looking forward to the season and eventually
``having a wonderful run here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was all unofficial, of course. It was all pending league
approval, which was expected to come at some point early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   It all fit perfectly on this all-day, well-into-the-night frenzy
of waiting for the final piece of the puzzle to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The day that would be Pippen's began for some in the Rockets
organization at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be like a strange sort of crash course on
franchise-building come to life.
</P>
<P>
   It was a kind of NBA 12-step program on how to put together a
potential NBA champion, with the Rockets' staff spending most of
the day skipping two or three steps at a time on the way to
hopefully finally putting a team on the court.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, everything was tripped up on the last step.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley was a Rocket, then he wasn't. Matt Bullard and
Matt Maloney were Rockets, then they weren't. Pippen put on his
best suit, then he undid his tie and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   First, things were put off because of Pippen's travel itinerary.
There also was the search for Barkley amid the out-of-bounds stakes
at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   There was the ever-present NBA litigation and Alexander
occasionally having to stop to rub the cramps out of his
contract-signing hand.
</P>
<P>
   Details, the Rockets said.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Alexander sitting behind his desk Thursday afternoon,
giddily smiling and signing deal after deal, like Mel Brooks in
Blazing Saddles, knowing that by the end of the night all his
dreams would come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work, work, work. Work, work, work.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough being kings of the NBA world, but that's exactly what
Alexander and the Rockets seemed to be putting the finishing
touches on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers were sent back and forth, picking up players and agents.
A makeshift stage was put together at midcourt of Westside Tennis
Club. Caterers were called; sound people checked microphones.
</P>
<P>
   A Rockets staffer and notary even flew to Los Angeles, hopped on
a golf cart and tracked down Barkley at the Chrysler tournament so
he could sign his new Rockets contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones chimed. Fax machines buzzed. Players gathered at the
Westside locker room and talked about how great it was that the
season finally was set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   But then, it didn't. First practice was canceled, and then the
grand announcement about Pippen was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The season was put off one more time, meaning the Rockets might
be the last NBA team to start this strange 1999 basketball season,
which might also be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   After all, judging from everything that became unofficially
official Thursday, the Rockets might be the last ones standing in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   We should expect it all to happen officially today. We should
expect in about 90 days for Pippen and the Rockets to pick up where
Pippen and the Bulls left off.
</P>
<P>
   We should expect a championship run. The wait will be worth it.
And then maybe we should expect more pizza and beer.

AS ISLES' FREE FALL CONTINUES, MILBURY STEPS ASIDE AS COACH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Less than 24 hours after hearing chants of ``Mike
must go! Mike must go!'' during a listless loss at Nassau Coliseum,
Mike Milbury resigned Thursday as the Islanders' coach for the
second time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came two and a half hours before
Thursday night's 5-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins, was the
latest development to rock the franchise this decade. Unsteady
ownership, frequent coaching changes, a revolving-door roster, rare
playoff appearances and shrinking attendance have plagued the
franchise, which won four consecutive Stanley Cups beginning in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stewart, the Islanders' first-year assistant coach,
replaced Milbury, who will remain as the team's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury, who signed a five-year coaching contract last May, said
he made his decision after Wednesday night's 5-2 loss to the
Florida Panthers. The Islanders had not won a game since Dec. 26
before winning on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big-time statement,'' Milbury said, referring to
the game Wednesday night. ``I told them I've been around a long
time, and last night was as listless a performance as any that I
can remember. Right now motivation is the main thing. They seem to
be feeling sorry for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Islanders' season-breaking 0-10-1 streak, it had
become apparent that some, if not most, of the players had begun to
tune out Milbury. The trade of Bryan Berard, a talented 21-year-old
defenseman who was popular with his teammates, for the goaltender
Felix Potvin, may have further weakened his relationship with the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if pressures of coaching hurt his ability to direct the
team from a general manager's standpoint, Milbury said,
``Absolutely not.'' However, in public and private conversations,
people close to Milbury said that he told them he did not want the
dual roles, but was forced into them by the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Milbury; Ed Milstein, a member of the team's
ownership group; David Seldin, the president, and Steven
Gluckstern, a co-owner, discussed making a change over lunch at
Milbury's house, but no decision was made until Thursday when
Milbury called Gluckstern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was the way to go,'' Milbury said. ``You can't
go on a streak like this. It happened to Rick Bowness last year. He
couldn't turn them, and I can't turn them on right now. If the them
team quits on the coach, it's an awful tough thing to get them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That responsibility now belongs to the 41-year-old Stewart, a
defensive strategist. Stewart, a 10-year veteran as a defenseman in
the National Hockey League, last season coached St. John of the
American Hockey League to the Calder Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into this rah-rah stuff,'' said Stewart, who is
described by players as a good communicator and as very intense.
``I'd rather get results _ it's all about winning. Winning and
losing, nothing more, nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   About the decision to promote Stewart instead of the assistants
Wayne Fleming or Lorne Henning, Milbury said, ``We hired Bill
Stewart over the summer knowing that he had been successful at
every level that he coached and that someday he might get the
opportunity here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Isles are 14-29-3 and on course to miss the playoffs for the
fifth consecutive year. Zigmund Palffy, Trevor Linden, Lachance and
Tommy Salo, to name a few, have not played to their ability. Since
returning from a 32-game holdout, Palffy has 3 goals and 6 assists
in 13 games. Linden, the captain, has 11 goals, 15 assists and a
minus-9 rating and does not have a goal since Dec. 26. Defenseman
Scott Lachance has struggled all season and is minus-16.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury, 46, was named coach on July 5, 1995, adding the general
manager's title five months later. He reluctantly relinquished the
coaching job in January 1997 and hired Bowness. He went 37-50-12
and was fired by Milbury last March 11, not long after a 10-game
losing streak. Milbury went back behind the bench for last season's
final 19 games.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Milbury was 57-111-24 in parts of four seasons as
Islanders coach. He also was the coach of the Boston Bruins for two
seasons, with a pair of Adams Division titles and a trip to the
1990 Stanley Cup finals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milbury's resignation is the latest turmoil in the Islanders'
organization in the past two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   John Spano, who was announced as the team's buyer in late 1996,
pleaded guilty to fraud charges last January for lying to banks and
the National Hockey League by saying that he had enough money to
buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   New owners were found in September 1997 _ Gluckstern, an
insurance executive, and Howard Milstein, a real estate executive.
Before this season, however, they expressed concerns about Nassau
Coliseum's safety and sought to play the games in other arenas. The
Islanders moved out of the Coliseum and sued their landlord. But
the plan to play elsewhere was struck down in court, and
negotiations over a new arena foundered. Progress was reported this
week, however, on reaching an agreement on a new arena.  &QL;

Q&AMP;A LIABLE TO BE `FREE-FOR-ALL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial could be headed for a
free-for-all today because cooperation among Democrats and
Republicans has faltered again, this time over key procedures for
how senators will pose questions to the parties, says Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have refused to agree to anything, so we go to this
questioning period wide open. It's literally a free-for-all,'' Kyl
told ``The Arizona Republic'' on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said one key point
had been decided: Republicans and Democrats are to alternate
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually everything else was left unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could the respondent take an unlimited time to answer? Should
a response of the other side be permitted?'' Kyl asked. ``I hope my
fears of confusion are ill-founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions may be directed either to House managers or to the
White House legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said Republicans had already filed 80 questions by midday
Thursday. Ten of them are Kyl's own. It could not be determined
Thursday how many questions had been submitted by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's defense team concluded its case Thursday
with a presentation by former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. Democratic
senators said they hoped to end the trial soon with an up-or-down
impeachment vote, but Republicans cautioned against a rush to
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial calendar says the next step is this:
``Senate questions parties, not to exceed 16 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were few rules in place to guide the senators. It may
be left to Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who has thus far not
played a significant role, to halt responses that seem too long.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began two weeks ago with Lott and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., proudly announcing a framework in which to
proceed. Lott and Daschle said it was critical that the parties
work together.
</P>
<P>
   But the civility began to fall apart when Democrats accused
Republicans last week of holding private meetings with House
managers on the witness issue. Republicans countered that Democrats
had indeed been invited, albeit belatedly, and that nothing was
decided behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bipartisan agreement was to be a framework, and the
assumption was that we would continue to meet on a bipartisan basis
and work out details,'' Kyl said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as of (Thursday night), they (Democrats) wouldn't agree to
something as basic as, `Republicans would ask questions for an
hour, and Democrats would ask questions for an hour,' or something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, the Democrats' lead spokesman, was unavailable Thursday
night to respond to Kyl's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans began submitting their questions this week to Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Hatch has been busy organizing the questions
into logical order and eliminating duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   After the question-and-answer phase, Democrats are expected to
seek a dismissal of the case. At that time, Republicans may push to
summon witnesses for depositions or public appearances. The
witnesses could include Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern whose affair with Clinton led to the impeachment charges. &QL;

PLAGUED BY PAVEL, RANGERS LOSE AGAIN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers begin the All-Star break the way they
began the season: with a four-game losing streak. Thursday night's
defeat was particularly aggravating. After coming from behind to
tie the score, they lost by 2-1 in Madison Square Garden to the
Florida Panthers. The winning goal, at 18 minutes 17 seconds of the
third period, was scored on a long slap shot by defenseman Bret
Hedican, who intercepted John MacLean's clearing pass and drilled
the puck past goalie Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Hedican was acquired earlier this week in a trade with Vancouver
that also brought Pavel Bure, who scored the other Florida goal.
</P>
<P>
   This was a tense and rugged game with an edge to it between two
Eastern Conference rivals who would not be among the eight to
qualify for the playoffs from their half of the league if the
post-season were to begin today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the low goal total, scoring chances were plentiful and
both goalies were serenaded by the ringing of their goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens of the Rangers tied the score at 1-1 at 7:47 of
the third period when he beat Florida goalie Sean Burke with a low
wrist shot from the dot of the right-wing faceoff circle. Stevens
sprang loose behind the defense and took a bank pass off the boards
from Brent Fedyk. It was Fedyk's first point of the season. Moments
before, Burke denied Fedyk on two close-in chances.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:34 remaining in the third period, the Panthers called a
timeout to plan strategy for a two-man advantage that lasted for 43
seconds. The Rangers killed it off, drawing chants and cheers from
their fans, who increased the volume when the home team killed off
the remaining one-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bure scored two goals in his season debut on Wednesday night, a
5-2 victory over the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum. Thursday night,
he gave the Panthers a 1-0 lead at 6:45 of the second period when
the teams were each playing with one man in the penalty box.
Breaking loose ahead of the play and taking a long pass from Rob
Niedermayer, Bure raced in alone on Richter, made a couple of fakes
and put the puck between Richter's legs and over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Bure refused to report to the Vancouver Canucks this season and
forced a trade that occurred last Sunday. He traveled from Moscow
to New York on Tuesday and played limited minutes in both games.
The Rangers were one of the teams negotiating for Bure all season,
but Brian Burke, the Canucks' general manager, turned the Rangers
down when they refused to include Manny Malhotra, the rookie
center, in the package.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came into Thursday night's game with only two goals
in their previous three games. They thought they scored twice early
in the second period, but they were foiled once by a video review
and the other time when an official mistakenly blew his whistle.
The first was on a power-play shot by Petr Nedved, who took Wayne
Gretzky's pass and beat Sean Burke over the shoulder on the stick
side, but the puck hit the cross bar and the goal post before
bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play, Adam Graves crowded the crease and knocked a
rebound over the line. But Paul Stewart, one of two referees, waved
it off because he had blown the whistle, apparently thinking the
goalie had covered the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mellanby, the Panthers' captain, left the game in the
second period and appeared to be in great pain with a pinched nerve
sustained in a collision with Ranger defenseman Ulf Samuelsson. It
happened while Mellanby manned the left point on the power play.
Samuelsson, who was playing with the flu, appeared to hit Mellanby
in the face with his left hand. But it was just a glancing blow and
the injury apparently was caused by something else.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lindsay, Florida's scrappy left wing, seems to play his
best against the Rangers. Lindsay had five hits in the first
period, most of them against Nedved. In response, Lindsay was
slammed to the ice by Jeff Beukeboom, the big Ranger defenseman. In
the second period, Lindsay was penalized for roughing Nedved. In
the final minute before the second intermission, Lindsay took a
two-minute minor for interfering with Richter behind the Rangers'
net.
</P>
<P>
   That would have given the Rangers another power play, but it was
negated when Graves came to Richter's defense and hit Lindsay with
a couple of punches, and both men were sent off with minors. The
Rangers' power play had led the league for much of the season, but
they had only one goal in 18 chances with the manpower advantage in
the previous four games. In the first two periods Thursday night,
the Rangers had no power-play goals in six chances over a span of
10:54.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Mathieu Schneider was out for the fourth time in the
last five games with a groin strain. Gretzky played despite neck
spasms that have bothered him all week. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The future home of Cal State Northridge football
will be decided by university President Blenda Wilson, but without
the aid of a singular recommendation from a site committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of recommending one site for a football field, the site
committee reverted to a previous plan and suggested an on-campus
site and an off-campus site during the final meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The site committee voted 6-2 to recommend an 8,000-seat facility
on the North Campus for its on-campus selection. The location for
the $8million to $10million project is approximately 75 yards south
of the current stadium and would be just north of Lassen Street.
With a unanimous 8-0 vote, the committee recommended a renovation
of Pierce College as its off-campus site.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a motion passed with a 7-1 vote to have the final
site committee's recommendation include the surrounding community's
site preference.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's events didn't offer a lot of solace to residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what President Wilson wants, which is an on-site
stadium,'' said committee member Bob LoPresti, a CSUN graduate and
member of the Lindley West Coalition. ``I believe this committee
would be used as a scapegoat, and she could blame it on them, (if
we voted for one site). This is where we were a year ago. That
stadium started right at (the North Campus) location a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 11 committee members who held votes attended the
meeting. Joining LoPresti for a ``nay'' vote for the on-campus site
was Bob Galletly, who represents Northridge Townhome Estates.
</P>
<P>
   Residents representing the Zelzah Coalition and La Villa Nueva
Homeowners were also in attendance. The homeowner groups are
concerned about noise pollution, increased crime and traffic if a
facility is erected on the North Campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community was heard and I think they made a clear and
unambiguous statement,'' Galletly said. ``This committee is not
going to be the scapegoat, and we should be as objective as
possible in making a recommendation for on-site or off-site.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman David Honda, who didn't hold a vote, said it
would take him approximately 30 days to complete the report and
turn it over to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   However, a potential snag exists for the Pierce site. Honda, who
had a conference call with Pierce administrators Thursday morning,
said the school didn't want CSUN as a permanent tenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no money and they don't want Cal State Northridge
for more than four or five years,'' Honda said. ``This makes
(Wilson's) job very high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same manner in which the previous meeting ended _
with two sites selected. But when the committee adjourned on that
November night, Honda said they would return for a final meeting
and recommend one site for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly two months ago, and though this meeting was much
more controlled and lacked the venom of the last, approximately 125
residents were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN needs a venue for football. Its current home _ North Campus
Stadium _ is scheduled to be demolished following the 1999 season
because the land has been leased to Alfred Mann for a MiniMed
biotech facility. But the school did leave enough space to build an
8,000-seat stadium, which is needed to meet Big Sky Conference
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleasantly surprised with the passion the community has
with regards to the opposition of the stadium,'' LoPresti said. ``I
think the residents have to gear up for phase two of the fight. I
think there's obviously litigation, but first is the (environmental
impact report) process.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the White House wrapped up its three-day case
Thursday, Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed that President
Clinton's lawyers had mounted a strong defense, but they remained
divided over whether they needed to hear more evidence before
voting on the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that the White House's legal assault had
punched big holes in the House prosecutors' case, and they
continued to press Republicans to skip a scheduled vote early next
week to depose witnesses and vote instead on acquittal or
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the votes aren't there, so why drag it out?'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Republicans, who support calling witnesses to
clear up conflicting testimony, urged their colleagues to withhold
judgment on witnesses at least until the next phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Friday, Democrats and Republicans will each have up
to eight hours to question the White House lawyers and House
prosecutors for the first time. Republican and Democratic leaders
have been culling and organizing questions submitted by senators.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will read the questions,
identifying their authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has good lawyers and they scored some
points,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., whose brother, Asa, is
one of the House prosecutors. ``Now everyone is looking forward to
the question-and-answer time, when it'll give the House an
opportunity to do some rebuttal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, complained
Thursday that the managers had been given no chance to rebut the
White House's defense. ``The last one to speak always has the
advantage,'' said Hyde, who said he sensed growing support among
senators for summoning witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the prosecutors had not decided on a final list of
witnesses, although he has called for bringing Monica Lewinsky,
Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan Jr. Hyde said the prosecutors would
decide whether to seek any witnesses to testify in the trial after
reviewing their depositions.
</P>
<P>
   With opening statements from both sides now complete, the
situation remains remarkably fluid. Democrats and Republicans are
talking among themselves about whether to dismiss the case and
which, if any, witnesses are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of flux and a lot of movement and a lot of talk
and groping toward a bipartisan solution,'' said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans know the trial is unpopular with Americans.
Clinton's job approval ratings rose after his State of the Union
address on Tuesday night, ranging from 66 percent in an ABC poll to
72 percent in a CBS survey to 76 percent according to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans say they must push ahead with their solemn
duty and not be swayed by opinion polls. Moreover, they add, it's
natural that Democrats would try to seize on the momentum from the
White House's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution presented their case and everyone said, `Oh,
OK,''' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, a former county prosecutor.
``Then the defense presented their case. Everybody said, `Oh, OK.'
This is a natural rhythm to a trial, and we're into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties say the momentum could shift again after the
questioning starts. Democrats and Republicans have each collected
dozens of queries from senators. Each side will alternate asking
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are conflicts in what has been said by the
House managers and the White House,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, told reporters after Thursday's arguments. ``There
appear to be conflicts between what the witnesses have said. This
is an important part of the process as we try to clarify the
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will delve into both the perjury and obstruction
of justice charges. Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Clinton's
lawyers had raised ``reasonable doubts'' about whether the
president could be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he was still troubled by certain details. ``How
many interns in the White House would the president, Vernon Jordan
and Betty Currie find a good job for on an expedited basis?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the questioning, the Senate is set to vote on whether to
dismiss the case, perhaps as early as Monday. Senate Republicans
outnumber Democrats, 55-45, so six Republicans would have to defect
and all Democrats would have to hold firm to dump the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say outright dismissal is unlikely. So Democrats are
eyeing the next vote, to depose witnesses, as a proxy for
dismissal. Senators say the outcome of that vote is less certain.
But even if it fails, Democrats say it carries political potency
for them because they can accuse Republicans of dragging out a
trial that is unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many Republicans are uneasy about calling
witnesses. Some Republicans, including Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
voiced concerns at a party caucus Thursday morning about the impact
of a lengthy deposition process.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans rejected the idea of bypassing a vote on
witnesses. ``To do anything that would abridge the process of
getting to the truth or to arbitrarily cut short that process
because it's inconvenient, is unwise,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing ahead with depositions, knowing that senators will have
a second vote on which, if any, witnesses actually testify at the
trial, still carries risks of prolonging the trial, lawmakers
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This train,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., ``may not have
no brakes.''

FEDS SUING TELEMARKETING FIRM IN INVESTOR FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The federal government is suing a telemarketing
company and its principal for allegedly defrauding investors out of
about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Assured
International Inc. and its principal, Sam E. Harris, a repeat
securities laws violator, with luring 82 investors into buying
shares in a fake business that claimed to make disposable latex
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleges that the company never made gloves. Instead, the
company has misused invested funding, including paying $202,422 to
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Harris' attorney for comment Thursday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1998, Assured International has received at least
$828,000 from investors nationwide. They sold common shares in the
company for 50 cents, and told investors that it was going public
in early 1999. The SEC said Assured International told investors
that they could sell their shares later for $5 to $8 each.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest investment was $5,000. Most investors gave $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said these telemarketing boiler rooms are
becoming more prevalent. For some reason, they're clustering in the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more of it. More and more (of these boiler
rooms) are moving to the (San Fernando) Valley -- Woodland Hills is
kind of popular,'' said Lisa Gok, assistant regional director for
enforcement at the SEC. ``We are aware of the boiler rooms and the
telemarketers who are in the Valley, and we will go after them with
the full force of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is a repeat offender, the SEC said. Seven states have
sued him for various securities violations -- California,
Pennsylvania, Missouri, Kansas, Montana, Texas and Oregon. Illinois
and Indiana are suing Assured International for the latex glove
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is seeking fines and a permanent injunction against
Harris' company. The agency also wants the court to order Harris to
return money they say he stole.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has frozen his bank accounts, but authorities aren't
sure investors will get their money back. Typically, investors
rarely get back more than 10 percent to 20 percent of money they've
given to a boiler-room operation.

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been laid against the President of
the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low view of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America still has it in for politics, at
least if Hollywood's latest outpourings are anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw three blockbuster films _ ``Primary Colors,''
``Bulworth'' and ``Wag the Dog'' _ which all painted politicians as
venal, corrupt, depraved and obsessed by personal ambition.
</P>
<P>
   This, in itself, was nothing new. After all, the classic film
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' had a similar message: the
innocent comes from outside the city to bring a breath of fresh
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-sticker politics has had it in for big-time politics for
decades, with stickers proclaiming that ``All politicians are
liars,'' or hoping that the Russians would nuke the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   And ask virtually any American in any bar in any city what they
think of Democrats or Republicans, and the gist of the inevitable
tirade is likely to be ``a plague on both their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism about politics and politicians grew throughout the late
1960s, and exploded as the Watergate saga broke. In the postwar
years, there was great faith in government: it had, after all,
ended the Depression, won the war and emerged stronger and more
confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Vietnam, inner-city riots and Watergate
sent public trust plunging. It recovered during the 1980s under
Ronald Reagan, but then sank again in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the cry of ``throw out the rascals'' went out across the
country, there was a rise in insurgent politics: a preference for
non-politicians, whether real non-politicians like the businessman
Ross Perot, the independent candidate for the White House, or
invented non-politicians like Ronald Reagan, who ran as an
anti-Washington, anti-government figure from California.
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian right was on the upswing, deregulating,
privatizing, deunionizing and ridding the nation of the threat of
Big Government. Yet against all the expectations, public trust in
politicians now seems to be rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls show that not only is Bill Clinton's approval
rating solid, but that in general politicians are reasonably
well-regarded. Incredibly, a poll in November showed that 54
percent of Americans trusted the president to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the same polls show little respect for him as a person,
he is widely thought to have done a good job, as are those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup poll, 76 percent of Americans hold
either ``a great deal'' or ``a fair amount'' of confidence in the
federal government to handle international problems, and 61 percent
have a high level of confidence in its ability to handle domestic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though these figures are about 10 percent lower than they were
pre-Watergate, they are significantly higher than in much of the
intervening period.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment made no difference. As Gallup said: ``If any change
has occurred in the past year-and-a-half, it has been in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The last elections showed voters backing incumbents in record
numbers. The nation seemed to be saying: keep the rascals in. Even
the film ``Bulworth'' is about the humanization of a politician, a
man who comes to see what damage he and his colleagues have done.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been something of a sense of the wheel coming
full circle. The repudiation of ``ideology'' and partisanship
around impeachment has been mainly directed at Republicans from the
House of Representatives, led by Newt Gingrich until his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich led an anti-Washington, anti-government crusade, but
ultimately had to face the fact that he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   He and his ``revolutionaries'' attracted a great deal of
criticism; the Senate, entirely composed of professional
politicians, is suddenly seen once again as the repository of
experience and good sense, not a nest of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If this feelgood sense of politicians persists, it may have
important implications for the next presidential election.
Vice-President Al Gore, who is expected to win the Democratic
nomination for the presidency next year, was born in Washington,
the son of a senator, and has worked there most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The early policy positions he has taken are about revitalizing
city centers and conserving the U.S. equivalent of the Green Belt _
activist ideas that seem to resonate with suburban concerns across
America. George W. Bush, his most likely Republican opponent, is
another insider, but he lacks political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, hangs on the economy. The indices
tracking confidence in government correlate closely with rising or
falling personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current boom has been longer than that of the 1980s, and
nearly matches that of the 1960s; hence Bill Clinton gets the
plaudits, whatever voters think of his character. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Americans credit their politicians with creating economic booms,
and blame them for creating recessions, like most electorates. They
are, by comparison with the British, more trusting of public
figures in general, according to a study by Harris Poll and MORI,
except for one category: newsreaders.
</P>
<P>
   The British place implicit trust in the men and women who read
the scripts, while Americans do not.
</P>
<P>
   If one group of people have really been lambasted over the
Clinton saga, it is the media. Expect the next rash of films to be
about the cynical, corrupt and depraved inhabitants of the nation's
newsrooms. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been laid against the President of
the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low view of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America still has it in for politics, at
least if Hollywood's latest outpourings are anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw three blockbuster films _ ``Primary Colors,''
``Bulworth'' and ``Wag the Dog'' _ which all painted politicians as
venal, corrupt, depraved and obsessed by personal ambition.
</P>
<P>
   This, in itself, was nothing new. After all, the classic film
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' had a similar message: the
innocent comes from outside the city to bring a breath of fresh
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-sticker politics has had it in for big-time politics for
decades, with stickers proclaiming that ``All politicians are
liars,'' or hoping that the Russians would nuke the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   And ask virtually any American in any bar in any city what they
think of Democrats or Republicans, and the gist of the inevitable
tirade is likely to be ``a plague on both their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism about politics and politicians grew throughout the late
1960s, and exploded as the Watergate saga broke. In the postwar
years, there was great faith in government: it had, after all,
ended the Depression, won the war and emerged stronger and more
confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Vietnam, inner-city riots and Watergate
sent public trust plunging. It recovered during the 1980s under
Ronald Reagan, but then sank again in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the cry of ``throw out the rascals'' went out across the
country, there was a rise in insurgent politics: a preference for
non-politicians, whether real non-politicians like the businessman
Ross Perot, the independent candidate for the White House, or
invented non-politicians like Ronald Reagan, who ran as an
anti-Washington, anti-government figure from California.
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian right was on the upswing, deregulating,
privatizing, deunionizing and ridding the nation of the threat of
Big Government. Yet against all the expectations, public trust in
politicians now seems to be rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls show that not only is Bill Clinton's approval
rating solid, but that in general politicians are reasonably
well-regarded. Incredibly, a poll in November showed that 54
percent of Americans trusted the president to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the same polls show little respect for him as a person,
he is widely thought to have done a good job, as are those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup poll, 76 percent of Americans hold
either ``a great deal'' or ``a fair amount'' of confidence in the
federal government to handle international problems, and 61 percent
have a high level of confidence in its ability to handle domestic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though these figures are about 10 percent lower than they were
pre-Watergate, they are significantly higher than in much of the
intervening period.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment made no difference. As Gallup said: ``If any change
has occurred in the past year-and-a-half, it has been in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The last elections showed voters backing incumbents in record
numbers. The nation seemed to be saying: keep the rascals in. Even
the film ``Bulworth'' is about the humanization of a politician, a
man who comes to see what damage he and his colleagues have done.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been something of a sense of the wheel coming
full circle. The repudiation of ``ideology'' and partisanship
around impeachment has been mainly directed at Republicans from the
House of Representatives, led by Newt Gingrich until his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich led an anti-Washington, anti-government crusade, but
ultimately had to face the fact that he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   He and his ``revolutionaries'' attracted a great deal of
criticism; the Senate, entirely composed of professional
politicians, is suddenly seen once again as the repository of
experience and good sense, not a nest of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If this feelgood sense of politicians persists, it may have
important implications for the next presidential election.
Vice-President Al Gore, who is expected to win the Democratic
nomination for the presidency next year, was born in Washington,
the son of a senator, and has worked there most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The early policy positions he has taken are about revitalizing
city centers and conserving the U.S. equivalent of the Green Belt _
activist ideas that seem to resonate with suburban concerns across
America. George W. Bush, his most likely Republican opponent, is
another insider, but he lacks political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, hangs on the economy. The indices
tracking confidence in government correlate closely with rising or
falling personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current boom has been longer than that of the 1980s, and
nearly matches that of the 1960s; hence Bill Clinton gets the
plaudits, whatever voters think of his character. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Americans credit their politicians with creating economic booms,
and blame them for creating recessions, like most electorates. They
are, by comparison with the British, more trusting of public
figures in general, according to a study by Harris Poll and MORI,
except for one category: newsreaders.
</P>
<P>
   The British place implicit trust in the men and women who read
the scripts, while Americans do not.
</P>
<P>
   If one group of people have really been lambasted over the
Clinton saga, it is the media. Expect the next rash of films to be
about the cynical, corrupt and depraved inhabitants of the nation's
newsrooms. &QL;

SANCHEZ VICARIO UPSET; NOVOTNA IS ALSO OUSTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ What started on Thursday with the
Stanford man Paul Goldstein and the Austrian baseliner Barbara
Schett continued Friday with the mountain man Marc Rosset and the
Spanish baseliner Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo.
</P>
<P>
   Seedings no longer have the same power to intimidate. The men
rid themselves of their inferiority complexes long ago, and the
women are rapidly acquiring the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so easy for the 10,'' Schett said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Schett had just proved her point with a
straightforward 6-2, 6-2 defeat of No.4-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The victory would have been a lot more surprising if Schett had
not already beaten the Spaniard just last week in Sydney on her way
to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Lorenzo's 6-3, 6-0 victory over the reigning Wimbledon
champion Jana Novotna in the third round was not nearly as
predictable. It has been a disastrous tournament for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 13 men who came to Melbourne, including No.2-seeded
Alex Corretja and No.4-seeded Carlos Moya, reached the third round.
But now the Spaniards have some consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, seeded third, had not come to Australia since 1995, but
changed her plans late last year. Clearly, she should have stayed
in the northern hemisphere. Novotna routinely struggles in the wind
because of her slice backhand and high-risk attacking game. But the
wind could not have been the only explanation for her
absent-minded, error-filled performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just still in a state of shock, really not knowing what
went wrong, and it was just a nightmare,'' said Novotna, who could
not remember when she had last lost a set at love.
</P>
<P>
   The American Chanda Rubin, a semifinalist here in 1996 before
wrist problems pushed her career off track, reached the fourth
round with a 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-4 victory over No.15-seeded Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus. Rubin is ranked 30th, but she has played much
better than that in 1999, winning a warm-up tournament in Hobart
last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin was still trading ground strokes with Zvereva, Marc
Rosset of Switzerland was finishing off No.6-seeded Tim Henman of
Great Britain, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 7-5, in the third round. The
6-foot-7-inch Rosset, with his thick beard and shaggy hair, looks
these days as if he just returned from a very long walk in the
woods, but he is actually a banker's son from Geneva. And at last
year's U.S.Open, he and his coach, Pierre Simsolo, booked seats and
then changed their minds the day of departure on the Swissair
flight that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 229
passengers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   That the 31st-ranked Rosset should beat one of Britain's tennis
heros in a Grand Slam event is no surprise. He is a former member
of the top 10 and, though consistency has seldom been his forte, he
possesses one of the most wicked forehands and first serves in
tennis. But few would have expressed confidence that Goldstein, a
qualifier ranked No.187, would upset Britain's other tennis hero,
Greg Rusedski, in the second round. But the 22-year-old from
Rockville, Md., who turned professional after graduating from
Stanford last June, topped the No.8-seeded player, 6-4, 6-7 (9-11),
7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rusedski, who has been struggling so far this season, was
hardly in rare form, Goldstein served cleverly, covered court well
and lobbed and returned very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably one of the best guys I've ever played in terms
of returning my serve,'' said Rusedski, the 1997 U.S.Open finalist
who has the fastest and one of the finest serves in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein attended high school and Stanford with President
Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. At Stanford, he was a human biology
major and the first player to be a member of four consecutive
National Collegiate Athletic Association championship tennis teams.
Not surprisingly, he talks nearly as good a game as he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty humbling place,'' he said of Stanford, ``as John
McEnroe said when he came the summer after he got into the semis of
Wimbledon at 18 years of age and was 30 in the world. He shows up
on campus as a freshman and he thinks all the women will be all
over him, and he left after a year because it was like, `I was
nothing there.' I might have misquoted him a little bit, but I
think that's the general gist of it.''  &QL;

LAKERS GET EARLY JUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Minutes into the first practice of
training camp, the Lakers appeared the clear favorites in the NBA,
and not just because they have three All-Stars and the big genie at
center. No, their advantage lies in a simpler axiom: They've got
players.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen players donned the purple and gold Thursday at UC Santa
Barbara's Robertson Gym, and a 14th man, Rick Fox, was on the way,
delayed only by the 405 freeway. Contrast that to Phoenix, where
the poor Suns had just enough players for a game of bridge and it's
clear the Lakers have a 10-meter head start in the 50-game sprint
that starts Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got teams that ain't even got a team yet,'' forward
Robert Horry said, ``and we've got our whole team, plus some. We've
got a lot of guys who have been here before, a lot of guys who have
played together. And that's the key in this league, learning how to
play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's re-signing with the Lakers means all five starters from
last May are back, as are four bench players. And even one of the
new Lakers, Travis Knight, is an old Laker _ back after a year in
Boston. Add three rookies and veteran Derek Harper, and the Lakers
are both talented and deep, ready to embark on a season that
squeezes 50 games into 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Schedules were released Thursday, and some guys got winded just
looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-!ital!sane!off!,'' Eddie Jones said, poring over the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers open Feb. 5 against Houston at the Forum and play
five games in seven nights, ending with a back-to-back at Denver
and Minnesota. They'll have three sets of back-to-back-to-backs
(three games in three nights) and a muscle-melting stretch in
mid-March of six games in six cities in nine nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much time to breathe,'' noted Lakers executive Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy. Crazy,'' said Jones. ``I like stuff like this. That's a
tough schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be who wants it the most, man. Looking at this
schedule, you gotta want it real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for the Lakers to be confident in the
returning nucleus that won 61 games and the newcomers who join
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long, bruising season, so you really need
depth,'' Horry said. ``A team without depth is gonna be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The familiar roster could get one more wrinkle, however.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's deal for Antonio McDyess and Phoenix's related deal
with the coveted Tom Gugliotta were on hold, and the Lakers
continue to hover on the edge of the Gugliotta situation.
</P>
<P>
   If Minnesota sees it will lose Gugliotta _ who can get more from
the Timberwolves than anyone else _ the Wolves might still work a
sign-and-trade with the Lakers to assure getting something in
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're kind of a last resort for Minnesota,'' West
said. ``If they get in trouble with (Gugliotta), then maybe we'll
have some reason to talk. But I think they feel confident they can
still sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   So Elden Campbell's name will continue to surface in trade
rumors for at least a few days, if not right into March and the
NBA's trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   West said nothing was planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on our team. He's here, and I assume he's going to remain
here,'' West said of Campbell. ``We're going to explore
possibilities up to the end, and if there's something we can do we
feel can help our team, we'll try to do that. We like what we have,
and it's really dangerous to tinker with something that's pretty
good already.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Lakers could have difficulty finding enough
minutes to go around. With several players able to play two
positions, they're practically three deep all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   That means a tough time-management job for coach Del Harris, but
he was just thrilled to be back at work after a 204-day lockout and
countless delays this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife this morning that last night was like the first
day of school. I kept waking up about every hour,'' Harris said.
``I kept looking at the clock. It was like that all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Lakers will hold a scrimmage Monday at 5 p.m. at
UCSB's Thunderdome. The public is invited, and admission is
free.... Tickets to all Lakers home games go on sale Sunday at the
Forum box office and all TicketMaster outlets.

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he embroiled in such banal matters as trying to conceal a
tawdry love tryst from his McCarthyite political foes. No, these
charges involve such issues as destroying an empire, taking up arms
against parliament, waging an illegal war and committing genocide
against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, the subject of these allegations enjoys almost
no support from the general public, many of whom would agree that
he is guilty of at least some of these offenses, and should
certainly leave office.
</P>
<P>
   These days very few Russians support Boris Yeltsin. And, for the
past six months, a 15-member Russian parliamentary commission has
been investigating whether there are grounds to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings could scarcely offer a greater contrast from the
Clinton circus. The Moscow media has paid sparse attention,
although it has given plenty of coverage to the Washington
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This interest is partly because Russians see a link between the
more aggressive aspects of U.S. foreign policy, such as the
Anglo-American bombing of Iraq, and White House efforts to distract
attention from the shame of the president; and partly because
skewering a leader over an issue like Monicagate causes universal
astonishment here.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself has given the hearings little heed, not even
bothering to send a Kremlin representative along to defend his
corner. Nor has the general public, as it battles to weather deep
economic depression, shown much interest.
</P>
<P>
   Russians tend to confine themselves to wry comparisons between
the two beleaguered leaders. Would that the moribund and remote
Boris Yeltsin had the energy to chase young women, they remark.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's foes believe that he has committed five impeachable
offenses: destroying the Soviet Union; using force to destroy the
Soviet-era parliament in 1993; illegally waging war in Chechnya _
in which tens of thousands died; undermining the armed forces; and
presiding over the genocide of Russians _ ravaged by poverty,
alcoholism and disease, the population has fallen by 2 million
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, convened by the State Duma, or lower house, has
already concluded that there are grounds to charge him with the
first four. The fifth _ genocide _ has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's Communist chairman, Vadim
Filimonov, the hearings should be completed and the findings sent
to the lower house next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the beginning of a long process which, if nothing
else, illustrates the absence of a separation of powers between the
Kremlin, the judiciary and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   To impeach Yeltsin, his opponents must win a two-thirds majority
in the 450-member Duma. The Supreme Court must then agree that the
President has committed treachery or a crime against the state. The
proceedings would then be reviewed by the Constitutional Court,
before going back to the Federation Council (the upper house) for a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The path is littered with people who owe their jobs to Yeltsin
and is so tortuous that, even if the impeachment passed the first
hurdle, there is no chance that it could be completed before
Yeltsin leaves office next year. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   One leading newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, has condemned the
proceedings as ``a farcical waste of time.'' Even Filimonov
grudgingly admits there is ``a grain of truth'' to the widely held
view that Yeltsin stands no chance of being removed from office.
(As for the charges against Clinton, he agrees that they are
ludicrous.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Filimonov concerned by the fact that three of the Russian
president's alleged crimes _ breaking up the U.S.S.R., shelling
parliament and launching the Chechen war _ were blazingly public
events which happened before Yeltsin was returned to office, with a
comfortable majority, by the electorate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an obstacle,'' he says. ``At the time of the
election these actions had not come under judicial analysis...
People could have thought others were to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: even if everyone knows they cannot
impeach Yeltsin, the issue is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were launched by parliament to defend itself
against dissolution by Yeltsin during their battle with him last
summer over his choice of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new reason to carry on. There are parliamentary
elections in December, and the Communist opposition is unlikely to
miss the chance to use the process to trumpet its case, hammering
Yeltsin and all those who have worked by his side. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he embroiled in such banal matters as trying to conceal a
tawdry love tryst from his McCarthyite political foes. No, these
charges involve such issues as destroying an empire, taking up arms
against parliament, waging an illegal war and committing genocide
against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, the subject of these allegations enjoys almost
no support from the general public, many of whom would agree that
he is guilty of at least some of these offenses, and should
certainly leave office.
</P>
<P>
   These days very few Russians support Boris Yeltsin. And, for the
past six months, a 15-member Russian parliamentary commission has
been investigating whether there are grounds to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings could scarcely offer a greater contrast from the
Clinton circus. The Moscow media has paid sparse attention,
although it has given plenty of coverage to the Washington
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This interest is partly because Russians see a link between the
more aggressive aspects of U.S. foreign policy, such as the
Anglo-American bombing of Iraq, and White House efforts to distract
attention from the shame of the president; and partly because
skewering a leader over an issue like Monicagate causes universal
astonishment here.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself has given the hearings little heed, not even
bothering to send a Kremlin representative along to defend his
corner. Nor has the general public, as it battles to weather deep
economic depression, shown much interest.
</P>
<P>
   Russians tend to confine themselves to wry comparisons between
the two beleaguered leaders. Would that the moribund and remote
Boris Yeltsin had the energy to chase young women, they remark.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's foes believe that he has committed five impeachable
offenses: destroying the Soviet Union; using force to destroy the
Soviet-era parliament in 1993; illegally waging war in Chechnya _
in which tens of thousands died; undermining the armed forces; and
presiding over the genocide of Russians _ ravaged by poverty,
alcoholism and disease, the population has fallen by 2 million
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, convened by the State Duma, or lower house, has
already concluded that there are grounds to charge him with the
first four. The fifth _ genocide _ has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's Communist chairman, Vadim
Filimonov, the hearings should be completed and the findings sent
to the lower house next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the beginning of a long process which, if nothing
else, illustrates the absence of a separation of powers between the
Kremlin, the judiciary and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   To impeach Yeltsin, his opponents must win a two-thirds majority
in the 450-member Duma. The Supreme Court must then agree that the
President has committed treachery or a crime against the state. The
proceedings would then be reviewed by the Constitutional Court,
before going back to the Federation Council (the upper house) for a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The path is littered with people who owe their jobs to Yeltsin
and is so tortuous that, even if the impeachment passed the first
hurdle, there is no chance that it could be completed before
Yeltsin leaves office next year. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   One leading newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, has condemned the
proceedings as ``a farcical waste of time.'' Even Filimonov
grudgingly admits there is ``a grain of truth'' to the widely held
view that Yeltsin stands no chance of being removed from office.
(As for the charges against Clinton, he agrees that they are
ludicrous.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Filimonov concerned by the fact that three of the Russian
president's alleged crimes _ breaking up the U.S.S.R., shelling
parliament and launching the Chechen war _ were blazingly public
events which happened before Yeltsin was returned to office, with a
comfortable majority, by the electorate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an obstacle,'' he says. ``At the time of the
election these actions had not come under judicial analysis...
People could have thought others were to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: even if everyone knows they cannot
impeach Yeltsin, the issue is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were launched by parliament to defend itself
against dissolution by Yeltsin during their battle with him last
summer over his choice of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new reason to carry on. There are parliamentary
elections in December, and the Communist opposition is unlikely to
miss the chance to use the process to trumpet its case, hammering
Yeltsin and all those who have worked by his side. &QL;

<P>
   The last scene in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a sort of
parable of the World Wide Web. The carefully crated Ark is carried
into a gigantic government warehouse. The camera plays over row
after row after row of crates. You know the Ark is about to be
lost, once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's there. But no one knows where. So it is with the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned libraries share common organizing principles: a
card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.
</P>
<P>
   A site that discusses the subject with, well, a good deal less
objectivity is 401k Scam at
http://members.aol.com/scam401k/index.html. &QL;

<P>
   The moral: How far you can go depends on where you start. Start
with Yahoo! and you will probably be frustrated at the paucity of
choices. Start with AltaVista and there is a good chance you'll be
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Excite (www.excite.com) offers a comfortable middle course. When
I searched for ``40lk'' or ``401(k),'' the engine returned with a
list of 20,218 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where I wanted to go, I could visit sites put up by
corporate giants, such as www.quicken.com and
www.fidelityatwork.com (Fidelity's omnibus site for tax-deferred
savings plans), or sites maintained by individual enthusiasts such
as economist William Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other sites worth visiting, arranged according to
the three main issues in 401(k) saving:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETIREMENT PLANNING &LR;  &QL; : Am I saving enough and getting enough
return to
retire at the appointed age?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSET ALLOCATION &LR;  &QL; : How should I invest my money? How much risk
should I
take for a given return?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAN FEES &LR;  &QL; : Is my employer's 401(k) plan a good one? The
central issue
here is how much the plan costs and who pays for it. Diligent
saving and smart asset allocation won't mean much if a plan sinks
from the weight of its expenses or the mediocrity of its choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with retirement planning. One of the most attractive
basic retirement calculator sites belongs to an individual, Tracy
Paul, on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Her site (members.aol.com/tracy/paul/private/index.html) offers
a 401(k) accumulator and a retirement withdrawal plan. But like
other simple calculators, it omits factors like Social Security,
private pensions, and spousal earnings, so its usefulness is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The online retirement calculator offered by Fidelity combines
your expected Social Security benefits, your expected private
pension, if any, and the projected results for your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's site has no provision for private pensions, but it
does allow you to specify expected future living expenses, which
are just as important to a successful retirement as investment
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Many people can substantially improve their retirement outlook
by moving into housing that costs less or by moving to a part of
the country that is less expensive to live in.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, your retirement plan will work when your
accumulated financial assets equal about 20 times the annual
expenses not covered by other income sources. You get to that point
through asset allocation. The question is how to mix your
investment choices to get the highest return at the lowest risk.
</P>
<P>
   For a primer on how asset allocation can help produce a higher
return or lower risk, check out the Index Investor,
www.indexinvestor.com. Then look at William Bernstein's ``Efficient
Frontier: An Online Journal of Practical Asset Allocation''
(www.efficientfrontier.com), a site that combines dark humor with a
solid grounding in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Another good site is Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe's new
venture, Financial Engines, at www.financialengines.com. Intended
as a service for 401(k) plans, Financial Engines forecasts the
chances that a saver will reach his or her goal with a given asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   And my own site, www.scottburns.com, provides a Couch Potato
Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the investment community regularly complained
that people were too conservative as investors. But a new study by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, www.ebri.org, indicates
that 401(k) holdings are now invested much as conventional pension
portfolios are, with just more than 60 percent in equities.
</P>
<P>
   To see if that trend holds true in the future, check in every
once in a while at www.hewitt.com/401kindex, an index of activity
in 401(k) plans; this site is maintained by Hewitt Associates, an
employee-benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the cost of 401(k) plans was a non-issue for
most savers, but that's beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from traditional, defined-benefit pension plans to
defined-contribution 401(k) plans has transformed money management
from a wholesale business into a retail one. In many cases, the
price of managing retirement assets has risen from less than 1
percent a year to more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about how these costs can affect long-term
performance, read the reports on fees from the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at www.dol.gov/dol/pwba.

objectivity is 401k Scam at

   The last scene in ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a sort of
parable of the World Wide Web. The carefully crated Ark is carried
into a gigantic government warehouse. The camera plays over row
after row after row of crates. You know the Ark is about to be
lost, once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's there. But no one knows where. So it is with the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned libraries share common organizing principles: a
card file, the Dewey decimal system. But there's no standard
taxonomy of information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helpful librarians, you have search engines like
Yahoo!, Infoseek, and Excite. They aren't interchangeable. Some,
like Yahoo!, are organized by subject and may produce very limited
responses to queries.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like AltaVista, read and index every word of every file
they can find on the Web. Conducting a complete search on AltaVista
could be your life's work.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shows the variations among search engines better than a
hunt for information about 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ask HotBot to search for two different keywords _ ``40l(k)'' and
``401k'' _ and it will return with 10,866 documents containing
``401k'' and 92,115 documents with the more precise ``401(k)''
phrasing. AltaVista retrieves 70,120 documents containing ``40lk''
and 40,556 containing ``401(k).'' Yahoo! yields a mere 60 sites.

KINGS FALL TO DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The NHL's All-Star break is here, a time
for most players to rest and relax after more than three months of
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   If the Los Angeles Kings wish to maximize their enjoyment of
this idyllic interlude in their season, they will do well to avoid
pondering their recent record, and they will cover their eyes
anytime anyone shows them the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pair of goals by Jozef Stumpel, the Kings entered the
break Thursday night with a 3-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils
before an announced crowd of 11,267 at the Forum. Referee Mick
McGeough disallowed a goal by Donald Audette with 1:02 remaining
because Audette directed the puck into the net with his stick above
his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Kings (16-25-4) to 1-4-1 in their last six
games and 1-3 on their four-game home stand. Next up is a difficult
four-game trip to Dallas, Washington, Buffalo and Philadelphia, and
the Kings will be fortunate if they return from that trek only five
points out of a playoff berth, the distance that separates them
from the postseason at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the importance of the game against the Devils
(25-14-5), coach Larry Robinson juggled his lineup Thursday night.
He benched right wing Pavel Rosa and defenseman Steve Duchesne, and
dressed defensemen Philippe Boucher and Mark Visheau, moving
Visheau to a forward position as he has done several times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   For Boucher, it was his first appearance after 13 consecutive
games as a healthy scratch, and he responded with one assist and
two fights.
</P>
<P>
   For Duchesne, a major disappointment this season since signing
with the Kings as a free agent last summer, being benched probably
was a meant to give him something to think about during the
upcoming hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, nothing is imminent in terms of a
transaction involving Duchesne. General Manager Dave Taylor denied
a report on ESPN of a possible deal sending Duchesne to
Philadelphia for disappointing center Alexandre Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lineup changes, they had no positive effect on the
Kings' play for the game's first 20-odd minutes. The Devils piled
up a 23-4 advantage in shots on goal in the first period and pushed
the margin to 28-4 in the first two minutes of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' first goal was one Jamie Storr would have liked to
have had back, an unscreened slap shot from the top of the right
faceoff circle that beat the Kings' goalie between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings got a break one minute later when Stumpel scored
his first goal of the game, a slap shot from the left circle that
should have been stopped by Martin Brodeur. The Devils' goalie got
only a piece of the puck with his glove, and it trickled into the
net.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the only noise the Kings would make in a first
period dominated by the Devils, who took a 2-1 lead when Bobby
Holik scored from the slot on a power play at 12:21.
</P>
<P>
   Things almost got much worse, when Luc Robitaille received a
double-minor penalty for high sticking late in the period. The
Devils fired 10 shots at Storr during the ensuing power play, but
he stopped them all.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much he could do 42 seconds into the second period,
however, when Scott Niedermayer tucked in the rebound of a shot
from the right point by Brendan Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kings' good fortune that after New Jersey amassed its
two-goal lead, the Devils gradually became more passive on the
attack. In their new role as the aggressors, the Kings began to get
scoring chances, and at 15:31, after Brodeur left a long rebound of
a shot from the left boards by Vladimir Tsyplakov, Stumpel fired
the rebound into the net from the high slot.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Kings trailed by only a goal heading into the final 20
minutes, but the Devils are not a team you want to try to rally
against, given their 18-1-2 record when leading after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were kept in check by Brodeur and the Devils' defense,
and were unable to score in the final 1:10 with Devils defenseman
Ken Daneyko serving a high-sticking penalty and Storr off for an
extra skater, coming closest on Audette's disallowed goal. For the
final 12.8 seconds the Kings had a three-man advantage, when
Niedermayer was sent off for tripping.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some seasonal
shopping, don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget
to get a hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 5 percent or 20 percent, that money is yours. Ask
for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

<P>
   If the stronger U.S. dollar lures you abroad for some seasonal
shopping, don't be one of the two out of three Americans who forget
to get a hefty rebate on their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Asia, a consumption
tax is built into the price of many goods and services. As a
visiting American, you're entitled to a refund on many of those
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Are we talking real money here? In some cases, yes. The rates
for consumption tax vary from country to country, from a relatively
modest 2.9 percent in Singapore to a whopping 20 percent in
Denmark, Italy and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Ireland, you must spend a minimum amount to claim a
refund. The minimum amount also varies (as little as $45 in Denmark
and as much as $340 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein), but in most
countries, you can accumulate purchases over time in order to reach
the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers may also be eligible for refunds on
business-related expenses, depending on the country. For example,
if you stay in a hotel in Germany for business, you (or your
company) can claim a refund on the 16 percent tax you pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, a company not based there may claim a
refund of the 17.5 percent value-added tax its employees pay for
hotels, rental cars, meals, telephone calls, trade shows, and even
marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is in knowing how to get your money back. Let's say
you're in Milan, and you have no choice but to spend $2,000 on a
fabulous dress. You're entitled to a VAT refund of $400.
</P>
<P>
   The store clerk will need your passport _ always carry it when
shopping _ when he or she fills out the refund form. Each purchase
you make will be listed on the form, which must be presented to a
tax official when you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must also be prepared to show the goods you purchased to the
tax-refund agent at the airport when you're flying out of any
country that's a member of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where many Americans get tripped up. If you check
your luggage before you locate a tax-refund kiosk, you might be out
of luck. The tax man can't be certain you're not trying to claim a
refund on goods purchased for a friend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Have the goods available for display. The refund
papers from the places of purchase will be stamped; simply mail
them in, and your charge card will be credited or you'll be sent a
check. Or you may even be handed a cash refund on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Things are a bit more complicated for the business traveler. The
rules differ widely from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   France, for example, will rebate only the 20.6 percent in VAT
paid for phone calls, marketing-consultant services, and trade-show
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K., on the other hand, is relatively generous in rebating
taxes but won't do so for individuals _ only companies. And
companies can file only four times a year for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   There are firms such as EuroVAT (800-828-0609) and Fexco
(800-865-4561) that specialize in recapturing taxes due American
businesses. Their fee is generally 20 percent of the taxes
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in the retail arena, the savings can be enormous.
Let's say the employees of an American-based company spend, in
total, 223 days a year in the U.K. on business.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that these road warriors spend an average $150 a night
on hotels, $35 a day on rental cars and gasoline, and $35 a day on
meals _ all told, about $49,000 a year in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.K. levies a 17.5 percent VAT, a company can obtain a
refund of about $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Canada began honoring corporate claims for
refunds as well. The rates vary from province to province, but
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Quebec will
refund not only the federal sales tax but also the provincial sales
tax, which alone can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says it rebates 5 percent on most business expenses, but
Karen Bostrom, a vice president of sales and marketing with
EuroVAT, says that in practice Japan generally refunds 5 percent
only on hotel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's 5 percent or 20 percent, that money is yours. Ask
for those pounds, francs, yen, or marks back. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE BEATS WEBER STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time for a quick evaluation of the Cal State
Northridge men's basketball team, courtesy of starting forward Jeff
Parris.
</P>
<P>
   So Jeff, which is the real team, the one that nearly blew a
20-point lead to winless Sacramento State on Wednesday night, or
the team that handled the second-best team in the Big Sky
Conference a loss Thursday night?
</P>
<P>
   ``We show two sides. We play with emotion and we play without
emotion,'' Parris said. ``When we play with emotion, we play a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Well put. And blatantly obvious after the fired-up Matadors led
nearly wire-to-wire in a 78-68 victory over Weber State in front of
an announced crowd of 755 at Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (12-8 overall, 4-4 in conference) extended its winning
streak to three and beat a hot team; Weber State (14-6, 5-2) had a
four-game win streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the biggest win we've had recently,'' said
junior center Rico Harris, who scored a team-high 15 and also
grabbed six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the Matadors ``were active... finding open men down
the court and getting dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of rebounding, the Matadors beat the Wildcats
in every meaningful area. CSUN's bench outscored Weber State's
27-9. The Matadors also had 21 assists and shot 53 percent from the
field compared to Weber State's 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys played an all-around good game,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said, ``on both ends of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Parris was typical of the effort. He was 6 of 7 from the floor
for 12 points in only 20 minutes, and he also grabbed two important
rebounds in the final two minutes when the Matadors were in the
midst of five consecutive missed free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And Parris made the play of the game with 4 minutes, 8 seconds
left. He blew by a defender on the baseline, dunked while getting
fouled and gave CSUN a 72-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell said Parris' effort ``really lit a fire under us.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber State, which beat Eastern Washington 101-100 in four
overtimes last Saturday, couldn't get closer than six points the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have crumpled... simply just quit,'' Parris said.
``That's the shot in the arm that we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other sparks. Greg Minor, who was sick with the flu
and didn't suit up on Wednesday, scored nine points and had four
assists in 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Minor made a 3-pointer with 6{ minutes left in the first half
that gave CSUN a 28-18 lead, and the Matadors took his cue. Brian
Heinle made a 20-footer that made it 30-18. Harris made a 3-pointer
from the top of the key to push the lead to 33-21.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN didn't relent. Markus Carr made two consecutive baskets to
give the Matadors a 39-21 lead _ their biggest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats only made one significant run, cutting a 51-35
deficit to 64-60 with 5:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team is going to have a streak at one point,'' Braswell
said. ``We were ahead when they made theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber State forward Harold Arceneaux, the Big Sky's leading
scorer, had a game-high 26 points. But he was only 2 of 9 in first
half.

DRIVING DRUNK TO MEAN LOSS OF THE VEHICLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Starting within the next month, the cars of people
arrested on drunken driving charges in New York City will be seized
on the spot and later forfeited if the drivers are convicted,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to drive drunk,'' Safir said, ``you're going
to face a serious penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   State law currently allows the forfeiture of vehicles owned by
repeat offenders, but it is rarely enforced, officials said. And
critics warned that with forfeiture practices coming under
increasing scrutiny because of abuses by law enforcement agencies,
any attempt to expand forfeiture was likely to face tough legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the new plan withstood those challenges, it would
probably prove so cumbersome in practice that, like the state law,
it would almost never be enforced, said a lawyer who has instructed
prosecutors and police departments around the state on
drunken-driving enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds to me like something that's done to inspire the
public awareness of DWI,'' said the lawyer, Peter Gerstenzang,
author of the book ``Handling the D.W.I. Case in New York.'' ``But
I think once they get into it, they won't forfeit too many cars
because it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the police would be using what he called a
``creative'' interpretation of the city's forfeiture laws, which
give the police the power to seize property used in the commission
of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The cars of people arrested on drunken driving charges are now
held by the police until someone comes to pick them up. Under this
plan, Safir said, the impounded vehicles will be returned only if
the driver is acquitted or if the vehicle belongs to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Upon conviction of a car's owner, the city will begin forfeiture
proceedings to assume ownership of the seized vehicle, Safir said.
Forfeited vehicles could be added to the city's fleet or sold at
auction. Several top city officials drive vehicles that were
forfeited by convicted drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   And, Safir said, because more than 6,000 people are arrested
each year on charges of driving while intoxicated, the city would
have to find room for all the confiscated vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Fisher Ricardella, who heads the New York City chapter
of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, praised the new initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, these drunken drivers are using
their cars as 4,000-pound weapons and are causing a tremendous
amount of carnage on our streets and highways,'' she said. ``A cop
wouldn't walk in on a holdup in a grocery store, take away the
knife and then give it back later.''
</P>
<P>
   While stepped-up enforcement is not part of the plan, Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani said forfeiture would be a welcome addition to
his administration's arsenal of weapons against dangerous driving,
which has included speeding crackdowns and cameras that catch
drivers who run red lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us build on the success we had in reducing
traffic fatalities,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing cars may sound tough, he said, ``but anything we can do
to convince people not to get behind the wheel of the car after
they have had a drink is good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes taking their car from them to convince them that
they should not get behind the wheel of the car after they've had a
drink,'' Giuliani said, ``we're probably saving them a lot of
problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gradess, the executive director of the New York State
Defenders Association, said that the city and Safir were picking an
inopportune time to try to expand the uses of forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing it at a moment in history when forfeiture laws,
even those used to attach property used as the direct instrument of
a crime'' _ such as burglars' tools _ ``are under intense
scrutiny,'' Gradess said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cases where police departments and prosecutors' offices
were accused of seizing cars willy-nilly to expand their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiture laws, he said, ``have been criticized by the Supreme
Court, by the Congress, and state legislatures are slowing down on
the use of forfeiture. Any law enforcement official who is
tinkering with the borders of forfeiture is probably making a
gigantic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, also said he had some concerns about the legality
of the initiative. ``Clearly drunk driving is a serious criminal
offense, but this plan raises serious legal questions,'' Siegel
said. ``What the Giuliani administration wants to do is add a
punishment to the existing punishments for drunk driving. Generally
it is the legislative branch that has to amend the law to add a
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that the city's administrative code gives the Police
Department the power to seize property used as a means of
committing a crime, adding that it should allow the police to seize
cars used by drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 31 people were killed by drunken drivers in New York
City, down 40 percent from 1997, when 52 were killed, the police
said. Arrests on charges of driving while intoxicated also
decreased slightly last year to 6,368, down from 6,836 arrests in
1997, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how many other states, if any, have
enacted similar seizure practices. According to information
compiled in November 1997 by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, 23 states have vehicle confiscation or impoundment
laws for drunken drivers, but most apply only to repeat offenders
or drivers 18 and under.

<P>
   Q: I love my job, but after five years, I am still making the
minimum pay for my position as a data-entry clerk though my
workload has increased significantly. In addition to continued
responsibility for my normal duties, I have been ``granted'' _ for
being such an excellent employee, my boss said _ three grandiose
titles that carry huge new responsibilities. But when I requested a
raise, my boss declined, saying that if she gave me one, she would
have to give all my co-workers one, too. Yet most of them earn more
than I do. So, do I quit a job I love because I am being taken
advantage of, or do I ask to be relieved of some of my duties and
risk angering management? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's see. You make less money than your colleagues and you
do the work of several employees, yet your supervisor claims she
can't give you a raise because then everybody would expect one.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to take that ``kick me'' sign off your back.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the boss recognizes your abilities, and even talks
about your ``excellent'' performance. Your job now is to get her to
put her money where her mouth is by making her realize just how
valuable you are to the organization. And one of the surest ways to
do that, experts say, is to confront your employer with the
possibility of losing you.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she needs to do is look like crazy for another job,''
said Barbara B. Reinhold, career counselor and director of the
career development office at Smith College. Once you have a couple
of offers in hand, ask the boss for a tete-a-tete.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly A. Potter, an author and workplace psychologist in
Berkeley, Calif., advised: ``Go in and say, `Gee, I really love
being here; however, I've got these other offers. I'd really prefer
to stay, but this is what I need.' They may decide that they can
give one individual a raise after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your boss doesn't realize how overworked you are. To
enlighten her _ and to improve your bargaining position _ compile a
list of your achievements and of the duties you perform that are
above and beyond the job you're being paid for, Ms. Potter said.
This will help you to present a compelling case for a raise, she
added, and to avoid going in with your ``head bowed like a puppy
asking, `Can I have a bone?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Keep the discussion focused on your commitment to the company
and the strength of your contributions. Asking to be relieved of
some duties would send the wrong message. ``It makes it sound like
there's something wrong with her,'' Ms. Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this process takes awhile, just getting out there and
looking around at other job options can provide a big boost for
morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make her feel like she has some control,'' Ms.
Reinhold said. ``She can't fall into a victim state. When people
stay in a position over which they feel they have no control, it's
a quick and slippery slope to emotional and physical illness.''
</P>
<P>
   No job is worth that. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last days of 1998, W. Michael Bennett, a citrus grower
and cattle rancher in California's San Joaquin Valley, began a
frenzied race against the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   As sunset temperatures slipped below freezing, Bennett threaded
his truck through 150 acres planted with fruit and vines. In the
glare of headlights, he switched on irrigation pumps and wind
machines that spewed out clouds of warming moisture. After a quick
bite and a few hours' sleep, he returned to the groves to repeat
the process.
</P>
<P>
   It was all to no avail; the entire crop of navel oranges and
lemons, valued the previous year at $115,000, failed. State
agriculture officials estimate that the weather damage to the
state's citrus crop reached $634 million, and Tulare County, where
Bennett's farm is located, was the hardest hit. ``As cold as it
got, we needed more help,'' Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty weather is the ancient enemy of farmers, of course, and
even in this age of high-technology, nobody has yet figured out how
to end a drought or stave off wind and freezing rain. The victims
can only do what they have always done: tighten their belts and
hope for better luck next season.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bennetts, that means making lists of trips to forgo,
purchases to postpone and farm operations to put off. While
disaster insurance and savings give them a safety net against
foreclosure, the couple are determined to get expenses in line with
income _ and everybody in the family, including the two of their
four children who still live at home, is expected to pitch in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a game plan,'' said Bennett, 52, whose father is also
a Central Valley grower. But, he adds, ``I don't know if it's going
to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Marti, 47, isn't about to sink into self pity. The
couple's home, a 3,000-acre ranch in the Sierra Nevada foothills,
five miles from the citrus farm, was part of an original homestead
staked out in 1887 by her great-grandparents, and she displays a
stoicism born of four generations of harsh experience. ``It doesn't
do a thing to pound your head against the wall,'' she said. ``We'll
work with the hand we got.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in addition to the long hours she spends on the ranch, she
will do substitute teaching at the high school 15 miles away in
Porterville, a drive she makes anyway to drop off and pick up her
two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the couple have postponed improvements they planned for
the ranch. They won't buy an $8,500 computer-connected digital
scale, and so will have to continue hauling their cows to the
nearby ranch of Mrs. Bennett's brother to be weighed. Paying $7,000
to increase their stock of bulls from six to eight, in a herd of
200 cattle, will also have to wait another year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennetts have shelved plans to remodel their home, which was
built by Mrs. Bennett's grandparents in 1953, and will let the
energy-efficient windows they purchased for the remodeling collect
dust in storage. ``That stopped dead. We're going to use that money
on the ranch for operating funds,'' Mrs. Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Another spending cut will be borne by the children, who raise
their own mini-herds of show cows to make money for college. With
weekend livestock fairs charging entrance fees of $30 a head,
Brooke, 14, and her brother Casey, 15, will be taking only four
calves, instead of eight, to competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic crop insurance, made available to California
growers from the federal government after an even harsher freeze in
1990, will ease the Bennetts' financial pain but will not erase it.
The insurance pays half of a grower's production costs, which
average $1,500 an acre, said Shirley A. Batchman, a spokeswoman for
the Exeter-based California Citrus Mutual, a grower's association
whose 800 members farm 40 percent of the state's citrus acreage.
</P>
<P>
   For most growers, that will not even cover payments for the
land, she said. Moreover, she said, ``It doesn't give you a penny
to live on.''
</P>
<P>
   Applying that formula, Bennett would qualify for $112,000
(though he hopes to salvage some fruit and would thus receive less
aid). Even so, that won't cover all his debt on his 35 acres and
the 115 acres he owns jointly with his brothers, Robert and
Richard. ``I'll have to go to the lender to ask for a
postponement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bennetts are unusual among farm families in that they
have saved a year's worth of income, Bennett is reluctant to
liquidate what he had mentally stashed away for retirement to meet
operating needs. So he is considering refinancing some land to
preserve that capital.
</P>
<P>
   He is also reluctantly weighing cuts in citrus operations, like
fertilizer feedings and pruning, which are likely to curb future
crop yields and revenue. He has already temporarily let go two
employees, a foreman who worked for him for 15 years and another
farmhand, both eligible for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   Few crop failures force farmers from their land, said Mark L.
Prendergast, a certified financial planner in Fresno. Instead, they
end up with higher debt. ``When they have good years, they buy
tractors; when they have a bad one, they fire their foreman,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prendergast calculated that if the Bennetts sold their land and
invested the proceeds, they would make more in interest and
dividends than they make from farming in the best years.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect seems unfathomable to Bennett, though. ``That would
be one of my last choices,'' he said.

A DELICATE FAMILY AFFAIR  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn.)  (af) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baby boomers seem to be focused on three economic issues: their
homes, their retirements and their children's college educations.
But a fourth potential drain on their resources tends to sneak up
on them: their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the baby boom generation are getting older, and
not all of them are prepared for the financial strains of declining
health. President Clinton addressed this problem last month by
proposing a $1,000-a-year tax credit for the chronically ill and,
in some cases, for the relatives who care for them, but that kind
of money would hardly make a dent in most such health care bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation doesn't have a clue to what caring for a parent
is all about,'' said Virginia Morris, author of ``How to Care for
Aging Parents'' (Workman Publishing, 1996). ``I think in the next
10 years we're all going to get a shock. Not only are people living
longer now, but living longer with disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if your parents have adequate insurance and
savings to handle a medical crisis? And how do you ask? My parents
are in their mid-70s and very independent. How much should I pry?
And should a ``That's none of your business'' be allowed to end the
discussion?
</P>
<P>
   True, it is none of my business right now, but it may become my
business if, say, my father has a stroke and my mother is
overwhelmed by the demands of caring for him. In that case, I
wouldn't hesitate to open my wallet, even at the expense of my four
children.
</P>
<P>
   But I would like to avoid having to make such a choice. My
parents tell me they're fine, and I don't doubt their sincerity.
But do I know how much they have in reserve or how extensively they
have planned? No, and I have never asked. For many families, it's
the same: ``Don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Mayko, 44, of Milford, Conn., never asked. His
parents are in their 80s, and when his father developed Alzheimer's
disease, Mayko helped his mother care for him. Then his mother had
a heart attack, and overnight he became responsible for the care of
both parents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he spends some mornings before work and much of his time
on weekends at their house a few towns away. And while his parents
can still cover most of their health care costs, Mayko knows their
funds are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming, but I tried to keep it out of my mind,''
Mayko said. ``They had no wills and made no arrangements for
long-term care. Now, I'm making decisions on their lives that I'm
not comfortable making.''
</P>
<P>
   For Angela Scott, 46, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., it wasn't so sudden.
One day her mother turned to her and said, ``I think I'm getting
Alzheimer's disease.'' She was right. Her mother moved in with her,
but as the disease progressed, she needed constant custodial care.
While she had some savings and insurance, Ms. Scott and her two
siblings are stuck with bills totaling tens of thousands of dollars
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we can't afford to keep her at home much longer, so
we will have to place her in a nursing home,'' Ms. Scott said.
``Financially there isn't a choice. I'm dreading that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris, the author, says she doesn't think people realize
how expensive care can be. ``Average nursing home care is $40,000 a
year, but you can easily spend $80,000,'' she said. She added that
children need to discuss finances with their parents early, before
they become ill, vulnerable and frightened. The best way to begin
the conversation, she said, is to simply ask them about their
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask them what are their concerns, what are their worries,''
Ms. Morris said. ``The big issue is where are they going to live if
they need long-term care. It lets them take the conversation where
they feel safe. You'll have to bring it up a couple of times.
You're not going to sit down in one conversation and sort this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sensitive topics that need to be addressed, she said, are
whether the parents have or should buy long-term care insurance;
who should have power of attorney over their affairs, if that
becomes necessary; whether they have made a ``living will'' that
designates who should make medical decisions for them when they
can't make their own; what sort of estate planning they have done,
and what benefits they can expect from Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on family dynamics, parents may refuse to discuss any
of this with their children, or may be willing to talk with one
child but not another. For those who prefer to talk with an
outsider, suggest that they consult with a financial planner or an
attorney who specializes in laws affecting the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Certified Financial Planners (800-282-7526 or
www.icfp.org) will provide you with a free list of certified
planners in your area. The National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys
(520-881-4005 or www.naela.org) sells directories for $15 that list
its members by region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, our parents are going to be the dinner-table
conversation,'' Ms. Morris said. ``When we say `day care,' we won't
be talking about our children, we'll be talking about our
parents.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)

 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Securities analysts, highly paid as they are on Wall Street,
often get precious little respect from academics. Perhaps the
analysts' biggest ignominy was research conducted in the late
1970s, whose conclusions since have become part of the ivory
tower's canon. According to those devastating studies, the average
stock that has no analyst following it actually outperforms the
average stock that does.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts, therefore, are to be excused if they
initially disbelieve a new study written by Brad Barber, a
professor at the University of California at Davis, and three of
his colleagues at Berkeley and Stanford. These professors not only
reached the opposite conclusion than those earlier studies; they
also discovered that even the average securities analyst is able to
pick stocks that outperform the market.
</P>
<P>
   Is nothing sacred?
</P>
<P>
   Using data from Zacks Investment Research, the professors
studied more than 360,000 recommendations made between 1985 and
1996 by more than 4,000 brokerage firm research analysts. The
professors constructed a consensus recommendation for each stock
based on the average advice of all analysts who followed it. They
then constructed several portfolios from these consensus
recommendations. For example, one portfolio had only the stocks
with the strongest consensus recommendations, while another had
just those with the weakest.
</P>
<P>
   The results? Over the 11 years through the end of 1996, the
portfolio containing stocks with the strongest consensus
recommendations gained an annualized 18.8 percent, outperforming
the Wilshire 5000 by 4 percentage points per year. Even more
impressively, it outperformed the portfolio containing the weakest
stocks by 13 percentage points per year.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that this result is a fluke. For example, the
professors found that, without exception, the highest consensus
recommendations outperformed the lowest in each of the 11 years.
And similar results were reached by another study of security
analysts who write investment newsletters. According to my
calculations, between 1980 and 1996, a portfolio of investment
newsletters' most-recommended stocks beat the market by 3 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before you rush out to buy the consensus recommendations,
however, you need to be aware of two things. First, the professors
found that their pattern was most pronounced for small- and mid-cap
stocks. For the few hundred largest companies, like those in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, they found no significant
difference in the performance of the stocks that analysts liked the
most and those they liked least.
</P>
<P>
   Second, neither study took transaction costs into account. Such
costs can easily defeat the strategy, because the turnover rate for
following the highest consensus recommendations can be more than
300 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that transaction costs substantially reduce this
strategy's return is not as disappointing as you might otherwise
think. All it means is that the consensus of analyst
recommendations can't stand alone as the only factor you look at
when constructing your portfolio. But that doesn't mean it can't
play a valuable supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   When you've decided to buy stocks, for example, you've already
committed to paying a commission and a bid-ask spread anyway. In
such a case, the professors' study suggests that it would be worth
your while to take into account the consensus of analyst
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   This advice applies even more strongly when you have decided to
sell some of your stock holdings. This is because the lowest
consensus recommendations underperform the market by even more than
the strongest ones outperform.
</P>
<P>
   Where can you find the consensus recommendation on your
particular stock? They are widely available on a number of Internet
sites, including cbs.marketwatch.com. Alternately, you can
subscribe to services like Analyst Watch, published by Zacks
(www.zacks.com) &QL;

<P>
   In the Canadian Rockies last summer, Peter and Sheryl Neupert
perched on a purple tandem bicycle and looked up one of the
steepest hills they had ever seen. Most other bikers in their group
demurred, but the Neuperts pushed on _ with Sheryl providing the
kick to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an animal,'' said Neupert, starry-eyed. ``She is the
stoker.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet the new chief executive of Drugstore.com, a ballyhooed
on-line pharmacy that plans to introduce its Web site sometime this
quarter, and his wife, both former Microsoft executives, who are
now in for the ride of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, just about everybody and their pharmacist has awakened
to the idea of putting a drugstore on the Internet and creating the
Amazon.com of analgesics. Rite Aid, Drug Emporium and Wal-Mart
Stores are among the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Those household names, however, have a track record. While
Drugstore.com, based in Redmond, Wash., has enjoyed a lot of
advance publicity, thanks to backing by the marquee venture
capitalist firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, it lacks
established relationships with drug makers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Neupert, 42. As a Microsoft executive for 11 years, he
catapulted the Windows operating system from an also-ran in Japan
to the market leader there, and he was instrumental in the creation
three years ago of MSNBC, the 24-hour cable news station. (He was
proud enough of his role to order a vanity license plate reading
MSNBC for his car.)
</P>
<P>
   Neupert believes that the key to success will be to emphasize
the convenience _ and anonymity _ of shopping on the Internet.
``It's better to get condoms in a box than at the checkout line,''
he said. In general, he added, ``the drugstore experience today
isn't a pleasant one.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the huge domestic market in pharmaceuticals _ $150
billion in 1997, the most recent data available _ leaves plenty of
room for him as well as any competitors. Neupert hopes
Drugstore.com will be able to go public within a year, maybe as
soon as in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The business plan was drawn up a year ago by Jed Smith, a
marketing executive with Cybersmith, a chain of cybercafes. Last
April, Kleiner Perkins agreed to provide the first of several
rounds of financing of several million dollars each, aimed at
giving it a 30 percent stake in the company. In July, it chose
Neupert to run the venture. (Smith is a vice president.)
</P>
<P>
   Neupert, said Brook H. Byers, a partner in Kleiner, based in
Menlo Park, Calif., ``was our dream hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Neupert's single-mindedness shows up in his private pleasures,
too. An avid biker, hiker and jogger, he made up his mind to run a
marathon in less than three hours, and entered five races until he
succeeded. Some associates say his doggedness is accompanied by
levity; when working in New York with NBC, where blue suits are the
order of the day, Neupert would often wear a sequined red-and-green
Christmas tie.
</P>
<P>
   Other colleagues and underlings, however, describe him as an
``uber-achiever'' with little time for water-cooler banter. He
inspires respect _ and sometimes fear, when his standards are not
met, they say. Neupert indirectly confirms that, declaring he
``does not suffer fools'' gladly.
</P>
<P>
   The color of the Drugstore.com logo is purple, and, true to
form, Neupert wore a purple tie along with his blue suit during an
interview earlier this month at an upscale hotel in San Francisco.
His speech was deliberate, and he seemed less a salesman than an
academic.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of his tenacity were sown early. In high school in
Portland, Ore., he finished No. 1 in his class _ not the first in
his family to make that grade. Decades earlier, his father, Karl
Frederic Neupert, led his class at the Naval Academy and served six
years as a commander during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Neupert went on to found a successful wholesale
plumbing company. Peter remembers him as loving but strict: On
Christmas, he wouldn't let his six children open presents until
their rooms were inspected for neatness. ``It wasn't like we grew
up like we were in the military,'' said Neupert, who wears the
Naval Academy ring he inherited from his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Neupert said he decided to breathe more freely when he left
the nest. At Colorado College, he emphasized learning, not grades,
and majored in philosophy. He eventually got a master's degree at
the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, gave a shot
at the family business, did a stint as chief operating officer of a
small software company in Portland and then settled in at
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm, at least outwardly, pales next to his wife's.
When they met, Sheryl was director of recruiting at Microsoft, and
she agreed to date him only because, she says, he wouldn't quit
asking. She calls him ``Neupert,'' not Peter. ``I thought `Neupert'
sounded stronger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When not caring for the couple's two children, Ms. Neupert, who
speaks at a racehorse's pace, remains his unofficial business
consultant. In fact, before Neupert took the job at Drug-store.com,
it was she who gave the company's board a final grilling. Neupert
said he knows business strategy, his wife knows people, and the
combination is formidable.
</P>
<P>
   It had better be. The mountain they are about to climb is
formidable, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Press kits, the glossy bundles of information that car
manufacturers send to journalists, are typically triumphal
documents, harking sales records broken and heralding new products
born. Somewhere in the files I am sure there is a press packet that
begins, ``It promises to be another banner year for Yugo.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's press kit for 1999 begins on a more measured note,
soberly observing that the company nearly succumbed to ``economic
Darwinism'' earlier in the decade, when it was almost devoured by
Renault SA of France.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Volvo AB has again appeared on the corporate
dinner table; Fiat SpA, the Ford Motor Co. and possibly others have
been weighing a purchase of the Swedish company's automotive
division. The buzz has sent Volvo's stock shooting up, then down,
then up again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a a decade of auto mega-mergers, Volvo and Porsche are,
for now, the last two independents of consequence left standing. GM
bought Saab; Ford bought Aston Martin, Jaguar and control of Mazda;
Fiat bought Ferrari and Maserati, Hyundai bought Kia; Volkswagen
bought Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini; BMW bought Rover and
Rolls-Royce; Mercedes bought Chrysler _ or was it the other way
around?
</P>
<P>
   However much business sense these mergers make, it is hard not
to mourn the loss of diversity they augur. Imagine an international
potluck dinner where everybody brings a tuna casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, the Volvo S80 is more than just a roundly
excellent car; it is a declaration of la difference. It proves that
a relatively small car company can compete against the merged
global mastodons.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad there are not more small car companies left to take
heart at this.
</P>
<P>
   When the swoopy C70 came out last year, you might have imagined
the designers shouting ``Eureka!'' and running, like Archimedes,
through Volvo's hometown of Goteborg, their French curves held
aloft. But the S80 proves that they have not forgotten how to draw
a straight line. An elegant crease in the sheet metal travels from
the blunt nose to the taillights, creating rounded shoulders across
the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Trimmed in matte black, with crystal-like headlamps flanking the
familiar grille, the S80 has a look that is formal but functional
(though compared with the S90 it replaces, it seems positively
wanton). In fact, with a 0.28 drag coefficient _ a measure of
aerodynamics _ it is one of the most slippery shapes in the big-car
market.
</P>
<P>
   At 189.8 inches in length, the S80 is roughly the size of a
Mercedes E-Class. At night, when you activate the ``home safe
lighting'' _ a security system that surrounds the parked car with
pools of light _ it looks more like a full-size UFO.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the S80 is spacious and quietly elegant, and the leather
seats have the quality of a good Italian sofa. I drove the test
car, a turbo-charged T6, more than 1,200 miles over a holiday
weekend, and at the end I could have happily gone another 1,000 or
so. Those are some great seats.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel has a strict aeronautic look, with
white-on-black analog dials and a useful trip computer (so many are
not) tucked in the corner. The center console presents climate and
audio controls in banks of logically placed soft-touch switches.
The materials range from pebbled vinyl on the dash to a
Chippendale-like walnut wainscotting that circles the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost smell the midnight oil; thoughtful touches greet
you everywhere. Air outlets on the center pillars provide lots of
circulation in the back. Cup holders spring from every armrest.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect some will buy the S80 for the trunk alone. There are
hooks from which to hang plastic supermarket bags, nets to secure
loose cargo and a retractable strap that will hold a paper grocery
bag snugly in the corner. (Somebody in Volvo's design department
may have an eating disorder.)
</P>
<P>
   For the trips to the wholesale warehouse store, the rear seats
fold individually, and there is a pass-through for skis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the S80 seems safe. In addition to front and side air
bags (using a new gas that is said not to irritate eyes or skin),
the S80 features an ``inflatable curtain'' that pops out of the
headliner in a side collision.
</P>
<P>
   The S80 also has what Volvo calls a whiplash protection system.
If the car is rear-ended, the front seatbacks move backward with
the occupant, then tip a bit to counter the force of the rebound.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concluded, after testing
the system at Volvo's request, that it significantly reduced the
neck movements that cause whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Add to that five sets of three-point harnesses with pyrotechnic
pretensioners, smart air bags (they deploy with variable force
depending on whether one is belted) and a rugged body structure,
and the Volvo S80 has the goods to appeal to the most chronically
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Volvo, I half-wished somebody would hit me so I
could see some of this exotic equipment in action. I have no such
dark thoughts at the wheel of, say, a Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Other active-safety measures are in place, as well: four-wheel
anti-lock disk brakes, a traction control and, this month, an
electronic stability control that makes handling on slippery
surfaces more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Volvos were noted for their safety features, too. What
is different is that the S80 feels a lot tighter and heftier than
past Volvos _ a sense of gravitas that makes you trust the car the
moment you sit in it.
</P>
<P>
   Powering the S80 is a 2.9-liter, multi-valve, in-line six
cylinder ladled with high-tech controls, including variable valve
timing and an electronic ``drive by wire'' throttle. The T6 has
light-pressure twin turbos, bumping horsepower from 201 to a stout
268.
</P>
<P>
   This engine, backed by a four-speed automatic transmission
(produced by GM, interestingly) sends the 3,690-pound car to
V8-caliber speeds _ 0 to 60 m.p.h. takes 6.5 seconds and the top
speed, limited by a computer chip, is 133 m.p.h. At lead-footed
cruising speeds the S80 T6 can travel an astounding 550 miles on 20
gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The walnut-topped shifter can be slipped into a semi-manual
Geartronic shift gate. Deft stirring of the shifter will prompt the
S80 T6 to spurt through city traffic like a bottle rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Steering is light and accurate at speed, but around town the
turning radius is limited by the wide six-cylinder engine mounted
sideways in the engine bay, leaving rather less room for the wheels
to operate. Parallel parking is more delicate than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is saddle-stiff in the European mode, but comfortable.
The suspension (rear multi-link, front struts) absorbs jolts and
recovers quickly. Shoed with 16-inch Michelin Pilot tires, the T6
grips corners and keeps its poise in abrupt maneuvers, wh
limited-slip differential compensates for any spin on the front,
driving wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Global in appeal, the car's heart is rooted in Scandinavia. You
see it in the dual-mode heated seats, heated outside mirrors,
headlight washers and a defroster that will blast your hair into a
Don King 'do.
</P>
<P>
   As a brand, Volvo has needed to wriggle out of the ``boxy and
safe'' handcuffs it fashioned for itself. The finely finished,
athletic S80 should help. The base-model 2.9 starts at $36,395, and
the T6 at around $40,000; the test car had a lot of content for
$43,755.
</P>
<P>
   The S80 is so good it could open up new vistas of snob appeal
for the company. Enjoy it while you can. The S80 may be the last
hurrah of a free, Swedish-controlled Volvo. &QL;

ASSESSING THE RISK FOR ACTIVE MANAGERS

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
(af) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with the sharp rebound in Brazilian stocks, the world's
emerging markets are still down nearly 50 percent from their 1997
highs, bringing more than a few fund managers' reputations down
with them. Another casualty of the selloff: the widely held notion
that emerging markets are fertile ground for active fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, emerging markets remain a place where many investors
believe actively managed funds have an edge. Some experts who
concede that few large-cap mutual funds will consistently beat the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of large-capitalization stocks insist
that over time, stock pickers can still outperform indices in
out-of-the-way foreign markets by buying undiscovered stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The inefficiencies of such markets, they argue, make them ripe
for the cherry-picking style of active management. Moreover, when
emerging markets plummet, active managers have the option of
fleeing to the safety of cash or, in some cases, less volatile
locales.
</P>
<P>
   But the carnage of late in emerging stock exchanges suggests
otherwise. Consider: The 164 actively managed emerging-market funds
tracked by Morningstar Inc. fell 26.9 percent last year, far more
than the 18.2 percent loss by the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock
Index fund, the only emerging-market index fund tracked by
Morningstar, the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Why would this be? The price of research on emerging-market
stocks is one probable culprit. But even more important are the
enormous trading costs such stocks carry. A round-trip purchase and
sale of a block of stock on a typical emerging market usually costs
about 4.5 percent of the value of the stock, said Joshua Feuerman,
manager of the State Street Global Advisors Emerging Markets fund
in Boston. ``It's a disgustingly expensive asset class to trade
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And because turnover at actively managed funds is more than four
times that of the Vanguard offering's 19 percent, such costs are
bound to hit active managers harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is not whether the market is inefficient or
not, it's whether you can overcome any inefficiency and add value
beyond the costs of obtaining information and the bid-offer
spreads. That is probably why active managers fail in the emerging
markets,'' said Larry Swedroe, a financial author and principal at
Buckingham Asset Management in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Indexing the emerging markets is a very subjective discipline,
involving different component companies and country weightings.
``You can have perfect correlation with the S&AMP;P 500, but to have
perfect correlation with a Russian index is totally different,''
said David Masters, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's Micropal, a
research firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard fund is a good example: It doesn't track any
benchmark emerging markets index stock for stock; instead, it
parallels a custom Morgan Stanley index that excludes countries
with liquidity, foreign-exchange or settlement problems. That
helped the fund last year when Russia and other countries that
didn't meet the fund's criteria encountered serious problems, but
it made for bigger losses in 1997 when the fund's overweighted
investments in more liquid Southeast Asia were pummeled by currency
devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Vanguard fund simply lucky it beat actively managed funds
because the particulars of its custom index kept it from the worst
trouble? That is a ``potentially valid argument'' when it comes to
beating the benchmark Morgan Stanley emerging markets free index,
which fell 25.3 percent last year, said Gus Sauter, who runs the
fund and about two dozen others at Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   But ``insofar as how we outperformed active managers, it doesn't
hold, for most active managers are not in those countries for the
same reason we're not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second big selling point of active management, that a fund
can sidestep market drops by selling when a market starts to
tumble, has also proven problematic. Liquidity dries up quickly,
leaving managers two choices: sit tight or sell into a falling
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In aggregate, active managers can't get out of the market,''
Sauter added. ``For everybody who gets out, there's somebody who
must get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Active managers defend emerging-market stock-picking, noting
that while they lagged the benchmarks during last year's downdraft,
``active managers have beaten the indexes handily'' in some years,
said Robert Pozen, president of Fidelity Management and &UR;  &LR; Research,
who oversees all of Fidelity Investment's fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   But other support exists for indexing. According to Micropal,
the United States global emerging-market equity funds it tracks
fell an average of 26 percent last year and had annualized losses
of 8.3 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively, for the three- and
five-year periods ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the Barings emerging market extended index fell
by 18.8 percent last year and reported annualized losses of 7.23
percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, for the three- and
five-years periods. Another emerging-market index, the
International Finance composite, fell 22 percent for the year and
lost an annualized 10.1 percent for both the three- and five-year
periods.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that of the few emerging-market funds that
beat Vanguard last year, two are somewhat passively managed, have
low portfolio turnover and use some quantitative techniques:
Dimensional Fund Advisors Emerging Markets Portfolio, which fell
9.4 percent, and State Street Global Advisors Emerging Markets,
which fell 15.9 percent.

ROBITAILLE ADDED TO ALL-STAR ROSTER
</HEADLINE>

(OPTIONAL: New lead) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he scored his 500th goal earlier in the month, Luc
Robitaille's teammates presented him with a home-entertainment
system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Robitaille returned the favor by showing up in
the dressing room with Dom Perignon, which unfortunately for the
Los Angeles Kings is not the name of a high-scoring forward but a
fancy brand of champagne. Robitaille gave each of his teammates a
bottle of bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL then gave Robitaille an overdue reward for his 25-goal
season: an invitation to Sunday's All-Star Game in Tampa.
Robitaille was added to the North American roster after Detroit's
Steve Yzerman suffered a cut above his right eye and a broken nose
when struck by a puck Thursday night against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Robitaille said of the invitation. ``It's a
privilege to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his gift to his teammates, Robitaille said, ``The guys
have been great. I was trying to think what to get them. What do
you get guys who have everything?''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille gave them the champagne with one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   Said Robitaille, ``I told them, `Not on game day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Time for recess: Kings coach Larry Robinson said he is hoping
the All-Star break will rejuvenate his players, not just physically
but mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have nagging injuries and their groins are a little
tight,'' Robinson said. ``It's a great time for them to get a
little break and get away from the rink.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he may try to give his players more time away from
the ice when the season resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get stale,'' he said. ``And how many different ways can
you explain the game of hockey? If you just keep harping on them,
doing the same things, after awhile you do get stale. It's great to
get away from the rink once in awhile. We're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of practices on some days, Robinson said the Kings may
work on weight training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes don't lose their conditioning in one day,'' he said.
``We're going to look at doing a lot of gym work, especially guys
who play a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring drought: The Kings' defensemen entered play Thursday
with a combined 10 goals, among the fewest of any team in the
league and two fewer than Dallas' Darryl Sydor (an ex-King) and St.
Louis' Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have more rounded goal-scoring,'' said Rob
Blake, who began the night leading Kings defensemen with three
goals despite missing 18 games this season due to injury and
suspension. ``Right now, the only guy scoring consistently is
Luc.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake led NHL defensemen with 23 goals last season, 11 on the
power play. Asked about his drop in goal scoring this year, Blake
said, ``Most of my goals come on the power play, and the power play
hasn't been that good. You need your defensemen scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he tough enough?: Robinson said this week that he has
questioned whether he is hard enough on his players, but Blake said
he doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry can say all he wants,'' Blake said, ``but it's up to the
guys on the ice to do it.''

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Boston College coach Al Skinner knew there
would be nights like this. Nights when everything he drew up on the
sidelines would unravel the minute his players took the floor.
Nights when the opposition would appear that much bigger, that much
stronger, that much more menacing and physical than his team. And
nights when the flaws of his undersized and inexperienced team
would be exposed and exploited for an unrelenting 40 mintues.
</P>
<P>
   In short, nights when all would seem like a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was such a night.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately looking to snap a six-game losing streak by winning
its first Big East game of the season, BC instead wound up
absorbing its worst loss of the season and worst ever in conference
play _ a 90-51 thrashing by No. 20 Syracuse before a Carrier Dome
crowd of 18,161 that witnessed the third-most lopsided game in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   With a team that returned no starters and no one over 6 feet 8
inches, Skinner was braced to take his lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know when it's going to happen,'' said Skinner,
whose team had only two starters score in double figures, Kenny
Harley (14) and Michael Cotton (10). ``I've always said there's two
sides to this coin. We're going to have nights like this and
there's going to be nights when we're going to put it together. And
tonight was that other side of the coin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who trailed, 45-19, at intermission after converting
just 7 of 29 field goal attempts, dropped to 3-13 overall and 0-8
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Syracuse (13-5, 5-4) rebounded from a 74-71 loss at
Rutgers Monday by recording its most lopsided conference victory,
surpassing a 36-point romp over BC at the Carrier Dome Feb. 20,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have a game like this, no question,'' said
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. ``You don't want to have to slug it out
every time you play, which will be the case just about every game
the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Feb. 24 rematch with BC at Conte
Forum, one supposes.
</P>
<P>
   Etan Thomas, Syracuse's 6-9 junior swatmeister, led the
Orangemen with 14 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 blocked shots, giving
him 72 rejections for the season. Thomas scored 11 points and got
all of his blocks in an 11-minute cameo in the first half to help
Syracuse storm to a 28-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who managed to score just 9 points in the first
10:06, faced their biggest halftime deficit of the season. And it
only got bigger in the second half, thanks in large part to Eric
Williams, who chipped in 10 of his 12 in the second half to help
the Orangemen lead by as many as 40, 81-41, with 5:11 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's decided height advantage translated into an easy
victory on the boards, where it outrebounded BC, 56-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the rebounding and the aggressive play on the
perimeter, they were just too physical and we were not prepared for
that,'' said Skinner, whose team must regroup before Miami visits
Conte Forum Sunday. ``It was just that simple. It was a very
physical basketball game and, right now, we just couldn't stand up
to them.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins went into the All-Star break Thursday night
at a loss, literally.
</P>
<P>
   They fell to the Ottawa Senators, 3-1, at the FleetCenter, and
some players feel there are times when some members of the club
aren't on the same page or the same bookshelf or even in the same
library.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins are going to make it to the postseason, they're
going to have to do a better job of reading _ each other, the
coach, whomever. Coach Pat Burns is clearly frustrated by the
overly fancy play of the top line, Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov,
and Dmitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't skate up the ice and try to be fancy and dance
around with the puck in the neutral zone,'' said Burns. ``You can't
do that with that club. You've got to put it in behind them and
grind them. That's what you have to do and we didn't do it. All
lines didn't do it. Some did, some didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Boston took a tumble at the hands of the Senators
was March 22, 1997, when Ottawa took a 5-4 decision. Boston's 5-0-2
streak had been its longest current unbeaten run against one
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your good players have to play,'' said Burns. ``If your good
players don't play, you're not going to win. Our good players have
to rise to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period was scoreless, with the Bruins outshooting the
Senators, 8-6. In the second, the clubs traded late goals 47
seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators struck first with forward Bruce Gardiner scoring
his fourth of the season at 18:06. Alexei Yashin had the puck in
the right circle and managed to fight off defenseman Hal Gill to
keep control. He found Gardiner in the slot and Gardiner fired a
shot past goalie Byron Dafoe for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins responded right away, with Khristich scoring his
20th. Khristich gained the blue line and dished a pass over to
Allison. Allison ripped a shot that goalie Ron Tugnutt kicked out
with his right pad. But Khristich charged in and snagged the
rebound, beating the netminder with a forehand shot at 18:53.
</P>
<P>
   That deadlock didn't last long, as the Senators took the lead
for good in the first minute of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruin Shawn McEachern got the puck behind the net and
fired it out to the right side. Sami Salo, who was at the right
point, blasted a shot that sailed past the glove of Dafoe for a 2-1
lead at the 55-second mark. McEachern added an empty-netter at
19:19 to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had their opportunities, especially in the second
period, with a five-on-three advantage for 24 seconds. But they
couldn't manage a shot on net during that time. The closest they
came was when Ray Bourque passed the puck down to Allison, who had
a hard time controlling the redirect attempt and shot wide.
</P>
<P>
   The tone in the dressing room was one of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to either be overly skilled or very disciplined,''
said right wing Rob DiMaio. ``I don't think we're overly skilled. I
think we have to be very disciplined to win. I thought at times we
played well but we make the crucial mistake at the wrong time and
they're a very opportunistic team. They capitalize on mistakes, and
every one we made, they seemed to score on.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 43 games, the Bruins are actually on a slightly better
pace than last season. A year ago, they were 19-16-8. Now they're
20-16-7. However, to some it doesn't feel like improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was such a new experience for everybody,'' said
DiMaio. ``This year, we're a group of guys who know what the
capabilities are and for some reason we're slipping a little bit in
certain areas and we're not being that solid team that you knew
last year was going to come out and do the same thing every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's like we're taking some shortcuts or being fancy or
doing things uncharacteristic of this team. Until that changes,
we're going to have these problems once in a while.''

MCEACHERN A SENATOR IN A GREAT STATE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The summer of 1996 had just begun and Shawn McEachern
was coming off a nice season with the Bruins. And he was headed out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   He was not thrilled about the idea. His wife, Andrea, was
pregnant. The Ottawa Senators looked to be going nowhere. After
growing up in Waltham, playing at Matignon and Boston University,
then bouncing around the National Hockey League, McEachern had been
home for just a bit and now he was gone again. He was traded by the
Bruins to Ottawa for Trent McCleary and a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it didn't work out,'' McEachern said. ``I
thought I had a pretty good year here and they wanted to go in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Money was going to be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the Senators he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous about going to Ottawa,'' McEachern
said. ``They were the worst team in the league at the time. But
things have worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Very well.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was the latest example.
</P>
<P>
   McEachern, who turns 30 next month, was a major pain in the
Bruins' backside all evening. When Ottawa's 3-1 victory was over,
he had a goal and an assist, and his red-hot team had run its road
unbeaten streak to seven games at 6-0-1.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy McEachern set up the winner after a steal behind the
net and late won a footrace to score into an empty net with 41
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, after a busy and highly successful January, are
rolling along at 25-15-6 and McEachern is rolling with them. The
empty-netter was his team-leading 21st goal, and he now has 18
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn has played very well,'' said Senators coach Jacques
Martin. ``He's been a key performer for us for the last two years.
It's not only his scoring, but his speed. He's improved his defense
tremendously and he's provided us with some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, on a new line, he provided a bit of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played all year with (Alexei) Yashin,'' Martin said.
``But they like to check that line. That's why I broke them up.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to bother McEachern.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, he and Vaclav Prospal pestered
Ray Bourque into coughing up the puck while the Bruins were
shorthanded. The Bruins lucked out when McEachern was called for
interference on Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   The next time he stole the puck, the Bruins were not so
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   He was behind the Bruin net, intercepted a pass and threw it out
front, and it deflected to Sami Salo, who was moving in. Salo let
go a blast that beat Byron Dafoe high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his first goal, but he's got a bomb, that guy, for a
shot,'' McEachern said.
</P>
<P>
   That killer goal came with 55 seconds left in the second period
and made it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   McEachern's scoring totals have him headed for a career year;
his best was 1992-93 with the Penguins when he had 28 goals and 33
assists.
</P>
<P>
   He loves the fact that the team is doing so well. He likes being
with a team for a third straight year (a first for him) and with a
coaching staff that has been stable as well.
</P>
<P>
   And while his family comes back to Massachusetts for the
summers, Ottawa is a good place to spend the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun team to play for,'' McEachern said. ``We're in a
small town and I've got the kids up there. I'm enjoying myself. We
see each other a lot. You go to the grocery store or to rent a
video and you run into Bruce Gardiner. It's small.'
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, things have worked out pretty well.

KINGS FALL TO DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The NHL's All-Star break is here, a time for
most players to rest and relax after more than three months of
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Los Angeles Kings really want to maximize their
enjoyment of this idyllic interlude in their season, they will do
well to avoid pondering their recent record, and they'll cover
their eyes if someone shows them the Western Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Luc Robitaille was added to the North American team
for Sunday's All-Star Game in Tampa after Detroit captain Steve
Yzerman's nose was broken Thursday against Carolina when he was hit
by a pass from Carolina's Paul Coffey. Robitaille joins Kings
teammates Rob Blake and Mattias Norstrom in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Robitaille was not thinking about his latest honor after the
Kings' 3-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils (before an announced crowd
of 11,267 at the Forum) on a night when disappointing defenseman
Steve Duchesne was benched by coach Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' Robitaille said after the Kings (16-25-4)
dropped to 1-4-1 in their past six games. ``We're going to have to
play really desperate now. We need everybody to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the All-Star break, the Kings embark on a difficult
four-game trip to Dallas, Washington, Buffalo and Philadelphia. The
Kings will be fortunate if they return from that trek only five
points out of a playoff berth, the distance that separates them
from the postseason at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Kings fell despite two goals by Jozef Stumpel.
Referee Mick McGeough disallowed a goal by Donald Audette with 1:02
remaining because Audette directed the puck into the net with his
stick above his shoulders. Thus, the Kings concluded a four-game
homestand with a 1-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we needed to win all four to keep our momentum going
and keep everybody feeling positive about themselves,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils got first-period goals from Randy McKay and Bobby
Holik, with Stumpel's first goal sandwiched between them. Kings
goalie Jamie Storr should have had McKay's goal, an unscreened
40-footer that beat him between his pads. On the other hand, the
Kings were outshot 23-4 in the first period, but trailed by only a
2-1 margin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer made it 3-1 at the 42-second mark of the
second period, but Stumpel brought the Kings within a goal 15
minutes later. The Kings had Storr off for an extra skater and were
on a power play when Audette appeared to tie the score in the final
minute, but there was no argument from the Kings on McGeough's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson juggled his lineup for the game, benching right wing
Pavel Rosa and defenseman Steve Duchesne, and dressing defensemen
Philippe Boucher and Mark Visheau, then moving Visheau to a forward
position as he has done several times this season.
</P>
<P>
   For Boucher, it was his first appearance after 13 consecutive
games as a healthy scratch, and he responded with one assist and
two fights.
</P>
<P>
   For Duchesne, a bust this season since signing with the Kings as
a free agent last summer, being benched clearly was intended to
give him something to think about during the upcoming hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, nothing is imminent in terms of a
transaction involving Duchesne. General Manager Dave Taylor denied
a report on ESPN of a possible deal sending Duchesne to
Philadelphia for disappointing center Alexandre Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   Of Duchesne, Robinson said, ``I spoke to (Duchesne) about it. I
thought a couple of times he could have been more physical (in
Tuesday's 5-4 loss to Colorado). ... I don't say he's got to be a
physical player. But when the opportunity is there, you've got to
play the body.''

JUDGE TO DECIDE ON AN AFFIDAVIT IN GUN LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge is expected to decide Friday whether
criticism of the gun industry by a former gun company executive
will be presented to a jury in a case that seeks to hold the
industry liable for shootings with illegally obtained handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The former executive, Robert I. Hass, who until 1989 was a
senior vice president of marketing and sales for Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp., the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, has charged in an
affidavit and a deposition that gun makers and wholesalers do not
do all they can to keep their products from falling into the hands
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Hass charged that his former company, and the firearms industry
as a whole, knew that the ``black market in firearms is not simply
the result of stolen guns but is due to the seepage of guns into
the illicit market from multiple thousands of unsupervised'' gun
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the case _ a lawsuit in which relatives of six
people killed by illegally possessed handguns and a seventh person
wounded by one _ are seeking in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to
hold more than 40 gun makers and wholesalers, including Smith &AMP;
Wesson, liable for the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that the companies have marketed and
distributed handguns so negligently that dealers in states with
weak gun control laws are oversupplied and that many of the excess
guns end up with illicit traffickers who resell them to criminals
in states with strong gun laws, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   The companies deny that they oversupply the states with weak gun
laws and say they cooperate in every way they reasonably can to
curb illegal gun trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs had hoped to call Hass, who has been
portrayed as a gun-industry whistle-blower, as a witness in the
trial, but they say that a heart ailment prevents him from
testifying and that they want his affidavit and deposition to be
read to the jury. Lawyers for the company oppose this, saying any
testimony by Hass should be in person to allow for
cross-examination in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Anne G. Kimball, a lawyer for Smith &AMP; Wesson, also said Thursday
that Hass' years at the company _ 1978 to 1989 _ were not ``within
the relevant time frame'' of the case. She said in an interview
that under earlier rulings in the suit, the activities by the
companies to be considered are those from 1989 to 1994, the last
year in which any of the shootings in the case occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers asserted that Hass's testimony remained
relevant because the practices he described continued from 1989 to
1994. Judge Jack B. Weinstein is expected to decide Friday whether
his affidavit and deposition may be presented to the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, available since it was made last April, Hass
said that one step gun manufacturers could take to keep their
handguns from getting into the illicit underground trafficking
market would be to use the information they got from law
enforcement officials, regarding guns of theirs that might have
been used in crime, to cut off retail dealers who have sold large
numbers of such guns.

GRAND CANYON LOGGING WOULD BE FIRST FOR PARKS

<P>
   For the first time ever in an American national park, Grand
Canyon National Park officials plan to log trees to reduce the
possibility of catastrophic forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are worried that the experiment could set a
precedent and lead to large scale logging in the nation's 52
national parks, which have been off-limits to timber firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the public ready to support logging trucks rolling out of
our national parks? That's a significant question,'' said Sharon
Galbreath of Flagstaff, a forest specialist for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   She said public outrage stopped a proposal to conduct salvage
logging after the 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon park officials released a draft environmental
assessment Thursday indicating that more than 8,000 trees would be
removed from four 20-acre plots: two on the North Rim along Swamp
Ridge, about 15 miles northwest of Grand Canyon Lodge; and two on
the South Rim near Grandview Point, about 10 miles east of Grand
Canyon Village.
</P>
<P>
   If the environmental assessment is approved after public
hearings, the logging could be conducted this summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; R.V. Ward, the park's biologist, said the $900,000 project
would remove only smaller trees, the ones that compete with larger
old-growth pines and firs that make up essential habitat for many
kinds of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those young trees can out-compete the older ones,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   A side-by-side aerial view of Grand Canyon National Park and
adjacent Kaibab National Forest can make the park look like a lush
paradise, Ward said. The forest has been over-logged, while the
park contains a chokingly high number of trees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 years of fire suppression, along with cattle
grazing, predator controls and growth in mule deer populations,
have changed the forests surrounding the Canyon, according to the
environmental assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Human actions have resulted in thick stands of sapling ponderosa
pines, a lack of grass, shrinking meadows and thick pine needle
duff, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of stand-replacing, catastrophic fires is very
high,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report's findings are based on the research of Wally
Covington, a forestry professor at Northern Arizona University. He
has pioneered research into the likely condition of Southwest
forests before European settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's work has shown that natural wildfires occurred every
few years, burning quickly through the forest grasses, consuming
excess small trees, while passing by the fire-resistant bark of
larger old-growth trees.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a relatively open, parklike forest with grasses
that could reach the belly of horses, according to Covington. His
research supports the use of intentionally set small fires and
selective logging as ways to eliminate small trees and return the
forest to a more natural condition.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists contend that Covington's findings, much of
it based on anecdotal information, can't be applied throughout the
forests.
</P>
<P>
   A forest restoration project supervised by Covington on U.S.
Bureau of Land Management forest on Mount Trumbull, northwest of
the park, has been praised by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a
former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists have criticized the Mount Trumbull
experiment for cutting too many large trees, leaving a landscape,
they say, not far removed from the clearcuts that the work is
designed to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the park study already has shown that
wildfires once raced through portions of the park every three to
eight years, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   But Galbreath suggested that park officials should allow the
absolute minimum human activity in trying to restore natural
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Public hearings on the proposed park logging are scheduled for
Flagstaff on Feb. 11 at 6:30 p.m. at the Museum of Northern
Arizona, 3101 N. Fort Valley Road; and in Kanab, Utah, on Feb. 12
at 6 p.m. at the Shilo Inn on U.S. 89. &QL;

MAVS LOSE THOMAS, GAIN `HOT ROD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The mood on the opening day of training camp for the
Mavericks was gloomy after free-agent power forward Kurt Thomas
went back on his word and signed a two-year contract for $3.625
million with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' actions surprised Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson and sent him scurrying to the telephone in search of another
enforcer to help patrol the middle. But the Mavericks' spirits were
lifted later in the day when they found that enforcer in free-agent
center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, who has agreed to a three-year,
$5.775 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have scheduled a news conference today to
introduce the 6-foot-11, 245-pound Williams as the newest member of
their organization. Williams, a 13-year veteran, is 36. He was with
the Phoenix Suns when Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson,
Don's son, was on the Suns' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great rebounder and a great shot-blocker, and he's
going to have a Reggie White effect on our team,'' Donnie Nelson
said. ``He's a great influence and a real leader in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game he took a cab on his own to the arena, before the
bus got there, to get his body ready for the games. He is the
ultimate professional, and he's such a smart player. We're lucky to
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah, Houston, Miami, Portland, Atlanta, Boston and Milwaukee
all wanted Williams. He will earn $1.75 million this season, $1.925
next season and $2.1 million in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson hopes to start Williams at center, and start A.C.
Green at power forward. But he said he will discuss that scenario
with Williams first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he likes to come off the bench,'' Nelson said. ``So I
want to see if he's comfortable as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very smart basketball player, and he's a perfect fit
for us. Considering the kick in the teeth that we got this morning,
we came out great.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson also said he will continue to pursue Cedric Ceballos,
another free-agent forward who was with the Mavericks last season.
Ceballos is shopping his wares elsewhere after turning down the
team's offer of a three-year contract for $6.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson had already named Thomas as his starting power
forward before yesterday's turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was visibly upset that he didn't receive a call from
Thomas or his agent, Dallas' Jerry Hicks, for two days notifying
him of their new plans. Hicks called Nelson yesterday morning to
tell him the unpleasant news.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nelson said a reporter first tipped him off Wednesday
night that Thomas was about to renege on the oral agreement he gave
the Mavericks on Tuesday. The contract was a one-year deal for $1
million, with incentives that could have included another $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's seen anything stranger than this whole setup,''
Nelson said. ``And I've dealt with David Falk. ... You name the
toughest guys, and I've never dealt with a guy as unprofessional as
I was treated \Rby Hicks\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the 48 hours he was left hanging by Hicks and Thomas
were precious hours he could have used pursuing other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let me hang for two days and lose out on people that would
help us, that just wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Samaki Walker, who said he expects to receive
a proposal for a contract extension from Nelson within the next
five days, could see his playing time increased with Thomas now
gone.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ceballos, Nelson believes once the free-agent smoke
clears around the NBA, the eight-year veteran will sign with the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've offered Ced more than anybody else at this point, but
it's less than he made last year,'' Nelson said. ``So at this point
he wants to see if there's something else out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks open the season Feb. 5, a Friday, at Seattle, and
will play nine of their first 11 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you want to take a young team and play nine out
of your first 11 games on the road,'' Nelson said. ``That's hard
for us. But if we can somehow survive that and scratch out some
wins, then we could be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' home opener is Feb. 9 against Utah. Dallas plays
eight sets of games on back-to-back days, and on three occasions
they play three games on three consecutive days. In all, the
Mavericks will play a game every 1.78 days.

RICKY WILLIAMS MAKE PITCH TO CLEVELAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In his polite way, Ricky Williams is insisting that he
be the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason I shouldn't be the No. 1 overall
pick,'' said Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from the
University of Texas. ``I'm going to be optimistic about this, and
hopefully, I'll go to Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the fraternity of great running backs are less subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ricky isn't the top overall pick,'' Hall of Famer Gale
Sayers said, ``somebody ought to be shot. If Cleveland or anybody
else doesn't take Ricky, they ought to be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is ranked by many draft experts as the top player
``regardless of position.'' But traditionally, NFL teams value
quarterbacks above running backs. Despite Sayers joining a chorus
of Williams fans who suggest that the trend should be bucked _
other ``sponsors'' include the likes of Tony Dorsett and Earl
Campbell _ the Cleveland Browns, owner of the first overall pick in
the April draft, are open about their apparent intent to select
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, the first day teams were allowed contact with
prospective draftees, Couch and Browns president Carmen Policy
engaged in a lengthy planning session.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Williams said, ``I haven't talked to anyone in
Cleveland. Nobody. Everything I know about the situation is
hearsay.'' Williams said he hopes hopes to communicate with the
Browns in the coming days, however. And what will he say to attempt
to persuade the expansion club?
</P>
<P>
   ``That I do the things that stats don't show, that I do the
little things, that I do the things beyond the norm, that I do
anything to help the team,'' Williams said. ``And that I love the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how persuasive Williams is, Policy seems set on
building the new franchise with quarterbacks first. He said his
plan includes drafting a rookie standout and the acquisition of a
veteran quarterback who will begin the 1999 season as the starter
while he helps tutor the rookie. And the organization has already
included ex-NFL stars Bernie Kosar and Joe Montana _ both former
quarterbacks _ in the quarterback evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to build an organization is with the coach and the
quarterback as the foundation,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has the first overall pick. The lowly Philadelphia
Eagles choose second. Speculation has Williams using his leverage
as a two-sport star (he recently signed a one-year contract as a
minor-league baseball prospect with the Texas Rangers) to deter the
Eagles from selecting him. That scenario, played out most notably
in 1983 when Stanford quarterback/outfielder John Elway used his
two-sport potential to force his way from the Baltimore Colts to
the Denver Broncos, apparently is not in Williams' future.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles ``probably need me moreso than another team,''
Williams said, shrugging off the NFL system that calls for the
poorer to, theoretically, get richer via the draft. ``The kind of
person I am, I just love to play the game. So wherever I go, I'll
still love to play the game there.''

BUCKING STOCK HAVE TO BE STARS, TOO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Big deal if world all-around champion Ty
Murray or saddle bronc riding king Dan Mortensen are entered in the
Stock Show Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   So is the world champion bucking bull King Kong and an
up-and-comer dubbed as Dodge Durango.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the Southwestern Exposition and
Livestock Show Rodeo's cornerstone has been to cultivate the
livestock industry's elite. The stars of the 103rd Stock Show range
from the grand champion steer to the prize pig to the toughest bull
in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 stock producers have been contracted to bring
their best bulls and broncs to Fort Worth for the 17-day rodeo,
which begins its run tonight at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
Hiring those high-profile producers is confirmation that bull and
bronc power can dramatically affect a competitor's score, and
bucking stock with a feisty reputation have become a marquee
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have an exciting rodeo, you have to put some
people on the ground and it's getting harder and harder to
accomplish when today's contestants ride with such expertise,''
said W.R. Watt, the Stock Show's president and general manager.
``People like to see a good ride, but they also like to see people
bite the dust. It's like NASCAR racing, if they didn't have wrecks,
it wouldn't be as popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior rodeo producer Neal Gay of Mesquite and his son Jim have
coordinated the stock for the 30 performances at Will Rogers
Memorial Coliseum. The Gays, who have produced the Mesquite
Championship Rodeo since 1958, own several prize animals, such as
Dodge Durango, which shut out all of its riders at the weekly
Mesquite Rodeo and in Las Vegas during the Professional Bull Riders
World Championships and the National Finals Rodeo last year.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to stock up for the Fort Worth show, the Gays
have reached as far as Minnesota, from which producer Joe Simon has
come with a herd.
</P>
<P>
   ```He called me up and said he had some good horses, but in his
part of the country, there are no big rodeos like Fort Worth, and
therefore his horses don't get good exposure,'' Neal Gay said. ``So
he's bringing 10 of his top horses down here. I don't think this
trip to Fort Worth per se will be a money-making deal, but
hopefully it will help him in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Gays also have recruited high-profile
producers such as Californian Dan Russell, who has owned a PRCA
world champion bull for five of the past 10 years; Mack Altizer of
Del Rio who last year was billed as the association's top stock
contractor; and Oklahoman Dell Hall, who owns King Kong, the PRCA's
defending champion bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial that a stock contractor hire subcontractors to
get the better horses,'' five-time world saddle bronc champion
Mortensen said. ``That makes it more of a riding contest between
competitors than a drawing contest. You need a lot of good horses
to give everybody a good chance, and I've been fortunate to get on
good horses in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, we pay an entry fee to come to Fort Worth.
Unlike the stock contractor who gets paid, we have to pay a $362
entry fee and may spend $2,000 on total expenses after paying
travel costs, so it's crucial that a stock contractor supplies a
competitor a good bronc.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the multiple-stock-contractor concept at major contests
such as Denver's National Western Stock Show Rodeo and the Houston
Livestock Show Rodeo is common practice. For cowboys, top stock is
imperative, especially in the bucking stock events; a contestant's
score partially is based on how difficult the animal is to stay on
for the required eight seconds. Money scores usually are in the
high 70s, the 80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a blue-chip animal is the equivalent of finding a
Michael Jordan or a Troy Aikman. In an attempt to improve their
herd, the Gays, who ranch near Terrell, now have more than 400
horses and about 230 bulls that roam on about 5,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Within their massive herd, Gay also has leased and purchased
breeding stallions from other pro rodeo companies. He has also used
some of his former star bucking bulls such as Red Rocker, which was
voted as the top bull on the PRCA's Texas Circuit in the 1980s, in
the breeding program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the racehorse business,'' Gay said. ``You
produce a young colt out of a great stallion and mare, and it
doesn't run fast at all. But generally speaking, breeding to the
great bucking horses and bulls helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing potential bucking stock is like critiquing NFL rookies
during training camp and the preseason. The Gays' tests range from
holding buck-outs at their ranch using both dummy riders and live
cowboys and then slipping the more promising animals into their
weekly Mesquite Rodeo during the spring and summer months.
</P>
<P>
   If a bronc or bull passes the tests, only then will it be
considered for a slot at the Fort Worth rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding great bucking stock is a pretty tough racket,'' Neal
Gay said. ``You have to have a certain amount of luck.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Big deal if world all-around champion Ty
Murray or saddle bronc riding king Dan Mortensen are entered in the
Stock Show Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   So is the world champion bucking bull King Kong and an
up-and-comer dubbed as Dodge Durango.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the Southwestern Exposition and
Livestock Show Rodeo's cornerstone has been to cultivate the
livestock industry's elite. The stars of the 103rd Stock Show range
from the grand champion steer to the prize pig to the toughest bull
in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 stock producers have been contracted to bring
their best bulls and broncs to Fort Worth for the 17-day rodeo,
which begins its run tonight at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
Hiring those high-profile producers is confirmation that bull and
bronc power can dramatically affect a competitor's score, and
bucking stock with a feisty reputation have become a marquee
attraction.

RICKY WILLIAMS MAKE PITCH TO CLEVELAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In his polite way, Ricky Williams is insisting that he
be the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason I shouldn't be the No. 1 overall
pick,'' said Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner from the
University of Texas. ``I'm going to be optimistic about this, and
hopefully, I'll go to Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the fraternity of great running backs are less subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ricky isn't the top overall pick,'' Hall of Famer Gale
Sayers said, ``somebody ought to be shot. If Cleveland or anybody
else doesn't take Ricky, they ought to be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is ranked by many draft experts as the top player
``regardless of position.'' But traditionally, NFL teams value
quarterbacks above running backs. Despite Sayers joining a chorus
of Williams fans who suggest that the trend should be bucked _
other ``sponsors'' include the likes of Tony Dorsett and Earl
Campbell _ the Cleveland Browns, owner of the first overall pick in
the April draft, are open about their apparent intent to select
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, the first day teams were allowed contact with
prospective draftees, Couch and Browns president Carmen Policy
engaged in a lengthy planning session.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Williams said, ``I haven't talked to anyone in
Cleveland. Nobody. Everything I know about the situation is
hearsay.'' Williams said he hopes hopes to communicate with the
Browns in the coming days, however. And what will he say to attempt
to persuade the expansion club?
</P>
<P>
   ``That I do the things that stats don't show, that I do the
little things, that I do the things beyond the norm, that I do
anything to help the team,'' Williams said. ``And that I love the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how persuasive Williams is, Policy seems set on
building the new franchise with quarterbacks first. He said his
plan includes drafting a rookie standout and the acquisition of a
veteran quarterback who will begin the 1999 season as the starter
while he helps tutor the rookie. And the organization has already
included ex-NFL stars Bernie Kosar and Joe Montana _ both former
quarterbacks _ in the quarterback evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to build an organization is with the coach and the
quarterback as the foundation,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has the first overall pick. The lowly Philadelphia
Eagles choose second. Speculation has Williams using his leverage
as a two-sport star (he recently signed a one-year contract as a
minor-league baseball prospect with the Texas Rangers) to deter the
Eagles from selecting him. That scenario, played out most notably
in 1983 when Stanford quarterback/outfielder John Elway used his
two-sport potential to force his way from the Baltimore Colts to
the Denver Broncos, apparently is not in Williams' future.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles ``probably need me moreso than another team,''
Williams said, shrugging off the NFL system that calls for the
poorer to, theoretically, get richer via the draft. ``The kind of
person I am, I just love to play the game. So wherever I go, I'll
still love to play the game there.''

MAVS LOSE THOMAS, GAIN `HOT ROD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The mood on the opening day of training camp for the
Mavericks was gloomy after free-agent power forward Kurt Thomas
went back on his word and signed a two-year contract for $3.625
million with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' actions surprised Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson and sent him scurrying to the telephone in search of another
enforcer to help patrol the middle. But the Mavericks' spirits were
lifted later in the day when they found that enforcer in free-agent
center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, who has agreed to a three-year,
$5.775 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have scheduled a news conference today to
introduce the 6-foot-11, 245-pound Williams as the newest member of
their organization. Williams, a 13-year veteran, is 36. He was with
the Phoenix Suns when Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson,
Don's son, was on the Suns' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great rebounder and a great shot-blocker, and he's
going to have a Reggie White effect on our team,'' Donnie Nelson
said. ``He's a great influence and a real leader in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game he took a cab on his own to the arena, before the
bus got there, to get his body ready for the games. He is the
ultimate professional, and he's such a smart player. We're lucky to
get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah, Houston, Miami, Portland, Atlanta, Boston and Milwaukee
all wanted Williams. He will earn $1.75 million this season, $1.925
next season and $2.1 million in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson hopes to start Williams at center, and start A.C.
Green at power forward. But he said he will discuss that scenario
with Williams first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he likes to come off the bench,'' Nelson said. ``So I
want to see if he's comfortable as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very smart basketball player, and he's a perfect fit
for us. Considering the kick in the teeth that we got this morning,
we came out great.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson also said he will continue to pursue Cedric Ceballos,
another free-agent forward who was with the Mavericks last season.
Ceballos is shopping his wares elsewhere after turning down the
team's offer of a three-year contract for $6.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson had already named Thomas as his starting power
forward before yesterday's turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was visibly upset that he didn't receive a call from
Thomas or his agent, Dallas' Jerry Hicks, for two days notifying
him of their new plans. Hicks called Nelson yesterday morning to
tell him the unpleasant news.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Nelson said a reporter first tipped him off Wednesday
night that Thomas was about to renege on the oral agreement he gave
the Mavericks on Tuesday. The contract was a one-year deal for $1
million, with incentives that could have included another $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's seen anything stranger than this whole setup,''
Nelson said. ``And I've dealt with David Falk. ... You name the
toughest guys, and I've never dealt with a guy as unprofessional as
I was treated \Rby Hicks\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the 48 hours he was left hanging by Hicks and Thomas
were precious hours he could have used pursuing other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To let me hang for two days and lose out on people that would
help us, that just wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Samaki Walker, who said he expects to receive
a proposal for a contract extension from Nelson within the next
five days, could see his playing time increased with Thomas now
gone.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ceballos, Nelson believes once the free-agent smoke
clears around the NBA, the eight-year veteran will sign with the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've offered Ced more than anybody else at this point, but
it's less than he made last year,'' Nelson said. ``So at this point
he wants to see if there's something else out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks open the season Feb. 5, a Friday, at Seattle, and
will play nine of their first 11 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you want to take a young team and play nine out
of your first 11 games on the road,'' Nelson said. ``That's hard
for us. But if we can somehow survive that and scratch out some
wins, then we could be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' home opener is Feb. 9 against Utah. Dallas plays
eight sets of games on back-to-back days, and on three occasions
they play three games on three consecutive days. In all, the
Mavericks will play a game every 1.78 days.

FOUR CURES FOR CABIN FEVER
</HEADLINE>

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time February arrives, the holidays are long gone, and
midwinter blues are center stage. It's time to get creative about
your leisure time with the kids -- before cabin fever gets the best
of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ BUILD A BACKYARD ICE RINK
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're lucky enough to have a pond nearby, it may not be
safe for skating. Build your own fun with a backyard ice rink.
Invite the neighborhood kids and serve hot chocolate to warm little
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   1. Locate some level ground. Build a frame using lumber that is
1'' thick and 10'' high. Stake the frame on the outside so that
when the ice expands, your frame won't be knocked over.
</P>
<P>
   2. Build your frame on a warm day when the ground is still soft.
</P>
<P>
   3. Material for the inside of the rink should not be put in
place until it gets cold. It should be in one piece, without seams,
and it cannot be taped together. Either Visqueen (8 millimeter
thickness) or Permalon white plastic work well as a liner and can
be found at building supply stores. Don't use dark colors since
they absorb sunlight, making it harder to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carefully place the plastic sheeting inside your frame,
butted completely against the wall or frame. When you add water,
you will need to adjust the plastic so that it fits snugly but does
not pull.
</P>
<P>
   5. Use furring strips to hold the plastic in place over the top
of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   6. Keep leaves off the ice. Flood the ice nightly to smooth it
out after use and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   7. Add lighting for night skating if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   _ BAKE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Whether you bake basic bread or quick, sweet bread, there's
nothing more satisfying than the smell of fresh bread baking in the
oven on a winter day. Don't be shy about making a loaf from
scratch; kids like to get their hands gooey and watch the dough
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Try the following kid-friendly books for bread recipes and tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bake Bread!'' (J.B. Lippincott Co., 1976); ``Knead It! Punch
It! Bake It! -- Make Your Own Bread'' (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1981);
``Let's Bake Bread!'' (Lerner Publications Co., 1973); ``Betty
Crocker's Breads'' (Western Publishing Co., 1974); ``The
Breadbasket Cookbook'' (Walker Books Limited, 1982).
</P>
<P>
   _ HAVE AN INDOOR PICNIC
</P>
<P>
   Get out the picnic basket, spread the tablecloth on the floor,
and build a fire in the fireplace. All you need now is some great
picnic food to complete the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a simple menu:
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Whole Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf Salad (easy and fun for kids to make)
</P>
<P>
   Banana Cupcakes
</P>
<P>
   _ CAMP IN
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's too cold to camp in the snow, but an indoor camp-out
in the family room by the fireplace sounds inviting. Pull out the
sleeping bags, hoist the tent, roast some marshmallows, and tell
campfire stories or sing songs. You won't have any stars to gaze
at, but the flames in the fire will do.

WHEN CHILDREN LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By LYNNE S. DUMAS 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bonjour,'' sang out the 4- and 5-year-olds as they trooped
into the pre-kindergarten French class at New York City's Trevor
Day School. After greeting their teacher, Matt Dexter, the children
settled down and joined him in a game: They thumped their thighs,
clapped their hands, and as the teacher pointed to a body part,
called out its name in French: ``Le nez, la tete, les yeux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est bon!'' praised Dexter. The kids beamed with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign language classes like this one not only help kids gain
language skills but also help them build self-esteem, thinking
skills, math ability and an appreciation of different cultures. And
children are best able to absorb a second language when they are
under 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language comes easily to very young children,'' says Nancy
Rhodes, executive secretary of the National Network for Early
Language Learning in Washington, DC. ``At birth, they begin to
learn their parents' language because they hear it all the time.
Very young children can pick up a second language just as easily by
hearing it singing songs in it and using it in their play,'' Rhodes
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' growing understanding of the brain helps explain why
young children can learn languages so effortlessly. ``From infancy
to age 6 or 7, there is a great deal of neurogenesis -- the
development of new connections -- going on in the brain,'' explains
Dr. George Bush, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, who specializes in brain mapping. ``A child's brain
is shaped by his experiences -- what he sees, hears and touches,''
says Bush. ``When it's exposed to the sounds of a second language,
the brain of a young child will actually grow connections that make
a new language easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Around age 12, the brain not only begins to slow in its ability
to develop those connections but starts to prune away any that
aren't being used, Bush explains. Thus children who don't start
learning a second language until later in life will often have a
more difficult time doing so because their brain may not have
developed the necessary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids learn a second language early on, say as toddlers,
they tend to manage both their native and second language from the
same location in the brain,'' says Joy Hirsch, a professor of
neuroscience at Cornell University Medical College in New York
City. ``Kids who learn later -- as teenagers, for example -- seem
to manage their second language from a different and separate
location in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch hypothesizes that ``older children may have a harder time
because their brain has to do extra work to create additional space
for the second language. And they must do this at a time when the
brain is becoming less facile at generating new connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely due to parents' clamoring, a fast-growing number of
elementary schools are offering second-language training to their
youngest learners. According to the Center for Applied linguistics
in Washington, DC, the number of elementary schools holding foreign
language classes climbed almost 10 percent between 1996 and 1997,
to 31 percent. That means more than 4 million elementary school
students are learning a foreign language in school before the age
of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, New
Jersey, North Carolina and Oklahoma -- have instituted a
second-language requirement for all children in elementary school.
And Delaware, Florida, and Hawaii are considering a variety of ways
to increase foreign language offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that learning a foreign language actually
enhances children's overall mental development. A study of 13,200
third- through fifth-graders at tending public schools in Louisiana
was revealing: It demonstrated that regard less of race, gender or
academic level, kids taking foreign language classes did better in
the English language arts section of the Louisiana Basic Skills
Tests than students who were not studying a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
   Math scores of children studying a second language improve, too.
Carol Saunders, a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
examined test scores of third-graders in 18 Georgia grade schools
and found that kids who had had foreign language instruction since
kindergarten did significantly better in the math section of the
Iowa Tests of Basic Skills than students with no foreign language
training.
</P>
<P>
   When given foreign language instruction by age 3 or 4, children
are able to speak like a native in their second language. As a
rule, says Donna Linton, director of the foreign language program
at Trevor Day School, ``the younger the children are, the better
their accent will be, especially if they've had some foreign
language training before learning to read English. That's because
the system of sounds they learn in English interferes with the one
they need for a foreign language. Once they've developed and
concretized formal reading and English language skills, their
accent in another language will never be quite as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring a native accent comes as a natural extension of
growing up in a bilingual family. But making sure your child is at
ease with more than one language takes a great deal of patience
even in a bilingual family, says Cristina Villalon-Kartheiser of
New York City, who has spoken only Spanish to her daughters, Katie,
6, and Annie, 4, from the moment they were born. The girls' father
speaks to them in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very committed,'' says Villalon-Kartheiser.
``Whichever language one parent chooses to speak, he or she needs
to maintain it all the time so that the child doesn't feel that
either language spoken at home is less important in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   What if neither parent is bilingual? Try to make sure that your
child has continual exposure to a native speaker of a language
other than English, such as a grandparent or babysitter, suggests
Villalon- Kartheiser. You can also read stories to your child that
incorporate foreign words into English text, such as ``Rosita's
Calico Cat'' by Emily Thompson. Cassettes or CDs of Spanish songs,
such as De Colores by JoseLuis Orozco, as well as videotapes in
other languages, are especially helpful to parents who don't speak
a second language themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Or try creating a picture dictionary with your child in a second
language, using drawings or magazine cutouts to illustrate each
word. You can also take a family trip to another country; immersing
your child in another language is beneficial even for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   School-based immersion programs, in which children spend part or
all of the school day learning in a second language are another
option, albeit harder to find. The goal of immersion programs is to
enable a child to speak a second language fluently in a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura is a foreign language immersion Montessori School
in Oak Park, Ill. Seven classes -- five with children ages 3 to 6
and two with ages 6 to 9 -- bathe students in the sounds of either
Japanese or Spanish. Classes, or ``communities'' as they are called
at the school, consist of about 20 students each. ``If you walked
into our Japanese community, you would see what you see in other
Montessori schools -- kids exploring puzzles and toys, working on
art projects, even learning practical tasks like using a broom or
setting a table,'' says Michael Rosanova, the school's director.
But what you'd hear is very different. For instance, the two
teachers of Japanese, who are native speakers, speak only in
Japanese to their young students. When they write, it is also in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Children can respond in English if I they like, but as time goes
on, they, too, begin to speak only Japanese in the classroom. ``If
a child starts with us at age 3, it might take 8 to 10 months for
her to produce a second language spontaneously,'' says Dr.
Rosanova. ``But that's OK; the important thing is that she's
learning the language. At what point she becomes fluent varies
widely from child to child.''
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura children also teach each other. ``The other day,''
says Rosanova, ``a 5-year-old girl explained in Japanese to a newly
arrived 3-year-old Classmate: ``This water is pouring. It's pouring
from one pitcher to another. Would you like to try it?''' Such
interaction between children is at the heart of Montessori's
immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hieber's 4-year-old son, Liam, has gone to InterCultura
since he was almost 3. ``Why did I choose immersion? I felt it was
the most effective way for him to learn. He learns everything else
so rapidly, why not another language?'' she says. Hieber, who lives
in Chicago, was concerned that if Liam heard English spoken at home
and Japanese at school, he would get confused. But experience
allayed her fears. ``He moves easily from one language to the
other,'' she says. ``He speaks to me and his father in English
because he knows that's what we speak. In school, where everyone
speaks Japanese, he speaks Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-esteem is one more byproduct of early foreign language
instruction. ``Young children feel good about having this new
competency,'' says Linton. Lynn Fantom, mother of Luisa Sperry, 6,
of New York City, says that her daughter finds it particularly fun
to teach her mother Spanish words she doesn't know. ``She's as
proud as can be that she knows something I don't,'' says Fantom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to show lots of interest and enthusiasm about other
languages in order to encourage their child's learning. ``Attitude
has a lot to do with it,'' notes Marcia Rosenbusch, director of the
foreign language resource center at Iowa State University in Ames.
``If your child says a new word in a second language -- whether he
learned it at school, from you, or from a grandparent -- get
excited, make a fuss,'' Rosenbusch urges. ``It not only encourages
development of a second language but also helps children feel good
about themselves.''

FAT-BLASTERS FOR MIDDLE-AGED METABOLISMS
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIA CALIFANO 
 c.1998 McCall's 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunate but true: Starting around age 25, a woman's
metabolism declines by about 5 percent every decade; by age 55
you're likely to have twice as much body fat as you had when you
were 20.
</P>
<P>
   But read on: ``We now know that getting older doesn't have to go
hand in hand with getting fatter,'' says Labros S. Sidossis, an
associate professor of nutrition and the director of the
obesity-research program at the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston. ``With the right diet and exercise habits a woman can
avoid any significant gains in body fat as she ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the latest tips to keep off the pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to graze.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing (that is, having smaller, more frequent meals) may help
you burn fat more effectively. A recent study of 16 women found
that those over age 60 burned 30 percent less fat after eating a
large meal of 1,000 calories than did women in their 20s; that
means the older diners stored more of the calories as body fat. But
both groups burned fat with equal efficiency after eating a smaller
meal (500 calories) and a 250-calorie snack.
</P>
<P>
   While more research is needed to know why older women store more
fat and at what age this begins, you may want to play it safe. Try
eating three or four lighter meals (around 400 to 500 calories
each) instead of consuming most of your calories in one or two
sittings, recommends study director Susan B. Roberts, an associate
professor of nutrition and psychiatry at the USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk at least four hours a week -- and no less.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the key to staying lean for life, according to a
recent study by the American Cancer Society. Researchers tracked
the eating and exercise habits of more than 44,000 middle-aged
women for 10 years; those who engaged in four or more hours of
walking every week were less likely to put on pounds than were
their sedentary peers, regardless of diet.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't cheat. The study found that walking less than four
hours weekly didn't help the women stay slim. To rack up that much
pavement or treadmill time, go for a 35-minute walk every single
day, or walk for 48 minutes five times a week. (Of course, check
with your doctor before starting any exercise plan.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for high intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that doing aerobics and/or calisthenics for
four or more hours per week reduced a woman's risk of putting on
pounds at the waistline by 72 percent; jogging or running for one
to three hours per week lowered a woman's odds for this by about 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in an experiment at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis, women and men in their 60s who went from
being couch potatoes to doing endurance exercises (like jogging or
cycling) for three hours a week lost up to 1 l/2 inches from their
tummies after nine to 12 months -- without dieting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat lots of veggies.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Cancer Society study, women who consumed at
least 19 servings of vegetables a week were significantly less
likely to gain weight as they got older than those who ate
relatively few or no veggies -- regardless of total calorie intake.
To get 19 servings per week, aim for three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Easy produce boosts: At lunch have a salad, vegetable soup or a
sandwich stuffed with sprouts, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. Sip
tomato or vegetable juice in the afternoon. At dinner add grated,
shredded or chopped vegetables (like zucchini, spinach and carrots)
to pasta sauce, meat loaf, rice or mashed potatoes. Keep a bowl of
baby carrots, celery and red-pepper slices in the fridge for a
handy snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muscle your way up to a faster metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   A pound of muscle burns about 35 calories a day, while fat uses
a measly two. But starting in their mid-20s, men and women lose
about a half pound of muscle every year, says Wayne Westcott,
fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it's not hard to recoup your losses at any age with
strength training. For instance, when researchers at Tufts
University put 12 men and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s on a
three-times-weekly strength-building program, in just three months
the subjects gained enough muscle to burn an extra 109 calories a
day; over the course of a year, that adds up to 11 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   To get these benefits, do 25 minutes of toning exercises for the
upper and lower body (by using free weights, flexible bands or
resistance machines or by doing calisthenics) two to three times a
week. Again, check with your doctor first; then call your local
YMCA or pick up a good instruction book -- like ``Strong Women Stay
Slim, by Miriam E. Nelson (Bantam, 1998) -- to find out how to get
started.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR (250 words):
</P>
<P>
   SNEAKY WAYS TO SLASH 100 CALORIES
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight really does get harder as you get older; after age
25 your metabolism burns up to 100 fewer calories a day with each
passing decade. Luckily, it's easy to make up the deficit, notes
Leslie Bonci, assistant director of nutrition at the Center for
Digestive Health at Pittsburgh's Allegheny General Hospital. These
small steps will help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half cup (or a half fist) less pasta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Order coleslaw made with vinaigrette instead of choosing
potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute 4 ounces of juice combined with 6 ounces of seltzer
for a 10-ounce bottle of fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enjoy a slice of angel-food cake as an alternative to a glazed
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have half a large bagel rather than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put only one slice of bacon on your BLT, not three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half scoop of ice cream with a half scoop of sorbet,
cutting back from a full scoop of high calorie ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for a 3-ounce scoop of tuna salad on your sandwich in lieu
of the usual 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dip chips into salsa rather than guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for a wine spritzer (half wine and half seltzer) in place
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a small, not medium, order of french fries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Splurge on filet mignon as opposed to a T-bone steak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Munch a handful of pretzel nuggets instead of a handful of
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opt for hot-air-popped popcorn; steer clear of microwaved
buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have one less tablespoon of butter or margarine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for mustard instead of mayo on your sandwich.

  Includes three color photos of dancers Suzie Hardt and Phil Jensen
at the Sapphire Ballroom in San Francisco. They are avaialble via
e-mail in JPEG format. Call Joe Applegate at 212-499-3342. 
 By MEG MCCONAHEY 
 c.1998 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzie Hardt rushes into San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, all
adrenaline, anticipation and loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   She has slathered sunless tanning lotion on her legs, twisted
her black hair into a bun, swapped her glasses for contact lenses
and waged a 35-minute battle to glue false lashes over her brown
eyes. Any other day this no-fuss anthropology graduate wouldn't
even bother with mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after maneuvering her Toyota through a rush-hour
bottleneck, she's left with only minutes to complete her Cinderella
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing on a sequined gown and making hurried fixes in the
mirror of the ladies' changing room, Hardt breathlessly shoots down
the hall, onto the ballroom floor and into the arms of partner Phil
Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Baroque ballroom is decked out like a wedding reception.
Tiny cocktail tables dressed up with red and white centerpieces,
mixed drinks served up at a wet bar. Electric blue icicles shimmer
down a wall and couples, immaculately moussed, manicured, coiffed
and outfitted like Barbie and Ken at the prom, mill around in a
filmy swirl of rhinestones, tails and chiffon, nervously waiting
for their numbers to be called.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the glamor and sometimes garish glitz, the Sapphire
Ball, one of many ballroom dance championships held around the
country, is serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the room, vendors peddle the required gear:
$3,000 gowns, $100 pairs of shoes, hairpieces, falsies, even
on-the-spot massages.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as basketball with feathers, baseball with a
cummerbund, track in heels. When Jensen and Hardt take to the floor
it's with the focus and drive of athletes. They dance not for
romance, but to win.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is not a singular obsession. According to the
International Dancesport Federation, some 1.5 million couples
around the world, from Australia to Germany, from Canada to Japan,
are redefining social dancing into the new ``sport'' of competitive
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt is a 27-year-old office worker with a boyfriend; Jensen's
a single, 23-year-old engineer for Hewlett-Packard. Off the floor
they are almost social strangers, but Phil and Suzie need each
other. They both have it bad for ballroom. And in ballroom, you
can't do it alone. Finding the right partner, many dancers joke,
can be harder than finding a mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both over 6 feet tall, we're both under 40 years old and
we're both obsessive dancers,'' Hardt says of their strictly
ballroom alliance, forged, so to speak, across a crowded room at a
dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   Those caught up in the sequined magic maintain that it's a
high-aerobic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do one round of a professional dance competition, five
dances of a minute and a half, is like running at full speed for 10
minutes. You have to be in really good shape to do this. If you're
good at it and putting effort into it, you're sweaty,'' says
Christine Rinne-Flores, who co-owns Stars Ballroom in Novato,
Calif., a place where competitive dancers converge for private and
group lessons, weekly parties and special events that are part of
the colorful ballroom community.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the International Olympic Committee
recognized the federation as the official governing body overseeing
the fledgling sport, a first milestone on the road to the Olympics.
Boosters have hired a high-powered agency to promote the image and
increase the profile of competitive dancing, a fusion of spectacle
and sport seen to outsiders mainly through the quirky, half-mocking
lens of movies like Australia's ``Strictly Ballroom,'' Japan's
``Shall We Dance'' and last summer's ``Dance With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of lobbying, negotiating and politicking, both with
Olympic officials and within their own ranks, remain ahead. Key,
some observers say, is getting major TV exposure of ballroom.
That's already happening in countries like Germany, where
dancesport can be front page news.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the main TV exposure has been on PBS,
which airs the annual Ohio Star Ball the weekend before
Thanksgiving. But ballroom got a major network break recently when
NBC broadcast the International Dancesport Championships, with
Broadway diva Debbie Allen as hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance sport now. It's totally international, all over
the world. It's in Taiwan, in Japan, Norway, Denmark, England,''
says Rhona Pick, whose Pick School in San Francisco has been
training dancers since 1963. She believes ballroom will easily
cross the Olympic hurdle because of its worldwide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as exciting, definitely, as ice dancing, if not more,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest dancers could ever expect to go for the gold
however, is 2008, and to make even that deadline, the Federation
will have to convince Olympic officials by 2003 to accept ballroom
onto the program.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much locks even young, hungry dancers like Jensen
and Hardt out of an Olympic dream. But even without the big,
14-karat gold carrot to shoot for, the ballroom dance scene thrives
within its own intricate, arcane web of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just happiest when I'm dancing. When I look back
in my life, all my happiest moments have been spent dancing,'' says
Hardt, struggling to explain the compulsion to dance six days a
week, sweating through some 12 hours of practice and lessons, both
group and private.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt pares her living costs down to the barest essentials,
sharing a house with five roommates. ``I basically don't spent
money on anything except for dancing,'' she admits. ``I don't have
any payments on my car and my rent is pretty cheap. I never buy new
clothes. I just go to yard sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many novices, her two ball gowns are hand-me-downs, one a
black-and-white formal that set its first owner back $1,700. She
similarly lucked into her dance shoes when a shoe store, going out
of business, donated its remaining stock to Rice University, where
Hardt competed on the ballroom team. The 2-1/2-inch-heeled slippers
are a little loose, and Hardt, hours before the Sapphire Ball,
found herself gluing on elastic straps. Having shoes fly off during
a fox trot is one of the hazards of competition, along with the
occasional collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not going to be too tacky,'' she giggled. ``But I
haven't got any other shoes for competition. They're really
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sports, which can be measured by tangibles like
speed or distance, ballroom is highly subjective. Judges have only
a minute and a half to size up a floor full of couples, all in
motion, for form, technique and some inexplicable charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge is paid to give their first impression. We're not here
to study them. Sometimes it's just the way they walk on the floor,
and make you look at them, or look at them longer,'' says Enrique
Ramon from Houston, Texas, one of the network of professional
judges who ride the circuit. Ramon says in the '60s, when he was
first competing, there were only three to four major competitions
in the United States. Now there are that many in any given weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to get better, to best themselves, to out-dance
everyone on the floor can become consuming. Hardt vows to enter
every competition she can and someday take it all the way, which in
the world of ballroom is the ultimate championships in Blackpool,
England.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sapphire, she and Jensen make it to the finals in both
categories of competition they enter, and waltz away with a
second-place trophy in the pre-novice division, edging out seven
other couples, and place a respectable fourth in the higher novice
division. But they're more disappointed than elated about what
looks, to an observer, like a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dance my best,'' Hardt says, looking stricken when
she comes off the floor, fighting tears behind the forest of
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, whose mother and brother and sister have come to watch,
is only a little less defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have danced better,'' he adds. ``I got off on my
timing but then we did fairly decent in the rest of it. But we
don't know that many dance steps and it was a little ahead of our
level. We do have a ways to go.''

 (Eds.: Adds parentheses to 1st graf)  FROM PONZI SCHEME TO SHELL By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (In Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Clinton's
proposed Social Security reforms included investing some of the
federal budget surplus in the stock market. In December 1996, Slate
Editor Michael Kinsley provided a prejudiced primer on Social
Security privatization:)
</P>
<P>
   Privatization means allowing individuals to invest for
themselves all or part of what they and their employers put into
Social Security. Whatever the merits of this idea--and there are
some--it does not address the problem at hand. Social Security is a
Ponzi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Current payers-in are financing current payers-out, not their
own retirements. Privatization assumes an end to the Ponzi scheme:
Every generation saves for its own retirement. But you can't get
there from here without someone paying twice--for the previous
generation and the current one--or someone getting less (or
someone--i.e., the government--borrowing a lot of money).
</P>
<P>
   If Social Security manages to achieve a higher return, by
investing some or all of its assets privately, the rest of the
economy will achieve a lower return, by having more of its assets
in government bonds. In essence, the gain to Social Security will
be like a tax on private investors--an odd thing for conservative
think tanks to be so enthusiastic about.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the arrival of this huge pot of money looking for a home
will depress returns in the private economy, while the need to
attract an equally huge pot of money into the Treasury to replace
the lost revenue will increase the returns on government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Result? The diversion will be at least partly self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The size and security of future retirement benefits ultimately
depend on the country's general prosperity at that time in the
future. Checks to be cashed in the year 2055 (whoops! there's a
number) will be issued in 2055, whatever promises we make or don't
make today.
</P>
<P>
   The most direct way for Social Security to affect future
prosperity is to increase national savings, of which the Social
Security reserve is part, by trimming benefits and/or increasing
revenues. Since we have to do that anyway--even as a prelude to
privatization--why don't we do it first? Then we can argue about
privatization at our leisure.

MONEYBOX: WHY DOES AT HOME NEED EXCITE-MENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick. Why would At Home, the provider of online access which
effectively has exclusive rights to deliver broadband Internet
access to almost 60 million cable-television subscribers, spend
$7.5 billion to acquire Excite, an online portal that's at best
fourth in the race for Internet eyeballs?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, baby, content is still king.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the apparent reason for what at this point
seems like a rather curious purchase by At Home. And while it's
certainly a comforting reason for anyone who makes his living as a
content provider--that is, me--I think I'll need some more evidence
before it becomes a convincing reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. At Home is currently a very small company in terms
of the actual business it's doing (though not in terms of its
market cap, which is currently close to $12 billion). There are
only 330,000 At Home subscribers, and the firm did just $47 million
in revenue last year. Needless to say, it has yet to actually make
any money. For all of that, though, it's hard to find a company
associated with the Net whose future looks brighter. At Home's
service will provide access to the Net at speeds up to 100 times
faster than current modems, and will do so over already-existing
cable lines for a cost of $40 a month. As far as I'm concerned,
serious market penetration by At Home will transform not just our
experience of surfing the Net but the economics of the Internet as
well. Speed, in that sense, is the Net's killer app.
</P>
<P>
   And speed would be that killer app regardless of who was
creating At Home's gateway to the Net. Although careful
explanations of why At Home wanted to spend all this money have
been a little difficult to come by, people have pointed to Excite's
personalization features--which any portal worth its salt
</P>
<P>
   has. They've mentioned that these features will allow At Home to
do a better job of tracking customers, marketing to customers, and
serving its advertisers. They've also mentioned, of course,
Excite's established user base. The number being bandied about is
20 million, but all that number represents is people who at one
time or another have registered with Excite. And speaking only for
myself, I couldn't tell you how many Web sites there are that I've
registered at and never visited again.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even if we say that Excite has 20 million
customers, is it really plausible that they would turn down the
chance to use At Home's service if At Home were allied with some
other portal site, or if At Home created its own portal (which I
guarantee you would cost less than $7.5 billion)? Unless I'm
missing something, At Home customers are still going to be able to
head to Yahoo or Go.com if they want, so wouldn't the Excite
fanatics have been able to subscribe to At Home and still use their
site?
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, of course, the deal makes dazzling sense for
Excite. At Home is buying the portal for something like a 67
percent premium (depending on what happens to At Home stock in the
meantime). And although some people have suggested that At Home is
doing the deal because its own stock price may be inflated, its
shares are certainly no more inflated than Excite's. And any Excite
shareholder who sold Tuesday got as much as $110 a share. In cash.
In that sense, Excite's executives have done a really stunning job
of maximizing shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   As for At Home, well, I'd say that betting against CEO Tom
Jermoluk is a mistake. And some consolidation in this industry was
inevitable. But we all know by now that most mergers don't work,
and I'm assuming that's as true in the world of the Net as in the
real world. In the end, At Home may have underestimated just how
potent its technology is all by itself, and how little it needs
add-ons to attract customers. TheStreet.com quoted one portfolio
manager Tuesday saying, ``A great pipe is not worth very much
unless you give people a reason to use it.'' Um, hello? Getting the
whole Internet 100 times faster than you normally do isn't a great
reason to use At Home, but having Excite as your gateway is? Let's
simply say: not.

BROWSER: WHO SAYS WWII VETS ARE THE GREATEST? 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The No. 1 best seller in America this week is ``The Greatest
Generation,'' by NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw. The most acclaimed and
second highest grossing film of 1998 (just behind Armageddon) was
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Steven Spielberg's film is fiction and Brokaw's book is
something akin to oral history, they have in common a fashionable
theme: the nobility of those who served in the armed forces during
World War II and, by extension, Americans of that age in general.
</P>
<P>
   You might describe this perspective as GI envy. Both Brokaw
(born in 1940) and Spielberg (born in 1946) evince a powerful sense
of nostalgia for the world of their fathers. As his title suggests,
Brokaw makes an explicit case for the superiority of the World War
II generation. In an introduction to the interview-profiles that
make up his book, he repeats a claim he first made on television
when he was swept up by the emotion of the 50th anniversary of
D-Day in 1994: ``This is the greatest generation any society has
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Were they?
</P>
<P>
   Their children's generational neuroses don't necessarily prove
Brokaw wrong. But the Brokaw position is badly flawed, not because
of the instinct that motivates it but because of a romanticizing
tendency that eclipses all logic and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the GIs were somehow better people than those
born after them remains, like most facile generalizations about
generations, a matter of prejudice, not analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at a few of Brokaw's overreaching assertions. In his
introduction, he writes of the GIs, ``They stayed true to their
values of personal responsibility, duty, honor, and faith.'' That
sounds plausible--where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? But consider
just one of those attributes: ``faith.'' Putting aside the question
of whether more faith is a good thing, was the GI generation really
more religious than others? Brokaw doesn't offer any support for
this claim, and one might well make the opposite case. The United
States has probably become more religious as boomers have become
the dominant demographic group. About 10 percent more people now
say they belong to churches than did so in the 1950s, when the GIs
predominated.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the traits Brokaw attributes to the GIs are subject
to similar demurrals. ``That's another legacy of the World War II
generation, the strong commitment to family values and community,''
Brokaw writes in another characteristic passage. It's true that
returning veterans didn't get divorced in large numbers. But that
doesn't prove that our grandparents and parents had a deeper
commitment to family values. It simply testifies to the legal and
social reality they inherited--it was hard to get divorced in the
1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Who changed that reality? The GIs did, because they found the
virtual prohibition on divorce an intolerable restriction on their
freedom. As divorces became more readily available, GIs had them
too. The baby boomers who inherited the divorce laws the World War
II generation loosened have in recent years begun to contemplate
tightening them again.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to imply that Brokaw's book is all drivel. It
includes a number of moving stories about wartime heroism that can
be appreciated without reference to its argument, which is pretty
much superfluous. But what's missing from Brokaw's book--as from
most oral history--is any hint of analytical rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Aspects of American life that Brokaw deplores, such as
segregation and McCarthyism, are viewed as part of the wallpaper.
It was not the GI generation that rounded up Japanese Americans and
put them into camps. That was merely ``American racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to the good that happened on their watch,
Brokaw gives the GIs themselves full credit. ``They came to
understand the need for federal civil rights legislation,'' he
writes. ``They gave America Medicare.'' Well, GI Johnson did give
America Medicare. But others, such as GI Dole, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that George Wallace and Joe McCarthy also
served in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw repeats most of the other familiar cliches: World War II
veterans know the value of a dollar, they never boast, and they're
reluctant to talk about their wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to say that Brokaw never met my Uncle Stanley. Of
course, it's true that there are a lot of World War II-era vets who
aren't inclined to relive the battlefield horrors they experienced.
But this may have less to do with the unique stoicism of a
generation than with the natural inclination everyone has to
repress traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   If Vietnam vets have been tempted to make more of a meal of
their experiences, it's partly due to the fact that those
experiences weren't widely shared. The therapeutic culture of the
present era also probably plays a role, teaching us that it's not
healthy to keep one's pain bottled up inside. But who created that
therapeutic culture? You could argue, once again, that it was a
bequest from members of the GI generation, who introduced
psychiatry and psychoanalysis into American life.
</P>
<P>
   That many of the GIs Brokaw interviews say explicitly is that
the baby boomers lack the moral character they themselves had.
``They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not
protest,'' Brokaw writes of the GIs, casting another aspersion at
the Vietnam generation.
</P>
<P>
   But at the risk of stating the obvious, Vietnam was not like
World War II. The question men of draft age faced after Pearl
Harbor was whether they would serve their country in an
unambiguously good cause. The challenge faced by the Vietnam
generation was morally more complex: How do you serve your country
when it is engaged in a morally dubious cause (a cause the country
as a whole--not just a few protesters--came to conclude was a
mistake)?
</P>
<P>
   The World War II generation also had little choice. Everyone was
needed in the war effort, and there were few opportunities to dodge
the draft. During the Vietnam War, the military needed only a small
percentage of those who were eligible, and there were many options
for evasion, legal and illegal. Some served and didn't protest.
Others protested and didn't serve. Some, like Bob Kerrey and John
Kerry, served and then protested.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there is no obvious answer to who answered this
quandary in the best way. The GI envy felt by members of the
Vietnam generation seems in part a longing for the clearer moral
imperative of another time.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, pivotal generational experiences. No one
would deny that the Great Depression and World War II molded one
group of people or that Vietnam shaped another. But attempts to
explain history in terms of common traits already possessed by the
peer groups that confronted these events are seldom illuminating.
Just as we cannot know how the baby boomers would have responded to
the moral challenge of World War II, we cannot know how the World
War II generation would have responded to the different moral
challenge of Vietnam. For that matter, we can't compare the GIs to
the Athenians of Pericles' time, the Florentines of Michelangelo's,
or the Americans of Abraham Lincoln's.

CLOTHES SENSE: THE WAY WE WORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the movies, the past is indeed a foreign country; they dress
differently there. The clothes on women, particularly, create
foreignness in different ways. Depending on what era the movie is
set in, clothes can conjure a unfamiliarity that is soothingly
adorable or uneasily alien.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years back, and the gaze is nostalgic. But go 45 years
back, and the fashions cross into a mist that renders them faintly
dangerous--they are feared because their truth has finally been let
go. Instead of indulgence, 40-year-old fashion seems to need
taming. How else to explain the way movies use ridicule and easy
cliches when re-creating the clothes of the 1950s?
</P>
<P>
   You can see how it works in the recent movie ``Pleasantville,''
in which a pair of modern teens are transported back 45 years--not
into real life, but into a black-and-white Ozzie and Harriet-style
TV sitcom. The movie's conceit is that sitcom conventions of that
time--no color, no sex, no bathrooms--delimit the characters'
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' suggests that '50s fashions for women have now
come to mean what female Victorian clothing used to mean in the
1920s--not just clothes in a different style, but a metaphor, a
compendium of ridiculous and unnatural devices invented to dishonor
female life and liberty. The actual clothes of the '50s are now
almost half a century gone, most of them vanished. We only see them
in old films, old television nd old magazines, just the way 1880s
fashions were understood, 40 years later in the 1920s, from ancient
fashion plates and daguerreotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the 1880s to the 1920s was severe. By the
second half of the 1920s, female fashion and female life had been
totally transformed. Women had adopted short hair and short skirts;
they wore the easy-fitting sweaters and dresses appropriate for
modern female citizens, who by that time had acquired effective
means of contraception, gainful employment and the vote. Too young
to remember the ordinary clothes of the previous era, they regarded
huge bustles, sweeping trains, lofty coiffures, and tightly laced
waists with a ferocious derision born of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the 1990s, with the evidence drawn mainly
from old movies and old sitcoms, '50s fashion is similarly ripe for
reductive contempt. Those big, pointy breasts; useless hats; and
lampshade skirts look so creepy on the screen--and hardly a woman
now alive can remember what the great range of real clothing was
like at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this phenomenon mysteriously rights itself the further we
recede in time. Go back 50 more years, and all our social
perceptions become romantically transformed. Clothes in historical
movies can show the really distant past as a friendly foreign land,
perhaps even a lot like the here and now. All Ancient Historical
Drag is morally and visually neutral, apt for inventive play with
the styles of a century back, or five centuries, or 20.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian fashion, for example, wholly redeemed, is often
treated with great respect in movies such as ``The Portrait of a
Lady.'' The high hair and big bustles have been assimilated to all
the other harmless customs of antiquity; they've become the
equivalent of Egyptian breastplates and Elizabethan padding.
</P>
<P>
   Historical films are usually kind to the olden days, updating
the principal women's clothes so the actresses look attractive by
modern standards. Two recent releases deal with the Elizabethan
age--''Elizabeth,'' the bloody tale of the Virgin Queen's rise, and
``Shakespeare in Love,'' a romp through Elizabethan theater.
</P>
<P>
   The first shows late 16th century fashion looking ridiculous
only on the aging queen herself, as if no other woman at the time
ever wore a rigid farthingale and stuffed sleeves, a tightly
frizzed wig and a bushel of pearls, or painted her face with white
paste. The young court ladies in Elizabeth appear in their natural
hair and skin, wearing modern-looking Renaissancey garments that
run to becomingly mobile and flowing silk dresses with smoothly
boned bodices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' has authentic Elizabethan dress for
everybody, but there's a good deal of extra emphasis on the way the
period corsets flatten the breasts and strictly encase the
ribs--and on how thrilling it is when the corsets come off.
</P>
<P>
   In '50s movies set in Elizabethan times, of course, everybody
wore big, molded, and pointy breasts with their Renaissancey
garb--no flattening was permitted and certainly no exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though corseted bodies are authentically Elizabethan, they
are used so freely in both these films because they're modish once
more. Modern designers such as Christian Lacroix and John
Galliano--and especially Jean-Paul Gaultier--overthrew '60s
ideology to reinstate the corset, using them as sexy accents in the
early '90s. Such recent use has decisively transformed the standard
20th century emblem of female oppression back into the erotic
device it always was. Corseting has stopped looking dishonorable
and started looking chic again, both as a feature of recent ball
gowns and wedding gowns and as a costume component that can give a
modern frisson to movies set in ancient days.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s aren't quite ancient yet, but they're getting more so.
By contrast to the condescension of ``Pleasantville'', genuine
tenderness for the time could be seen in ``The Last Picture Show,''
a 1971 film about real life in 1951. Nostalgia could still be
evoked after only 20 years, and many remembered when. The movie was
beautifully restrained and accurate with respect to clothing--the
peasant blouses, the swinging skirts, the smooth, side-parted hair,
the garter belts and capacious underpants from a time before
Spandex were all deliciously heartbreaking, never exaggerated for
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The film's evocation of the style of the time was marred only by
insufficient attention to movement. The young jeans-wearing
actresses of the '70s failed to walk in the correct '50s style
while wearing long narrow skirts. (The secret: Knees together, and
don't try to stride.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the '90s, right on schedule, fashions of the '70s are
being given a nostalgic, sympathetically accurate whirl in such
movies as ``Hilary and Jackie'' and ``The Ice Storm.'' A genial
gaze is being cast on them just as flared trousers, square-toed
shoes, and long male hair are once again looking normal in the
real-life fashion universe.
</P>
<P>
   In another 20 years, no doubt, '70s fashion will be in for its
share of cinematic contempt (once the square toes are truly gone)
just as the '50s finally achieve true antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   The modes of any period can easily be made to look stupid. Even
in its own day, fashion needs a lot of enhancement to make it look
great. Whereas fashion photography--in the '50s as always--aimed to
arouse active lust for new goods, the clothes in '50s movies were
so thoroughly surreal as to look quite unfit for normal wear, even
if they were waitresses' uniforms or girl-next-door dresses. Movie
garb was automatically read as part of the tradition that stretched
back to silent Hollywood days, with everything made specially for
the stars and uniquely worn by them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' the designers fit Elizabeth Taylor
into a form-fitting, made-to-measure, boned-and-stayed,
built-in-bra sort of slip, unobtainable by anybody else, an
inspired collaboration between Taylor's unbelievable body and the
costume department. Real '50s slips had no relation to it at all.
They were like the ones in ``The Last Picture Show,'' with wrinkles
around the middle and unreliable straps that slid around on the
shoulders, uneasily contending with the bra straps.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, nobody wanted the movies to show all that except
for the Italian ones, where the sexiest women all wore ill-fitting
slips and had hairy armpits, too. That was really foreign.

   BRASHEET, Lebanon _ Someday, they could meet on the rocky battle
ground of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrilla Ahmed Sayeed is from south Lebanon, where he
leaves his job and children at night to answer a call to battle
inspired by Muslim clerics. He literally prays to die in martyrdom
in battle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli paratrooper Itamar Haviv is from Jerusalem, but follows
the path of his father, who also fought in Israel's long Lebanon
war. He's fights for patriotism and seeking personal challenge.
But, when he's through, he wants to be a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in different cities recently with the Cox News
Service, two Hezbollah fighters and two Israeli paratroopers
described their views of the 17-year-old conflict that grips this
tiny country on the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   They are emblematic of a war that pits east against west, and
religious men seeking martyrdom against youths just beginning their
adult lives.
</P>
<P>
   About the only reality they hold in common is the strain that
comes from the days-long ambushes they set for each other -- a
guerrilla tactic Israel actually learned from Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   While Hezbollah, the ``Party of God,'' is trying to repel an
invader from their land, the Israelis acknowledge they are holding
a place until a political deal is made over issues elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a restless public, Israeli leaders say they want to leave
Lebanon. But, they need assurances from the Lebanese and Syrian
governments that Hezbollah will not then venture into Israel to
launch attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which controls Lebanon and has partial control over
Hezbollah, stands in the way of such a peace deal until Israel
returns to Syria the Golan Heights nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's Lebanon invasion in 1982, 894 Israeli soldiers
and 1,400 Hezbollah guerrillas have been killed, according to the
two sides. And, over the years, Hezbollah has become a formidable
army.
</P>
<P>
   Sayeed, 30, builds houses by day here in Brasheet, which sits
just outside the nine-mile-wide band of territory occupied by
Israel in southern Lebanon. Israeli shells often fall nearby, and
occasionally in, the small farming town. Many civilians and
fighters have died.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a porch in the small village, Sayeed looks like any
contractor in his flannel plaid shirt, neatly trimmed reddish beard
and cotton pants. He could be an American yuppie, but he has been
fighting for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many nights, he leaves his wife and two children to await in
ambush for Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are born here. We are religious and we love our land,'' he
says. ``We are all asking to be martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Khalil Musa, is a slightly-paunchy electrician by
day who at night sometimes sets the remote-controlled road-side
bombs used by Hezbollah. During his 12 years of fighting, he has
been in ambushes that may have killed four Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever feels sorry for killing Israelis, he answers
unequivocally, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that the Jews are our enemies,'' he says. ``The
behavior of the Israelis makes us carry our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army might be world-famous, Musa says, but he calls the
Israeli soldiers ``cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Far away, in an Israeli base near Jerusalem where combat troops
periodically return for training, the two paratroopers describe
their view of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that almost all Israelis must serve in the army, platoon
leader Haviv and squad leader Moti Rubin, both 20 years old,
decided to go for the action and volunteer as paratroopers.
Applicants must pass a two-day fitness test.
</P>
<P>
   Haviv, tall with a close-cropped military haircut, emphasized a
``patriotic'' and practical call to fight, saying Israel must fight
hostile neighbors to survive. He feels he protects Israelis living
on the border with Lebanon. Rubin said he mostly went for ``strong
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Haviv says his ambushes have never engaged Hezbollah in the
field. Rubin would not say. He added that, unlike others, he would
not scratch an ``X'' in the handle of his M-16 rifle after killing
a guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   They both know that growing numbers of Israeli citizens and
politicians want to pull out of Lebanon, which some compare to the
United States' Vietnam War. They have lost friends in the war and
know how much their country mourns when one dies. They also know
the land in Lebanon does not mean as much to them as it does to the
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the big advantage for them. For us it's not even worth
getting wounded,'' says Rubin, who is from Jerusalem. ``In truth, I
don't care about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, with a budding pompadour he says his commanders will soon
tell him to clip, he wants to go to business school in Montreal
when his three years of army service are over.
</P>
<P>
   Haviv has already served his three years, but is staying on to
be an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about life in the battle zone, they talk about the long
guard duties, anxious ambushes and the off hours in their bases,
when they listen to Israeli rock music and play card games of
Whist.
</P>
<P>
   And, Haviv and Rubin both speak of their respect for Hezbollah
fighters, who they said seek martyrdom but are not suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very good soldiers,'' Haviv says. ``They are a very
serious enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Both the paratroopers and guerrillas discussed the difficult
ambushes, which sometimes last for days. Hezbollah's Khalil Musa
said the hardest part of his job is sitting through ambushes that
do not snare any Israelis. Hezbollah helps pay his family's bills
while he's away.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Haviv said he feels relieved by never having confronted
guerrillas, but also that he has ``missed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is glad that most of the fighting is outside of civilian
areas and therefore ``black and white.'' Anyone walking at night
where they are, he says, is a guerrilla. You have to fire first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they believe they are going to heaven if they die killing
you, then you don't just wound them, you have to kill them,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the older Lebanese fighters, the Israelis are single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my father. As long as I remember he was this great
warrior,'' Haviv says. ``When I have kids, they won't have to go to
war.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hezbollah's Musa, he faces the Israeli fort on the hill
opposite his village and says his 10 year-old boy already talks
about joining the fight. Eventually, he will let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will follow in my way,'' he says.

 &HT;    TOO LATE FOR ONE FAMILY, MAO'S FIRST DISSIDENTS COME UP FOR
VINDICATION

<P>
   BEIJING _ When retired biologist Chen Linna was a 14-year-old
schoolgirl, her nights were tormented by a dream: must she kill her
father as a ``criminal'' who betrayed his country?
</P>
<P>
   Walking home from school one day, Chen had read a wall poster
pasted in her courtyard that denounced her father as a ``bourgeois
rightist.'' Soon expelled from the ruling Communist Party, her
father was shipped off for a year to one of China's original labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1957. Today, she says the stain of the ``rightist''
label has never quite disappeared from her father's career -- or
hers. Last year, he died at the age of 84, officially
``rehabilitated'' but still bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than a year later, the historical fate of Chen and the
550,000 others in the first generation of accused Chinese
dissidents has finally come up for debate within the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a further irony, the party is deciding whether to expunge the
guilt of this dwindling core of ``rightists'' even as it is
aggressively cracking down on today's new generation of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   With China approaching the 50th anniversary of the communist
takeover in October, ranking party officials have told Western
visitors about a still-secret documentary that is said to make a
powerful case that the party wrongly persecuted the ``rightists''
42 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The film was previewed for senior leaders and party historians
at a recent study session at the Central Committee's Party School
in northern Beijing, according to one visitor, Professor Robert
Pastor of Emory University in Atlanta. Pastor said he learned of it
from a senior Beijing party official during the Carter Center's
recent trip to observe Chinese township elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he was never fully rehabilitated -- emotionally,''
said daughter Chen, now 56, when she heard about the secret film.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to overturn the 1957 verdicts by party
tribunals poses an exquisite dilemma to today's Communist Party,
which exercises a hollow power with neither ideological or moral
force over 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   A full denunciation of the anti-rightist campaign might bring
some new legitimacy to the party -- but at great risks, said
Harvard University China scholar Roderick MacFarquhar(CQ). It might
help revive patriotism among a generation of sons and daughters
repelled by the hostility to intellectuals so long displayed by the
party, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strongest arguments against removing the stigma from
the ``rightists'' is the need to protect the reputation of the late
Deng Xiaoping. Deng, the former Chinese leader, remains a revered
symbol for today's top communists for thrusting China onto its
winning path of market-oriented ``reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in 1957, Deng was Chairman Mao Tse-tung's
chief hatchetman in the ``anti-rightist'' crackdown. By some
reputable accounts, it was Deng who convinced Mao to open the first
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   Then after Mao's death, Deng pressured the party to declare in
1980 that the anti-rightist campaign ``was not erroneous in itself,
the problem was that it became inflated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why few experts expect that a documentary fully
repudiating the ``rightist'' crackdown will ever be broadcast in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that many party members would be dead set against
opening a Pandora's box,'' MacFarquhar said in an e-mail interview
with the Cox News Service. ``It would further undermine the
Chairman, and also Deng Xiaoping, thus bringing into question not
merely the Maoist era but even the Dengist.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy remains so painful for the party because the
``rightists'' included some of the best and brightest in Mao's
revolution. China's current premier and economic czar Zhu Rongji
was one of the few ``rightists'' who endured the purge and went on
to rise to top leadership.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the noted revolutionary novelist Ding Ling stopped
writing for two decades and never fully regained her vitality.
Then-campus activist Harry Wu emerged from his ``rightist'' labor
camp to go into exile, then turned into one of China's most
vituperative critics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Chen's father, Chen Shiwu, was swept up almost by
accident in the ``rightist'' purge.
</P>
<P>
   At Mao's revolutionary base at Yan'an in the 1940s, both Chen's
father and mother were part of the entourage as revolutionary
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   After Mao came to power on Oct. 1, 1949, Chen's father was
dispatched to communist East Berlin as chief correspondent of
China's official Xinhua news service. He returned to China in 1955
and was promoted to chief of Xinhua's international department.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1956, Mao signalled a period of liberalization. ``Let
100 Flowers Bloom, Let 100 Schools Contend,'' was Mao's slogan.
Writers and intellectuals were invited to help improve the party by
criticizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Chen never said anything provocative, at least as far
as his family recalls. His apparent mistake was associating too
closely with his older brother, Chen Qixia, a well-known and
outspoken member of the Chinese Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mao slammed shut the ``100 Flowers'' period after rebellion
broke out in Poland in June 1956, followed that autumn by the
abortive Hungarian anti-communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For young daughter Chen Linna, the 1957 ``anti-rightist''
crackdown began with a front-page blast in People's Daily against
her father's brother, then the shocking wall poster attacking her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Soon teachers pressured her to denounce him during humiliating
``self-criticism'' sessions at school. ``I always felt that I was a
criminal when I faced the Communist Party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in a labor camp, her father was freed and sent back
to Beijing around 1959 in a low-status job at the news agency. When
the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, his ``rightist'' brand
brought him another two years in a labor camp. Around 1980 he was
declared ``rehabilitated'' and let back into the party, but his
journalistic rise was finished.
</P>
<P>
   By then, daughter Chen Linna had long since lost her chance for
a fast-track career. Because her father was a ``rightist,'' she was
banned from the Young Communist League in high school. That meant
she never became a Communist Party member nor was allowed into the
Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to fight her way into the Beijing Forestry Institute
and graduate as a biologist. She was assigned to work in a remote
mountainous outpost near Inner Mongolia, 100 miles from the nearest
rail station.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years she served her time in one place and
another, then retired last year. Now she lives in a two-room
Beijing apartment with her octogenarian father-in-law and her
unemployed daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite late,'' she said softly, as she pondered how her
life would change if the party does decide to vindicate the
rightists.

banned from the Young Communist League in high school. That meant
she never became a Communist Party member nor was allowed into the
Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to fight her way into the Beijing Forestry Institute
and graduate as a biologist. She was assigned to work in a remote
mountainous outpost near Inner Mongolia, 100 miles from the nearest
rail station.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years she served her time in one place and
another, then retired last year. Now she lives in a two-room
Beijing apartment with her octogenarian father-in-law and her
unemployed daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite late,'' she said softly, as she pondered how her
life would change if the party does decide to vindicate the
rightists.

<P>
   BRASHEET, Lebanon _ Nimreh Farhad's Arabic name means,
``Tigress,'' but if that kind of spirit ever lived in the old
woman's soul, it was pounded out long ago by the war in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old Lebanese peasant lives in the rocky hills dotted
with olive trees and farmland near territory occupied by
neighboring Israel for 17 years. It is the battleground between
Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas, and she is shell-shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Israel has stepped up its air raids. As the rumble of
bombing many miles away echoed harmlessly through Farhad's village
recently, she jumped up in fright from the small stone wall where
she sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear the way! Clear the way!'' she yelled, shuffling with her
weathered wooden cane toward the door of her whitewashed block
house. Her daughter tried to calm her, and neighbors explained that
she just can't take war any more.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, they are tired of the war here in Brasheet, where
dozens have died either fighting or from persistent shelling. But
so are they tired in Israel. They are tired of their youth dying in
what some consider Israel's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to end the war has steadily increased. On one side,
Hezbollah is gaining strength. On the other, Israeli public
opposition is building. A November Israeli newspaper poll showed a
high of 40 percent supporting a withdrawal, even without a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But, this is a complex proxy war. Syria, which borders Israel
and controls Lebanon, uses Hezbollah to pressure Israel into
returning the Golan Heights -- which Israel captured from Syria in
1967. And, Hezbollah is backed by Iran, with its own agenda for
spreading Islamic fervor. Even if Israel were to withdraw from
Lebanon, there is no guarantee that Hezbollah -- with encouragement
from Syria -- will not attack over the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been suspended for
more than two years, and are on hold now at least until after the
May elections for Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, until a soldier is killed it isn't in the
headlines,'' says Lynn Griver, a member of the Israeli group, Four
Mothers, which has lead Israeli opposition to the war. ``This is a
stagnant time.''
</P>
<P>
   Griver, originally from New York City, used to protest against
the Vietnam War. Now, at 48, she has a son drafted into the Israeli
army who will soon head to south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   There, Israel occupies a roughly nine-mile wide band of
territory tracing back to June 1982, when Israel launched an
invasion that then-Defense Minister Ariel Sharon billed as a quick
strike against Palestine Liberation Organization terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel kept pushing north until it placed the Lebanese
capital of Beirut under siege, killing more than 17,000 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the PLO fled and Israel withdrew to the southern
strip that Israelis now call their ``security zone.'' From the
occupation grew a more formidable foe than the PLO; the Lebanese
who fight for the ``Party of God,'' or Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the war has settled into a blood-soaked routine.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli commandos search out guerrillas, who wait for them with
ambushes or remote-controlled, camouflaged bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese civilians build their homes with small windows for
safety. They occasionally need United Nations escorts to pick their
olives, and they can distinguish the sounds of bombs, mortar fire
or artillery.
</P>
<P>
   When civilians are killed, a five-nation committee assigns the
blame. Israel and Hezbollah occasionally exchange prisoners and
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When Israeli forces kill civilians -- an air raid killed a
mother and six children in December -- residents in northern Israel
know to head for bomb shelters in preparation for the Hezbollah
response.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hezbollah fired 120 rockets into Israel, killing none
but prompting Israeli strikes in return.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli army, 894 of its soldiers have been
killed in Lebanon since 1982. That does not include deaths outside
the war zone, such as the 73 soldiers who died in a 1997 helicopter
collision south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah officials say they have lost about 1,400 fighters in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lebanese civilians, the war claimed 15 civilian lives in
1998, about 30 the year before and more than 200 the year in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Brasheet is a small farming community just outside of
Israeli-held territory. Within sight are mountain-top Israeli
forts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is shooting, I can go up and look out the window,
see where the operation is and then go to the other side,'' said
34-year-old nurse Khadeja Shahab(CQ). ``Many times, we're stuck in
the house for hours and can't go out.''
</P>
<P>
   When shelling broke some of her windows recently, Hezbollah
showed up to pay for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, one of the world's best-financed, best-organized
guerilla organizations in the world, gets about $200 million a year
from Iran. It is also a political party and social network with
members in the Lebanese parliament, three major hospitals, hundreds
of health clinics and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the radical Shia Islamic movement that took off in the
late 1970s, Hezbollah fights Israel on behalf of the rest of
Lebanon -- the Lebanese army stays out of the war -- with an
estimated 5,000 fighters. Most are not full-time, but they showed a
leap in skill after increased training in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Israelis) are unable to hurt us badly,'' Sheikh Nabil
Kaouk, Hezbollah leader for southern Lebanon, told the Cox News
Service. ``We will keep the south here like an oven . . . until
they withdraw, they will burn.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Israeli Cabinet voted to accept an old U.N.
resolution calling for an Israeli withdrawal. But, the plan
requires a Lebanese commitment to stop Hezbollah from attacking
over Israel's border.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Lebanon does not call the shots. Syria,
which has more than 35,000 troops in Lebanon, controls the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any negotiation with Israel, we are the weaker party . . .
with Syria we are much stronger,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
el-Hoss told the Cox News Service in a recent interview. ``Peace
will have to wait until Syria is ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Syria wants is the Golan Heights, land seen as strategic by
many Israelis. Hezbollah is Syria's vehicle for pressuring Israel,
and Syrian leaders vow not to restart peace talks until Israel
agrees it will eventually turn over the Golan, now home to some
15,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Byzantine situation where everyone is holding their
cards close to their chests and quoting the highest price,'' said
Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for Lebanese affairs. ``The
parties will have to find common ground to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Israelis fear that pulling out would let Hezbollah could come
right to its borders and launch an attack. Hezbollah purposely does
nothing to assuage those fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our duty to tell Israel what will be (after a
withdrawal),'' Hezbollah's Sheikh Kaouk said. ``We are not going to
give the occupier a present when they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That line helps Syria keep on the pressure for the Golan. It
also highlights the question of whether Hezbollah will ever give up
war to become just a political party.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these complexities, small wonder that a growing
number of Israelis want to just leave Lebanon and see what happens.
They argue that that would both save lives and deny Syria leverage
over the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   One withdrawal plan would require a fence and radar network on
the border. If Hezbollah attacked Israel, it could use
international pressure or the threat of military attacks directly
against Syria until it reigns in Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, several leading politicians, including now-Foreign
Minister Sharon, have backed variations on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief
opponents in the elections see that as too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiator Lubrani notes that only six Israeli civilians
have died on the Lebanon border since the mid 1980s. For now, he
said, the ``security zone,'' is working.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Where the roads get narrow in the
Deep South
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Everybody knows about the Deep South. Not so many
people, perhaps, know about the deep, dark South.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way to get there is to get yourself lost on some
backwoods road where the magnolias leave off and the bayous begin.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, most travelers don't take the time to take
in the surroundings. All they care about is finding a road that
will deliver them back to the main highway and away from
Deliverance country, all the while whistling ``Dixie'' past the
graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I found myself halfway lost midway on a day trip
into Louisiana, trying to stay on old U.S. Highway 190 eastward
from Jasper, Texas _ the jumping off place for civilization, of all
places.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Texas, I passed the Three Flags Truck Stop.
If I had to guess, I'd say those were the Lone Star flag, the
Confederate flag and the U.S. flag, the last one included as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Please note that as you cross the Sabine River into Louisiana,
the speed limit falls off along with the condition of the highway _
55 mph compared to 70 mph in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Obey the law. They have ways of making you obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   I once got stopped by a constable in Mississippi, a long ways
from nowhere, for suspicious behavior, a compound felony in my case
seeing as how I was driving a car with Texas plates.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd done to disturb the peace officer was stop to take a
photo of a quaint old building. I was required to explain exactly
why and what for the photograph had been made.
</P>
<P>
   I said not a word about constitutional rights. The main word I
stuck with was ``Sir.'' I count myself lucky to have escaped with
only a warning ticket _ shooting pictures out of season, or some
such offense.
</P>
<P>
   When you step back into time, watch your step. Southern
hospitality has a way of turning hostile.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is God's country. Old-time religion is still
very much up to date, as spelled out on the front of such worship
places as the New Testament Holiness Church, the True Light Church
and the Jesus Church.
</P>
<P>
   But it's like they say: It takes a Christian to burn a cross in
your yard.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs that, catching my eye, made me catch my breath:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Quicksand Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Merryville Cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Help Prevent Woods Arson.''
</P>
<P>
   That last one in particular serves as a reminder, pilgrim, that
you're in outlaw territory where old feuds flame up in a very real
way.
</P>
<P>
   But a good rule of thumb for traveling Louisiana: The worse the
highway gets, the better the food gets _ such is the French
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Where else could you find a St. Germain road, other than the
backwoods of south Louisiana or the Left Bank of Paris?
</P>
<P>
   What I like best is what you don't find.
</P>
<P>
   I drove more than 90 miles, through one little community after
another, and never saw a McDonald's or a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   C'est bon, y'all.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A little-understood global hazard _ the graying of the developed
world's population _ may actually do more to reshape our collective
future than deadly superviruses, extreme climate change or the
proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, countries in the developed world
will experience an unprecedented growth in the number of their
elderly and an unprecedented decline in the number of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and magnitude of this demographic transformation have
already been determined. Next century's elderly have already been
born and can be counted _ and their cost to retirement benefit
systems can be projected.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to take an unflinching look at the shape of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Floridization of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Been to Florida lately? You may not have realized it, but the
vast concentration of seniors there _ nearly 19 percent of the
population _ represents humanity's future.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Florida is a demographic benchmark that every developed
nation will soon pass. Italy will hit the mark as early as 2003,
followed by Japan in 2005 and Germany in 2006. France and Britain
will pass present-day Florida around 2016; the United States and
Canada in 2021 and 2023.
</P>
<P>
   _ Societies much older than any we have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Global life expectancy has grown more in the last 50 years than
over the previous five thousand. Until the Industrial Revolution,
people age 65 and over never amounted to more than 2 percent or 3
percent of the population. In today's developed world, they amount
to 14 percent. By the year 2030, they will reach 25 percent and be
closing in on 30 percent in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ An unprecedented economic burden on working-age people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the next century, working-age populations in most
developed countries will shrink. Today the ratio of working
taxpayers to nonworking pensioners in the developed world is around
3:1. By 2030, absent reform, this ratio will fall to 1.5:1. In some
countries, such as Germany and Italy, it will drop to 1:1 or even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity revolution represents a miraculous triumph of
modern medicine and extra years of life will surely be treasured by
the elderly and their families. But pension plans and other
retirement-benefit programs were not designed to provide these
billions of extra years of payouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aging of the aged: the number of ``old old'' will grow
much faster than the number of ``young old.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations projects that by 2050, the number of people
age 65 to 84 worldwide will grow from 400 million to 1.3 billion (a
threefold increase). The number of people age 85 and over will grow
from 26 million to 175 million (a sixfold increase). The number age
100 and over will jump from 135,000 to 2.2 million (a sixteenfold
increase).
</P>
<P>
   The ``old old'' consume far more health care than the ``young
old'' _ about two to three times as much. For nursing-home care,
the ratio is roughly 20:1. Yet little of this cost is figured in
the official projections of future public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Falling birthrates will intensify the global aging trend. As
life spans increase, fewer babies are being born. As recently as
the late 1960s, the worldwide total fertility rate (that is, the
average number of lifetime births per woman) stood at about 5.0,
well within the historical range.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a behavioral revolution, driven by growing affluence,
urbanization, feminism, rising female participation in the
workforce, new birth-control technologies and legalized abortion.
The result: an unprecedented and unexpected decline in the global
fertility rate to about 2.7 _ a drop fast approaching the
replacement rate of 2.1 (the rate required merely to maintain a
constant population).
</P>
<P>
   _ A shrinking population in an aging developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless their fertility rates rebound, the total populations of
western Europe and Japan will shrink to about one-half of their
current size before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, seven of the 12 most populous nations were in the
developed world: the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy and the United Kingdom. The United Nations predicts that by
2050, only the United States will remain on that list. Nigeria,
Pakistan, Ethiopia, Congo, Mexico and the Philippines will replace
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ From worker shortage to rising immigration pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most predictable consequence will be the rising
demand for immigrant workers in older and wealthier societies
facing labor shortages. Immigrants are typically young and tend to
bring with them the family practices of their native culture _
including higher fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   In many European countries, non-European foreigners already make
up roughly 10 percent of the population. This includes 10 million
to 13 million Muslims, nearly all of whom are working-age or
younger. In Germany, foreigners will make up 30 percent of the
total population by 2030, and more than half the population of
major cities such as Munich and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Global aging and attendant labor shortages will therefore ensure
that immigration remains a major issue in developed countries for
decades to come. Culture wars could erupt over language and
religion. Electorates could divide along ethnic lines and emigre
leaders could sway foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 years, developed countries may have to spend at least
an extra 9 percent to 16 percent of gross domestic product simply
to meet their old-age benefit promises. The unfunded liabilities
for pensions (that is, benefits already earned by today's workers
for which nothing has been saved) are already almost $35 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Add in health care, and the total jumps to at least twice as
much. At minimum, the global aging issue thus represents, to
paraphrase the old quiz show, a $64 trillion question hanging over
the developed world's future.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for promised benefits through increased taxation is
unfeasible. Doing so would raise the total tax burden by an
unthinkable 25 percent to 40 percent of every worker's taxable
wages _ in countries where payroll tax rates sometimes already
exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the costs of these benefits by borrowing would be
just as disastrous. Governments would run unprecedented deficits
that would quickly consume the savings of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   And the $64 trillion estimate is probably low. It likely
underestimates future growth in longevity and health-care costs and
ignores the negative effects on the economy of more borrowing,
higher interest rates, values, less savings and lower rates of
productivity and wage growth.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to respond to the aging challenge will destabilize the
global economy, straining financial and political institutions
around the world. As they age, some nations will do little to
change course, while others may succeed in boosting their national
savings rate, at least temporarily, through a combination of fiscal
restraint and household thrift. Yet this too could result in a
volatile disequilibrium in supply and demand for global capital.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century from now, will the divide between today's
``rich'' and ``poor'' nations be better described as a divide
between growth and decline, surplus and deficit, expansion and
retreat, future and past? By the mid-2020s, will the contrast
between North and South be better described as a contrast between
Young and Old?
</P>
<P>
   Countries where populations are still exploding rank high on any
list of potential trouble spots, whereas the countries most likely
to lose population are the staunchest friends of liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the developing world, the total fertility rate
remains very high (7.3 in the Gaza Strip versus 2.7 in Israel),
most people are very young (49 percent under age 15 in Uganda), and
the population is growing very rapidly (doubling every 26 years in
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   These areas also tend to be the poorest, most rapidly
urbanizing, most institutionally unstable _ and most likely to fall
under the sway of rogue leadership. They are the same societies
that spawned most of the military strongmen and terrorists who have
bedeviled the United States and Europe in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's long-term planners predict that outbreaks of
regional anarchy will occur more frequently early in the next
century. To pinpoint when and where, they track what they call
``youth bulges'' in the world's poorest urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Is demography destiny, after all? Is the rapidly aging developed
world fated to decline? Must it cede leadership to younger and
faster-growing societies?
</P>
<P>
   For the answer to be no, the developed world must redefine that
role around a new mission. How governments ultimately prepare for
global aging will also depend on how global aging itself reshapes
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already some of the largest and most strident interest groups in
the United States are those that claim to speak for senior
citizens, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, with
its 33 million members, 1,700 paid employees, ten times that many
trained volunteers, and an annual budget of $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior power is rising in Europe, where it manifests itself less
through independent senior organizations than in labor unions and
(often union-affiliated) political parties that formally adopt
pro-retiree platforms. Could age-based political parties be the
wave of the future?
</P>
<P>
   Global aging could trigger a crisis that engulfs the world
economy. This crisis may even threaten democracy itself. The gray
dawn approaches. We must establish new ways of thinking and new
institutions to help us prepare for a much older world.

<P>
   A little-understood global hazard _ the graying of the developed
world's population _ may actually do more to reshape our collective
future than deadly superviruses, extreme climate change or the
proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, countries in the developed world
will experience an unprecedented growth in the number of their
elderly and an unprecedented decline in the number of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and magnitude of this demographic transformation have
already been determined. Next century's elderly have already been
born and can be counted _ and their cost to retirement benefit
systems can be projected.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to take an unflinching look at the shape of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Floridization of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Been to Florida lately? You may not have realized it, but the
vast concentration of seniors there _ nearly 19 percent of the
population _ represents humanity's future.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Florida is a demographic benchmark that every developed
nation will soon pass. Italy will hit the mark as early as 2003,
followed by Japan in 2005 and Germany in 2006. France and Britain
will pass present-day Florida around 2016; the United States and
Canada in 2021 and 2023.
</P>
<P>
   _ Societies much older than any we have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Global life expectancy has grown more in the last 50 years than
over the previous five thousand. Until the Industrial Revolution,
people age 65 and over never amounted to more than 2 percent or 3
percent of the population. In today's developed world, they amount
to 14 percent. By the year 2030, they will reach 25 percent and be
closing in on 30 percent in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   _ An unprecedented economic burden on working-age people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the next century, working-age populations in most
developed countries will shrink. Today the ratio of working
taxpayers to nonworking pensioners in the developed world is around
3:1. By 2030, absent reform, this ratio will fall to 1.5:1. In some
countries, such as Germany and Italy, it will drop to 1:1 or even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The longevity revolution represents a miraculous triumph of
modern medicine and extra years of life will surely be treasured by
the elderly and their families. But pension plans and other
retirement-benefit programs were not designed to provide these
billions of extra years of payouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aging of the aged: the number of ``old old'' will grow
much faster than the number of ``young old.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations projects that by 2050, the number of people
age 65 to 84 worldwide will grow from 400 million to 1.3 billion (a
threefold increase). The number of people age 85 and over will grow
from 26 million to 175 million (a sixfold increase). The number age
100 and over will jump from 135,000 to 2.2 million (a sixteenfold
increase).
</P>
<P>
   The ``old old'' consume far more health care than the ``young
old'' _ about two to three times as much. For nursing-home care,
the ratio is roughly 20:1. Yet little of this cost is figured in
the official projections of future public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Falling birthrates will intensify the global aging trend. As
life spans increase, fewer babies are being born. As recently as
the late 1960s, the worldwide total fertility rate (that is, the
average number of lifetime births per woman) stood at about 5.0,
well within the historical range.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a behavioral revolution, driven by growing affluence,
urbanization, feminism, rising female participation in the
workforce, new birth-control technologies and legalized abortion.
The result: an unprecedented and unexpected decline in the global
fertility rate to about 2.7 _ a drop fast approaching the
replacement rate of 2.1 (the rate required merely to maintain a
constant population).
</P>
<P>
   _ A shrinking population in an aging developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless their fertility rates rebound, the total populations of
western Europe and Japan will shrink to about one-half of their
current size before the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, seven of the 12 most populous nations were in the
developed world: the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy and the United Kingdom. The United Nations predicts that by
2050, only the United States will remain on that list. Nigeria,
Pakistan, Ethiopia, Congo, Mexico and the Philippines will replace
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ From worker shortage to rising immigration pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most predictable consequence will be the rising
demand for immigrant workers in older and wealthier societies
facing labor shortages. Immigrants are typically young and tend to
bring with them the family practices of their native culture _
including higher fertility rates.
</P>
<P>
   In many European countries, non-European foreigners already make
up roughly 10 percent of the population. This includes 10 million
to 13 million Muslims, nearly all of whom are working-age or
younger. In Germany, foreigners will make up 30 percent of the
total population by 2030, and more than half the population of
major cities such as Munich and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Global aging and attendant labor shortages will therefore ensure
that immigration remains a major issue in developed countries for
decades to come. Culture wars could erupt over language and
religion. Electorates could divide along ethnic lines and emigre
leaders could sway foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 years, developed countries may have to spend at least
an extra 9 percent to 16 percent of gross domestic product simply
to meet their old-age benefit promises. The unfunded liabilities
for pensions (that is, benefits already earned by today's workers
for which nothing has been saved) are already almost $35 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Add in health care, and the total jumps to at least twice as
much. At minimum, the global aging issue thus represents, to
paraphrase the old quiz show, a $64 trillion question hanging over
the developed world's future.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for promised benefits through increased taxation is
unfeasible. Doing so would raise the total tax burden by an
unthinkable 25 percent to 40 percent of every worker's taxable
wages _ in countries where payroll tax rates sometimes already
exceed 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the costs of these benefits by borrowing would be
just as disastrous. Governments would run unprecedented deficits
that would quickly consume the savings of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   And the $64 trillion estimate is probably low. It likely
underestimates future growth in longevity and health-care costs and
ignores the negative effects on the economy of more borrowing,
higher interest rates, values, less savings and lower rates of
productivity and wage growth.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to respond to the aging challenge will destabilize the
global economy, straining financial and political institutions
around the world. As they age, some nations will do little to
change course, while others may succeed in boosting their national
savings rate, at least temporarily, through a combination of fiscal
restraint and household thrift. Yet this too could result in a
volatile disequilibrium in supply and demand for global capital.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century from now, will the divide between today's
``rich'' and ``poor'' nations be better described as a divide
between growth and decline, surplus and deficit, expansion and
retreat, future and past? By the mid-2020s, will the contrast
between North and South be better described as a contrast between
Young and Old?
</P>
<P>
   Countries where populations are still exploding rank high on any
list of potential trouble spots, whereas the countries most likely
to lose population are the staunchest friends of liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the developing world, the total fertility rate
remains very high (7.3 in the Gaza Strip versus 2.7 in Israel),
most people are very young (49 percent under age 15 in Uganda), and
the population is growing very rapidly (doubling every 26 years in
Iran).
</P>
<P>
   These areas also tend to be the poorest, most rapidly
urbanizing, most institutionally unstable _ and most likely to fall
under the sway of rogue leadership. They are the same societies
that spawned most of the military strongmen and terrorists who have
bedeviled the United States and Europe in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's long-term planners predict that outbreaks of
regional anarchy will occur more frequently early in the next
century. To pinpoint when and where, they track what they call
``youth bulges'' in the world's poorest urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Is demography destiny, after all? Is the rapidly aging developed
world fated to decline? Must it cede leadership to younger and
faster-growing societies?
</P>
<P>
   For the answer to be no, the developed world must redefine that
role around a new mission. How governments ultimately prepare for
global aging will also depend on how global aging itself reshapes
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already some of the largest and most strident interest groups in
the United States are those that claim to speak for senior
citizens, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, with
its 33 million members, 1,700 paid employees, ten times that many
trained volunteers, and an annual budget of $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior power is rising in Europe, where it manifests itself less
through independent senior organizations than in labor unions and
(often union-affiliated) political parties that formally adopt
pro-retiree platforms. Could age-based political parties be the
wave of the future?
</P>
<P>
   Global aging could trigger a crisis that engulfs the world
economy. This crisis may even threaten democracy itself. The gray
dawn approaches. We must establish new ways of thinking and new
institutions to help us prepare for a much older world.

<P>
   Recent events have given the lie to the conventional wisdom on
civil wars: that they are private matters which great powers may
simply ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, America has again and again found itself
in the middle of foreign, internal conflicts, from Haiti to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has the focus been so acute or the consequences as
immediate as in the Balkans. The United States and its Western
allies have worked hard _ though with limited success _ to end the
wars that erupted when Yugoslavia collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Western interests were directly implicated; concern over
humanitarian abuses, the risk of war spreading to neighboring
states and the future of NATO justified American and European
intervention. The Dayton accords seemed to win a fragile peace for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat of war in Europe now looms as likely as ever, as
elections return Bosnian hard-liners to office and the uprising
tragically flares in Kosovo. The prospects of achieving a lasting
peace in the region are slim, and these problems are likely to vex
American policymakers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The attention paid by the West to the wars in the former
Yugoslavia should come as no surprise. Only recently have
superpowers refrained from involvement in internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the case has been just the opposite. And with good
reason: revolutions in France, Russia and China sparked profound
changes in the international system that remain with us today.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, internal conflicts in Korea and Vietnam
drew the United States into costly interventions, while domestic
strife in El Salvador and Nicaragua dominated American foreign
policy through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the Soviet Union, internal wars provided the
source for both one of Moscow's greatest victories (Cuba) and one
of its most costly defeats (Afghanistan).
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the USSR (brought on in part by the Afghan
disaster) and the end of the Cold War, new questions must be asked
about civil wars and American interests. Proxy fights between
Russia and America are no longer likely. The domino effect is no
longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Though wars within states continue to outnumber those fought
between them, many now argue that the United States should turn its
back on these internal squabbles. These civil wars, they argue, are
the domestic affairs of poor, weak countries, not important enough
to merit American involvement. Getting enmeshed in complicated
disputes and age-old hatreds will sap American resources _ and for
no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this view. Most civil wars do not directly
threaten the United States or its allies. While recent internal
conflicts have raised humanitarian concerns, none has seriously
affected American security or economic interests. This, however,
was largely a matter of luck.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should recognize a vital and sobering truth:
that not only the former Yugoslavia, but also Russia, Mexico and
Saudi Arabia all now stand on the brink of civil war, conflicts
that would have devastating consequences for the United States.
These consequences are not the traditional dangers of
state-to-state aggression, such as outside attack or invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Though largely ignored by scholars and policymakers, who remain
fixated on the idea of international conflict, internal war has
emerged as a principal threat to security in the post-Cold War
world.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts may foment within the borders of a single state, and
yet in this day and age they send shock waves far beyond their
frontiers. To begin with, internal wars risk destroying assets the
United States needs. Were the Persian Gulf oil fields destroyed in
a Saudi civil war, the American economy (and those of the rest of
the developed world) would suffer severely.
</P>
<P>
   Internal wars can also unleash threats that stable governments
formerly held in check. As central governments weaken and fall,
weapons of mass destruction may fall into the hands of rogue
leaders or anti-American factions. More directly, internal wars
endanger American citizens living and traveling abroad. Liberia
will not be the last place America sends helicopters to rescue its
stranded citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, internal wars, when they erupt on U.S. borders,
threaten to destabilize America itself. U.S. intervention in Haiti
was spurred, in large part, by fear of the flood of refugees poised
to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All of these dangers are grave enough to warrant consideration;
what makes them even more serious is the fact that their impact on
America is largely unintended. Being unintended, the spill-off
effects of the world's civil wars are not easily deterred, which
creates unique challenges to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Washington must recognize that future threats
will be qualitatively different from traditional challenges. During
the Cold War, an enormous amount of military, economic and
scholarly effort went into deterring a Soviet invasion of Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   America did not then hesitate to protect itself. The prospect of
internal war erupting in key states is now just as likely as was
that of Soviet troops pouring through the Fulda Gap, and the
consequences would be just as catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the U.S. government gives internal war only a tiny
fraction of the attention it once paid to the Soviet threat. With
the Cold War over and internal wars virtually the only form of
battle being fought, scholars and policymakers need to shift gears
and recognize that not all threats to security are deliberate,
purposeful acts of a coherent enemy that can be deterred with the
right policy.
</P>
<P>
   Civil wars _ whether in Kosovo or Moscow _ could inadvertently
unleash catastrophic harms. Because these risks are so hard to
prevent, they must now get the analysis and attention they so
urgently deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the inadvertent side effects of internal conflicts cannot
be deterred, the outbreak of civil war itself may be discouraged.
Doing so may require unambiguous and generous American support for
a regime that finds itself under assault. Or it may require
Washington to ease out unsustainable leaders once their time has
clearly passed.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the difficulties of preventing internal war pale in
comparison to the problems of coping with its effects.

<P>
   It has been suggested that males, in our species and others, are
more prone to violence than females.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, despite the current academic bias against genetic
explanations for behavior, this evidence does show that males are
indeed more likely to fight, murder, loot, pillage and, of course,
rape, than females.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however, whether this apparently innate
male predilection has much to do with war, international relations
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the anthropology of war, there is little basis for locating
the wellspring of war in aggressive male instincts _ or in any
instincts, for that matter. Wars are not barroom brawls writ large,
but, as social theorist Robin Fox puts it, ``complicated,
orchestrated, highly organized'' collective undertakings that
cannot be explained by any individual impulse.
</P>
<P>
   No plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut
his hair short and drill for hours under the hot sun. As
anthropologists Clifton B. Kroeber and Bernard L. Fontana have
pointed out, ``It is a large step from what may be biologically
innate leanings toward individual aggression to ritualized,
socially sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as a 1989 conference on the anthropology of war concluded,
``The hypothesis of a killer instinct is ... not so much irrelevant
as wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the male appetite for battle has always been far less
voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war or
army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Western history, individual men have gone to
near-suicidal lengths to avoid participating in wars _ cutting off
fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting. Prior to the
advent of the nationalist armies of the 19th century, desertion
rates in European armies were so high that, according to historian
Geoffrey Parker, ``at certain times, almost an entire army would
vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   So unreliable and prone to escape was the rank and file of the
famed 18th-century Prussian army that military manuals forbade
allowing the men to camp near wooded areas. Even in the supposedly
highly motivated armies of the 20th-century democracies, few men
can bring themselves to shoot directly at individual enemies _ a
fact, as Lt. Col. Dave Grossman writes in ``On Killing: The
Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' that
has posed a persistent challenge to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we need not resort to instinctual male
aggressiveness to explain the male near-monopoly on warfare. One
reason is clearly biological, resting on men's advantage in upper
body strength _ an undeniable plus when the weapons of war are
heavy swords, spears, pikes, maces or clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is cultural, or at least as purely cultural
as one can be: In many, if not most, human societies, male
initiation rites feature acts of violence committed by or on the
initiates, and one of the most common of these rites has been
participation in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``blooding a spear'' a boy proved his manhood (or
through ordering the bombing of some smaller nation, in the case of
recent American presidents). For an activity to be a male
initiatory rite, it cannot, of course, be open to women and girls.
Hence the widespread taboos on female handling of weapons and, in
many cases, the tools of peaceable male-dominated crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no reason to think that such initiatory activities
derive from instinctual male proclivities. In some cultural
settings, the young male's initiation to the adult world may be
entirely bloodless, featuring the receipt of a diploma or admission
into a guild.
</P>
<P>
   In others it may be violent in ways not related to war,
involving circumcision, homosexual rape or nose-bleeding induced
with sharp sticks _ activities that few would say are instinctually
driven.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the very purpose of male initiation rites is to
distinguish biological maleness, which undoubtedly includes a
healthy desire for self-preservation, from cultural manhood, which
requires a certain amount of self-discipline and even
self-sacrifice for the group (as does cultural womanhood).
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it be assumed that the male monopoly on warfare has been
eternal and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gravesites recently excavated in Russia contain the remains of
women warriors from the second millennium B.C. _ female skeletons
buried with weapons and bearing wounds inflicted by similar
weapons. The victims of the famous Neolithic massacre at Jebel
Sahaba included both women and men, and there is no evidence that
the perpetrators were exclusively male.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back into the Paleolithic Age, when hunting was probably
the principal form of human violence, growing archaeological
evidence suggests that it was a communal enterprise in which women
and children joined men in driving herds over cliffs into nets or
culs-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   The male-centered hunting strategy that figured so prominently
in the writings of sociobiologists in the 1960s and '70s _ in which
a small band of men stalks an individual animal _ may be a rather
recent innovation, necessitated by declining game populations in
the Mesolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient civilizations, some of the earliest deities
worshipped by humans were female, but they were hardly the
nurturing earth mothers imagined by many scholars. The archaic
goddesses unearthed from Mesopotamian ruins or recalled in
Mesoamerican mythology were huntresses and avid consumers of blood
sacrifices, often accompanied or represented by predators such as
lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Only later were these terrifying deities ``tamed'' through
marriage to patriarchical male gods and reassigned to agricultural
duties. Although the characteristics of the archaic goddesses tell
us nothing about the roles of actual women, they do suggest a time
when the association of manhood with violence and femininity with
gentlemen was not as self-evident as it has seemed in the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever our genetic and prehistoric cultural legacies, women in
the past two centuries have more than adequately demonstrated a
capacity for collective violence. They have played a leading role
in nonmilitary violence such as 18th- and 19th-century bread riots
and revolutionary uprisings, in which they were often reputed to be
``foremost in violence and ferocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, the Soviet military deployed them as fighter
pilots and in ground combat. Since then, women have served as
terrorists and guerilla fighters in wars of national liberation.
More to the point, women have proved themselves no less susceptible
than men to the passions of militaristic nationalism: witness
feminist leader Sylvia Pankhurst, who set aside the struggle for
suffrage to mobilize English support for World War I by, for
example, publicly shaming men into enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   Among heads of government, Margaret Thatcher is an exception to
the gender dichotomy. Among the many exceptions on the male side of
the ledger are the anti-militaristic, social-democratic Olaf Palme
and Willy Brandt. And of course the greatest pacifist leaders of
the 20th century were male: Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas K.
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Inherent aggressiveness of men and niceness of women? Perhaps
one thing is true: Whatever the innate psychological differences
between the sexes, a certain male propensity for chest-thumping
persists _ and it can be found among desk-dwelling American
scholars as well as alpha apes.

 &HT;    GOVERNORS SEEK RACIAL AND POLITICAL CALM
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With their state treasuries overflowing, governors
from coast to coast called this month for more civility and
cooperation between diverse ethnic groups and political parties.
</P>
<P>
   A Cox Newspapers review of inaugural or ``state of the state''
addresses this month by more than 40 of the 50 governors showed
that three themes _ less confrontation, higher spending on
education, and lower taxes _ popped up in almost every major
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Their priorities are similar mostly because the governors are in
touch with what their constituents want in this prosperous era,
according to political scientist Laura Van Assendelft of Mary
Baldwin College in Virginia. The author of ``Governors, Agenda
Setting and Divided Government,'' Van Assendelft said that was
especially true of the 22 re-elected and 12 newly elected just two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they propose things the people want,'' she said.
``When I did research for my book in 1994, economic development was
hot. Now you have a president who has prioritized education, and,
with the economy doing well, tax cuts and tax relief are bound to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls for racial and ethnic harmony come after an election
year in which black and Hispanic voter turnout was higher than
usual and decisive in some races.
</P>
<P>
   Such calls also could appeal in a non-threatening way to ``the
moral agenda, the whole idea that we've become a godless country
that has lost its moral bearings,'' suggested sociologist Paul
Luebke, who is also a Democratic state representative in the North
Carolina Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, only 11 percent of the school children in
Burlington, the state's largest city, are from racial minorities.
But that was enough to draw comment from the state's Democratic
governor, Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Vermont is only now becoming a diverse, multicultural
state, we have an opportunity to avoid mistakes made elsewhere,''
Dean said. ``It is extraordinarily important that we begin now to
set a tone which condemns racism and makes sure that all citizens
are equal and accorded the respect they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans don't belong in little ethnic and racial boxes (like
those) all over the world, in places with names like Kosovo,
Bosnia, Rwanda,'' Republican Gov. George Bush said in Austin. ``As
we head into the 21st Century, we should have one box: American.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the oath taken by Democrat Roy Barnes, who is white,
was administered by his old college friend, Robert Benham, chief
justice of the Georgia supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is white, and the other is black,'' Barnes said. ``This
act, which would have been impossible 100 years ago, shows Georgia
at its best, as a place where neither race, gender, nor geography
will ever divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, there were exceptions. In Mississippi, Republican
Kirk Fordice complained that for two years in a row the legislature
has buried his bill to rename a stretch of Interstate 20 for the
31st Infantry ``Dixie'' Division, formed during World War I from
the white National Guard troops of several southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I still don't get it,'' Fordice said. ``But, if that's
the way this system works, I hope I never do.''
</P>
<P>
   But far to his west, Republican Bill Janklow was forthright in
deploring divides between South Dakotans of Native American,
European and Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks back at the end of this new term, Janklow said,
``If there is one person of red skin or white skin or yellow skin
or brown skin who truly and honestly feels like they are
unacceptable and unaccepted and don't belong with everybody else,
I'm going to be a failure in my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Even farther west, in California, Democrat Gray Davis declared:
``In recent years we've had too much scapegoating and
finger-pointing.... So tonight I propose a four-year moratorium on
wedge-issue politics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD THAT CAN STAND ALONE AS A
</ANNOTATION>
SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
<P>
   Calls for avoiding partisanship were natural in Minnesota, where
Gov. Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party has to wrestle with a
legislature in which Democrats and Republicans each control one
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put down the partisan party politics and look at the
bigger picture,'' said Ventura. Like many governors, he faces a
relatively painless political dilemma: How to split a budget
surplus _ rather than how to cope with a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Revenues in the current budget year are running
ahead of projections in at least 46 states, according to the Fiscal
Survey of the States, sponsored by the National Association of
State Budget Officers and the National Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-year budget corrections to avoid deficits have been needed
this year only in three states: Nevada, where gambling faces more
competition from other states; Hawaii, which attracts fewer
tourists from troubled Asia; and Alaska, which was hurt by the
worldwide drop in the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Most states also expect continued prosperity and higher revenues
next year, even if they give some of their surpluses back to the
taxpayers in rebates or rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There are two exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Governors are still worried that the federal government will
try to seize some of the 25-year revenue windfall expected from the
tobacco suits the states settled with tobacco companies last year.
Several are counting on that money to balance their state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Future revenue is uncertain in a broad swath of Plains states
stretching from Texas to North Dakota, where farmers and ranchers
have been devastated by droughts that damaged cotton crops, row
crops, dairy production and rangeland, and by over-production that
crushed prices for hogs, cattle and grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, estimates are that as many as 25 percent of the
region's producers _ particularly small to mid-size farms with no
off-farm income source _ will discontinue production over the
year,'' the Fiscal Survey said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, Republican Gov. Ed Schafer said, ``Although the
farmers and ranchers continue to face major problems caused by poor
weather and garage-sale prices, we can be encouraged by recent
reports of many farmers who used alternative crops and forward
contracting to shelter their losses.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in those states, unemployment remained near the lowest
levels in history. Though they restrained themselves, most
governors this year could have summed up their state's prospects in
the one-word yelp that closed Ventura's inaugural address:
``Hoo-yah!''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is a sampler of quotations from speeches this
month by state governors:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tough new (drunk driving) laws and aggressive public
education must send a simple and blunt message: Drive Hammered, Get
Nailed.'' _ Jane Dee Hull (R) Arizona
</P>
<P>
   ``You (elected officials) will discover soon enough that on some
days you're the pigeon and on some days you're the statue, and more
often than not, the statue.'' _ Mike Huckabee (R) Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   ``The only government in history to promise more than the United
States liberals was the former Soviet Union. There is yet room in
the garbage dump of history if we are determined to share its
philosophy and its fate.'' _ Kirk Fordice (R) Mississippi
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Commonwealth has a right _ and I would say a
duty _ to ban the transportation of garbage on Virginia's
waterways.'' _ Jim Gilmore (R) Virginia
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces beyond our state borders threaten our growth and our

 &HT;    Vampire bats: Yes, they DO want to drink your blood
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only one type of bat deserves a bad
name: Vampire bats.
</P>
<P>
   Vampires are found in South America, Latin America and Mexico.
They can't go more than 48 hours without a blood feeding, so
they've never traveled to Florida. Also, they can't live more than
a few hours in temperatures below 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about real highly evolutionized animals,'' says
John Seyjagat, director of the Lubee Foundation for bat research in
Gainesville. ``You're not talking a run-of-the-mill animal, you're
talking a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   When a vampire lands on a cow, sheep or horse, its scalpel-sharp
teeth make an incision. The bat's saliva has an anesthetic and an
enzyme that stops blood from clotting _ so the victim doesn't feel
it, and the blood flows.
</P>
<P>
   These bats are smart enough not to kill too quickly _ they drain
just enough blood to keep their host weak but alive, so they can be
fed on another day.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go to Tampa to see the only vampire bats on display
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Gardens has about 50 vampires, and the Florida Aquarium
has 13 in its Frights of the Forest exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Gardens trades theme-park tickets to a slaughterhouse for
beef blood and shares with the aquarium. A pint feeds 10 to 13
vampires.
</P>
<P>
   Lead zoo keeper Phil Lightfoot takes care of the Busch vampires
and says they can be quite personable. ``There's a vampire bat that
hops up on my boot and sniffs around and follows me around until I
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Cindy Marks decided to devote her life to bats
after reading a magazine story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a small article about Bat Conservation International
and it told about how bats are mistreated,'' she says. ``I sent in
$15 and it included a one-day workshop in Washington, D.C., at the
National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we met our first bats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We quickly discovered,'' adds Cindy's husband, George, ``how
much we didn't know about bats and how much we knew that was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Cindy and George started the the nonprofit Florida Bat
Center in Punta Gorda. Cindy is a graduate of the closest thing to
Bat College, a two-week course at York University in Toronto. At
their home are ``working'' bats Pippy, Amelia, Emily and Charlotte
_ all used for school visits.
</P>
<P>
   The couple serves as the state's No. 1 clearinghouse for bat
information. State agencies, pest control companies and wildlife
centers call the Bat Center with problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bat Center you can buy everything from a bat T-shirt ($12
to $18) to a bat cookie cutter (50 cents). Bat houses to attract
the bug-eaters run from $19.95 to $42.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Walsh got into the business of removing bats because he
just got tired of killing things.
</P>
<P>
   He owns Walsh Pest Services in Palm City, and he guesses about
half of his pest business is bats _ jobs that can cost from a few
hundred dollars for a home to $15,000 for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in my glory doing this,'' he says. ``No one is going to
talk to me about bees, roaches or crickets. You go home, and we
helped something live another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh removes bats from places they're not wanted _ such as the
outdoor bar of a resort where bat guano was falling into drinks _
by using soft netting that seals off access to the roost. When the
bats can't get back ``home,'' they find a new place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has relocated bats from a Stuart gas station, a $1 million
home in Lake Wales and a gym at Jensen Beach Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother of all of his recent jobs was the
soon-to-be-demolished Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa, where 4,000 to
6,000 Mexican free-tail bats once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather spend the $15,000 than be known as a bat killer,''
said Bill Hand, construction manager for the Tampa Sports
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal to kill a bat in Florida, just like it's illegal to
wantonly kill any animal. Endangered species are protected by
federal and state laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Jeff Gore, a wildlife biologist for the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission, says bat exclusion is the best way to
remove bats from an unwanted place. You could destroy a bat colony
legally, he says, if you can prove a public health hazard. ``But
we've never OK'd that.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much talent to move a bat colony, Walsh admits _
just a sturdy stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is having the nerve to get in a 5-foot
bucket and go up 30- to 70-feet,'' he says. ``And then there's the
smell (of the roost). Not a lot of people want to do this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bat Conservation International, based in Austin, Texas, is world
famous for conservation and education. It was started in 1982 by
Dr. Merlin Tuttle, a mammal expert, who has been fascinated by bats
since he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   Members of BCI receive a variety of perks including Bats
magazine, news of eco-tours and workshops, discounts on more bat
stuff than most knew existed. The price of membership is $25 and

 &HT;    Worried about work? Author says job stress just `small stuff'
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In Richard Carlson's world, ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy'' plays 24 hours a day on the radio. Everyone
smiles. No one has ever heard the word Prozac. Tension headaches
are taboo. And if ever there is heard a discouraging word, well,
it's drowned out by a de-stressing mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the best-selling author of ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff
... And It's All Small Stuff;'' ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff With
Your Family;'' and ``Don't Worry, Make Money,'' is back.
</P>
<P>
   This time he takes on the Godzilla of stress inducers, the
workplace, with ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff at Work, Simple Ways
to Minimize Stress and Conflict While Bringing Out the Best in
Yourself and Others'' ($11.95, Hyperion).
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't whether stress exists in the workplace,
Carlson said during a recentew York Times News Service

 &HT;    Woodworkers have sharpnering method preferences
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week we talked about sharpening, but only one
method. Fact is, most woodworkers use different methods for
different tools. There is, however, no total agreement on how a
given tool should be sharpened. There are all kinds of ways to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Chisels and plane irons need to be as sharp as they can possibly
be, which means razor sharp.
</P>
<P>
   My preference here is stones. There are natural and artificial
stones, and there are Western and Japanese stones. Western stones,
especially artificial Western stones, are intended to be used with
oil as a lubricating medium.
</P>
<P>
   This presents a problem. Oil gets into stuff, and when it gets
onto the wood you're working, it can permanently stain it.
</P>
<P>
   So, as I said last week, I use Japanese stones. The artificial
ones are a lot cheaper than the natural and they do a splendid job.
They use water for lubrication, and they can be had in grits much
finer than most American manufacturers produce.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the greatest of woodworkers have radically
different methods. James Krenov uses a hand-cranked grinder. If you
don't have one, you've surely seen them in stores _ just like an
electric grinder, except there's a handle on the right side. You
get the wheel up to speed with the handle, then slide the tool up
the rest until the edge makes contact. The advantage over a powered
wheel is that there's no chance of overheating or burning the edge.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot, of course, expect decent results with the dismal
stones that come with these wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Tage Frid, on the other hand, sharpens his tools on a stationary
belt sander. He uses a worn belt of the finest grit. Just thinking
of this makes me shudder, but I guarantee you Frid does not use
dull tools. He uses this technique because it's quick; it requires
the least possible break from the work he's doing, and he knows how
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his only option. Tage had an old-world apprenticeship.
He could probably sharpen a chisel on the bottom of his shoe. It
would just take a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   I generally leave power sharpening options for turning tools.
The idea here is that the superfine edge brought up by waterstone
sharpening will be destroyed in a second or two by the violence of
turning. Here, I think a couple of good wheels turning on a
1700-rpm grinder are ideal. However, there are outstanding turners
who use stones to put the ultimate edge on their tools.
</P>
<P>
   There are some machines that combine the benefits of good jigs
to hold the tools with waterstones turning at slow speeds. The
really good ones, however, tend to be expensive.

 &HT;    All that bran for naught
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Health-conscious Americans have been choking down
sticks and twigs for decades based on the theory that a high-fiber
diet will protect them against colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that eating cow food does nothing to prevent humans
from getting colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of the diet theories that sweep across America, this
one was never tested.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to diet, health and safety, Americans have a
gullible streak a mile wide.
</P>
<P>
   After years of accepting as gospel-truth the theory that
high-fiber diets help prevent colon cancer, teams of researchers
from Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
actually tested this unproven theory.
</P>
<P>
   After tracking the eating habits of more than 88,000 female
nurses over 16 years, the researchers discovered that women who ate
a high-fiber diet were no less likely, or more likely, to develop
colorectal cancer or polyps, which can be precursors to cancer,
than women who ate little fiber.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't matter if the women smoked, ate fried foods or
dined daily on red meat.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive study also found that it made no difference
whether the women were marathon-running vegetarians or couch
potatoes who preferred to vege-out in front of the TV with a big
bag of Hershey Kisses.
</P>
<P>
   The solar-powered fruit-and-nut crowd immediately dumped loads
of fetid tofu all over the study.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps women have different colons. This was one line of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nurses have colons that allow them to maintain a diet of
Big Macs and German Chocolate cake without getting colon cancer any
more than roughage-munching nurses who wear out their teeth chewing
indigestible plants. Perhaps all that hospital formaldehyde does
something strange to the colons of female nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``perhaps'' raised by skeptics of the study was that the
nurses could not be counted on to accurately recall their own
eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to explain away the study requires a belief that
nurses either can't remember maintaining a high-fiber diet or that
they are somehow motivated to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the real reason that a 16-year study of 88,000 nurses
came out the way it did is because the three-decade-old theory by
British missionary Dr. Denis Burkitt was wrong from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure sounded wonderful to people who thrive on high-guilt
diets.
</P>
<P>
   The diets of these people are many and varied. But the mother of
all their diets is the Spit Diet _ if it tastes good, spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that coarse, bulky food, such as bran, stimulates and
invigorates the colon to the point that all this activity prevents
the formation of polyps and reduces the likelihood of colorectal
cancer sounds reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   But absent scientific research, practically any crackpot theory
can be made to sound good.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have purchased truck-loads of crystals that were said
to cure everything from colon cancer to depression.
</P>
<P>
   Health food stores are crammed with ``medicines'' made from
roots, berries, old bones, fungi, tree bark or practically anything
that can be made to sound healthy. Each ingredient has its own
theory behind it, which means absolutely nothing unless it has been
tested and proven effective and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans now are buying magnets that are supposed
to prevent or cure various ailments. Curative magnets also are
based on a theory that sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should be remember that it's healthy to take a dose of
skepticism when they confront good-sounding, but untested, health
and safety theories.

 &HT;    Who says Y2K won't be a blessing instead of a bug?
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ You just can't overestimate the pessimism of
the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Two of last year's most popular movies were about huge asteroids
plummeting
</P>
<P>
   toward Earth, with little the world could do to stop them. Even
in the most optimistic of these films, cheerfully named
``Armageddon,'' Paris is wiped out, New York is half destroyed and
millions of people die.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of fun from Hollywood, huh? Yet the populace flocked to see
these films and if we have an ``Armageddon II _ The Real Thing,''
it will probably do even better.
</P>
<P>
   As a people, we thrive on worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Y2K frenzy is so hot _ the idea that at one
second past midnight Jan. 1, 2000, every computer is going to
freeze up. Or, if not every computer, at least the ones controlling
the most important parts of our lives are going to crash.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who are reasonable people (I think) who've taken
to storing up on coal-oil lanterns and bottled water. I realize
some places in the world may be a bit behind the curve in dealing
with the computer changeover, but my guess (save this,
survivalists, in hopes that you can ``tell me so'' next year) is
that most of America on Jan. 1, 2000 will be fighting the hangover
bug more than the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has never been made clear to me why the
nation's water systems, most of which were built before computers
were a gleam in Bill Gates' eye, will suddenly stop delivering
water at the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us without lives might consider having a party that
night to flush all the toilets at 12:01 a.m. just to make sure we
still can. The tension leaves me almost breathless.
</P>
<P>
   And who decided that Y2K had to be a bug, anyway? The
pessimists, of course. From now on, I'm going to refer to it as the
Y2K blessing.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, while all you pessimists are out their wringing
your hands about what terrible things might happen when 1999 turns
into 2000, I'm going to be considering all the wonder _ positive _
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I'm going to consider the possibility that the Y2K
blessing will wipe out the ability of all telemarketers to function
for a good month. Can any of you imagine what it might be like to
actually sit through dinner without someone asking you if you
wanted to change long distance services? Give me the blessing!
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping that Jerry Springer is not Y2K compliant, what a
wonderful blessing that would be. And maybe the Y2K blessing will
somehow keep all those 400-decibel car stereos from working. Sorry,
but one man's bug is another man's blessing. I think of the quiet
possibilities, what sounds we might begin to hear again.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am pretty sure that the birds are already Y2K
compliant, so is the air, the trees, rain and wind. My children are
not compliant at all, Y2K or otherwise, but that has never given
them any downtime.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2000, each of them will be waking up, being happy,
being grumpy,
</P>
<P>
   being themselves and it won't have anything to do with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   All the things that are really important don't have single
computer chip inside them.
</P>
<P>
   I know, many people are most worried about what will happen to
the monetary
</P>
<P>
   system and, thus, have been changing their cash into gold.
</P>
<P>
   But, heck, I don't have any money now. I'm not going to lose
anything. The Y2K blessing could only do something positive for me.
I intend to write a bookful of checks on Dec. 31 with that notion
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   You're completely right if you think that I don't know for sure
that something positive will come out of the Y2K blessing, but all
the naysayers don't know for sure that anything bad is going to
happen either.
</P>
<P>
   Given the two options, I'll accentuate the positive any time.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    A royal night's sleep
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Anita J. Finkelstein

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be easy to say that selecting a mattress is a
lot like tasting wine. Most people know the steps they are supposed
to take _ swirling the wine, smelling the wine, looking at the wine
_ but they don't exactly know how they are supposed to decide if
it's good or bad other than by tasting the wine. Same goes with a
mattress: Although you should try it before you buy, there are
other factors to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Mattresses are considered both a big-ticket item and a long-term
investment _ a decent one should last at least eight to 10 years.
So picking the perfect mattress is an important decision that will
impact your sleep _ and perhaps your health _ for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Korshak, general manager of the Norcross-based Mattress
King, says there is everything from the Yugo of mattresses to the
Rolls-Royce version out there. ``Every customer has different needs
and a different budget. That's why there are so many different
kinds.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``A queen size mattress can range from $199 to
$4,000,'' said Ellen Fruchtman, spokeswoman for Rich's. ``Price is
very much determined by the quality of what's inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to the sheer volume of choices out there, the confusing
marketing tactics and unfamiliar technical jargon that push the
industry, and the consumer can end up feeling intimidated, confused
or sometimes even cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Says Korshak, ``When it comes down to it, the consumer just has
to know what their needs are and be educated on what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of information and some forethought, it is possible
for a consumer to save time and lessen the stress of buying a
mattress.
</P>
<P>
   LYING DOWN ON THE JOB
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for a mattress? Here are some tips from bedding
manufacturers, retailers and industry experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan on spending at least one day shopping for a mattress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring your favorite pillow with you and spend at least 5
minutes lying on each bed you're considering. (Don't forget to wear
comfortable clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a mattress that is firmer than you are accustomed to. It
will soften with use. ``A good mattress is like a good quality
shoe. You have to break it in,'' says Ron Wolinski, director of
corporate training for Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask about edge support. ``Bending a bed often will shorten its
life span, so it's a good idea if you move a lot to get a bed with
good edge support,'' suggested Karrie Auer, area manager for the
Mattress Firm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mattresses and box springs come as ``sleep sets'' _ you should
buy them together. Place a new mattress on an old box spring and it
will feel different than it did in the store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to ask about the box spring or foundation. It
acts as a shock absorber, and it's just as important to check on
its quality.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're worried about a large mattress set fitting through a
narrow hallway, ask about a split box spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your salesperson should inform you about turning your mattress
periodically. ``We liken it to rotating your tires. Flipping it and
turning it end to end will extend its life and help it wear more
evenly,'' said Dave Choppa of the Original Mattress Factory. If
your salesman doesn't mention it, be wary.
</P>
<P>
   THE FACTS _ AND THE FEEL _ OF THE MATTRESS MATTER
</P>
<P>
   Before you even step foot in a store, start by answering three
questions: What are you looking for in a mattress? How much are you
willing to spend? Where are you going to shop for it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Assessing your needs. Ron Wolinski, manager of corporate
education for Simmons, says the key question people should ask
themselves is, ``What is important to me in a bed?'' Are you more
concerned about back problems, for example, or that you are able to
sleep undisturbed? ``The first thing I ask a customer is what's
wrong with the old mattress,'' says Jack Korshak, general manager
of Mattress King in Norcross. ``It's a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions: Is it just old and sagging or are you not
getting a good night's sleep on it? Do your partner's movements
wake you up at night? Is it too soft? Is it too firm? Can you not
get comfortable?
</P>
<P>
   It's also good to think about who is going to be using the bed
and how often, says Dave Choppa, vice president of the Original
Mattress Factory in Marietta. If it's for a guest room, for
example, the mattress won't be used as much, and durability might
not be as important.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deciding on a budget. This is important, because if a $199
sale on a brand name is what lures you to a mattress store, you'll
be disappointed if you find it's the lowest-quality version of that
style.
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb to remember is that within each brand name
there are several different styles. And each style is available in
at least three different price points _ low-end, an average and a
better bed. The differences are in the layering and types of
padding and in the kind and number of coils (more on that later).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a budget, that's why you'll find a $199 version
of a Beautyrest and a $599 version of the same label. But
generally, the low-price beds are going to be the lowest-quality
ones,'' says Korshak.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the general price range of mattress sets and go with
a set budget in mind, you are more likely to walk away happy with
your purchase. According to Consumer Reports' March '97 issue, the
selling price for well-constructed bedding typically starts at
about $600 for full-sized and $800 for queen-size sets. In Atlanta,
expect to pay $200 to $300 for a twin set and $800 to $1,000 for a
king set.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Fruchtman of Rich's says people need to recognize that in
the end, they get what they pay for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finding a retailer. It's a good idea to get recommendations
from friends before shopping and it's also smart to visit more than
one store. The key is to go somewhere you trust. People usually go
to a mattress chain, buy from department stores or from independent
mattress retailers, which tend to focus on a few brand names.
Another option is an independent mattress manufacturer, such as the
Original Mattress Factory, which makes the product on site.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that research has shown that 70 percent of
consumers buy the mattress from the first store they visit.
Salesmen know this, so expect most of them to do everything in
their power to keep you from leaving without a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Also be aware that comparison shopping from store to store is
virtually impossible, because national brands usually have at least
two different product lines, according to Consumer Reports: the
ones that are available everywhere and ones that are exclusive to a
certain store.
</P>
<P>
   The ones that are available nationwide though, don't necessarily
have the same coverings _ and the same mattress can have different
names. For example a Serta Perfect Sleeper Brookhollow in one store
might be called a Serta Perfect Sleeper Escape in another. Even if
the covering (also known as ticking) is the same, and it's made by
the same company, it doesn't ensure it's the same mattress. The
only way to tell is to know the specs of each style, which are not
always listed on the tags. So, ask to see a ``comparable'' mattress
if you have found one you liked at another store.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING ABOUT BUILD GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD SHOPPING SMART
</P>
<P>
   Once you've determined your needs, it's time to learn more about
mattresses. There are four main things to think about when
selecting a mattress: size, comfort, support and durability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size. This is the easy part. In general, a mattress should be
at least 6 inches longer than the person sleeping in it. Full size
beds are 75 inches long, where queens and kings are 80 inches.
Finding a longer mattress usually requires custom ordering.
</P>
<P>
   Where a full size bed used to be the norm, more people now opt
for queen size. Dave Choppa of the Original Mattress Factory says
research shows the average person shifts position 40 to 60 times
per night, and the full size bed at 53 inches by 75 inches allows
less than the width of a standard crib (27 inches) per person. Most
stores will offer a 30-day comfort promise, meaning customers can
try the bed out for 30 days, and if they don't feel they are
getting a good night's sleep on it, it can be exchanged for another
bed in the store. The only catch is that often the consumer has to
pay a second delivery charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comfort. Yes, Goldilocks had the right idea when she put her
head down on each bed before choosing one that was ``just right.''
The only way to figure out what is most comfortable is to lie down
on a few.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent increase in sleep research, doctors don't
have a recommendation of the best sleep surface. Karrie Auer, area
manager for the Mattress Firm, said she has found that people who
sleep on their backs tend to like firmer beds, while people who
sleep on their side or stomach gravitate toward the softer beds.
</P>
<P>
   Try not to ask which ones are ``firm'' and which are ``soft'';
instead feel for yourself. To a manufacturer and retailer, the
terms firm and soft (or plush) refer to how much the bed compresses
when a person lies down on it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor determining firmness and softness is what's
inside and how it is layered. Mattresses are filled with a
combination of flat foam sheets, convoluted or egg crate foam
sheets, cotton batting and shoddy pads (which is matted fabric
scraps). How these sheets are layered creates the feel of the bed.
A firm mattress will conform to your body as well as a soft one _
it will just take some time to break in.
</P>
<P>
   Beds range anywhere from seven to 15 inches in thickness, which
is directly related to the number of layers of padding. A thicker
bed does not necessarily mean a softer bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support. Support refers to the flexibility of the mattresses
and how well it handles the weight of the users. It is determined
by the number of coils, the thickness of the coils and the number
of turns in each coil.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Brennan, vice president of material management for Simmons,
recommends a coil count of at least 312 for a full size bed. (The
highest coil count for a Simmons full size bed is 704 coils.) The
thickness of the wire should be 13 or lower _ the lower the number,
the thicker the wire. Also, there should be five or more ``turns''
to the wire (the more turns, the tighter the coil).
</P>
<P>
   ``The more coils you have, the better the bed is going to
conform to your body,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Although, at some point, if you have so many coils that the wire
being used is thinner than it should be, you are sacrificing both
firmness and durability.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, like Serta will vary the thickness and
amount of coils in different places in the bed to provide more
support where needed. ``The heaviest part of a person's body is the
middle third. Serta has a bed that has a reinforced center, which
helps people with lower back pain,'' says Mattress King's Jack
Korshak.
</P>
<P>
   If you're confused by the different types of coils, just
remember that it isn't the type of coil so much as the thickness of
it that affects support. In fact, the same company, Leggett &AMP;
Platt, makes 80 percent of the coils found in beds made in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Durability. You want a mattress that will withstand use and
abuse. It's a good idea to take a good look at the mattress to see
if it is a quality product. Most stores have cutaways of their
mattresses so you can see how the mattress is constructed. But also
look at the exterior: Are the seams straight? Is the quilting tight
and uniform? Are there any broken threads?
</P>
<P>
   The industry standard is for all mattresses to carry a 10-year
warranty. Some come with more.
</P>
<P>
   Auer said it is important to recognize that a warranty covers
the structure of the mattress and foundation only. It doesn't cover
how long it is going to last. ``Keep in mind what you are buying as
you go up in price is comfort life.''

 &HT;    Living large in small spaces
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas, _ Living space comes at a premium price in this
town. Diminutive homes have castle-size pricetags and tiny
apartments rent for a square foot on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to cramp anyone's sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Central Texans have skimped on home decor
just because their shelters are of modest dimensions. They've
turned their small spaces into personal havens that showcase
everything from cowboy funky to midcentury art in less than 800
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   They have met the challenge by making use of every inch of their
dwellings, sometimes packing things in despite the view of many
interior designers that compact living requires one to edit, edit,
edit.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ball knows about editing. She had to reduce 50 years
worth of furniture to a handful of pieces when she moved into a
652-square-foot apartment in the Grand Court, a Round Rock
retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   She incorporated a single visual theme. ``It has to flow from
room to room. You have to know your stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Ball know what she had, she knew exactly where each
picture, accessory and stick of furniture was going in her two-room
residence. Her grandmother's mahogany credenza is in a corner next
to a draped picture window and is topped with an ornate English
mirror. A pair of velvet chairs flanks a pine Welsh piece in the
living-dining-kitchen area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my daughter if it (the dresser) didn't fit, I wasn't
moving,'' said Ball. ``There was a lot of measuring.''
</P>
<P>
   She exchanged a large antique bed for a smaller version with a
Bishop headboard. It shares the bedroom with a mahogany secretary
Ball purchased as a young bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to select pieces that are versatile,'' said Ball, who
has a small chest of drawers in her tiny bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although her place is compact, Ball said she designed it so that
from any sitting position the eye can view her collectibles and
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   While floor space is a major concern when living in a small
home, vertical space is crucial too, says Stephanie Villavicencio,
a licensed interior designer with Cohagan Hall Design Associates.
</P>
<P>
   For most small-space dwellers, maximizing the walls and windows
gets items and accessories off the floor. For others, such as
Charles Peveto, it's the difference between showing his artwork or
putting it in storage.
</P>
<P>
   Peveto lives in a downtown apartment that is slightly less than
800 square feet. It comes with a loft connected by a spiral
staircase, but the area is mainly used for storage because of the
lack of natural light, said Peveto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall space is most definitely important,'' he said. Most of
his collections are of midcentury Texas artists, pre-Columbian
artifacts and chrome furniture from the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The dining niche is dominated by a chrome and black table that
once graced a Texaco gas station's women's lounge. His
living-dining area is so miniscule that in an effort not to crowd
the floor he got rid of his sofa, keeping two chrome chairs. An
Everett Spruce painting entitled ``Broken Tree'' hangs over the
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Peveto included the kitchen in his decorating scheme, using his
bar counter to display part of his pre-Columbian art collection.
</P>
<P>
   A large collection can be a challenge in small spaces and that's
why functional diversity is a must, says Kathy Borth, a member of
the American Society of Interior Design and owner of KTB Designs.
</P>
<P>
   In South Austin, Pamela Hawthorne knows the meaning of
multifunction. She lives in an apartment that's roughly 390 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel small,'' she said. ``I feel that I live
large.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne said she didn't hesitate moving into her ground floor
home because it was bigger than her previous residence in Mexico.
She lived in the former maid's quarters in a home she shared with
two other couples.
</P>
<P>
   Within her small space, Hawthorne has carved out a dining area,
home office and entertainment spot. Her one-bedroom, one-bath
apartment is home to Hawthorne's most treasured possessions,
including her cowboy collectibles, an extensive assortment of glass
and dinnerware and a 1930s-era living room suite with matching
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much, but everything I have means so much to
me,'' she said. ``If I love it I'll find a place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne's home requires that her storage is often in sight.
The kitchen cupboard is open. A wooden cutting table is her main
countertop, but the wheeled cart holds a set of fine glassware and
Hawthorne's colorful assortment of shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
   A white wicker console table covered with a swatch of lace is
used to display framed photographs and a shelf underneath showcases
Hawthorne's cowboy boots. ``I call it my memory table. All the
people I love are on there and even the boots have stories,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tips for small space decorating
</P>
<P>
   Storage
</P>
<P>
   _ Use shelving and storage units that maximize the wall space.
Shelving can be used to subdivide a small space into versatile
areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't waste the space above your head. A narrow shelf at
picture-rail height can be used to display accessories. Don't
forget about the vertical space inside cabinets or closet doors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Organize similar items together, such as books, pictures or
china, in one place, either stacked or shelved. Personal items in
such a collection give a small home a personality.
</P>
<P>
   _ A decorative screen can hide everything from exercise
equipment to an on-going hobby project.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture
</P>
<P>
   _ Place your furniture where it makes the most sense. Do not
automatically exclude large pieces, because they can serve as focal
points in a tiny room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Select multifunctional furniture as much as possible, such as
an ottoman that works as a coffee table and a storage chest, or a
stool or chair that turns into steps. Use trolleys and trays that
double as side tables. The idea is to make your furniture do double
or triple duty, so you won't have to buy so much of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ When selecting furniture, try not to get too many pieces that
sit heavy on the floor. Furniture that you can see under and around
allows light to pass through, eliminating visual barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Color
</P>
<P>
   _ White isn't the only color to use in a small space. There are
a hundred shades of pale that will work just as well as white in
reflecting light. You might want to paint only the walls, leaving
the ceiling white. The pastel colors can offer a compact place a
sense of expansiveness.
</P>
<P>
   _ If using a monochromatic color scheme, remember to use texture
in fabrics, coverings and objects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daytime rooms look best in light, airy colors to make them
appear bigger. Night-time rooms can be painted strong, dark colors;
they make a room more formal.
</P>
<P>
   _ To ``raise'' a low ceiling, use a cool color. To ``lower'' a
high ceiling, paint it two to three shades darker than the walls.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it ever has been
since the terrible civil war of 1918-20.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state
apparatus, anchored by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its
disintegration has created a power vacuum that has yet to be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the fledgling government confronts a vast array of
problems without the power to take effective action. Unable to rely
on popular ideology or coercion to establish control, the
government must prove itself to the people and establish its
authority on the basis of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yeltsin administration has abjectly failed to do so, and
it cannot meet the most basic needs of the Russian people. Russians
know they can no longer look to the state for personal security,
law enforcement, education, sanitation, health care or even
electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of government authority, criminal groups _ the
Russian mafiya _ increasingly hold sway. Expectations raised by the
collapse of communism have been bitterly disappointed, and Moscow's
inability to govern coherently raises the specter of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   If internal war does strike Russia, economic deterioration will
be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the gross domestic
product has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, 10 years ago,
unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with
many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty
line (earning less than $70 a month). Modern Russia can neither
collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor
significantly cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a
land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where
subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an
American-style capitalist economy look remote at best.
</P>
<P>
   As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current
political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most
analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian
people will soon run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In
the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in
check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little
civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile
foundation _ personal friendships between government leaders and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a
dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay,
housing and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has
created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the
military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals
may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers
who dislike being used as a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities
pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local
governments for housing, food and wages. Draftees serve closer to
home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow,
it is not at all clear which side the military would support.
Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the
structure of the Russian Federation makes it virtually certain that
regional conflicts will continue to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 89 republics grow ever more independent in a system
that does little to keep them together. As the central government
finds itself unable to force its will beyond Moscow (if even that
far), power devolves to the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy collapsing, republics feel less and less
incentive to pay taxes to Moscow when they receive so little in
return. Three-quarters of them already have their own
constitutions, nearly all of which make some claim to sovereignty.
Strong ethnic bonds promoted by shortsighted Soviet policies may
motivate non-Russians to secede from the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's successful revolt against Russian control inspired
similar movements for autonomy and independence throughout the
country. If these rebellions spread and Moscow responds with force,
civil war is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Should Russia succumb to internal war, the consequences for the
United States and Europe will be severe. A major power like Russia
_ even though in decline _ does not suffer civil war quietly or
alone.
</P>
<P>
   An embattled Russian Federation might provoke opportunistic
attacks from enemies such as China. Massive flows of refugees would
pour into central and western Europe. Armed struggles in Russia
could easily spill into its neighbors. Damage from the fighting,
particularly attacks on nuclear plants, would poison the
environment of much of Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Within Russia, the consequences would be even worse. Just as the
sheer brutality of the last Russian civil war laid the basis for
the privations of Soviet communism, a second civil war might
produce another horrific regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming is the real possibility that the violent
disintegration of Russia could lead to loss of control over its
nuclear arsenal. No nuclear state has ever fallen victim to civil
war, but even without a clear precedent the grim consequences can
be foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Russia retains some 20,000 nuclear weapons and the raw material
for tens of thousands more, in scores of sites scattered throughout
the country. So far, the government has managed to prevent the loss
of any weapons or much materiel. If war erupts, however, Moscow's
already weak grip on nuclear sites will slacken, making weapons and
supplies available to a wide range of anti-American groups and
states.
</P>
<P>
   Such dispersal of nuclear weapons represents the greatest
physical threat America now faces. And it is hard to think of
anything that would increase this threat more than the chaos that
would follow a Russian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   America must reduce the chances that civil conflict in Russia
will unleash nuclear weapons against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, Washington must do more to reduce the amount of nuclear
weapons and fissionable material that could be lost, stolen, or
used in the chaos of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program, under which the United States buys
Russian nuclear material to use and store in America, is a good
start, but it must be accelerated. America should not worry about
making a profit on the plutonium and enriched uranium it buys, but
just get the goods out of Russia as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, arms-control initiatives that may have been
unpalatable during the Cold War should now be reconsidered, given
the risk of accidental or unauthorized launchings.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers should contemplate agreements to reduce
the total number of Russian (and American) nuclear weapons, to
deprive the Russians of the ability to quickly launch a nuclear
strike (for example, by contracting to store warheads away from
missiles), and should intensify efforts to develop an effective
defense against missile attacks.

<P>
   Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it ever has been
since the terrible civil war of 1918-20.
</P>
<P>
   For 70 years, the Soviet Union operated a strong state
apparatus, anchored by the KGB and the Communist Party. Now its
disintegration has created a power vacuum that has yet to be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the fledgling government confronts a vast array of
problems without the power to take effective action. Unable to rely
on popular ideology or coercion to establish control, the
government must prove itself to the people and establish its
authority on the basis of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yeltsin administration has abjectly failed to do so, and
it cannot meet the most basic needs of the Russian people. Russians
know they can no longer look to the state for personal security,
law enforcement, education, sanitation, health care or even
electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of government authority, criminal groups _ the
Russian mafiya _ increasingly hold sway. Expectations raised by the
collapse of communism have been bitterly disappointed, and Moscow's
inability to govern coherently raises the specter of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   If internal war does strike Russia, economic deterioration will
be a prime cause. From 1989 to the present, the gross domestic
product has fallen by 50 percent. In a society where, 10 years ago,
unemployment scarcely existed, it reached 9.5 percent in 1997 with
many economists declaring the true figure to be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two percent of Russians live below the official poverty
line (earning less than $70 a month). Modern Russia can neither
collect taxes (it gathers only half the revenue it is due) nor
significantly cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers tout privatization as the country's cure-all, but in a
land without well-defined property rights or contract law and where
subsidies remain a way of life, the prospects for transition to an
American-style capitalist economy look remote at best.
</P>
<P>
   As the massive devaluation of the ruble and the current
political crisis show, Russia's condition is even worse than most
analysts feared. If conditions get worse, even the stoic Russian
people will soon run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   A future conflict would quickly draw in Russia's military. In
the Soviet days civilian rule kept the powerful armed forces in
check. But with the Communist Party out of office, what little
civilian control remains relies on an exceedingly fragile
foundation _ personal friendships between government leaders and
military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the morale of Russian soldiers has fallen to a
dangerous low. Drastic cuts in spending mean inadequate pay,
housing and medical care. A new emphasis on domestic missions has
created an ideological split between the old and new guard in the
military leadership, increasing the risk that disgruntled generals
may enter the political fray and feeding the resentment of soldiers
who dislike being used as a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Newly enhanced ties between military units and local authorities
pose another danger. Soldiers grow ever more dependent on local
governments for housing, food and wages. Draftees serve closer to
home, and new laws have increased local control over the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Were a conflict to emerge between a regional power and Moscow,
it is not at all clear which side the military would support.
Divining the military's allegiance is crucial, however, since the

TAXES MAY STILL BE CERTAIN, BUT ON THE WEB IT'S AT LEAST EASIER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects and clarifies Intuits market share in 14thgraf, which is
the 1stgraf of the 2ndtake)   By STEVEN E. BRIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web sites that deal with tax information have become more
sophisticated and capable. Even the venerable Internal Revenue
Service web site has tax forms that can be filled out online and
printed, a far cry from the days when everything had to be
downloaded, printed and then filled out by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this change comes about as a result of the IRS e-file
program, in which tax returns can be filed electronically, whether
by telephone or through a computer. This has spurred an increase in
Web sites that can handle tax calculation and filing through a
browser, something unheard of just a few short years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 25 million returns were filed electronically,
about one in five according to the IRS. This year, the agency
expects that number to climb to about 30 million. This is a
significant change for the IRS, which still has its employees
retyping all the information that comes in on paper returns,
whether it was done by hand or computer _ and even if it comes in
on the 1040PC form. Every return that comes in electronically is
one less that has to be retyped and, according to the IRS, the
money saved will be redirected to customer service and upgraded
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is room for improvement. According to the IRS, half the
professionally prepared personal returns are prepared on computer
but less than a quarter of those are filed electronically. A paltry
28,000 of the approximately 9 million individual extensions
requests, seeking permission to file late returns, are filed
electronically. A picayune 1,000 of the 23.8 million payments that
accompany individual returns are received electronically, leaving
the IRS awash in a sea of paperwork and perpetuating a process that
is prone to error.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional tax software providers like Intuit and H&AMP;R Block
have jumped on the e-file bandwagon. They have been joined by
companies such as One Tax, Tax Act and Secure Tax that provide
information as well as software and online filing services. The
incentive for consumers to use such services is the promise of
easier filing, faster refunds and fewer contacts with the IRS
</P>
<P>
   The sites that have the Web-based tax programs uniformly offer
tax advice of high quality. H&AMP;R Block's Kiplinger Tax Cut,
www.taxcut.com, mple, offers a handy section titled ``50 ways to
cut your taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site put together by the Internal Revenue _
Servicewww.irs.ustreas.gov. _ contains tax forms, information
sheets and explanations of the many arcane rules of the tax
business. The tax rules are available on line in what the IRS
claims is plain language; it is offered on CD-ROM for tax
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has expanded its use of what it calls fillable forms.
The forms are based on Adobe Acrobat's Portable Document Format
(P.D.F.). Unlike the other forms, which must be downloaded, printed
and filled in by hand, these allow users to view a form with a Web
browser, type information in the appropriate fields and then print
or save.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the forms do not have a computation engine built
in, so it is still necessary to do all that troublesome math on
your own and carry the results from one field to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Younger taxpayers, or those who want the tax code explained in
English, may want to check out the Taxi, or Tax Interactive,
section of the site. This explains how the tax system works, where
tax money goes and what many of those obscure terms mean. The
explanations are a bit simplistic, but if you don't know the
language, Taxi is a good place to start. Another useful section is
the site's FAQ page. Like much in the world of taxes, it depends
heavily on numbers, but it still contains useful information.
</P>
<P>
   When tax time is past, some people may want to take a look at
the Statistics of Income section of the Web site. This contains
demographic information about taxpayers that may be of some use to
businesses that need to target their products or marketing or to
people trying to better understand their community. By the way,
people perusing the entire site can also rest easy, according to
the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't count visitors or individual users,'' said Linda
Wallace, the agency's chief of electronic information services.``We
feel everyone wants to be anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed king of the hill for personal tax software is
Intuit, with the various versions of Turbotax grabbing well over 70
percent of the federal tax software market, according to PC Data of
Reston, Va., a market research company. Intuit also makes a
Macintosh version, Macintax, and several versions of the program to
handle state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Intuit is taking that background to the Web with Web
Turbotax.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers advantages over desktop tax software. First, you
don't have to worry about software conflicts, running out of disk
space or any of the problems that arise when installing software.
Second, the program and data are available through any Web browser:
just take out your W-2 statement of annual earnings, open the
browser, go to the site and enter the information. The drawbacks,
as for any Internet service, are slow connections and concerns
about security.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit provides extensive notes about the security of its
encryption (128-bit secure socket layers) and about the penalties
the company would face if it misused tax data. Concerns over speed
are addressed by allowing users to do much of the work without
charge and requiring a fee only when it comes time to print, view
or send the return.
</P>
<P>
   The product will handle federal returns as well as those from
any one of the 44 states (and the District of Columbia) that have
income taxes. But you can't file in two states.
</P>
<P>
   The site charges $9.95 for a 1040EZ form or the state equivalent
and $19.95 for a 1040 or its state equivalent. Finished documents
can be printed to be mailed or sent electronically. Taxpayers who
earn less than $20,000 can use the program free under an IRS
program intended to encourage electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   The information for the return is collected during Web
Turbotax's interview process.
</P>
<P>
   As the interview process proceeds, an outline down the left side
of the screen changes to let you know where you are in the process;
FAQ's appear on the right to answer questions relevant to that part
of the interview. Although helpful, these additions slow down the
process. Entering the assets needed for Schedule C was painful; a
single question was answered on each screen, with three or more
screens for each new asset. Users who have outfitted a home office
with a computer, television, scanner, fax, desk and related
equipment might find this too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When finished with the federal return, the program asks if you
wish to prepare a state return.
</P>
<P>
   Onetax.com is relatively new to the consumer market, though not
to tax and financial information. It is an offshoot of Thomson
Investors Network, which produces First Call financial earnings
estimates, software for professional tax preparers and other
financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Like Web Turbotax, One Tax allows you to do federal and state
taxes using a Web browser, limiting users to a single state. The
price is low, $9.95 &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Web Turbotax, One Tax takes more of a minimalist
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed for speed and for the average taxpayer.
``We don't do the business,'' said Jane Moynihan, a company
spokeswoman. ``We don't do Schedule C. We don't do multiple
states.'' &UR;  &LR;  Everything is clearly labeled, and every field has
either a Help button or a Tax Tip button next to it. A quick click,
and more information on that field is available. Another click, and
you are back at the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of time doing a robust help engine and making
help easy,'' Ms. Moynihan said. ``We also don't give out tax
advice. We do give advice like, `This is what this means.'''
</P>
<P>
   One Tax allows the user to switch between the standard ``guided
entry'' process and an ``independent entry'' system. Independent
entry allows you to click on a menu at the top of each page,
choosing items like W-2, 1099, dependents and similar items, and
then enter the information you happen to have at that time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, one of the House impeachment managers referred to the
removal of former federal judge Alcee L. Hastings _ in order to
buttress the notion that perjury is serious enough to warrant
impeachment. In 1989, Hastings was impeached for bribery and
numerous counts of perjury in regard to his testimony as a
defendant in a criminal case. The House manager neglected to
mention that Alcee Hastings is now a colleague, a member of the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, being a scoundrel while serving as a judge is
unacceptable, but isn't a barrier to joining the ranks of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Probably that isn't news to most people.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment clauses in the U.S. Constitution grant the
Senate the power to remove the president, vice president, federal
judges, and all civil officers of the United States. The Senate is
also given the authority to disqualify those convicted of articles
of impeachment from holding elected or appointed public office. The
Senate rarely votes in favor of disqualification although it only
takes a simple majority, not a two-thirds majority, to add this
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to President Clinton's impeachment, the U.S. House had
impeached 15 individuals: a president, a senator, a Cabinet member,
and 12 judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate convicted seven _ all judges. Only two of those seven
were disqualified from holding office in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after his impeachment, Hastings ran as a Democrat
for a House seat from his home state, Florida. He's been a member
of Congress ever since. And last September, Hastings introduced a
resolution to impeach Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings accuses Starr of violating his oath of office, misusing
the powers granted to an independent counsel, and unlawfully
disclosing grand jury material for the purpose of embarrassing
Clinton. The House voted to table Hastings' resolution.
</P>
<P>
   An added note: Prior to his impeachment, a jury in a criminal
trial had acquitted Hastings of conspiring to solicit a bribe.
Nevertheless, the House voted in favor of 17 articles of
impeachment against Hastings, including the bribe for which a jury
had found him not guilty. The Senate convicted him of seven
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt sticks in GOP's craw
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
called for a criminal investigation of Larry Flynt. The RNC's Web
site (www.rnc.org) was filled with invective against Flynt for
nearly a week, reviling him as a smut peddler and Clinton's
pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson claims Flynt is ``obstructing a congressional
investigation'' for digging into the sexual escapades of Republican
hard-noses who want Clinton impeached. Apparently, the RNC's
chairman doesn't see the delicious irony of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   Starr couldn't find a shred of evidence against Clinton in the
Whitewater probe and found nothing to show Clinton might have been
involved with illegal use of FBI files, but the Paula Jones lawsuit
promised some sexual hanky-panky that a zealous prosecutor might be
able to finesse into an article of impeachment _ if he played his
cards right. After all, Starr had a $40 million deck.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's OK for Starr to dig into Clinton's sex-capades,
but it isn't OK for a private citizen to dig into the dalliances of
those Republicans who have been aiming to bring the president down
since he was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson calls Flynt's outing of hypocrites ``the politics of
personal destruction.'' And it is. But who started it? Suddenly,
this tactic has become very personal. It could be a married
Republican senator who has his private life smeared across the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to the darker era of the FBI, one cannot find the
Republican Party calling for the dismissal of director J. Edgar
Hoover for secretly recording and publicizing the sexual revelry of
certain civil rights leaders. The politics of personal destruction
was used with a vengeance against black leaders. But now, used
against the conservative establishment, it is finally considered
dangerous and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon impeachment standard
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1974, when the House Judiciary Committee voted on
articles of impeachment against President Nixon, the committee
passed three: obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The committee rejected two articles, one of which should be at
issue in the Clinton impeachment trial. Article 4 accused Nixon of
tax evasion and illegally using government funds to improve his
private residences.
</P>
<P>
   The article reads, in part: 1) ``He ... unlawfully received
compensation in the form of government expenditures at and on his
privately-owned properties ....'' and 2) ``He knowingly and
fraudulently failed to report certain income and claimed deductions
... which were not authorized by law ....''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee voted 26-12 against Article 4.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that Congress should only
impeach a president for actions taken against the Constitution or
against our form of government. Although Nixon might have been
guilty of tax evasion (a felony) and misappropriating government
funds for his own use (another felony), the committee felt that
these crimes were personal and not crimes against the nation;
therefore, not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate of the 106th Congress used the standard applied to
Nixon, all fair-minded Republicans would have to vote to acquit
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The actions that brought impeachment articles against Clinton
were certainly personal, even private, and do not jeopardize our
nation.
</P>
<P>
   That raises questions: Do we have two or more standards of
impeachment for presidents? If so, can this process ever be fair?

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Where the roads get narrow in the
Deep South
 &HT;    (Eds: Subs 6th-to-last graf.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ Everybody knows about the Deep South. Not so many
people, perhaps, know about the deep, dark South.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way to get there is to get yourself lost on some
backwoods road where the magnolias leave off and the bayous begin.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, most travelers don't take the time to take
in the surroundings. All they care about is finding a road that
will deliver them back to the main highway and away from
Deliverance country, all the while whistling ``Dixie'' past the
graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I found myself halfway lost midway on a day trip
into Louisiana, trying to stay on old U.S. Highway 190 eastward
from Jasper, Texas _ the jumping off place for civilization, of all
places.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Texas, I passed the Three Flags Truck Stop.
If I had to guess, I'd say those were the Lone Star flag, the
Confederate flag and the U.S. flag, the last one included as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Please note that as you cross the Sabine River into Louisiana,
the speed limit falls off along with the condition of the highway _
55 mph compared to 70 mph in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Obey the law. They have ways of making you obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   I once got stopped by a constable in Mississippi, a long ways
from nowhere, for suspicious behavior, a compound felony in my case
seeing as how I was driving a car with Texas plates.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd done to disturb the peace officer was stop to take a
photo of a quaint old building. I was required to explain exactly
why and what for the photograph had been made.
</P>
<P>
   I said not a word about constitutional rights. The main word I
stuck with was ``Sir.'' I count myself lucky to have escaped with
only a warning ticket _ shooting pictures out of season, or some
such offense.
</P>
<P>
   When you step back into time, watch your step. Southern
hospitality has a way of turning hostile.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is God's country. Old-time religion is still
very much up to date, as spelled out on the front of such worship
places as the New Testament Holiness Church, the True Light Church
and the Jesus Church.
</P>
<P>
   But it's like they say: It takes a Christian to burn a cross in
your yard.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs that, catching my eye, made me catch my breath:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Quicksand Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Merryville Cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Help Prevent Woods Arson.''
</P>
<P>
   That last one in particular serves as a reminder, pilgrim, that
you're in outlaw territory where old feuds flame up in a very real
way, and setting a neighbor's woods on fire is a weapon of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   But a good rule of thumb for traveling Louisiana: The worse the
highway gets, the better the food gets _ such is the French
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Where else could you find a St. Germain road, other than the
backwoods of south Louisiana or the Left Bank of Paris?
</P>
<P>
   What I like best is what you don't find.
</P>
<P>
   I drove more than 90 miles, through one little community after
another, and never saw a McDonald's or a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   C'est bon, y'all.

Delta Air Lines announced it was adding a $2 surcharge to all

   GLASS-COLUMN _ ASHINGTON In 1964, as Lyndon Johnson campaigned
in Ohio, his motorcade drove by an elderly woman propped in a
wheelchair. Somebody had put in her lap a photo taken of her as a
new-born baby while being held by Abraham Lincoln. LBJ, who didn't
miss much, ordered his caravan halted. To the delight of all, he
had the White House photographer take his picture with the old
lady. That poignant scene, spanning a century, came to mind when
President Clinton, closed his State of the Union address by evoking
the image of another American president standing ``a 100 years from
tonight ... in this place to report on the State of the Union.''

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ Last week we talked about sharpening,

on how a given tool should be sharpened. There are all kinds of
ways to do it. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR

   BATS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only some bats deserve a bad

   RELIGIONRELIGION-Y2K _ Shaunti Christine Feldhahn, a former
federal reserve financial analyst who lives in Atlanta, has started
a project and written a book to help churches get ready for Y2K.
She's no survivalist nut who's piling up bottles of water and dried
food in the basement. Feldhahn explains the problem and offers ways
individuals, businesses and churches can prepare to prevent major
problems so that services to the poor and needy go on despite
computer problems. She also offers ways churches and synagogues can
be available to help communities that may have temporary power
outages, food shortages or business closures at New Year 2000. We
interview her and two or three people involved in local chapters of
the Joseph Project, helping people get ready. (GWhite, Atlanta

   ORCHIDS _ Orchids have been given a bad rap. Like roses, they
have the reputation for being tempermental. But professionals and
amateur gardeners alike contend they're one of the easiest plants
to grow indoors _ and one of the most effective ways to bring
garden color inside during the gray days of January. To whet your
appetite, the Atlanta Botanical Garden is sponsoring an exhibit of
more than 1,500 varieties of orchids, and next Saturday visitors
will be treated to a guided tour of the greenhouse where they're
grown. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR PHOTOS.

   LEEMAY-COLUMN _ Columnist Lee May muses on hummingbirds and
life: ``One day, Lyn and I sat idling, counting the number of times
a bird stuck its icepick beak into the little feeder hole during
one trip. Thirty-six times, we counted. A minute or so later it
returned, only to get buzzed by another hummingbird. Back and forth
they went, taking turns dive-bombing each other away from the
feeder. The result: Neither tasted the sweetness. So it goes in the
garden of life.'' (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). FOR SATURDAY

   SMALLSPACES _ Austin apartment rents are high. Some places are
asking for nearly $1 a square foot. And so for many folks a large,
rommy place to live is out of the question. But how do residents
live with style and comfort in a small place--not a dorm room. How
have they applied their creativity to transform a need into
nice-looking nest. Several new books are out on how to decorate
small houses, some no larger than 440 square feet, and apartments.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ Last week we talked about sharpening,
but only one method. Fact is, most woodworkers use different
methods for different tools. There is, however, no total agreement
on how a given tool should be sharpened. There are all kinds of
ways to do it. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR

   BATS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only some bats deserve a bad

   RELIGIONRELIGION-Y2K _ Shaunti Christine Feldhahn, a former

She's no survivalist nut who's piling up bottles of water and dried
food in the basement. Feldhahn explains the problem and offers ways
individuals, businesses and churches can prepare to prevent major
problems so that services to the poor and needy go on despite
computer problems. She also offers ways churches and synagogues can
be available to help communities that may have temporary power

   ORCHIDS _ Orchids have been given a bad rap. Like roses, they

amateur gardeners alike contend they're one of the easiest plants
to grow indoors _ and one of the most effective ways to bring
garden color inside during the gray days of January. To whet your
appetite, the Atlanta Botanical Garden is sponsoring an exhibit of
more than 1,500 varieties of orchids, and next Saturday visitors
will be treated to a guided tour of the greenhouse where they're
grown. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH COLOR PHOTOS.

a bird stuck its icepick beak into the little feeder hole during
one trip. Thirty-six times, we counted. A minute or so later it
returned, only to get buzzed by another hummingbird. Back and forth
they went, taking turns dive-bombing each other away from the
feeder. The result: Neither tasted the sweetness. So it goes in the

   SMALLSPACES _ Austin apartment rents are high. Some places are

have they applied their creativity to transform a need into
nice-looking nest. Several new books are out on how to decorate
small houses, some no larger than 440 square feet, and apartments.

THE JUDGE MADE AN APPALLING SITUATION EVEN WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been several weeks since I read the outrageous _ if
understandable _ comments a judge made when sentencing a despicable
man, but I can't get them out of my mind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole case made me sick. And what the judge said
simply made a horrid situation worse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Brian Stewart, 32, of Columbia, Ill., stood
convicted of an almost-unthinkable crime: injecting his own
11-month-old son with HIV-tainted blood old to avoid child-support
payments. The boy, now 7, suffers from the disease HIV causes,
AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a punishment severe enough for ruining the
life of an indefensible baby. As a volunteer in the struggle
against AIDS, I have seen dozens of people die of this evil
disease. To give it to a child intentionally is unfathomable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there's a difference between expressing justifiable outrage
at illegal and immoral acts and using a judge's secular authority
to set forth theological conclusions that don't belong in a court
of law. The latter is exactly what St. Charles, Mo., County Circuit
Judge Ellsworth Cundiff offered to the defendant and the world when
he sentenced Stewart in early January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cundiff, calling himself a religious man, said this: ``I believe
when God finally calls you, you are going to burn in hell from here
to eternity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't object to the judge holding that opinion. He's free to
believe a Manichean vision of ultimate reality if he chooses. It's
a free country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as a public servant, Cundiff has no right to afflict anyone
in his courtroom with his myopic brand of theological certainty, no
right to take upon himself the grandiloquent role of eternal judge
and jury. It's an assault on the constitutionally mortared wall
separating church from state. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cundiff may well believe Stewart will burn in hell. I suppose if
Cundiff were a minister in Stewart's church, if any, he might have
a right to say that to Stewart, though even there such certainty is
misguided. But Cundiff isn't clergy. He's a county judge, and some
judgments are beyond his competency. The eternal destiny of Brian
Stewart is one of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most religions offer one or more theories of what happens to us
when we die. But none, so far as I know, leaves anyone's eternal
fate up to a county judge in St. Charles, Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my own Reformed Tradition of Christianity, in fact, there is
a much-misunderstood Calvinistic doctrine called
double-predestination that can be unpacked fully, if at all, only
with delicately nuanced language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In oversimplified _ and almost certainly misleading _ words, the
doctrine says God irresistibly designates some people for heaven
and some for hell, and there's nothing really to be done to change
that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to argue either for or against this idea here. In
fact, I bring up the doctrine simply to point out how it can
prevent people who pledge some allegiance to it from making the
sort of judgment about others that Cundiff made about Stewart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author Kathleen Norris best explains this ironic truth in her
recent book ``Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith'': ``To me, the
most intriguing thing about John Calvin's doctrine of
predestination (inherited from Augustine) is not his belief that
some are gratuitously predestined by God to eternal salvation and
some to damnation but that no one but God knows who is who. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There,'' she says, ``among the heroin addicts, is one destined
for eternal joy. There, among the faithful widows of an ordinary
church, is one destined for damnation. It strikes me that only a
French lawyer could have come up with so complex, if not bizarre, a
justification for treating all people as if they could be among the
elect, the chosen of God.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not wish upon Cundiff the burdens of being a Calvinist or
of explaining the hard doctrine of predestination. But I do wish he
had been influenced by the doctrine's implications that Norris
points to and that he would be, thus, more reluctant to judge
others' eternal destiny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For, in the end, none of us should put up with hearing anyone
damned to hell by a county judge. That ruling requires at minimum a
change of venue. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS SUFFER OVER IRAQ, MISSILES
 &HT;    EDs: Albright departs for Russia on Sun.; holds meetings in
Moscow Mon.-Wed.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Jan. 24 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It is not the Cold War, but it is chilly.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian relations are filled with friction these days,
perhaps more than at any time since Russia became an independent
state after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Moscow on
Monday for meetings with senior Russian officials amid strains over
policy toward Iraq, the Balkans, disarmament and U.S. sanctions
against Russian institutions allegedly supplying help to Iran to
build its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Russian foreign ministry officials promised frank talks over
what they are politely terming ``the accumulation of agitations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the widely held notion in Moscow is that the Clinton
administration is kicking Russia while it is down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from bad to worse,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, of
the Moscow-based Strategic Studies Center. ``For the past two
months almost every action the U.S. takes provokes anger in Moscow.
It is a conceptual challenge for Washington -- how do you handle a
former superpower?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policymakers have struggled with that question since the
fall of the Soviet Union. It has become increasingly difficult as
the gap widens between America, with its robust economy and firm
superpower stature, and Russia, its superpower status long ago
faded and currently in the midst of an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Russia's media have denounced Washington over
the perception in Moscow that the United States is seeking world
hegemony while deliberately humiliating Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very start of the year Washington has led a massive
attack against Russia with the aim of overcoming the last remaining
barrier to American world domination,'' the politically moderate
newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The always-sensitive relationship between Moscow and Washington
took a turn for the worse in December when the United States and
Britain launched air attacks on Iraq without prior consultations
with Russia or other members of the United Nations Security
Council. In protest, Russia recalled its ambassadors to Washington
and London.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent controversy came this week when the White House
proposed changes to the terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. The proposal for amending the treaty is based on a
new American defense doctrine that recognizes a need for new
anti-missile systems to counter threats from rogue states such as
North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Economically and politically weak, Russia has little pressure to
bring to bear on the Clinton administration to counter its
international policy. Russia depends on economic aid from the
United States and Europe, including food aid this winter to help
Russia through its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday that damage
control is necessary during the Albright visit. ``The essential
thing is to prevent sliding from certain differences to outward
confrontation. That we will not allow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ABM proposal, put forward in a letter from President Clinton
to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, was met with a negative
response from the Russian government. ``We proceed from the
assumption that it must not happen, and will actively be trying to
convince our American partners,'' Ivanov said Friday in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   It prompted howls of protest from Russia's press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States invites Russia to take part in a new arms
race,'' announced a front-page headline in the newspaper Sevodnya,
adding that Russia's economic crisis would prevent it from
competing.
</P>
<P>
   Also fueling Russian ire was the White House decision this month
to impose sanctions on several Russian companies and scientific
institutes which the United States alleged were supplying weapons
technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Russian officials denied the allegations, though Yuri
Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister, admitted in a
television interview Wednesday that there was a basis for the U.S.
charges. ``Some of the cases that they have presented have turned
out to be true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled Yugoslavian province of Kosovo also will be high on
the agenda, and ripe for disagreement as NATO threatens possible
air strikes on Serbia, a longtime ally of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In another development certain to trouble Moscow, NATO is
scheduled to expand eastward later this year, adding three new
members formerly under the umbrella of the Soviet Union -- Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic. Russia is concerned about the
related buildup of military forces in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is carrying what she has called ``a very large briefing
bag'' for the Moscow trip. She is scheduled to meet with Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Ivanov. It was not clear whether she
would hold talks with Yeltsin, who is in a Moscow hospital
recovering from a bleeding ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Russians will be surprised by anything she
has to say. But clearly she will seek to clarify our position on
these matters,'' said a U.S. official speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even a U.S. proposal to provide more aid to Russia to cope with
its aging nuclear arsenal was derided in the Russian press and
among some opposition political leaders as disingenuous and
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union speech, President Clinton called on
Congress to spend $4.5 billion over the next five years to help
Russia disarm and safeguard its vast nuclear arsenal. The United
States has spent about $2 billion over the past eight years on
disarmament programs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While welcomed by the Kremlin, some Russian politicians doubted
whether Clinton could win approval in Congress for the proposal and
said it was a thinly disguised effort to win ratification in the
Russian parliament for the long-delayed START II arms treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and nationalists who control Russia's lower house
of parliament, the Duma, had been ready to vote on START II last
month. But they canceled the vote to protest the U.S. bombing of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government supports ratification of START II --
which would reduce U.S. and Russian arsenals by half -- to
3,000-3,500 warheads each -- arguing that budget cutbacks will
force Russia to reduce the numbers of its aging nuclear missiles
anyway.

GROUP SAYS AIR FORCE AND ARMY KICK OUT GAYS IN RECORD NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army and Air Force discharged homosexual
personnel in record numbers last year despite a controversial
policy that allows gays and lesbians to serve, the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network (SLDN), a gay rights legal organization,
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of discharges in the two military branches represents
huge increases over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force discharged 414 gay and lesbian personnel in 1998,
compared with 309 in 1997, 282 in 1996, 234 in 1995 and 180 in
1994, according to figures provided by the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also discharged record numbers of homosexuals in 1998,
according to unofficial figures provided to the gay rights
organization. In the Army, 317 enlisted personnel were dismissed
compared with 197 enlisted and officers in 1997, 206 in 1996, 182
in 1995 and 136 in 1994. The group wasn't provided 1998 figures for
the number of Army officers discharged.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokesman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio led the way in the Air
Force, accounting for 271 basic trainees severed from the service
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures, first reported by the San Antonio Express-News
in an article by Sig Christenson, represent the greatest number of
homosexuals discharged from the Air Force since President Clinton's
controversial ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'' policy went
into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But T'Jae Gibson, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said
a majority of the discharges in 1998 _ 391 cases _ were because the
service member voluntarily came forward and described his or her
sexuality to a commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people walked into their boss and said, `I am gay' or `I
engage in homosexual or bisexual activity,''' Gibson said,
</P>
<P>
   SLDN officials countered that the Air Force actively roots out
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have also heard that spin before from the Air Force,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-director of SLDN, which provides legal aid to
troops tossed from the military under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reason for gay discharges is that commanders continue
to ask, pursue and harass people whom they suspect are gay,'' she
contended.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were not available Friday for the Navy and Marine Corps,
but the number of homosexual discharges in those branches has risen
since the policy's inception, according to Benecke.
</P>
<P>
   The result of a bruising battle among the White House, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and Congress, the ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' policy means that homosexual activity is banned in the
military, but that gays and lesbians may serve as long as they keep
quiet about their sexual orientation and aren't caught engaged in
homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders may not inquire of a service member's sexual
orientation, according to the rules. However, they may do so if
they have ``credible information'' that a service member engages in
homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pentagon efforts to clarify the policy, homosexual
rights organizations maintain that gays and lesbians in the ranks
who conceal their sexuality are routinely drummed out.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director for SLDN, said, ``The new
numbers suggest that rather than providing any kind of relief for
gay people under this policy, commanders are going after people
even more fervently.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy ``has intensified the ousting of people thought to be
gay or lesbian,'' said Rob Blanchard, a San Antonio-based state
vice president of the Log Cabin Republicans, a nationwide group of
15,000 gays.

TEXAS DEATH SPARKS TV REPORT ON WHITE SUPREMACY IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Documentary airs Monday night) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with a small article in a London newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   BBC journalist Zab Chughtai read the story last June about the
horrific death of Jasper, Texas, resident James Byrd Jr. How he was
walking home from visiting relatives. How he was accosted, beaten
and chained by his ankles to a pickup. How he was dragged for two
miles, leaving a trail of blood and flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born after the civil rights struggle,'' said Chughtai,
31, ``and I didn't expect to read the story of a dragging-to-death
of a man apparently because of the color of his skin. Not in my
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story that crossed national boundaries _ racial
problems are not only something Americans are suffering from. James
Byrd's murder led me to research the white supremacy movement in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The product of her research is ``A Murder in Texas: Hate on
Trial,'' a one-hour documentary to air Monday night on Discovery
Channel. The report is remarkably deep in sources and includes rare
interviews with William Pierce, author of the notorious ``The
Turner Diaries''; Richard Butler, founder of the neo-Nazi group
Aryan Nations; and Charles Lee, grand dragon of the Texas Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable: Chughtai got those racists to speak to
her, the daughter of Pakistani parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I rang the white supremacy organizations and got through
to their leaders, I obviously had to be straight with them, and I
told them my name was Zab,'' said Chughtai. ``It's clearly not an
Anglo-Saxon name, despite my English accent. (She was born in
northern England.) In fact, the English accent comes with a brown
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern, she said, was not a fear for her safety as much as
a fear that the project would be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to lose the interviews, nor did I want the
interviewees to self-edit when they had to sit and answer questions
from someone with black hair, black eyes and a brown face,'' she
said. (Her crew _ producer, cameraman, sound man _ was white.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the characters I spoke to were interested in whether I
was dark-skinned or olive-skinned or pale-skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Chughtai won them over. She believes she succeeded
because she was straight with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that I'm a storyteller trying to tell a story,
that my race is completely irrelevant as far as I am concerned and
it should be irrelevant to you.''
</P>
<P>
   She guaranteed them nothing, and no money changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``the issue of money was raised, but you
can't pay these people to talk, nor can you promise that certain
things will not be used. You have to be completely straight. I
couldn't afford not to be. Ultimately they will see this
documentary, and they're dangerous characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from espousing the views of white supremacists, ``Murder in
Texas'' is balanced by interviews with the likes of NAACP chairman
Julian Bond, Southern Poverty Law Center counsel Morris Dees,
Jewish Defense League chairman Irv Rubin, New Black Panthers
founder Aaron Michaels, and Bob Blizter, chief of the FBI's
domestic terrorism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai visited with Patrick Petrick, a former member of the
Aryan Brotherhood _ he has the white-power tattoos to prove it _
who has become a Christian and today calls prison in Huntsville,
Texas, home. She talked with the Rev. Claude E. Payne, bishop of
the Episcopal Diocese of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Powerfully and purposefully, ``Murder in Texas'' leads with the
murder of Byrd; we retrace the yellow-chalked road on which he was
dragged. Using footage from KPRC-TV, Houston's NBC affiliate, we
are introduced to his alleged killers, one of whom _ John William
``Bill'' King _ is facing trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   The report also begins with brief remarks from James Byrd's
sister, Clara Taylor, and daughter, Renee Mullins. Mullins recounts
how her father's body was so torn up _ his head and right arm were
dismembered _ that his casket had to be closed at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Said Chughtai, ``She said to me _ this is not in the film _ `I
served in the U.S. military because I felt that the enemy was
outside my borders. But the enemy is within.'''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary then dives in deep, demarcating battle lines
separating sides of what NAACP's Bond calls a ``low-level race
war.'' Though small in number _ estimates are that the white
supremacist movement has 100,000 U.S. members, ``with a reach to
sympathizers of 1 million'' _ civil rights proponents treat their
rhetoric with deadly seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be black in America today is to be constantly on the alert
for real and sometimes imagined slights that come your way,'' says
Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they're seen less often, the appearances of
Pierce, Butler and Lee leave an indelible impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a patriotic person,'' says Pierce, ``but I feel no sense
of loyalty to government. I'm only concerned with my own people,
people of European ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages of hate come from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to strangle them (his opponents) if I can,'' says
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The report, disturbingly illustrated with modern-day
cross-burnings and salutes to Hitler, also taps into the
supremacists' use of the Internet, and the Christian Identity
church movement, which says racial purity is Bible-based.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it also recounts the Branch Davidian fiasco of
1994 in Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. ``The
Turner Diaries'' comes up here, with Dees linking the book to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The book, the story of a race war in America targeting blacks,
Jews and the government, has been called by the FBI ``the bible of
the racist right.'' Timothy McVeigh, convicted in the Oklahoma City
bombing, is said to have had many copies of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised if the people who have engaged in strikes
against the government have in many cases read `The Turner
Diaries,''' says Pierce. ``In the case of the three ex-convicts in
Texas,'' he says, speaking of the men charged with Byrd's death,
``I may be surprised that any of them can even read. They seem
pretty much like a low-life crew ... I don't believe in many cases
(The Turner Diaries) inspires people to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chughtai said she was surprised she found the supremacists
``charmingly disarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These men lead the movement because they inspire, and you can
see from the film that some people may think what they're saying is
frighteningly possible. It's because they're charmingly disarming
that they're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   They were charming, but they could also be combative ``during
moments when they clearly didn't like the line of questioning that
I had to pursue,'' she said. ``I mean, this is not a propaganda
film, a platform for them to advertise their views.''
</P>
<P>
   The white supremacy movement, Chughtai warned, ``doesn't simply
target the lone African-American walking home late at night. They
are anti-Semitic, anti-abortion, anti-affirmative action, anti-race
mixing and anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First and Second Amendments (of the Constitution) define
the dream of democratic freedom, but the consequence of that kind
of freedom is that you do have a constitutional right to hate,''
she said. ``You don't have a constitutional right to hurt somebody.
It's the gray area in between that I think we should address.''

WEBTV'S CHAT ABILITIES LIMITED SINCE DEVICE CAN'T RUN PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just got WebTV, and several of my friends are on America
Online. Is there any way that we can talk to each other in chat
rooms or with instant messages?
</P>
<P>
   A: The short answer is no. WebTV, while a computer of sorts, is
not one that has all the capabilities of a traditional PC. It
cannot run programs other than the specialized software used to
access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, this may change with future versions of WebTV. And
there are ways you can communicate _ other than via e-mail _ though
they're somewhat klunky.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a traditional PC, and you were not on America Online,
you could chat with your AOL friends using Instant Messenger. This
program, which I've touted before, is an excellent piece of
freeware that lets you chat one-on-one with AOL subscribers, or
with anyone who has the program. The latest version, 2.0, lets you
set up multi-person chats. You can get it at www.aol.com/aim/. It's
free, but you do have to register to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Once you do, you can also use another feature called QuickBuddy,
at www.aol.com/netmail/quickbuddy/about.html. This uses Java _ a
programming language supported by most PC Web browsers _ to run a
streamlined version of Instant Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the browser on WebTV doesn't support Java. WebTV
executives, after first saying they would not offer Java support,
said in December that they are trying to find a way to add it. If
it comes, it will only be available on WebTV Plus, not the older
WebTV Classic boxes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to keep in mind: WebTV is owned by Microsoft, which is
involved in a bitter court dispute with Java creator Sun
Microsystems over Java. As a result, it's questionable just how
hard Microsoft will try to get Java into WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   There's a workaround, however. There are several sites on the
Web that offer chat rooms that don't require a Java-capable
browser. For example, Talk City at www.talkcity.com has an area
called EZ Talk Web. Have your AOL friends go there and meet you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently discussed the differences in various kinds of
removable drives, like a Zip or an LS-120. I just bought a new
computer with a big hard drive, and I wanted to look at one of
these as a backup system. But to back up a 14-gigabyte hard drive
with a Zip drive, which uses just 100-megabyte disks, would be
almost as bad as using floppies! What do you think is the best
solution for backing up a big hard disk?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither a 100-megabyte Iomega Zip drive nor a 120-megabyte
LS-120 drive are suitable for a full backup of a drive that big.
While you likely won't fill it all the way up right at first, even
1 gigabyte of space requires 10 Zip disks. At about $10-$15 apiece,
that gets pricey.
</P>
<P>
   You could go with an Iomega Jaz drive, which holds 1 or 2
gigabytes, but those are expensive, too. A 1-gigabyte disk costs
about $100; a 2-gigabyte disk about $125.
</P>
<P>
   A tape drive may be your most cost-effective choice, though tape
is notoriously flaky when it comes to restoring from a backup, and
you can't use it for general storage. A 10-gigabyte tape cartridge
will run about $35, making it a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers have suggested that buying a second big drive and
using it only to backup a main drive is a good idea, given how
cheap new hard drives are today. This makes backing up easy: just
drag and drop between drives to store a backup. Or, you can use
commercial backup software to create a compressed backup on the
extra drive.
</P>
<P>
   However, hard drives have a siren song _ eventually, you'll want
to put other things on that drive, and use it for day-to-day
computing.

   &UR; CATACLYSMIC EXPLOSIONS MAY HAVE HELD UP ALIEN VISITORS &LR;  _ The
powerful explosions caused by gamma-ray bursts could be the reason
why we haven't yet had any visitors from outer space. After
studying the effects of cataclysmic explosions on life, an American
astrophysicist has concluded that aliens may have just started to
explore their galaxies. By Robert Matthews. 700 words. (slugged:

<P>
   Over 15 million homes around the world have unwittingly bought
digital TV receivers which allow broadcasters to prevent them from
making watchable recordings of material they transmit.
</P>
<P>
   The news will surprise consumers who have invested in equipment
to receive digital pay television, only to find they can't record
the movie they have paid for and watch it later.
</P>
<P>
   Prerecorded VHS tapes have been copy-protected for the past
decade. To do this the movie industry uses a system developed by
the California company Macrovision. To make copy-proof tapes,
manufacturers connect a Macrovision encoder between the master tape
player and the slave decks that make authorized copies. The encoder
adds extra pulses to the picture synchronization pulses in the
original signal. Analogue televisions need sync pulses to keep the
pictures steady.
</P>
<P>
   When the tapes are played, television sets ignore the extra
pulses and display perfect pictures. But if the output of one VCR
is connected to the input of another, to make an illicit copy of
the tape, the extra pulses fool the recorder into making a copy
which is too out of sync to play.
</P>
<P>
   This analogue anti-copy system, however, cannot stop people from
making analogue copies of digital broadcasts, because sync pulses
are not sent with the digital picture signal. Instead, the digital
receiver adds its own sync pulses to the picture information.
</P>
<P>
   To protect material from being broadcast in digital form,
Macrovision has developed anti-copy circuitry that is built into
the digital television receiver. As the receiver converts the
digital signal into analogue format for display on a conventional
television, the anti-copy encoder can add extra pulses to the
output. A television displays the pictures normally, but a VCR
makes an unplayable copy.
</P>
<P>
   The encoder is switched on by trigger signals which the
broadcaster transmits along with programs which it does not want
viewers to tape.
</P>
<P>
   Macrovision says the majority of digital receivers now being
sold worldwide incorporate its anti-copy chips.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, most receivers in the shops are fitted with the
encoder chips, even though the terrestrial broadcaster On Digital
is still negotiating with Macrovision. Jeremy Corcoran,
Macrovision's pay-per-view director says he hopes a deal will be
signed soon. Meanwhile, satellite broadcaster BSkyB emphasizes that
it applies copy protection only to pay-per-view movies, and that
subscription channels can be taped. But skeptical viewers will
recall that free-to-air channels often become pay channels.
</P>
<P>
   For now, manufacturers can sell equipment that defeats
Macrovision. But in the United States, the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act will make it illegal from May 2000 to sell a VCR or
black box which evades anti-copy technology. Europe is considering
similar laws. And Macrovision has patented every conceivable
circuit which defeats its own system and will sue infringers. &QL;

   Drugs could one day be harvested from the semen of genetically
engineered pigs, Canadian researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Most people experimenting with transgenic animals that produce
therapeutic proteins are looking at females, with the idea of
purifying the drugs from the animals' milk. But Fran ois Pothier of
Laval University in Quebec believes that male pigs could produce
enough protein in their semen for it to rival milk.
</P>
<P>
   Semen naturally has a much higher protein content than milk,
Pothier says, and a boar can ejaculate up to half a liter at a
time. Boars also begin producing semen at the tender age of 110
days, well before cows or ewes can start producing milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very easy to get a pig to ejaculate,'' Pothier adds.
``They will mount anything that faintly looks like a sow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pothier and his colleagues have already completed a pilot study
in mice engineered to produce human growth hormone. One male
produced more than 10 micrograms of the protein in each milliliter
of his ejaculate. This is still less than levels found in the milk
of transgenic animals, but Pothier is sure it will be possible to
achieve much higher levels by tinkering with the techniques used to
insert the drug-producing genes. He plans to start testing the
technique in boars next month. &QL;

   Gamma-ray bursts _ incredibly powerful explosions that may be
caused by collisions between collapsed stars _ could solve one of
the oldest riddles about extraterrestrial civilizations: Why
haven't they reached Earth already?
</P>
<P>
   After studying the effects of gamma-ray bursts on life, an
astrophysicist has concluded that aliens may have just started to
explore their galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts for the existence of extraterrestrials have long
been haunted by a simple question supposedly posed by the Nobel
prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi around 1950. Fermi pointed out
that the Galaxy is about 100,000 light years across. So even if a
spacefaring race could explore the Galaxy at only a thousandth of
the speed of light, it would take them just 100 million years to
spread across the entire Galaxy. This is far less than the Galaxy's
age of about 10 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   So if ETs exist in the Milky Way, where are they? Maybe they
don't share the human urge to explore. Or perhaps there's another
reason, says James Annis, an astrophysicist at Fermilab near
Chicago. He thinks cataclysmic gamma-ray bursts often sterilize
galaxies, wiping out life forms before they have evolved
sufficiently to leave their planet (Journal of the British
Interplanetary Society, vol. 52, p. 19).
</P>
<P>
   Gamma-ray bursts are thought to be the most powerful explosions
in the Universe, releasing as much energy as a supernova in
seconds. Many scientists think the bursts occur when the remnants
of dead stars such as neutron stars or black holes collide.
</P>
<P>
   Annis points out that each gamma-ray burst unleashes devastating
amounts of radiation. ``If one went off in the Galactic center, we
here two-thirds of the way out on the Galactic disc would be
exposed over a few seconds to a wave of powerful gamma rays.'' He
believes this would be lethal to life on land.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of gamma-ray bursts is about one burst per galaxy every
few hundred million years. But Annis says theories of gamma-ray
bursts suggest the rate was much higher in the past, with galaxies
suffering one strike every few million years _ far shorter than any
plausible time scale for the emergence of intelligent life capable
of space travel. That, Annis says, may be the answer to Fermi's
question. ``They just haven't had enough time to get here yet,'' he
says. ``The gamma-ray burst model essentially resets the available
time for the rise of intelligent life to zero each time a burst
occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Davies, a visiting physicist at Imperial College in London,
says the basic idea for resolving the paradox makes sense. ``Any
Galaxy-wide sterilizing event would do,'' he says. However, he adds
that gamma-ray bursts may be too brief: ``If the drama is all over
in seconds, you only zap half a planet. The planet's mass shields
the shadowed side.''
</P>
<P>
   Annis counters that gamma-ray bursts are likely to have many
indirect effects, such as wrecking ozone layers that protect
planets from deadly levels of ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Annis also highlights an intriguing implication of the theory:
The current rate of gamma-ray bursts allows intelligent life to
evolve for a few hundred million years before being zapped,
possibly giving it enough time to reach the spacefaring stage. ``It
may be that intelligent life has recently sprouted up at many
places in the Galaxy and that at least a few groups are busily
engaged in spreading.'' &QL;

   A new generation of contraceptives could be on the way now that
researchers have identified a receptor on the surface of eggs that
binds to a sperm surface protein. By targeting such receptors, it
might be possible to trick an egg into believing it has been
fertilized, making it change its outer coat to keep sperm out.
</P>
<P>
   Existing birth control methods, such as barrier contraceptives
and hormones, all have their drawbacks. So researchers have turned
their attention to biochemical interactions between sperm and eggs.
Blocking these interactions could prevent fertilization. So far,
scientists have identified at least three binding proteins on the
sperm.
</P>
<P>
   But identifying the corresponding receptors on the egg has been
difficult, partly because eggs are harder to come by. Now, for the
first time, Nicole Sampson and Hui Chen at the State University of
New York in Stony Brook have found a receptor for a critical sperm
surface protein called fertilin-beta. In mice with a faulty
fertilin-beta gene, sperm rarely fuse with eggs. The team
synthesized the part of the sperm protein thought to bind to the
egg, attached a radioactive tag and then mixed the tagged peptide
with mouse eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The tagged fragment bound only to a receptor called
alpha-6/beta-1 integrin (Chemistry &AMP; Biology, vol. 6, p. 1). ``The
integrins are really an intriguing target,'' Sampson says. Some
evidence from frog eggs hints that an integrin receptor can
activate the egg and prompt it to change its outer coat to prevent
more than one sperm from getting in.
</P>
<P>
   If this happens in humans, the integrin receptor could be a
target for a new contraceptive that deceives the egg. ``It would be
great if you could prematurely activate an egg,'' says Janice Evans
of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore. But so
far, researchers have failed to activate mammalian eggs by
targeting integrins.
</P>
<P>
   Evans adds that sperm probably have several ways of getting into
an egg, so researchers might have to come up with a cocktail of
drugs to block all the different sperm-egg interactions. ``If there
was only one way to get a sperm to an egg, none of us would be
here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schultz of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia agrees that the work opens up new avenues to explore.
But he believes targeting sperm proteins would be a better
approach, because the alpha-6/beta-1 integrin receptor is also
found on cells other than the egg. Drugs that block this receptor
might disrupt other cell interactions and cause side effects. &QL;

HEALTHY ECONOMY CONCEALS JOB LOSSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ E.T. Johnson, a lubricator inspector for the new
Pasadena Paper Co., is feeling the pinch of foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-area company Johnson used to work for, the Simpson
Pasadena Paper Co., shut its doors Wednesday after losing money for
years going up against cheaper foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   The assets were sold to the Belgravia Paper Co. of Canada, which
turned around and rehired 300 of the 660 workers, including
Johnson, to run just one part of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson has a job _ in fact, the same job he used to have
at Simpson _ his salary has been cut almost $2 an hour, going from
$21.31 to $19.35.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   His benefit pension plan was eliminated along with his premium
pay for nighttime work. He lost two weeks of vacation time and
he'll have to pick up a hunk of his health insurance costs after
paying virtually nothing _ benefits that, all together, he figures
are worth another $3 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Johnson figures he won't make up the shortfall during
the six-year contract, which calls for annual wage increases
between 1 and 2 percent. The loss of the traditional pension is the
most troubling to Johnson, who is 48.
</P>
<P>
   That workers should be facing a pay cut after a year in which
average hourly earnings rose 3.8 percent is ironic.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, that means there is more money to jingle in
their pockets, a fact that isn't lost on Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn, people are talking about the good economy,
he said. Low interest rates, low inflation, solid growth. For lots
of people, that has meant job security and solid wage gains.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's story shows that statistics aren't everything,
that even in a good economy, some workers will take a hit.
Statistics that show job growth and wages are up or that
unemployment is down are meaningful only in the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   In the real workaday world, workers like Johnson in vulnerable
industries are going to get hurt _ no matter how good the economy
may be.
</P>
<P>
   He has already lived through four downsizings at the plant so
right now, and in this industry, he knows he's lucky that he has a
job.
</P>
<P>
   For most Houstonians today, Johnson's experience is rare.
Compared with the mid-1980s, relatively few can say they know
someone who's been laid off or had to take a pay cut. But Anthony
Chan, managing director and chief economist for Banc One Investment
Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, says Johnson's story is a sign of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   The low inflationary environment has made it practically
impossible for companies to increase prices, especially when they
go up against lower-priced imports pouring in from economically
depressed Asia. So while consumer prices increased 1.6 percent last
year, the tight labor market forced companies to boost average
hourly wages by 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That gap has squeezed profits, Chan said, and companies almost
have no choice but to cut wages or workers.
</P>
<P>
   Look for more signs of wage cuts in a wide variety of
industries, Chan predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners of the paper plant bristle at the idea that
workers are not faring well under the new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of the plant's profits will go toward increasing
employee wages by 10 percent, said John Cowan, vice president of
Belgravia.
</P>
<P>
   After that, 10 percent of the profits will be distributed to
employees. The company operates a coated paper machine that
supplies between 40 and 50 percent of the paper used for making
labels in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not unreasonable to ask employees to pay 20 percent of
their health insurance coverage, Cowan said. And he touts the
401(k) plan as offering more flexibility in planning for retirement
than the traditional annuity plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to compete, we had to restructure the business here,''
Cowan said. ``We're pleased to work out a business plan that saves
300 jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic realities, it's hard to give wages and
benefits back when all you hear is that car sales are soaring, home
sales are at record highs and consumers are spending freely because
they feel confident.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Bray doesn't feel that same confidence. He got a job with
the new plant and, like Johnson, will be earning $2 less an hour as
a lubricator inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Bray said that he and his wife will cut corners where they can:
fewer restaurant meals, fewer weekend jaunts and less money to
spend on Bray's beloved coin and stamp collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of progressing, I'm regressing,'' said the 52-year-old
Bray. ``But what can we do?''

MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT `HEART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some bits and pieces of ``Playing by Heart'' are delightful.
Some bits and pieces are not.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, here are a few of the delightful bits:
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Gena Rowlands dance with Sean Connery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hearing Dennis Quaid, telling a stranger about his failed job
as an ABC exec (``I'm responsible for all those (bleep) shows that
you don't watch on Thursday nights''), complain that his wife left
him for a guy at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Angelina Jolie buzz, beelike, in pursuit of Ryan
Phillippe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching an entire magazine rack fall on Gillian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Next, just to balance things out, here are a few of the
less-delightful bits:
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Ryan Phillippe mope.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Anthony Edwards mope.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Gillian Anderson mope (pre- and post-magazine rack).
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Jon Stewart pine for Gillian Anderson, mopes and all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watching Jay Mohr die in the arms of Ellen Burstyn.
</P>
<P>
   If you gather from these collected bits that ``Playing by
Heart'' is a hit-or-miss ensemble piece about love and emotional
fragility, you gather correctly. If you gather that Gillian
Anderson is the most irritating thing in the film, you also gather
correctly. (``Call me nuts, but I really like you,'' Stewart's
character tells her. OK, fella. You're nuts.)
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you gather that writer-producer-director Willard
Carroll (``Tom's Midnight Garden'') has a cynical view of the
mating game, you are mistaken. Carroll is above all an optimist,
and where ``Playing by Heart'' shines _ where it rises above
misfired casting and awkward navelgazing _ is in its simplest
moments, in little touches of vulnerability and affection that dot
the landscape of all relationships.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a moral to the story, it's that everybody has a tale
to tell: By the film's close, each character in this romantic
roundelay is given a chance to spill the beans, to face up to (or
face down) some past, festering wound. Honesty breeds hope. Hope
breeds love. And love, as we all know, breeds happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Riding this swirl of emotion are four couples: Paul and Hannah
(Connery and Rowlands), a comfy older pair whose marriage sports a
few new cracks; Meredith and Trent (Anderson and Stewart), a newly
dating duo who suffer from an advanced case of egg-head
self-analysis (they argue about a relationship they don't even have
yet); Gracie and Roger (Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards), an
adulterous pair who keep each other at a cool emotional distance;
and Joan and Keenan (Jolie and Phillippe), not-quite friends in a
maybe-relationship built on desperate bickering about Keenan's
reluctance to date.
</P>
<P>
   Also getting screen time are Hugh (Quaid, breathtakingly
malleable), a loner who snakes through one bar after another with a
wildly mutating story, and two additional characters thrown in to
squeeze tears: Mark (Mohr), who's dying of AIDS-related illnesses,
and his loving mom, Mildred (Burstyn).
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart'' has a good deal to recommend it, most of
all a script that's jammed with crisp, asymmetrical dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   (Paul to Hannah: ``Calm down! You're overwrought!'' Hannah to
Paul: ``I am perfectly wrought! I think, under the circumstances, I
am underwrought!'')
</P>
<P>
   Connery and Rowlands deliver their lines with a delicious,
sophisticated wisdom, while Jolie does her perpetual-motion routine
with loopy-innocent zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to see her _ but he doesn't want her to be
dismembered in underground parking,'' she says, as the sullen
Keenan walks her through a shadowed lot.
</P>
<P>
   It's cute; they're cute; the movie's cute. The parts that aren't
struggle from lousy chemistry (the Stewart-Anderson pairing) or
bare-bones plotting (the Stowe-Edwards pairing), an unsurprising
flaw in a movie loaded with primary and secondary characters.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to hand it to Carroll: He's made a sweet film about
the tartness of courtship, and he's made it with an absolute lack
of irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't no disco, and I don't want no `Cryin' Game'
confusion,'' says a drag queen to the chameleon Hugh. It isn't. And
there won't be. And for the time being, with one small film, that's
just fine.

RETIRED COP REMAINS CAPTIVATED BY NORMAN ROCKWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Massachusetts, Vermont)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ Retired policeman Dick Clemens is not
boastful about his likeness that was captured by a renowned artist
for future generations to admire.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, depicted in his police uniform in a classic 1958
Saturday Evening Post cover by artist Norman Rockwell called ``The
Runaway,'' doesn't think of it as conferring any kind of
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the important one, not me,'' said Clemens, who is so
modest he declined to have his picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   But his image as a young man has become an American icon. He is
the Massachusetts state trooper shown on a counter stool buying an
ice cream for a grateful and somewhat chagrined young boy.
</P>
<P>
   The illustration has become a symbol of the kinder and gentler
side of police work and an era when law enforcers were widely
respected. Little wonder it can be found hanging in police stations
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Police Supt. James W. McMahon said the
illustration was a tribute to both police work and Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman Rockwell captures the real essence of police work and
public service _ community, concern, compassion and a commitment to
helping others,'' McMahon said. ``Knowing Dick Clemens personally,
I feel Rockwell could not have found anyone more committed to those
values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably among Rockwell's better known works,'' said Bea
Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Norman Rockwell Museum at
Stockbridge, the Massachusetts institute where the original is on
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably all of us at one time in our wild youth had the
fantasy of running away because their mother didn't give them a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich or something. This plays into that
idea plus the other of the policeman as the friendly figure who is
going to befriend and help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Rockwell never hired professional models. Instead he
used friends and neighbors. He once had his studio on Main Street
in Stockbridge, but he became so distracted looking out the window
for potential models that he had to move it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was tabbed to be that figure largely because he was
Rockwell's neighbor in Stockbridge. The artist lived in the village
the last 25 years of his life, and as he had done previously in
Arlington, Vt., painted likenesses of those he encountered in his
daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived about three houses apart from him and his dog would
periodically run over and visit my house, and I would return it,''
said Clemens, who gives his age only as ``over 60.'' He said
Rockwell telephoned him one day and said he had an idea for a Post
cover involving a police officer and asked if he would pose for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased he would ask. He was a very nice man,''
Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   He got permission from his bosses and in the spring of 1958 sat
with two other people behind the counter of a Howard Johnson's
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell took photographs and oversaw the arrangement of several
poses, the whole session lasting ``a couple of hours,'' Clemens
said.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic process, including sketches, went all the way to
the color study, the last step before painting, when Rockwell
decided to change it, according to Snyder. He changed the young
counterman to an older figure, and changed the Howard Johnson's
into more of a country diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chatted a little bit about it,'' Clemens said. ``He said he
wanted it a little more rustic so you would have the impression the
kid got a little further out of town. And he changed the counterman
because he wanted more of an age contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he marvels at the craftsmanship in this
illustration as in Rockwell's others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the ability to portray the small details _ the laces on
my boots, the notebook in my back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said his superiors called to thank Rockwell for choosing
the subject, and the artist responded by inviting Clemens and his
boss to dinner. And at the request of the Massachusetts State
Police, he painted Clemens in a winter uniform so the department
could use it for its Christmas cards. A copy of that work is at the
Rockwell Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens retired from the state police around 1975, then he went
to work for the General Electric Co.'s plant in Pittsfield, Mass.
In 1984 he became head of plant security at GE's Power Systems
plant in Schenectady, N.Y., and moved to nearby Clifton Park.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally lectures at the Rockwell Museum about his
encounters with the artist.
</P>
<P>
   But he guards his privacy when it comes to detailing much of his
personal feelings. He said the reactions of his two married
daughters and three grandchildren are ``personal to me.'' Clemens
has a copy of the illustration in his house. But he said it is not
even his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those I like best is `Freedom From Want' where
everybody is sitting around having dinner and mother is bringing in
a turkey and putting it down. If you look closely,'' he said in a
tone of awe, ``everybody sitting at the table has a glass in front
of them. And every glass has water and in the water, there's ice.
That's the kind of detail he could paint.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows ``The Runaway'' is a favorite of police officers
and that gives him a special joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of that. There are a lot of dedicated people in law
enforcement. They do a very difficult job under very difficult
circumstances. And I hope that this helps build respect for them.''

THE CLUB MAY BE THE ANSWER TO SEX IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impeachment trial of President Clinton is of even greater
historical significance than that of O. J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   While the charges are grave _ perjury and obstruction of justice
_ it all began with inappropriate sexual conduct. Despite his track
record, inappropriate presidential sexual behavior was not invented
by Bill Clinton. Let us look at the record.
</P>
<P>
   While history books make rare mention, George Washington, the
Father of our Country, is said by some historians to have been very
much the amorous ladies man. Recently, new evidence strengthens the
case that Thomas Jefferson, a widower, fathered the illegitimate
children of Sally Heming, a mulatto slave. While DNA results are
not yet conclusive, it appears that something was up.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1884 presidential election, Democrat Grover Cleveland, an
absolute straight arrow in his public life, admitted to having
fathered an illegitimate child with a widow, Maria Crofts Halpin.
His Republican opponents coined the campaign slogan, ``Hey, ma,
where's my pa?'' an allusion to his paternity.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the election, the Democrats taunted, ``Gone to the
White House, ha, ha!''
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson had an extra-curricular liaison with a woman he
met while vacationing in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   And next comes the pre-JFK president credited with having the
lustiest libido, Warren Harding. He fathered an illegitimate child
with his No. 1 mistress of many years, Nan Britton. Their long and
torrid affair continued into Harding's White House years.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', author-historian
Francis Russell tells how Harding's trusted secret service agents
Walter Ferguson and James Sloan arranged assignations at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Mrs. Harding, usually referred to as the
Duchess and often described as a battle-ax, returned early,
suspecting that something was up. She stormed the cloak room next
to the Oval Office where the president and Britton were
passionately interfacing.
</P>
<P>
   The day was saved by agent Ferguson who blocked the door,
claiming that entry would violate Secret Service regulations and
jeopardize national security.
</P>
<P>
   FDR had affairs, the most notable of which was with Lucy Mercer
and extended over more than 20 years. Ms. Mercer was with the
president at his death in Warm Springs, Ga., on April 12, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   LBJ had a 21-year afair, (1948-69) with a Dallas woman, Madeline
Brown who produced a son Steven; plus countless transitory
encounters including, (so he boasted), interacting with a secretary
at his desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Long after his death, Lady Bird Johnson told a TV producer:
``You have to understand, my husband loved people; and half the
world are women. You don't think you could keep my husband away
from half the people?''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the impeachment and the trial in the Senate are a major
distraction from the important affairs of state. And clearly, all
this started with inappropriate sexual behavior. What, then, do we
do to end inappropriate sexual conduct among our politicos in
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   I submit that the solution lies in the development of an
electronic, miniaturized version of the Club which would be
attached to the zippers of all of our elected representatives. Each
Club would be controlled by an encryption device and the only
person with the code to unlock the Club would be the wife or
significant other, (either/or, not both), of the politico.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments all across America tell us that the Club is a
nearly foolproof way to prevent auto theft so why not transfer this
technology to zippers?
</P>
<P>
   I submit that the obvious choice to develop this zipper control
device is Bill Gates and his Microsoft team because Microsoft has
proven its ability to bring out new operating systems in short
development cycles and the very name Microsoft implies that it is
the right company.
</P>
<P>
   I also argue that if the Senate trial results in a plea bargain,
then President Clinton must agree to grant an unconditional pardon
enabling the immediate release of all people serving prison
sentences for perjury.

GEOLOGIST FINDS EVIDENCE OF EL NINO IN ANTIQUITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ El Nino appears to have been an active
climate force since the time human beings developed writing, a
geologist theorizes in an article published Friday in the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by a team of researchers add to a growing body of
knowledge about the still mysterious El Nino, which has affected
weather systems from South America to the U.S. Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could add to research into how El Nino may have
influenced civilization, and what it could mean for the future of a
warming planet.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an ancient Sumerian weather story that led Union
College assistant professor Donald Rodbell to the discovery, but a
30-foot-long sample of mud taken in 1993 from Lake Pallcococha high
in the Andes of Ecuador. The sample, originally drawn by Rodbell
and colleague Geoffrey Seltzer of Syracuse University to study
climate change associated with the last ice age, provided a natural
archive of climactic information spanning 15,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The core, after some initial study, sat in a refrigerator for
three years until researchers began taking another look at it,
particularly its unusual ``zebra stripes'' of light-colored layers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly what we had,'' Rodbell said. ``In the
back of my mind, I wondered if these patterns were somehow
connected to El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
</P>
<P>
   While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists
until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and
anecdotal records to study, including when it began. The core gives
what scientists say is the longest continuous record of El Nino
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Every two to eight years, El Nino manifests itself in warm ocean
currents off the western coast of South America, affecting,
depending on its strength, weather systems throughout the Western
Hemisphere. Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and
southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as
the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The bands of light and dark sediment in the sample, scientists
say, document El Nino's active and quiet years. The light layers
reflect non-El Nino years, marked by relatively weak rainfalls,
while the dark, organically rich layers were caused by heavy
downpours that washed more vegetation from upland areas into the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis with medical imaging technology found that El Nino
appeared every two to eight years, the same frequency as today.
</P>
<P>
   The research team found that El Nino was weak to non-existent
around the lake between 5,000 and 12,000 years ago, but as an
accompanying article in Science notes, other new records from
western Pacific corals and sediment from the Great Lakes show El
Nino was in action 12,000 to 120,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that unlocking El Nino's secrets means more to
humanity than knowing when to invest in umbrella stock. The
torrential rains, according to at least one theory by archaeologist
Daniel Sandweiss of the University of Maine, may have sparked
temple construction and more complex civilizations, right after an
El Nino lull that occurred from 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. While
that theory had been challenged, the find appears to support at
least his claim that the lull occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further
pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   IN December, scientists from the Woods Hole Research Laboratory
in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that during El Nino
years that bring hot, dry weather to the Amazon, Brazil's rain
forest sends out more carbon dioxide gas, trapping heat in the
atmosphere. How that might play out in a world where human activity
is adding to the so-called greenhouse effect remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell, whose coauthors include scientists from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of
Massachusetts, and the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological
Laboratory, cautioned that the results are only of one lake sample.
He was recently awarded a two-year, $90,000 National Science
Foundation grant to investigate other lakes in southern Ecuador.

IT'S TIME FOR SENATE TO BRING IMPEACHMENT NONSENSE TO AN END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere over the Capitol in Washington, I hear the voice of
former Cowboys quarterback and sports commentator Don Meredith
singing the refrain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn out the lights, the party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   This torch the House Republicans have been carrying for
impeaching the president, and having him removed from office, is
about to go out.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, we'll see Republicans in the Senate
folding faster than bad poker hands and looking for a way out of
the dilemma in which they now find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The president should never have been impeached in the first
place, but the majority party was hellbent on ramming this
constitutional charade down our throats in the name of ``the rule
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   For months I've been waiting for the Republicans to come to
their senses, but their blind obsession keeps them from seeing that
they are no match for this popular president. Every time they go
after William Jefferson Clinton with a vengeance, they end up
hurting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted on a trial so they once again could recount the
sordid details in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report,
refusing to accept the fact that the public was tired of the
scandal and was ready to see it end. The prosecutors from the House
even demanded witnesses in order to make their weak case more
dramatic because there was no real substance.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the president's defenders had made it just
halfway through their case this week, it was obvious that the House
managers were just that _ ``managers,'' attempting to manipulate a
conviction based on misleading ``facts'' and the most sinister
accounts of ``the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the law, White House lawyer Cheryl D. Mills poignantly
told the attentive senators:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its
applications. You cannot only love it when it provides the verdict
you seek; you must love it when the verdict goes against you, as
well. We cannot uphold the rule of law only when it is consistent
with our beliefs; we must uphold it even when it protects behavior
that we don't like or is unattractive, or is not admirable, or that
might even be hurtful. And we cannot say we love the rule of law
but dismiss arguments that appeal to the rule of law, as
`legalisms' or legal hair-splitting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While House managers fought for microphones afterward to offer
some lame rebuttals, it was clear that many Republicans were
looking for a back door out of this last embarrassment for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some were still predicting that we'd see witnesses,
and that ``the trial of the century'' would perhaps continue until
early February, there were signs that Democrats would get the votes
to bring down the curtain on this farce _ sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Even conservative evangelist Pat Robertson on ``The 700 Club,''
his TV program was singing the song from the Meredith hymnal:
``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the president had hit a home run in his State of the
Union speech Tuesday night, Robertson added: ``From a public
relations standpoint, he's won. They might as well dismiss this
impeachment hearing and get on with something else, because it's
over as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Come Monday, expect a motion to dismiss. Then expect that
Republicans with the least to lose politically (and this doesn't
include Texans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison) to join Senate
Democrats in bringing an early end to this national distraction.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time.

NFL'S PROMISES OF REVENUE DON'T ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, the steamrollers of the National Football League
flattened the city of Tampa. The local team, the Buccaneers, wanted
the public to pay for half of a new stadium. At the proper moment,
just when the local newspapers were filled with panic about the
team moving to Baltimore, Cleveland, Orlando or another city
desperate for a team, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said if Tampa
shared the costs, the league would give it a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL made Tampa feel it would be showered with dollar bills.
The league claimed that the 1995 Super Bowl in Miami generated
$364.9 million in economic activity for South Florida. Buccaneers
GM Rich McKay said, ``Nobody can argue with the direct impact of
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The steamrollers left little argument in their wake. The Tampa
Tribune accepted the NFL's claims to the point of boo-hooing in an
editorial, ``If the Bucs leave, there will never be another Super
Bowl here, with its $350 million boost to the local economy. If the
Bucs leave, we will never again have an NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   The public passed a sales tax to help build the stadium. The
Buccaneers stayed. There will be a Super Bowl in Tampa in 2001. But
one man in Tampa remained curious about the claim that the Super
Bowl was worth a third of a trillion dollars, and the media's
assumption that this was irreplaceable money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL's argument did not make any sense if you start to
think about it,'' said Philip Porter, an economics professor at the
University of South Florida at Tampa. ``After all, this is the same
NFL that charges $5 for a hotdog. If there was truly $350 million
in economic impact, do you really think the NFL, the same league
that gets cities to pay for stadiums _ when no other businesses
could dream of having cities build factories for them _ would
really leave that money lying around for you and me?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. If there was truly economic impact, the NFL would have
grabbed the dollars before they even hit the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter went through 25 years of economic data. He zeroed in on
three Super Bowls in Miami, two in Tampa, and another in Phoenix.
In each case he found that the city's taxable sales or gross sales
in a Super Bowl January were no different than sales from any other
January. There was nothing to suggest that the economic impact of
the Super Bowl was an extra $364.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence showed that the impact was zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Super Bowl does is chase away people who would have
otherwise come for vacations or conventions,'' Porter said. ``Maybe
the Super Bowl brings three days of high-profile, big spenders. But
with no Super Bowl, you would have had people who would have come
to Florida or Arizona for two or three weeks for vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's study adds to the mounting evidence that publicly
funded stadiums are cash registers for owners and players, but red
tape for taxpayers. Besides tax and sales receipts, Porter found
several other barometers that deflate the NFL's claims of special
economic benefits to Super Bowl host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Porter found no evidence of an increase in tourism. There were
no extra airline flights during the Super Bowl month. Restaurants
reported no major surge in restaurant activity and golf resorts did
not hire extra staff that one would assume would be needed to
handle a sudden flood of wealthy executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that kind of impact was true, it would show up as a huge
spike on a graph,'' he said. In an upcoming study that echoes
studies by other economists, Porter has found no change in jobs,
unemployment or income when a city gains or loses an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going on is the NFL asks the people who come in for a
Super Bowl, `Tell me, what did you spend?' '' Porter said. ``You
get 140,000 people saying they spent $2,500 apiece. The NFL
concludes from that that the Super Bowl provides $350 million in
economic impact. They never look at the impact of the other 140,000
who would have been here anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies, of course, have not stopped greedy owners and
supplicant politicians from trying to convince the public that the
NFL is Santa Claus. The NFL claims that last January's Super Bowl
meant $295 million for greater San Diego. South Florida convention
officials say that the Super Bowl on Jan. 31 will pump $380 million
into Miami's local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have not stopped states like Connecticut from throwing a
$374 million, publicly funded stadium at the New England Patriots.
Porter said studies will matter only when the politicians stop
being seduced. ``I don't fault the NFL,'' Porter said. ``They're
just trying to make money. It's the politicians. Right now, it
seems that if you're just a city councilor in a room with these
powerful owners, there is no resisting them, even if they are being
told self-serving lies.''

`RAGTIME' WORTH THE WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RAGTIME 
Musical in two acts. Music by Stephen Flaherty. Lyrics by Lynn
Ahrens. Book by Terrence McNally. Based on the novel by E.L.
Doctorow. 
Directed by Frank Galati. Choreography, Graciela Daniele. Set,
Eugene Lee. Costumes, Santo Loquasto. Lighting, Jules Fisher and
Peggy Eisenhauer. Presented by Pace Theatrical Group and Broadway
in Boston by arrangement with Livent. 
At: The Colonial Theatre, through March 28. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Ragtime'' may go down as the musical worth going to
jail for. With Livent, the company that brought it into being, in
bankruptcy and Garth Drabinsky, Livent's cofounder, under
indictment, we should simply be thankful that this magnificent
musical got to Boston at all and that Jon Platt and the Pace
Theatrical Group had the wherewithal to get it to the Colonial
Theatre, where it fits both snugly and majestically.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the musical worth waiting for, one that plugs into
what made the form worth getting excited about in the first place _
glorious melodies you hum for days afterward and characters whose
fates seem as important as those of your family and friends. Add a
healthy respect for the audience's intelligence and you have every
reason to think that ``Ragtime'' has restored the greatness of the
American musical.
</P>
<P>
   E. L. Doctorow's 1974 novel that the musical was based on is one
of the singular achievements in American letters since the end of
World War II. With its clear but distanced prose and fascinating
blend of historical and fictional characters, ``Ragtime'' tells the
story of the American century, from the waves of European
immigration through the legacies of slavery to the celebrity
culture that so envelops us today. Central to the story are the
intersecting lives of three sets of characters: the white
Anglo-Saxon family that has all the benefits of class and power;
the Jewish immigrant Tateh and his daughter; and ragtime artist
Coalhouse Walker and Sarah, his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Does the musical do Doctorow justice? Although nuanced
development is now spelled out and what was written with subtlety
is now sung in capital letters, this is still very much Doctorow's
story, both in terms of plot and themes. Perhaps it's the change in
tone that brought forth a minority of naysayers, particularly when
``Ragtime'' was done on larger stages, but this, after all, is
music. One doesn't go to Verdi to find Shakespeare's poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky fielded an all-star team, most of it from off-Broadway
rather than on. He also held a song-writing competition that was
won by the little-known team of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens
(``Once On This Island'') and the duo paid dividends. This is a
soundtrack not only loaded with hummable tunes, but the songs twist
and turn into and out of each other thematically with overwhelming
swirls.
</P>
<P>
   The best in this superb bunch is ``New Music,'' which starts out
as a lament by Father, the head of the WASP family. To him, ragtime
represents a loss of understanding about what's happening in
America. His wife picks up the tune, and to her it represents
liberation from stultification. The chorus joins in and croons
appreciatively until the black couple turn it into a passionate
love song that transforms everyone onstage. If you were doing a
medley of great scenes from the history of musicals, this quartet
with chorus would have to be in there.
</P>
<P>
   The music in ``Ragtime'' can be almost too overwhelming. No
sooner have we caught our breath from ``New Music'' than Coalhouse
and Sarah are off on another anthem, ``Wheels of a Dream,'' in
which the couple's optimism in America is boundless. Anyone
familiar with the novel knows what happens to that optimism. What
Doctorow and the musical do so well is dramatize the struggle for
assimilation and identity. Tateh, the Jewish immigrant, has his own
battle in keeping his daughter from starving or freezing, but is
ultimately allowed his corner of success. Walker, as much as he
would love to assimilate, has the door closed on him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the onstage talent in New York were three of the brightest
young musical stars of the American stage _ Audra McDonald, Brian
Stokes Mitchell, and Marin Mazzie. This production doesn't have
that firepower, but it's nevertheless a fine ensemble that belts
these songs out beautifully. Rebecca Eichenberger as Mother and
Theresa Tova as Emma Goldman are particularly impressive. In one
very important regard, ``Ragtime'' is better in Boston than in New
York. The musical fits the Colonial whereas it tended to get
dwarfed by Ford Theatre. Graciela Daniele's choreography is the
chief beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the measure, though, this production of ``Ragtime''
delivers the goods. A great American novel has become a great
American musical. As Tateh says, ``I like this music. It makes me
want to do cartwheels.''

<P>
   And the Heinz Index is flashing a bright green GO!
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking green as in the color of her money, though
there's no shortage of that either, which could come in handy. No,
the political types have been missing the signals, which have
playing out right under their noses.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when we vote for couples, not just presidents, Heinz
can more than hold up her end of the ticket. She is a serious woman
with serious credentials, and she's adding to them like a candidate
in waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Christmas she was on the Globe's editorial opinion
page, urging employers to give ``the gift of security'' by opening
a retirement account for their employees. ``We are a nation without
a retirement policy,'' she wrote. ``The result: Poverty is turning
many people's golden years into a nightmare of hardship and dashed
expectations.'' Two weeks before the prospective First Couple
virtually owned the Sunday Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The lead story in the paper that day _ a Globe exclusive _
reported how the high cost of living in Massachusetts was driving
away young people and causing a shortage of workers that could
jeopardize the state's economy. The report, funded by the $1.6
billion Heinz Family Foundation and initiated by Heinz herself, was
accompanied that morning by the lead editorial fretting about a
``brain drain'' of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind the Bay State; we have become the Pay State,'' the
editorial worried.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty impressive one-two orchestration, but the Heinz-Kerrys
did even better that day: On the page just opposite the Heinz
editorial was an opinion piece by Senator Kerry, scolding those who
would deny the dangers of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine what it must have been like that Sunday morning
in the antique four-poster bed on Louisburg Squarewith the Globe
spread out all over the goose-down comforter? Bill and Hill must
have had those kind of days back in Little Rock as they plotted
their way to the White House, many years and many Monicas ago.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz's interest in important topics is hardly new. Her causes
have run from the environment to nuclear disarmament to the arts.
The foundations and endowments she oversees give away $70 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she weighed running for the Senate after the death of
her husband, Republican John Heinz. The only thing new in
speculation about Heinz's interest in the White House is that this
time she and her husband would be running as Democrats.``Does she
picture herself as an effective Hillary? Sure,'' says one of those
who has worked closely with Heinz recently.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I may have it all wrong. Heinz may not be prepping
for a presidential run at all. Considering her recent focus on
things like housing affordability and the retirement system, she
may be angling for her own column on the business page. But, I
don't think so.

   Jim Hirsch is a guy who can take a punch. The Boston-based Wall
Street Journal writer who lost his job in a reporting goof during
the Mike Barnicle affair this summer has a new project: He's
writing an authorized biography of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the
middleweight who went to jail for 19 years for a triple murder he
didn't commit. In all, four publishers bid for the book, which was
sold to Boston's Houghton Mifflin. Hirsch's timing couldn't be
better: His book should be out about the same time a new Denzel
Washington film on Carter is arriving at a theater near you. That
should help sales.

KORDA FINDS LITTLE AMUSEMENT IN CARNIVAL ATMOSPHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ The Carrot Sticks, waddling and wailing in their
Netherlands-orange war paint and sheaths, are in town. So are the
costumed Vikings (Swedish, not Minnesotan), as well as the Mary
Pierce and Anna Kournikova impersonators: blonde-wigged guys in
tennis dresses identical to those worn by their heroines.
</P>
<P>
   Screamers and dancers all, boisterous backers of their
racket-flapping gods and goddesses, they are among the flavors of
fun that make the Australian Open the best take of the four majors.
Stacked up against this carnival, the French, Wimbledon, and US
Open are prayer meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda's prayer a year ago was to win a major championship
before his sometimes-brilliant career ran out. He was 30, had been
a French finalist six years before, and needed help _ which he got
from Karol Kucera, eliminator of Pete Sampras, and Marcelo Rios,
swooner in the 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I always dreamed of, winning one of the big
titles,'' said Korda. ``I was afraid I might be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, then, that his Melbourne reappearance as reigning
king, ranked world No. 21, would be hailed as a glorious return.
Instead it's a nightmare. He's been enveloped in a hailstorm of
disapproval from his colleagues on the men's tour, virtually all of
them feeling that Korda shouldn't be here at all. They think he
should be serving a year's suspension after testing positive for a
steroid called nandrolone at Wimbledon six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He got off lightly. Convincing investigators that he honestly
didn't know how the stuff _ which usually must be injected _ wound
up in his skinny body, Korda lost only the prize money and computer
points earned at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier, the champ of 1992-93 and highly respected in the
locker room, is one of the objectors to Korda's understandably
nervous presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Petr a friend, the last guy I'd suspect,'' said
Courier. ``But until he can come up with a believable explanation _
which he hasn't _ I think he should be out, the rules followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then warming to the subject, Courier raised the specter of blood
doping and drugs like EPO of bicycle-racing infamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys playing 35 tournaments, and I know I couldn't
do it _ and I train very hard,'' he said. ``They may be getting
some help, and I'd be very PO'd if they had an illegal advantage
and beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Denials from officialdom flew, and it is a fact that tennis has
suffered few drug embarrassments. A Spanish nonentity, Ignacio
Truyol, was ruled off for a year after flunking the test. Why not
Korda?
</P>
<P>
   One of his few defenders, No. 6 Andre Agassi, the current
betting favorite (6-1) to win this increasingly toothless,
seed-bleeding men's tourney, astutely points out that most of his
colleagues aren't up to date on the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a change,'' said Agassi. ``You aren't thrown out
automatically as Truyol was. You can appeal, and Korda is
appealing. Maybe he's guilty, but he deserves the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the limbo of an unappealing situation, Korda also suffered a
dissing by his first-round victim, Spaniard Galo Blanco, who
avoided shaking hands at the fifth-set conclusion. Blanco accused
Korda of another kind of ``cheating'' _ faking an injury. If so, it
was a rather elaborate fake. Falling hard in the third set, Korda
twisted his left ankle, requiring strapping by a trainer during a
subsequent injury timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran like a deer after that,'' said Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at my ankle _ black and yellow,'' said Korda.
</P>
<P>
   It still was after he beat another Spaniard, Julian Alonso,
Thursday to set up a date with American Todd Martin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A more subtle form of disrespect for Korda has been displayed by
the tournament organizers, denying the champion a main-stadium gig
thus far, keeping him on the outskirts where a few spectators have
taunted him.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching to his full, bristle-haired 6 feet 3 inches, the
embroiled Czech said, ``My father taught me to keep my head up
highest when things are worst. I must face reality, and be glad to
put two wins together. It's been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Loser of 13 of 14 matches in one post-Wimbledon stretch, and his
position in the top 10, Korda seemed distressed most to learn that
his Davis Cup teammates _ Daniel Vacek, Slava Dosedel, Bohdan
Ulihrach _ said he had disgraced Czech tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Although the male precinct began to come apart even before the
first ball was swatted, that wasn't going to keep record daily
crowds of 40,000-plus away from the good-old-summertime, party-time
atmosphere of Melbourne Park. Pete Sampras, trying to manage a
midlife crisis, was a no-show. Marcelo Rios and Goran Ivaniseveic
pleaded aching backs at the starting gate and the dreaded Spanish
armada of 14 gunboats (Nos. 3-5-14 Alex Corretja, Carlos Moya,
Albert Costa included) sprang early leaks and were on the bottom by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Then a rookie qualifier from Rockville, Md., No. 187 Paul
Goldstein, toppled 1997 US Open runner-up, No. 8 Greg Rusedski,
6-4, 6-7 (9-11), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The price is right for the hordes. So are their countryman, the
revivalist Aussies led by US Open champ, No. 3 Patrick Rafter, and
finalist, No. 14 Mark Philippoussis, whose rousing,
3-hour-45-minute win over a rejuvenated Michael Chang was the best
match here in years. Not to mention the exciting Lleyton Hewitt, a
17-year-old who demolished No. 15 Cedric Pioline.

REPUBLICANS DON'T KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know they've had record snowload in Buffalo, but how can 6,000
Buffalonians just disappear?
</P>
<P>
   There were ``more than 21,000'' folks cheering the Clintons and
the Gores there the day after the State of the Union speech, said
The Boston Globe. Naw, there were only ``about 15,000,'' said The
New York Times, which still called it ``a rock star reception.''
But who's counting crowds or poll numbers? The only number that
really counts for Clinton is 67 in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His big speech (98 applause interruptions for 67-odd new policy
announcements in a chamber boycotted by a dozen of his bitterest
Republican enemies) rang up big at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerin' Henry Hyde had to be throwing up on his recliner at
home. Representative Dick Armey looked as if he'd just scarfed down
a platter of bad clams. Rookie Speaker Dennis Hastert didn't know
whether to sit or go blind and ignore the Prez when Clinton
surprised him with a let's-bury-the-hatchet handshake before
unloading his boffo speech.
</P>
<P>
   From the chaplain of the far right came the first flutter of the
white flag. Pat Robertson tells his electronic flock that Clinton's
speech capped the impeachment volcano. Clinton ``hit a home run. .
. . From a public relations standpoint, he's won,'' said the 700
Club mogul. ``They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing
and get on with something else, because it's over as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat's brow is now furrowed deeper over Armageddon than Articles
of Impeachment. He told his network's audience that God is so angry
with the United States he might move up his timetable for punishing
the planet's sinners, maybe sometime right after 2000, unless 700
Clubbers pray hard and keep that toll-free number humming. My hunch
is that Pat is right on Clinton, wrong on the Almighty's schedule.
But, hey, it's a free country.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the regret of The Wall Street Journal, from whose
conning tower came a loud editorial moan. You can always tell how
well Clinton is doing by how viperish gets the Journal. Get the ice
buckets and hose down the editorial pen, fellas: ``It was the most
shameless State of the Union speech any president has ever
delivered,'' sputtered our overwrought brethren at the paper that
sells itself as ``the daily diary of the American dream.''
Clinton's survival is a nightmare for the Journal; Clinton boasts
the longest economic boom ever.
</P>
<P>
   The paper that has packaged the Clinton conspiracy through a
dozen different incarnations (Whitewater _ remember Whitewater? _
Who killed Vince Foster? Travelgate, Filegate, and Whatevergate)
has made cynicism a synonym for Wall Street Journalism. ``An act of
utter political cynicism,'' seethed the Journal's submariners as
the depth charges drive their vessel of indignation lower into the
murk. ``It could all backfire,'' gasps the editorial. Fat chance,
boys. As they say on Wall Street, let's look at the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   Job approval percentages? 76 in NBC's survey, 72 at CBS, 66 at
ABC, the highest since Bush's Gulf War halo effect. Many Americans
wouldn't trust Clinton with their wives or daughters, but 81
percent trust him on the economy. When ABC asked who would do a
better job handling America's major problems, it's Clinton 50
percent, Republicans 32. Case closed, boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   From North Dakota's Governor Ed Schafer came this glum tribute:
Clinton is a ``great deliverer.'' But who will deliver the Sun Belt
Republicans from their suicidal impeachment course? How do they get
off Trent Lott's runaway train? The Republicans have collectively
grabbed the third rail _ and can't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Clinton Web sites like Moveon.com testify to the groundswell
building against the GOP lynch mob. Everyone who ever bet their
hopes on Monica has been disappointed: Clinton, Starr, Hyde, now
Lott and the Republican Party. And the TV news mob.
</P>
<P>
   One TV network exec who's tossing in the Monica crying towel is
CBS news president Andrew Heyward. ``Monica fatigue'' is his term
for news shows overdosing on this cheesy scandal. ``We've covered
it so much it has turned off the public in droves,'' he sighs.
That's a lesson Republicans ignore at their peril as they weigh
calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's numbers appear bulletproof as long as the economy
keeps roaring. A huge political backlash seems to be building in
the countryside that is invisible to Lott and the D.C. lynch mob.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Republican water-carriers like William Safire have been
through GOP capsizings before. Brother Safire's postspeech column
retreated to the relative safety of linguistic esoterica. Brother
Bill, like any prudent passenger on the runaway GOP train, moves
away from the locomotive as it draws near the derailment.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Clinton's triumphant speech, I spoke to a group
of mostly retired folk, generally furious at the Republican scheme
to impeach Clinton. Clinton has this giant club in the closet he
hasn't used yet, I said: Social Security. And any time he reaches
for that weapon, he'll get the AARP crowd off their recliners and
ready to burn down the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   That night Clinton took the club out. And with the slim and
imperiled Republican majorities sitting sullenly in front of him,
he beat their roof in. All that's left is for the GOP to collect
their wounded and retreat.

REVEREND IKE AND HIS EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As buildings go, this one is extraordinary only for its
dreariness _ its brown and beige facade blending into Commonwealth
Avenue like yet another office filled with lawyers or chiropractors
on another monotonous strip of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But 910 Commonwealth Ave. holds a secret _ a devilish secret
involving big money, religion, and deceit. It's a secret about the
Rev. Ike, the formerly famous preacher whose singular claim to fame
is his unflappable ability to make himself rich at the expense of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Ike? In his heyday, in the 1970s, he was one of the most
visible blacks in the nation, his weekly sermons broadcast from New
York by some 1,700 television and radio stations across America.
His was a message of consummate capital consumption. He liked to
say that the lack of money, not money itself, was the root of all
evil, and he often told his flock, ``The best thing you can do for
the poor is not be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this much about Rev. Ike: He practiced what he preached. He
wore gaudy suits. He owned a fleet of mink-appointed Rolls Royces.
He lived in mansions on the East and West coasts and encouraged
speculation about his many mistresses. When the basket was passed
around his Harlem church, he warned followers that he didn't
appreciate the sound of loose change.
</P>
<P>
   He's been largely absent from public view for at least a decade,
causing state Representative Byron Rushing to ask this week, ``He's
still alive?'' Alive and well, it seems. And very much among us.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to 910 Commonwealth Ave., which for years,
largely unnoticed in suburban Brookline, has been the national
fund-raising office for Ike's United Christian Evangelical
Association. In the drab, empty lobby, a placard lists such places
within as ``The Altar of Solitary Meditation and Intercession'' and
a ``Theological Reference Library.'' Still, a visitor talking to a
nameless, faceless church worker via a lobby phone was afforded
only a curt dismissal. A religious experience it was not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this low-rise office building, combined with another in
Brighton, is the financial engine that continues to power Ike's
lucrative kingdom, complete with the mansions and Rolls Royces.
With his television career either in remission or over, Ike _ full
name: Frederick Eikerenkoetter _ is in the midst of a years-long
direct mail fund-raising frenzy that shows no sign of ending.
</P>
<P>
   Educated estimates say the national campaign takes in at least
half a million dollars a month _ every bit of it sifted through
Ike's Boston-area offices. ``There is nothing nefarious or
strange,'' says Dave Corbett, a consultant to the church. ``We
raise faith and funds and that is it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question is, from whom? Ike is widely known to target
the elderly and the poor in his mailings, with a particular
emphasis on those of African and Caribbean descent. Typically, he
sends a letter containing a charm or a curse such as a piece of
yarn or a sliver of a prayer rug. The letter exhorts the recipient
to mail it back by the following day, with a donation of at least
$20 to $30 to allow the Rev. Ike to bless it. Failure to return it
with a donation, he warns, could bring doom; compliance garners
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few weeks, Suffolk County District Attorney
Ralph C. Martin II has launched a fraud investigation into Ike's
operations in Boston, though some members of the office are
squeamish over the accompanying issues of race and freedom of
religion. For years, Ike has withstood investigations from the IRS
and US Postal Service, often telling critics, ``Let someone give a
dime to the preacher and he's robbing the poor.'' Another
consideration, though, is he has insidiously marbled himself into
the sophisticated Boston-area economy, parceling out enormous
printing and mailing contracts to companies across the region. The
manager of one Wilmington print shop said he has four 100,000-piece
mailings in the next six weeks, adding, ``He feeds a lot of
people.'' In Brockton, severely disabled people are hired to stuff
envelopes with the charms.
</P>
<P>
   In Brookline, his property is assessed at $1.8 million,
according to local officials _ all of it tax-exempt, meaning the
town doesn't see a single dime. All the contributions that flow
into the area are tax-free as well.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ike rolls around New York in his expensive cars.
He travels the world on cruises. In his church, he has a velvet
throne. It is as if he is playing an elaborate joke, and here in
Boston, we have assumed the role of the unwitting straight man.
Problem is, the joke is on the poor, those people who have the fear
of God and the devil put into them. Maybe now's the time to call a
fraud a fraud, not a preacher.

SWIFT SETS HER SIGHTS ON A LONG-IGNORED DSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She sold a home in North Adams and this month moved to
a two-bedroom apartment on the Boston waterfront. There, her
husband will take care of their three-month-old daughter,
Elizabeth, while Jane Swift reports for duty as lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   The cameras that hovered around an American political oddity _ a
pregnant candidate _ are gone. There's a baby picture on Swift's
desk, but, thankfully, no baby or diaper bag in sight. Motherhood
is a wonderful thing. But now it's time to find out whether Swift
is going to be something more than a poster child for
office-holders who lactate.
</P>
<P>
   She and Shannon O'Brien, the new state treasurer, won election
last November, the first time two women will hold statewide office
at the same time in Massachusetts. But the spotlight was on Swift
from the outset, mainly because she campaigned in maternity clothes
and wouldn't talk about her child-care options.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her new job sounds pedestrian: funerals, chairing the
newly-created Governor's Economic Development Commission and, of
course, presiding over weekly Governor's Council meetings, the sole
official function of the state's lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the opportunity to do more is there, as suggested by the
career path of the current governor. And Swift does have one
intriguing interest: to pay more attention to the state Department
of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   The DSS?
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous world falls within its bureaucratic purview, one
littered with society's tiniest victims. They were largely ignored
during the Weld-Cellucci years. Tax breaks, not broken children,
were the priority. Compassion was reserved for allegedly
overburdened corporate chieftains, not for absolutely overburdened
social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Would Lt. Gov. Swift really be willing to shine a light on the
dark and troubled DSS? Would Gov. Cellucci let her?
</P>
<P>
   Says Swift: ``At the end of four years, if I did not think we
were doing a better job of taking care of kids whose parents can't
take care of them, I would not be able to sleep at night.'' A
former state senator, she points out that during her last
legislative budget session she worked with other legislators to
commit more money to DSS. Yet, ``It doesn't appear the quality of
care has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Is more money needed? ``Maybe,'' acknowledges Swift. ``Social
workers are demoralized. Kids today are more complicated and
challenging. There is need for structural change . . . I don't
think it's just money.''
</P>
<P>
   Money alone can not solve society's most complex problems. But
for a high Cellucci administration official to concede some more
money might help is close to miraculous, given past ``Welducci''
rhetoric. Can Swift put something tangible, like focus and
resources, behind her good intentions?
</P>
<P>
   Her agenda, so far, lacks specifics. Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene
Hoffer says the governor knows of Swift's interest in DSS and the
two ``will explore what kind of role she wants to take.''
</P>
<P>
   She is poised, articulate and energetic _ a little perky,
perhaps, but that's an acceptable female trait until at least age
35. She was not Cellucci's first choice for lieutenant governor,
but appears to have some influence with him. She played a role in
convincing Cellucci to pick Jane Perlov as the new secretary of
public safety. Perlov, an outsider from New York, beat out two
Massachusetts insiders, Republican Jeffrey Locke and state Senator
James P. Jajuga, a Democrat who supported Cellucci in the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Swift's political courage is yet to be tested and is, in fact,
suspect. When she was introduced as Cellucci's runningmate, she did
an about-face on two key issues. As a senator she voted against the
death penalty, but reversed her opinion during the gubernatorial
campaign. She opposed an assault weapons ban in the Legislature,
but now supports it.
</P>
<P>
   But here is a new opportunity to demonstrate real backbone.
After six years at the helm, Linda K. Carlisle will step down as
DSS commissioner. She took over the commissioner's job after the
agency was condemned by a blue-ribbon commission. However good her
intentions, her reign was stormy and lacked credibility with
frontline social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Six children in foster care died last year; 10 the year before.
If we need to be reminded of the horror of child abuse cases, think
of 6-year-old Eric Dawood, beaten to death by Juan E. Cruz, his
mother's boyfriend. A jury this week found Cruz guilty of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   There is no money and little glory associated with the DSS
universe. That is why it is so often left to women to fret over _
and write about. Wouldn't it be something if a new mother like Jane
Swift really did something to put the focus back on the forgotten
children of Massachusetts?

ROWLANDS, CONNERY KEEP `HEART' ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
PLAYING BY HEART 
Written and directed by: Willard Carroll 
Starring: Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony
Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Philippe, Dennis Quaid,
Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart, Madeleine Stowe, Patricia Clarkson,
Nastassja Kinski 
Running time: 120 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Playing by Heart'' is the much blander new title of a film
originally called ``Dancing About Architecture.'' As in, one of the
characters explains, ``talking about love is like dancing about
architecture.'' This, of course, doesn't stop them from talking
about love, or, rather, the difficulty in finding it in
contemporary LA. Intertwining the amatory quests and avoidances of
a handful of Angelinos, it plays something like Robert Altman Lite.
It's saved from writer-director Willard Carroll's increasingly
forced linkages and made watchable by the resourceful acting of its
ensemble, some of whom get more to work with than others.
</P>
<P>
   Pride of place goes to Gena Rowlands and Sean Connery, as a
couple married 40 years, living comfortably from the TV talk show
in which her character, Hannah, stars, and which Connery's Paul
produces. As he puts it, no couple is married 40 years without some
rough patches. The one troubling them at the moment is the question
of his involvement years ago with one particular woman. It's sheer
pleasure to watch Rowlands and Connery tackle their assignments.
Rowlands hits every note, and Connery seems almost relieved to be
acting his age. Between them, they take advantage of their
characters' shared back story to give the film a grounding and
solidity it sorely needs. Charm, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands and Connery fill some gaps left by writer-director
Carroll. Not all the others are able to escape seeming brittle and
superficial. Gillian Anderson, for instance, does all that's
humanly possible, pushing her persona into new realms of
self-consciousness as a theater director named Meredith who'd just
as soon abort the date she just made with Jon Stewart's
never-say-die Trent. At least she comes right out and says she'd
rather not go on for fear of getting in deeper and getting hurt.
But given the fact that Anderson is given virtually nothing but
antsiness to play, you wonder what keeps the smile pasted on
Trent's face and why he keeps coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Edwards play lovers who meet in a
hotel suite for sex when they can get away from their respective
marriages. They talk a good game between the sheets, but we feel no
erotic energy from them, just a need to talk at one another, she
about her need to maintain a controlled environment, he about his
need for something more. Dennis Quaid at least is given the
opportunity to seem enigmatic as he plays out a string of seemingly
chance nocturnal encounters, trying different lines on different
strangers, perplexing the likes of Nastassja Kinski and Patricia
Clarkson, and, for quite a while, us. The departure from the
pattern comes from Ellen Burstyn, maintaining a bedside vigil
beside her son (Jay Mohr), dying of AIDS. Both muster some
beautifully gauged acting in the segment that could easily have
imploded from maudlin excess, but doesn't, thanks to their dignity
and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But the standout performance from the younger set comes from
Angelina Jolie. She and Ryan Phillippe have the toughest assignment
as two clubbers who share more than their respective hair dye jobs
(his blue, hers rust-colored). She's a bit too needy and
motormouthed (you wonder why; she's pretty and spunky!), he's a bit
too taciturn and prone to flight. Obviously, they're made for each
other. She at least sees it and tries to act on it, unafraid to
lead with her heart. They make you buy into a wish to see them dare
love. What does it isn't the dialogue but the yes vibes in their
eyes. They're the ones who seem made for photographer Vilmos
Zsigmond's velvety fairytale LA and they join the older actors to
make the film's simpatico ways exceed its synthetic ones.

DILBERT GOES FROM REAL WORLD TO . . . HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ For the past 10 years, captives of corporate
cubicle culture have found in Dilbert a comic-strip version of the
everyday absurdity of their own workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, when Dilbert creator Scott Adams went to Hollywood
to create a TV version of the strip for the UPN network, he found a
parodist's paradise of limitless fodder, right? Uh, no.
</P>
<P>
   Adams admits that he was ``kind of expecting that I would be
feeding the comic strip for months just based on going to the
meetings in Hollywood,'' but he ran into the age-old satirist's
dilemma: How do you caricature a caricature?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing down here is like the real world,'' Adams said. ``I
mean, Dilbert (the strip) exists because it's kind of common
experiences, you know, exaggerated, but at least they started with
that common thing. Everything down here starts out exaggerated and
gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so there's almost nothing that's kind of `the LA making-TV
experience' that I can go back and say, `Let's build this into a
script.' It just doesn't translate, doesn't work in Cleveland,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN is fervently hoping that the animated version of ``Dilbert''
works, in Cleveland and elsewhere. In fact, the faltering network's
hopes for a turnaround _ after losing a staggering 39 percent of
its already meager viewership in 1998 _ hinge partly on the success
of the series, which premieres Monday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   However, the creators and cast of the show insisted during a
recent interview session here with TV critics that they are feeling
no corporate pressure to rescue UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a totally external problem,'' said executive producer
Larry Charles, a veteran of ``Seinfeld'' and ``Mad About You.''
``Our problem is doing the show. We have enough pressure just
getting the show right.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that pressure is the fact that Charles and Adams were
still scrambling to finish the premiere episode as the air date
approached. In fact, Charles predicted that ``we will not be ready
actually until, like, the day before it goes on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The series has already had a complicated history: It began as a
live-action show at the Fox network before being abandoned and
revived at UPN as an animated series. Adams, who is co-executive
producer of ``Dilbert,'' professed pleasure at the genre change,
saying that animation is ``much more freeing creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he noted, the premiere contains a scene in which
Dilbert's co-workers doff their business suits, adding jokingly:
``We had nude people who actually didn't have genitalia . . . You
can do that live-action, but it costs a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice cast includes Daniel Stern (``The Wonder Years'') as
Dilbert, the hapless engineer with the inexplicably upturned
necktie; Chris Elliott as Dogbert, the canine companion whose
biting sarcasm is worse than his bark; Kathy Griffin as Alice,
Dilbert's short-fused co-worker; Larry Miller as the Pointy-Haired
Boss; and Gordon Hunt as the work-shirking Wally.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin and Elliott admitted that they were not readers of the
comic strip before being offered the roles. (Griffin will be
competing against herself on Monday nights, since she also appears
in the same time slot on NBC's ``Suddenly Susan.'')
</P>
<P>
   In forging a transition from a comic strip syndicated to more
than 1,900 newspapers across the world (including the Globe) to a
TV series, Charles said the producers tried to fashion a show that
works ``on many levels, like all great cartoons, like `Bugs Bunny'
or `Popeye' or `The Simpsons.' '' That means, he said, endowing the
show with humor that appeals to youngsters, teenagers, and adults
alike.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, the heart of ``Dilbert'' will remain its satirical
take on corporate life. In the three years since he left his job at
Pacific Bell, the inspiration for much of Dilbert, Adams now relies
on readers to keep abreast of corporate inanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get about 300 e-mail messages a day, and most of them are
cries for help,'' he cracked. ``I'm actually more tapped in now
than when I was in my cubicle.''

CALIFORNIA CITY MULLS SPANKING BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ First, no littering. Then, no smoking. Next on
the agenda: no spanking.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the city council is slated to take up the age-old
debate over how to raise children right. Under consideration: a
resolution to make Oakland the nation's first official No Spanking
Zone. If passed, stop signs with just that message will be hung in
libraries and other public buildings around town.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the no spanking movement said the red signs might
make parents think twice about swatting their toddlers' behinds, or
worse. The nation's child and adolescent psychiatrists endorse the
idea. So do many children's advocates. Even without the threat of
jail time or even fines, they said the campaign could have moral
sway with mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the spanking police to go into homes and arrest
people,'' said Dr. Irwin Hyman, a psychologist who runs the
National Center for the Study of Corporal Punishment and
Alternatives at Philadelphia's Temple University. ``We want people
to know it's not a good idea to hit kids. And when the government
takes a stand against it, it helps them realize they're not
supposed to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the purely symbolic resolution counter that local
government has no business telling parents how to discipline their
children, and that laws already exist to protect youngsters from
child abuse. They also worry that the definition of spanking is too
vague, since it can be interpreted to include everything from a tap
on the hand to a beating with a belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting is one issue; spanking is another,'' said Oakland City
Council president Ignacio De La Fuente, who later noted that both
his mother and grandmother spanked him as a boy. ``A little spank
on the rear is, in my opinion, not something that will damage the
child. . .Telling people how to raise their families shouldn't be
under the purview of local government. To be honest with you, this
issue is a waste of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents of the measure do agree on one point:
It will probably be voted down. The city that conducted a
short-lived experiment with Ebonics _ which would have taught
students in black dialect _ and where Jerry Brown recently became
mayor, fears additional ridicule. As council aide Joseph Devries
put it: ``People worry they'll get criticized and be made fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jordann Riak, executive director of a California group
called Parents and Teachers Against Violence in Education and the
man who got the council to consider the resolution _ put the odds
of passage at slim to nil. The idea of banning spanking is too new
to parents to be widely accepted yet, he said, likening the
movement to early efforts to outlaw smoking in offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this would be is something like a no littering sign, where
people feel that they're good citizens when they abide by this
request,'' Riak said. ``We're not saying you can't do it. We're
saying it's wrong to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-spanking advocates such as Riak insisted something must be
done to stop a practice so accepted that some parents feel
comfortable doing it in public. Spanking, they said, can cause low
self-esteem, depression and other emotional problems in children.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 reason not to spank, according to the No Spanking Zone
poster, is that it teaches children that hitting is OK and violence
succeeds. Advocates stressed that spanking can also lead to more
severe beatings, however unintentional, if parents lose control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spank your kid, it does not mean your kid will end up
in jail,'' said Dr. Richard Goldwasser, president of the Northern
California chapter of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry. ``But the underlying message that aggression is OK
lowers the threshhold for him to be aggressive with others or to be
a victim later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, author of ``The Case Against Spanking,'' said six
countries, including Sweden, Norway and Finland, have abolished the
punishment. Germany is considering it. In the United States, few
even know that various anti-spanking organizations are pushing a
national ``spank out'' day on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to their anti-spanking efforts is based on tradition
and religious ideolgy, advocates said. Adults who were spanked as
children are more likely to spank their children. Certain
interpretations of the Bible also allow for corporal punishment,
and Hyman said studies show that spanking is a more common in
southern states than in northern ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have really interesting reactions to the resolution,''
said Devries, a new father who handles public safety issues for
councilman Nathan Miley, sponsor of the resolution. ``It invokes
guilt in some people because they spanked their kids or because
they were spanked and they don't want to talk about the possibility
of being messed up because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Random conversations with Oakland residents seemed to bear out
Devries's theory. Many people hadn't heard of the proposal, and
more than a few of them laughed at it. Others said they abhor the
idea of spanking. But most added that whatever a parent's personal
views on child rearing, city government should have no say in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with spankings. Their basic rule was never hit in
the face, only on the behind or legs,'' said Jueleah Spencer,
director of an Oakland pre-school and the mother of two. ``My
children have been popped on the butt, yes, but I would never
degrade them. . .I don't think government has any business getting
involved unless a parent becomes abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rudy Hoffmann, a retired architect, ``Of course you
shouldn't be able to spank. It's not good parenting. On the other
hand, the government shouldn't interfere so much in people's
personal affairs. If we start with this, it could open up the way
for prosecuting a parent because of a spanking.''
</P>
<P>
   As pessimistic as they are about the possibility of passage in
Oakland, Riak and other no-spanking advocates plan to push similar
resolutions in other cities around the country. At the same time,
they said, parents must be taught alternatives to spanking and that
their children can learn the necessary lessons without ever being
spanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing trend among civilized nations to give
children the same rights as adults are accorded, and one of those
rights is not to be assaulted physically. . .,'' said Hyman.
``It'll never pass in Oakland, but it's a very good service. The
more we talk about it, the more people will discover that you
really don't have to spank your children.''

MONTREAL STADIUM FALLING ON TAXPAYERS' SENSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ With its sleek ovoid lines sweeping back to an odd
bristling tower, Montreal's Olympic Stadium looks like a cross
between a scorpion and a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   A French architect Roger Taillibert, who designed the stadium
for the 1976 summer Olympic games, liked to boast he was giving the
city an edifice for the ages, comparing it to the great medieval
cathedrals of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The cost was originally projected at a $120 million. But
then-mayor Jean Drapeau pooh-poohed taxpayers' alarm over the
bottom line. The games and the centerpiece stadium, he famously
declared, could ``no more lose money than a man can give birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century and more than $1 billion later, the
huge structure Montrealers unaffectionately call ``the Big Owe'' is
still incomplete, although it has certainly won reknown _ as
Quebec's most spectacular white elephant. It leaks, it creaks, it
sheds chunks and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this week, the stadium's new $25 million roof caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on Monday were busily setting up exhibits for Montreal's
auto show when someone noticed an ominous inward bulge in the big
Teflon top. As people scattered amid shouts of alarm, the roof tore
open, and hundreds of tons of snow, ice, and debris crashed down.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being hit by an avalanche,'' said Adrian Kanernan,
a worker who received a gash on the forehead and was partly buried
beneath a snowpile. ``It just came ripping through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have so many times in the stadium's tattered history,
officials convened news conferences, giving assurance that the
damage wasn't really so awful and that the place would be up and
running real soon.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, conceded Andre Tetreault, president of the board that
oversees the stadium, it's kind of embarrassing when a brand new
roof collapses in the first snowstorm of the season in the snowiest
major city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new roof. It's the first snowstorm,'' he said. ``Still,
it's an isolated problem. We're conducting a technical analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Montrealers, the latest fallen roof was the final
straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wrong about the stadium. It's a useless piece of
junk,'' said radio broadcaster Gordon Sinclair, news director for
station CJAD.
</P>
<P>
   Stated the Montreal Gazette in an editorial: ``This is it. It's
time to give up, tear the place down. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the prevailing sentiment, although officials
were offended by the suggestion. ``It's impossible to believe we
could just demolish it,'' Tetreault said. ``We've paid $1 billion
for the structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, make that $1 billion so far. In fact, when the last loan
is finally repaid in 2006, the stadium will have cost taxpayers at
least $1.7 billion _ counting interest, but not the latest roof.
</P>
<P>
   The first Olympic Stadium roof, a complicated ``retractable''
affair, arrived too late for the Olympics. Six years too late, it
remained in storage in France until 1982 for reasons that have
never been coherently explained. It took another five years to
install, and then, on opening ceremony day in 1987, it was ripped
by a gust of wind.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1989: Huge gashes appear mysteriously in the roof,
forcing thousands to flee a monster-truck pull show. Fast forward
to 1991: Winds rip open the roof in April, and tear open gaping new
holes again in June. In September, a 55-ton steel beam falls into
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were fires and explosions in the stadium. An
interior wall collapsed. Electric circuits shorted out while rain
and snow more or less constantly drizzled in.
</P>
<P>
   The original $52 million Kevlar roof, at last declared a safety
hazard, was sold for $1 to a scrap dealer, who transformed it into
office curtains and tarpaulins, turning a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits are already flying in the latest debacle.
</P>
<P>
   The latest roof, installed last year, was fabricated by Birdair
Inc., a New York firm. ``We are still trying to figure out exactly
what happened,'' said company president Jon Duncan. ``And we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have hinted the stadium might sue Birdair not
only for damages but loss of reputation. However Daniel Jutras,
professor of law at McGill University, said that would be a tough
case to make since ``there's not much reputation to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day auto show, which attracts 250,000 visitors, has
already been canceled. A boat show has also been deep-sixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos expect to play their first home game in the
stadium on April 8, roof or not. But the team hopes to move to a
new stadium in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Olympic Stadium has become a Montreal
landmark, and some citizens remain proud of it. ``It's part of our
skyline,'' said Jane McConnell, a lifelong resident. ``If it's a
turkey, it's our own distinct turkey. I'd be seriously upset if
they decide to knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Montreal's most indefatigable booster, Mayor Pierre
Bourque, wondered aloud whether enough is finally enough. ``It has
cost us so much. It's a huge financial drain,'' he said. ``It
stains the reputation of our proud city.''

   GOP _ WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Committee, trying to
regain its political footing after last year's setback, appeared to
soften its anti-abortion stance Friday. Newly relected chairman Jim
Nicholson, outlining the party's priorities through the 2000
election, deliberatedly left out abortion, in consultation with GOP
congressional leaders. Ironically, the RNC inched away from banning
abortion, one of its bedrock issues since Ronald Reagan's

abortion. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

A BEEPER SERVICE FOR EVERY OCCASION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This has to be the ultimate Web site for
Southern California. It combines pagers and freeway pursuits, and
was inspired by O.J. Simpson's Bronco chase.
</P>
<P>
   The only things missing are Rollerblades, mineral water and
surfing. And we'll get to surfing and pagers in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   PursuitWatch Network answers one of the most important questions
of life in Los Angeles: How are you going to know when a live
police chase is on television if you're not already watching?
</P>
<P>
   The solution is linking computers to pagers. When there's a
chase being shot by L.A. news helicopters, PursuitWatch subscribers
are beeped and can run to the nearest TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all that high-tech, but it fills a big need.
</P>
<P>
   PursuitWatch founder Ken Kuwahara says it takes shows like
``Cops'' to the next level. ``No one, not even the producers, knows
what the ending will be. Perhaps an incredible collision or deadly
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   All that mayhem, and there's a special bonus. If a subscriber is
the first to call or send an e-mail saying there's a chase on TV,
he or she wins $100.
</P>
<P>
   It's interactive, if you can call being glued to TV chases
active.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are positive uses for pagers. PursuitWatch isn't
the first or only outfit to use pagers as something other than
electronic leashes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 a Ventura, Calif.-based outfit named ``Call of the
Wind'' has provided windsurfers with pagers that give them
information about wind conditions in windsurfing spots from the
Hood River to Baja on the West Coast, in Hawaii, Tahoe and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Windspeed devices at each spot automatically alert the central
computer when wind velocity goes over 10 mph, and that information
is transmitted to windsurfers' pagers. Thus, they don't have to
waste gas and time looking for wind.
</P>
<P>
   They just buy a pager and pay a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started windsurfing, there was a machine you could call
to get a verbal report,'' said Call of the Wind founder Jim Martin.
``I said `Why can't a machine call me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has expanded his machine-calls-you business to ski
reports, storm reports for fishermen and surf reports. His Web site
(www.windcall.com) has millions of visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   It got me thinking. There must be many other ways to combine
pagers and computers to make life easier and more enjoyable. These
are a few ideas I'd gladly give away for a small percentage of the
take:
</P>
<P>
   _ ReservationCancellation Network will tell subscribers, via
pager, whenever a table is available at a hot restaurant.
Information will come from reservationists (yes, that's what they
call them) or subscribers canceling reservations. When the pager
beeps, start dialing fast.
</P>
<P>
   _ ThatIsSoFiveMinutesAgo Network will let fashion victims know
about changing fashion as it happens. When Hello Kitty purses
replace Gucci purses, you can ditch the Gucci and run right over to
the Sanrio store _ to use a fashion example that's already so five
minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CelebSighting Site will let you know instantly wherever
celebrities appear in public. Subscribers can rush right out and
gawk, and never again have to be passive readers of celebrity
columns.
</P>
<P>
   _ The BarstoolPigeon Network will alert its anti-tobacco
subscribers to anyone lighting a cigarette in a bar anywhere in the
San Francisco area. If the police are unavailable to respond,
smoke-prohibitionists can swarm the smoker and demand that he cease
and desist from his evil habit.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers can join the JoeCamelSentMe Network, which will alert
them immediately whenever a bar is filled with smoke, empty of
cops, and safely hazardous to smokers' health.
</P>
<P>
   _ TheNightmareIsOver Network is the network for those who aren't
following the impeachment trial, but would like to be notified if
Bill Clinton is forced from office or, more likely, if the
Republican Party blows up, leaving no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above can be done in real time, with pagers. At last
there are uses for pagers besides bringing bad news to adults,
status to the immature and annoyance to orchestra conductors.
</P>

HIP-HOP'S TIP-TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with rock 'n' roll, jazz, and salsa, hip-hop is a baby,
just a tad over 20 years old. But a look at the Billboard charts
makes it clear that hip-hop reigns. On any given week, it
dominates, with at least four albums in the Top 10. It's no longer
music of the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Rap was born in the South Bronx, where teenage boys picked up
microphones and started speaking along to records being mixed by a
DJ. It was raw, straight from the street. People called it hip-hop,
a culture that embraced the music, lingo, and fashion of the time.
Since then, hip-hop has grown, capturing the fascination of
suburban America.
</P>
<P>
   Many predict 1999 will be the year rap and hip-hop explode,
snatching the music industry's limelight, as it expands with more
artists, more producers, and more fans.
</P>
<P>
   You see, unlike other genres of music, the Hip-Hop Nation takes
care of its own, giving cameo appearances to burgeoning artists,
launching many rappers into stardom on their first album.
</P>
<P>
   As artists have caught on to where the real money is _ producing
and writing _ rappers are building their own empires, not allowing
out-of-touch record company producers to have creative control. So
funksters like Master P and Jermaine Dupri keep rolling out the
hits _ on their own labels _ creatively expanding the definition of
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The list of successful hip-hoppers would fill pages, so we've
narrowed it down for you to just the most talked-about
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
JAY-Z His latest album, ``In My Lifetime, Vol. II . . . Hard Knock
Life,'' debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart several
months ago and it remains there for one reason: Jay-Z's flowing
lyrical style. He takes chances with his music. For example, the
title song from his latest album samples a chorus of high-pitched
girls taken from the Broadway musical ``Annie'' set to a thumping
bass line. He's known to lend rappers a hand, rewriting their stuff
to make it tighter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MASTER P. Rapper and producer extraordinaire. An accomplished
rapper in his own right, he started his own label, No Limit
Records, and counts among his artists heavyweights Snoop Dogg, Mia
X, and his younger brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder. In a
world where corporations are careful to diversify their holdings,
Master P's done the same, starting his own sportswear line and an
independent movie company. His movies are reminiscent of low-budget
flicks like ``Krush Groove,'' but, on videotape, he's making mad
cheddar (major money). &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAURYN HILL She's the queen of hip-hop trio the Fugees, a woman who
can rap and sing with equal finesse. A woman of soul and substance.
An artist who speaks with rare frankness about problems she sees in
the black community. The Fugees have temporarily disbanded so that
Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Pras Michel could do their own thing.
Wyclef's solo album stretched Caribbean-style hip-hop beyond its
dancehall rhythms, incorporating merengue beats and salsa riffs.
Pras's solo effort fell short but gave us one of the best singles
of '98, ``Ghetto Supastar.'' But Hill's solo debut, the ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' is so vibrant and unique it didn't
surprise too many people when she was nominated for 10 Grammys. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOXY BROWN She's the Madonna of rap. Indeed, Foxy manages to flash
even more flesh than the old Madonna, before she got spiritual. On
the mike, Foxy spits out fast-witted rhymes, most of which get
bleeped when played on the radio. To the uninitiated, Foxy is
superficial and slutty; to those who understand her game, Foxy's a
smart business woman who knows she can make crazy dollars by
self-blaxploitation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NAS One of the best rappers in the biz, Nas has gotten a bit softer
over the years, easing up on street-beats for a more palatable
(read: commercial) sound, but his raps are still tight, exploring
social issues and creating dramatic fictional tales of mobster
life. A new album, ``I Am,'' is set for a February release. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DMX Last summer, he released his first solo album, ``It's Dark and
Hell Is Hot,'' and it tore up the charts. Now, he's got another one
out, ``Blood of My Blood. Flesh of My Flesh,'' and it's smoking.
He's a rapper with a scratchy voice, one that can bark like a
Rottweiler. He made headlines when he was arrested on rape charges

it. But the charge might have given him the kind of street
reputation that makes young people think a person is cool. &QL;

EASY TO DETECT WHAT MAKES LANSBURY A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BALANCING ACT 
The Authorized Biography of Angela Lansbury 
By Martin Gottfried 
Little, Brown, 338 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angela Lansbury's heroic battle against insidious typecasting
makes for much of the interesting reading in this authorized
biography.
</P>
<P>
   The actress never did become a movie star, but she did all right
_ arguably better: She became a Broadway star and a television
icon.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens with a bang. It's 1968, and Lansbury is at the
pinnacle of her acting career, starring as Mame Dennis, the
lovable, incongruously glamorous title character of a big and
brassy Broadway musical. In her final performance, she once more
steps spectacularly down the staircase onstage at New York's Winter
Garden Theatre, which has been her professional ``center'' for two
years. The title song _ in which she sings not a note _ brassily
drives the lavish production number. ``Mame'' has liberated her.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the book's finale is disappointingly limp, a
pastiche of reflections that we've already seen played out by
Lansbury in her life and career.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 73, the English-born Lansbury is known most widely as
Jessica Fletcher, the star of the long-running TV series ``Murder,
She Wrote.'' As Fletcher, she can reflect on having, of necessity,
finally played herself for the first time in her acting career.
(The grinding pace of TV series production allows no time for
``acting.'' As in the movies, stars must play themselves, or
exaggerated versions thereof.)
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Lansbury was an MGM contract player, a movie
actress for two decades in what was the heyday of the Hollywood
studio system, the system that stereotyped her. Even so, by her
late teens she'd received two Academy Award nominations (for
``Gaslight'' and ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'').
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't become a movie star because she was typecast as
``the other woman.'' In what was a critically acclaimed high
point,``The Manchurian Candidate,'' arguably her best film, she was
the other woman with a Freudian vengeance. Her character didn't
even have a name; she was identified only as ``Raymond's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lansbury was not only professionally but personally liberated
by her role as Mame. Coming to America as a refugee from the London
Blitz, a 19-year-old virgin, she married an actor who was, unknown
to her, a homosexual. At another low point, she was collecting
unemployment insurance and appearing in B pictures. Ultimately, she
happily remarried and had two children, only to learn that both had
drug problems. (They recovered, and the chastened performance
Lansbury gave on a Barbara Walters show was one of her best.)
</P>
<P>
   Lansbury eventually learned the hard way about the Catch-22 of
becoming a star. She had concentrated on doing character work; what
stars do is revel in typecasting, in playing themselves, in
stressing their original extroverted personalities. She would
always be, in her words, a ``one-up,'' a supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   When at the age of 41 she was offered ``Mame'' _ after 23 years
as a professional actress, after 36 movies, 26 TV plays, and three
Broadway productions _ she became a star. She made people forget
even Rosalind Russell's indelible performance in the movie ``Auntie
Mame.'' She put into practice her director Gene Saks's counsel:
``You must not be afraid to own the stage.'' Her confidence would
propel her into Stephen Sondheim's acclaimed ``Sweeney Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has a hint of the behind-the-scenes matter that draws
us back even to authorized star biographies. Esther Williams had
most of her diving done for her by a double named Edith Mottridge,
who did the more difficult swimming, too. Katharine Hepburn once
remarked of Ingrid Bergman that she was ``too stupid to be any
good.'' (Lansbury splits hairs over the remark, saying we should
take it to mean that Bergman was just stupid where men were
concerned.) Marlene Dietrich flounced around backstage in bathrobes
that had a disconcerting habit of falling wide open. Philadelphia's
Main Line audiences were notorious for leaving early for the long
ride home.
</P>
<P>
   And there's even a lesson on how to respond when a good friend
asks your reaction to a terrible performance. There are two
possible answers, Lansbury teaches: ``I never saw anything like
it'' and ``You were simply unbelievable.''
</P>

`STILL CRAZY' A HUMANE LOOK AT '70S ROCK BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
STILL CRAZY 
Directed by: Brian Gibson 
Screenplay by: Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais 
Starring: Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall,
Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Helena Bergstrom, Bruce Robinson, Hans
Matheson, Rachael Stirling 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: R (language, sexuality and drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy,'' in its unexpectedly sweet way, makes up for the
debacle of ``Velvet Goldmine.'' Partly this is because of its
British love of eccentricity and failure, partly it's because
director Brian Gibson and his colleagues convince us they like rock
enough to avoid going the put-down route in their lively and
endearing chronicle of a splintered '70s band trying to get it
together again. It's more invested in liking its characters than in
striking cool poses. You expect a comedy of disaster when Stephen
Rea's keyboard player, Tony, is talked into leaving his profitable
men's room condom concession in Ibiza, overcoming the psychic scars
of the band's flameout 20 years ago at a venue designed to recall
the Isle of Wight, and picking up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The first question, of course, is whether the pieces are in any
condition to be picked up. The original lead singer, called Strange
Fruit, is dead. Nobody can find his brother, the band's fragile
lead guitarist. But the others are traceable, especially once Karen
Knowles's Juliet, the oft-abused personal assistant turned likably
and resassuringly efficient manager, gets on the case. Before long,
Juliet and Tony have ascertained that the others need only to have
a few layers of rust and reluctance scraped off before getting a
shot at a second chance. It's about here that you begin to expect a
British ``This Is Spinal Tap.'' But no. Gibson, who did such a
terrific job with the Tina Turner biopic, ``What's Love Got to Do
With It,'' means to go the hey-kids-let's-put-on-a-show route.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the kids in this case are undergoing various
mid-life crises. Funniest, because he seems most shaky and
vulnerable, is Bill Nighy's Ray. He's a spindly narcissist living
beyond his means on an estate with his Swedish wife and onetime
groupie, who has all she can do to wrest the blow-dryer away from
him, and wouldn't except during his yoga breaks. Ray's mix of
vanity and terror is shared to various degrees by the others:
Timothy Spall's lowlife drummer, Jimmy Nail's smoldering bassist
and Luke Shand, representing the younger generation, as the
replacement guitarist and source of envy as the new young girls
flock to him and away from the sagging old men the others are
trying not to admit they've become.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for a cheerful mix, especially when they're egged
on by their resurrected roadie, a Scotsman with a mischievous eye
played by Billy Connolly. He seems to have a thing for playing
Scotsman, and, in any case, has earned an encore for his
performance as the monarchy-reviving Mr. Brown in ``Mrs. Brown.''
Shortly after you begin laughing as the band stumbles into its
continental break-in tour, which begins in less than grandiose
fashion on a barge in Holland, you find, to your surprise, that you
want them to somehow beat the odds and right themselves both
musically and personally. ``Still Crazy'' is what very few rock
movies are, namely, humane. It's not the kind of film that's out to
knock your socks off. Its ambitions are modest, but easy to
empathize with, and it helps get us through the January dismals
very warmly, indeed.

MARSHALLS'S MARSHA MORE THAN `SPOKESTOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What the Jolly Green Giant is to mixed vegetables, Marsha is
becoming to Marshalls. A few years ago, Marsha began life as
doodles on a cartoonist's sketch pad; today an animated character
with the voice of British comic Tracey Ullman has emerged into a
brand icon for the Framingham, Mass. retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   As befits an icon, Marsha recently got a Betty Crocker-style
makeover. And in spots set to break in a few weeks, TV viewers
could get to see Marsha's husband for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call her our spokestoon,'' says Kerry Hamilton, vice
president of marketing for Marshalls, of Marsha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has her own life now,'' says Gail Schoenbrunn, one of
Marsha's creators at Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos of Boston,
the ad agency that Marshalls uses.
</P>
<P>
   At birth, Marsha had a very specific mission. In 1995, Marshalls
had been acquired by TJX Cos., which is also based in Framingham.
TJX is perhaps best known for its T.J. Maxx chain.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are off-price retailers. Both sell the
same merchandise as department stores, only at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, they had different marketing
philosophies. T.J. Maxx stressed everyday low prices. Marshalls, in
contrast, was highly promotional, using its ads to highlight sales
events and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   For the acquisition of Marshalls to be successful, TJX believed
Marshalls had to adopt the T.J. Maxx everyday-low price marketing
philosophy while keeping its Marshalls identity distinctive and
separate in the minds of its consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Marsha fit in. She would represent the typical
Marshalls customer. And by using an animated Marsha, instead of an
actor or a model, the ads would set Marshalls apart from other
retailers, including T.J. Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marsha was conceived as a unique way to talk to customers,''
Hamilton says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were animated TV ads unusual for a retailer, they
offered some other advantages as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes an animated character can get away saying things
that you wouldn't accept from a real person,'' Schoenbrunn says.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot for swimsuits, for example, the ad opens with Marsha
saying something like: ``Sure, I love the beach, but first give me
a few minutes to lose 50 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can get turned off by a real pitch person. Is she too
blonde and glamourous? As a cartoon, Marsha avoids such feelings by
becoming a Rorschach ink blot for Every Woman and by letting the
Marshalls message come through loud and clear: ``Brand names for
less. Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenbrunn credits Hill Holliday art director Dick Pantano for
coming up with some early sketches for Marsha.
</P>
<P>
   Those sketches were then sent off to Olive Jar Productions, a
Brookline animation house, for further work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at Marsha with a gazillion different hairdos before
we decided on just the right one,'' Schoenbrunn says.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's been occasionally tinkered with, Marsha's signature
coiffure always has a curl obscuring one of her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What else has changed? Marsha now wears flatter heels on her
shoes for an ``updated look,'' Schoenbrunn says.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other subtle evolutions. In the beginning,
Schoenbrunn and Pantano imagined a woman who drove Saturns and was
fond of daisies. Now Marsha is more likely to be found behind the
wheel of a sport-utility vehicle, and her taste in bouquets is far
more exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Most Marsha TV spots feature a ``doughnut'' format.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second spot might open with seven seconds of the animated
Marsha, followed by the doughnut's middle _ 30 seconds of Marshalls
merchandise. Then the spot concludes with another seven or eight
seconds of Marsha.
</P>
<P>
   This technique allows Marshalls to frequently change the
merchandise that is highlighted in the middle of a TV ad while
recycling the same Marsha opening and closing sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole library'' of Marsha spots now that can bracket
a pitch for a specific category of merchandise, Schoenbrunn says.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Anheuser-Busch Cos. hinted it may phase out its Louie
the Lizard character in Super Bowl ads because an icon's shelf life
is only two years. Entering her fourth season with no end in sight,
Marsha may be durable because she is so flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can play a lot of different roles,'' says Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important, Marsha is ``memorable,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to me out of the blue and mention Marsha to me,''
she says. ``When it comes to recognition, she's getting to be like
the Jolly Green Giant of the Pillsbury Dough Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In icon terms, that's the next best thing to immortality.

DECLINES KNOCK INTERNET STOCKS OUT OF ORBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How often do you read about a quiet $100-per-share stock slide?
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing in the Internet stock world isn't that you can
find one there on that scale. The stunner: there are several on
display, typically falling off highs set just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Internet stocks are giving ground after unprecedented
climbs, bounding 25 percent or more daily for extended periods. But
you have to wonder: are we in the middle of the big, ugly reversal
investors feared would be inevitable or are Internet stocks just
going to give back a small piece of their heady gains?
</P>
<P>
   Leading Internet issues have fallen 30 percent or more in the
last two weeks, after most of them peaked on Jan. 11. Analysts like
Paul Noglows of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist aren't so sure what will happen
next, in part because they couldn't get their hands around the
forces propelling Internet stocks so high just weeks earlier. But
they are braced for further declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very possible,'' said Noglows. ``It's hard to
predict, just like it was hard to say why the stocks were going up
$100 a day. What you're looking at is a retail (investing)
phenomena. You have investors pushing stocks up or down not based
on any traditional metrics, not looking at fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investors, who like to hitch a ride on stocks that are
rising rapidly, are a powerful force when a stock is headed up;
they can be equally forceful on the way down. That is particularly
true when the stocks in question depend on such a tenous conn

A DIVA'S DEBUT _ FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Performers become Knights or Dame Commanders of the
British empire not just because of their contribution to English
musical life but because of their international prominence. Most of
England's unparalleled crop of singing Dames have made shining
contributions to Boston's musical life _ Janet Baker, Joan
Sutherland, Gwyneth Jones, Kiri te Kanawa, Josephine Barstow. But
we have missed out on two of them. Dame Margaret Price is now near
the end of her career and sings only occasionally in recital; we've
probably missed out on her. But this week the other holdout, Dame
Felicity Lott, makes her long overdue local debut, singing the
soprano part in a Boston Symphony Orchestra production of Benjamin
Britten's ``Spring Symphony'' _ a work that was premiered by the
BSO. Lott may be the most important singer of the day never to have
performed here.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Felicity's operatic repertory largely coincides with te
Kanawa's, although she hasn't sung any Verdi or Puccini. Lott is
celebrated for her Mozart roles (and recorded her Fiordiligi in
``Cosi fan tutte,''the Countess in ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' and
Donna Elvira in ``Don Giovanni''; earlier this season the Met
broadcast her elegant portrayal of the Countess) and for her
Strauss (she has taken her Arabella, Marschallin, Countess
Madeleine, and Christine Storch to most of the major opera houses
of the world). Despite this overlap, two singers more different
from each other can scarcely be imagined. What Lott has going for
her is intelligence, musicianship, curiosity, and a voice that is
as fresh and as clear as a mountain stream. From the beginning of a
career that has spanned 24 years since her professional debut, Lott
has explored the song and recital repertory, usually with her
schoolmate Graham Johnson, now England's most eminent collaborative
pianist, at her side. Lott has probably appeared on two dozen CDs
of songs and vocal chamber music in French, German, and English;
she may be the best female Poulenc singer of all.
</P>
<P>
   In person Dame Felicity is charming and down-to-earth _ who
could resist a diva who lists ``sleeping'' among her hobbies in her
``Who's Who'' entry, and whose nickname in the profession is
``Flott''? When she rises from her chair in her tailored suit, you
are stuck by her height and grace of bearing; she's built along the
lines of Vanessa Redgrave, and people who have seen Lott's
Marschallin in the video of ``Der Rosenkavalier'' will tell you
that she's an actress in the same class.
</P>
<P>
   Lott may be the only diva in the business who holds a degree in
French literature. ``I had sung all my life, but I didn't think I
had what it would take to claw my way upwards in this terrifying
profession,'' she says. ``I made my first recording when I was 2,
on a little machine in a booth in a store. I sang `Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer' and `Away in a Manger,' and it's bang in tune.
. . . It may be the only recording I've ever enjoyed. I played
violin and piano and sang all the way through school, and when I
was all of 14 I made my stage debut as Aline Sangazure in a school
production of Gilbert and Sullivan's `The Sorcerer.' Now I have a
daughter who is 14!''
</P>
<P>
   Lott spent a year studying French in Grenoble; that summer she
attended a school for singers in Nice where she was told she ought
to do something about her talent. She then enrolled at the Royal
Academy of Music, where she sang Mozart's Dorabella in ``Cosi fan
tutte'' and Pamina in ``The Magic Flute.'' ``I sang Dorabella
because I still couldn't get the high notes for Fiordiligi; it
wasn't until after I gave up smoking that I got the high notes!''
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Royal Academy in 1970 that she met fellow student
Graham Johnson. ``He's younger than I am _ he won't turn 50 until
next year, so I hate him _ and he was so talented that I was
frightened. I was taking lessons from Flora Nielsen and he would
come to play for my lessons. On our own, he made me learn sheaves
of songs. When he founded the Songmaker's Almanac performing
ensemble in 1977, I was there, and I am still in it _ now it's
mostly young people, but they sometimes trot out the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's operatic career started slowly but rapidly ascended. ``My
debut was as Pamina with the English National Opera. I was the
understudy, and the soprano got sick, and I went on _ I did know it
because I'd sung it in school. Then I did some tour performances. I
did about three auditions for the Glyndebourne chorus, and didn't
get in, but in 1976 I sang the Countess in Strauss's `Capriccio'
for them and the next year Anne Trulove in Stravinsky's `The Rake's
Progress.' Last summer I sang `Capriccio' again in the same
production, and I felt my whole life was passing in front of my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's first operatic recording was a live performance of
Charpentier's ``Louise'' in Belgium in 1982, but she had already
appeared in John Eliot Gardiner's recording of Purcell's ``Come Ye
Songs of Art'' (``my first grown-up recording''). Like te Kanawa
before her, Lott was chosen to sing at a royal wedding. ``Fergie,''
she says with a smile. ``I don't think the sopranos brought much
luck to the royal couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Lott has won the esteem of the most prominent
(and picky) conductors, including the late Klaus Tennstedt and
Georg Solti, Pierre Boulez, Bernard Haitink, Charles Mackerras, and
Kleiber, and she's still adding them to her list. This week's
concerts bring her first performances with Andre Previn, and he
leads New York Philharmonic programs with her next week. She was
asked to sing Blanche du Bois in his opera ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' in Tokyo, but the tour was canceled; the score sits on her
piano at home and she pronounces herself ``fascinated'' by the
role. The Met ``Figaro'' this season marked her debut with James
Levine; and her first concerts with Riccardo Muti and Kurt Masur
are coming up. Seiji Ozawa has eluded her. ``I would love to sing
with him,'' she says. ``Everyone says he's a singer's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as she has done, Lott sometimes wonders about the road not
taken. ``All of my training was toward German music and the German
style and all of my instincts took me towards the French. So
Italian opera sort of passed me by, although I used to sing `Una
voce poco fa' from `The Barber of Seville' as an audition aria. I
hadn't a clue! Not long ago I sang the love duet from Verdi's
`Otello' in a concert, and it made me want to sing the whole role
one day. I've always been tempted by Tatiana in Tchaikovsky's
`Eugen Onegin,' but I'd have to learn Russian to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, all in all, there were few regrets. ``I chickened out of a
recording of Leonore in Beethoven's `Fidelio,' and wish I'd done it
now. I've sung Donna Elvira a lot, and I'd like to try Donna Anna _
I wouldn't be as dramatic as some, I know, but in my mind Elvira is
the dramatic role.'' There are some new parts coming up. ``I'm
graduating from Blanche to the Second Prioress in Poulenc's
`Dialogues des Carmelites,' and I will sing my first `Fledermaus'
and my first Offenbach, `La Belle Helene,' next year. I have no
business complaining about my roles, because the ones I do are so
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott seems not to have disliked anything she has sung. ``It was
sheer heaven to sing Eva in `Der Meistersinger' at Covent Garden,
and I loved every moment of it. But I hate my feet, and this is a
whole, long opera that is all about feet and shoes!''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano lives on the south coast of England, not too far
from Brighton. ``It is not very convenient, but it is very
pretty.'' Her husband, Gabriel Woolf, is an actor and reader. As
``Mrs. Woolf,'' Lott has received a letter addressed to Virginia
Woolf. ``I know you're dead,'' the letter began, ``but I think
you're wonderful.'' A year ago the whole family came to Boston as
part of a holiday trip. ``My daughter kept asking if we could go
somewhere, sometime, when I didn't have to sing. So we came to
America, went to Disney World and Chicago, and came to Boston. We
went on a whale watch, and we went up to Vermont to see the Robert
Frost country. My husband did his Robert Frost program there.''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano says the secret of keeping her voice fresh is that
she never sits down. ``I am always working, and I am careful about
what I do sing. I also sing lots of songs, and that's healthy for
the voice. I do hope one of my pianists will tell me before things
get difficult or unpleasant _ and I hope they won't have to; I like
to be aware of what I'm doing.''

NHL NETWORKING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest television gadget to help the NHL draw more eyeballs
has little to do with sight but everything to do with sound.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's All-Star Game at the Ice Palace in Tampa, the NHL
froze 13 microphones into the ice to capture the sounds of sticks,
skates, and pucks. Whistles and words won't be aired because the
two-inch mikes catch only on-ice sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The mikes are frozen under each of the face-off dots and
creases. Three are stationed along the red line.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is give viewers a you-are-there feeling.
</P>
<P>
   That has been a problem, which Fox recognized four years ago
when it acquired the NHL television rights and tried to enhance
coverage by, among other things, colorizing the puck. Critics and
purists blasted the innovations, but Fox Sports executive producer
Ed Goren defended his network's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have elevated the awareness of the game,'' said Goren.
``The folks over at Disney realized that the NHL is worth a heck of
a lot of money by picking up the rights fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Goren is right. Last August, ESPN and ABC, both owned by Disney,
paid $600 million to televise the games the next five years, or
about $120 million per season. Fox is in the last year of its
five-year deal. In 1994, Fox paid a total of $155 million to air
five year's worth of games.
</P>
<P>
   Goren said television has done its part to help popularize the
NHL, but it can't do it alone. ``At some point, the league has to
look within itself and ask whether they are doing enough to create
personalities and stars locally and nationally.''

   ``Tank McNamara,'' the nationally syndicated comic strip carried
in 200 newspapers throughout the country, awarded Latrell Sprewell
its 1997 ``Sports Jerk of the Year.'' Creators Jeff Millar and Bill
Hinds had a lot of material to work with for its latest award.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern and Billy Hunter were strong candidates. As were
Ryan Leaf and Mike Tyson.

   CBS claims of breaking even during the first year of its
expensive eight-year NFL contract appear to be accurate. According
to the The Hollywood reporter, an entertainment trade publication,
CBS pulled in an estimated $450 million, including network sales
revenue and ad revenue from the 14 CBS-owned stations, and other
local contributions. CBS paid about $500 million to the NFL, and
while the sports books show a $50 million loss, the NFL helped
boost the ratings of CBS's other prime time programming, leading to
higher ad revenue overall and first-place in the prime-time race .
. . TBS airs the 50th ``Delchamps Senior Bowl'' Saturday at 2:30
p.m. Pregame starts at 2:05 p.m. Kevin Harlan, Mark May will be in
the booth and Craig Sager and Fox's Brian Baldinger on the
sidelines. Ernie Johnson and Marty Schottenheimer, a Senior Bowl
hall-of-famer, will handle the pregame and halftime shows . . .
There's a good piece on internet gambling upcoming on HBO's ``Real
Sports with Bryant Gumbel.'' Jim Lampley reports about the
exploding $600 million a year industry and how some American-based
companies circumvent American laws by conducting business from the
Carribean. ``21st Century Sports,'' for instance, operates in
Aruba, but is located in Bethlehem, Pa. ``Point, Click and Bet''
airs 10 p.m. Monday.

   Superfluous coverage
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl hype has always been excessive. Case in point: ESPN.
The self-proclaimed worldwide leader in sports has a staggering
nine days of pregame coverage, with almost 80 programs and a
whopping 150 hours of Super analysis, Super stories, Super
statistics, Super Xs and Os, Super everything. ESPN has dispatched
33 anchors, reporters, and analysts to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with a mere 60 hours of programming for the cable
station's ``SportsCentury'' project documenting the athletes and
stories of the millenium, and it appears that the annual Game of
the Century is more important than the Century.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is not alone in its blanket coverage. CNN/SI starts its
coverage Sunday, live from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which will televise the game, will present a pregame show
of seven hours, the longest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Does the Boston Globe or any other newspaper publish special
sections when its area team makes the Super Bowl? Of course. But it
is a valid criticism that the media prints and airs every possible
story, covers every possible angle, then turns around and complains
about the excessive amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they should just say no.

THEY'RE PERFECTING THE TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a little early yet, but we already have our two
candidates for Coach of The Year. Or Coach of the Half-Year.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Cliff Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   And Ohio State's Jim O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has made his team the talk not only of the Southeastern
Conference but of the country, Wednesday night's loss at Kentucky
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, going to basketball games has become the the thing to
do at Auburn, as ``Cliff Dwellers'' are congregating at
Beards-Eaves Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It's become so big that after a 17-point win over Arkansas Jan.
6, the trees at Toomers Corner (the social gathering center in
``downtown'' Auburn) were decorated with toilet paper, a custom
almost exclusively reserved for football celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis has worked his magic before, at South Alabama for nine
years and at Clemson for 10. And there were signs that the Tigers
were coming around last season when they won 16 games and made it
to the National Invitation Tournament, their first postseason
appearance in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, led by junior college transfer Chris Porter, the
Tigers feel they can take on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone doubts this team, they have been in a tunnel a long
time,'' said Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone following college basketball in Boston doesn't need an
introduction to O'Brien _ or a reminder about what has happened to
him the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Headline News'' version is simple and painful for Boston
College fans: O'Brien, a BC graduate, had brought his alma mater
back to respectability and seemed on the verge of making the Eagles
a perennial Top 20 team, a major accomplishment. Recruiting was
going fine. The Eagles were winning.
</P>
<P>
   Then it all came apart, because of the pettiness of a few people
who couldn't see the good in a man who desperately wanted to be a
lifer at the Heights.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien left for Ohio State, BC's top recruits left for other
Top 20 schools, and the program at the Heights became the pits.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, O'Brien resurfaced at Ohio State with a collection
of mediocre athletes and a few bad citizens. Backed by an
administration that offered tangible support, the Buckeyes went
from 8-22 last season (1-15 in the Big Ten) to a 14-5 mark so far
this year, with victories over Wisconsin, Indiana, and, on Tuesday,
a remarkable blowout of No. 16 Purdue. All three teams were ranked,
and all three probably expected to find the same stumbling Buckeye
team from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of BC transfer Scoonie Penn, who along with
Michael Redd makes up arguably one of the best backcourts in the
nation, the Buckeyes are one victory away from a clinching winning
season and, barring a major collapse, they are a lock for
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has been cautious, maintaining that the Buckeyes are a
year away from being genuine contenders for anything, but he is
naturally delighted to be competing again.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike BC, where making the NCAA tournament is the main
goal, Ohio State eventually wants to compete for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   With a state-of-the-art new arena, the full backing of the
administration, and a coach as good as O'Brien, the Buckeyes are
just beginning their climb.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten is highly competitive this season, but even a late
sag would not dim the prospects of the Ohio State program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strength in numbers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Big East is starting to flex its muscles. Nine of the
conference's 13 teams already have double-digit victory totals, and
Big East teams have nine nonconference victories over Top 25 teams.
But if you think that is impressive, consider the Atlantic Coast
Conference. Every team is above .500, though that can be misleading
because some pick up wins on weak nonconference opponents. But add
this to the equation. As of last Sunday, ACC teams had 17 victories
over 12 different teams that were leading their conferences.
Included on that list were Stanford, which has lost twice to ACC
teams, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Louisville, and Princeton . . . In this
day of specialization, when players are used in spurts, you've got
to love La Salle's Donnie Carr, who has a career average of 38.8
minutes per game (39.3 minutes this year) . . . Rhode Island's
Lamar Odom may have cooled off a bit after his sizzling debut, but
NBA insiders still think he will be a top three pick in this year's
draft. Odom already has been the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Week
five times . . . It all sounded so nice when it was announced last
spring. Former Houston star Clyde Drexler would come back to his
old school and re-create some magic from the Phi Slama Jama days,
with help from players and sons of players from the Cougars' glory
days. That's what drew Moses Malone Jr. to Houston. Just one
glitch. It didn't work out. Malone played nine games and decided he
didn't like it. He's transferring to that tradition rich school,
Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whistle-blower?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This kind of slipped through the cracks during bowl season. What
was Indiana coach Bob Knight talking about when he mentioned
gambling and officials during his ESPN chat-fest with Digger
Phelps? Said Knight, ``If we only knew the truth about games that
were controlled by officials having gambling interests, I think it
would be amazing.'' Shockingly, Phelps didn't ask him to name names
or cite specific circumstances. Knight has drawn the ire of
officiating chief Hank Nichols, who wants him to either retract the
statement or provide evidence to support it. Neither is likely to
happen, which is unfortunate for the game and for Knight, who
should do better than make such sweeping generalizations . . . Now
that Auburn has lost to Kentucky, we're down to one unbeaten team
in Division 1. The No. 1-ranked Connecticut Huskies . . . Still
looking for their first victory are Sacramento State and Monmouth .
. . Another building with character and history is making its final
go-around. North Carolina State's Reynolds Coliseum will be
deactivated this spring after 50 seasons . . . How's this for a
streak? North Carolina has been ranked for 300 consecutive games.
The ACC record, held by the Tar Heels, is 319, stretching from
December 1973 to December 1983 . . . Duke may be No. 2 in some
polls, but the Blue Devils are No. 1 in the RPI and Sagarin
rankings. According to the RPI, the Blue Devils have the
fifth-toughest schedule, while UConn has the 108th-toughest . . .
Wake Forest coach Dave Odom is earning his pay. In their first 17
games, the Demon Deacons used 10 different starting lineups
involving 11 players . . . Texas coach Rick Barnes didn't take long
to create waves in the Big 12. Seems he wants the conference
tournament moved out of Kansas City. ``I think the Big 12 can have
something real special,'' said Barnes, who came to Texas from
Clemson last season after coming to Clemson from Providence. ``I
just think it needs to be moved to create that.'' Sites that have
been suggested include Dallas, San Antonio, Denver, and Oklahoma
City. But don't look for anything soon, since there is a
north-south battle in the Big 12 between the Texas schools and
their northern counterparts . . . Speaking of Texas schools,
Southern Methodist is considering leaving the Western Athletic
Conference for Conference USA.

`STILL CRAZY': BAD MUSIC WITH A BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be a shame if ``Still Crazy'' were lumped into the
``Spinal Tap'' genre simply because it was about a reunion of old
rockers. In fact, it's what movie reviewers like to call ``the
feel-good movie of the year,'' which means it's easier than
searching for adjectives and safe to say since it's still January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' involves the '90s reunion of the '70s rock band
Strange Fruit, an English band that broke up acrimoniously after
lightning cut short their final show and gave the group an excuse
to let their lingering animosities explode.
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter with a concert promoter sets the stage for
the band's re-forming, and if this sounds like hokey business it's
only because it is. However, the movie, for a change, is a lot
better than the plot line sounds, as the eccentric Fruits put aside
their real-life jobs and glance back into what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason this movie rises above the predictable is the
script of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and the excellent
ensemble acting headed by Stephen Rea and Juliet Aubrey. See, you
know it's a real movie if anyone bothers to use the word
``ensemble,'' especially if they take the time to learn how to
spell it.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the movie is muttered somewhere in the middle,
after a bad comeback show and the ensuing arguments when Rea's
character, Tony Costello, says something about ``We have to bury
the past before it buries us.'' Corny, sure. But also enough of a
truism to merit caring about the internal wranglings of a bunch of
middle-aged folks taking the risk of giving their dream another
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nighy plays the most complex character in the movie, the
lead singer Ray Simms, who joined the band only after the death of
the original and much-loved lead singer. The elder Ray still hangs
onto his country estate, even though he's broke, and his struggle
to re-capture what fueled his passion as a singer _ especially now
that he partakes of Evian instead of Old Number 7 _ is surprisingly
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in the sense that ``Still Crazy'' is definitely a
comedy, but it's a comedy with heart.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of subplots, like the love interest between Rea
and Aubrey, who plays the band's tour manager who has always had a
thing for their guitarist, Brian Lovell. Which introduces another
subplot because when Rea and Aubrey try to round up the band, Brian
is nowhere to be found and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to another subplot, wherein the group brings in a
young gunslinger to give them relevance and fall in love with
Aubrey's daughter, who goes on tour with the band while they try to
reclaim their chops. What is this, ``The X-Files''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' suffers, as most rock movies do, because the
music bites. Even though many bands hit it big in the '70s with
crappy tunes, the idea that anyone would really want to see this
group with the kind of songs they play isn't very believable. But
when you bring in a guy from Foreigner and a guy from Squeeze and
put them in charge of the music, you can't really ask for much.
</P>
<P>
   However, this seems to be one of those sleeper films that should
generate a good buzz, and deservedly so.

WALKER CAN BREATHE EASIER

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A few minutes before 6 p.m. Thursday, Antoine Walker
sat in his condominium, waiting for a phone call. He napped a
little. He ate a little. He waited, it seemed, infinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his agent would be on the line, explaining the
``out'' clause in the fifth year of Walker's six-year contract.
Eventually he would be ready to put his signature on pieces of
paper worth $71 million. And then, slowly, the realization would
come to him: He's going to be a rich man. Forever. Who could have
ever imagined that? Who could have guessed that he could get in his
own car and drive to his own condo without worrying about a
creditor taking both away?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe sports fans will find those queries ridiculous. They know
Antoine Walker, 22-year-old Celtics player. They know a pro sports
environment in which million-dollar contracts are commonplace. We
are used to hearing weather and contract updates on the nightly
news. Antoine Walker, son of Diane, used to watch TV and see the
stories of rich people, too. He knows what it means to be one of
them, permanently, because he remembers the days when he was far
from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from nothing,'' he said as he waited for his agent's
phone call. ``You have to understand that I grew up not being able
to see $70 million or $80 million in my future. So to be able to
get a contract like this, I just can't describe what it feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was a single parent, trying to raise six kids. I
remember taking soda pop bottles to the store for money. I remember
taking jars of pennies to the store, because that was the only
money we had. I remember being a first-year pro and paying $60,000
to take care of the credit problems my mom had over all the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about that $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was from all the things my mother tried to do for all of
us,'' he said. ``From furniture, to repossessed cars, to housing
problems . . . a lot of things didn't work out. My mom always kept
a job, but it was hard for us. She was always trying to do things
that would make life better.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is certainly better now. Diane Walker's credit is repaired.
She and her children live in a beautiful home several miles outside
of Chicago. Her children now attend private schools. And her eldest
son, Antoine, recently held a basketball camp where all the
children played and ate pizza and drank soda. For free. Before
that, Diane Walker was given a sport utility vehicle that her son
received from a TV station in Boston. One of Walker's best friends
received a car from him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that easy. Walker had several Chicago addresses
when he was younger. He and his family would live in a comfortable
neighborhood for a while but ``then we wouldn't be able to handle
the rent and we'd have to leave.'' There would be some assistance
from Walker's cousin, pro baseball player Chico Walker. ``But if
you remember,'' Walker said, ``most of his career was spent in the
minor leagues.'' And when you spend most of your career in the
minors, it's difficult enough worrying about your own bills, not to
mention someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Antoine Walker doesn't have to worry about anyone's
bills; he simply takes care of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a major financial burden lifted,'' Walker said.
``Now I know that my little brothers and sisters and my daughter
can all go to college and not have to worry like I did. It's a
blessing to be in the position I'm in. I'll never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those observing Antoine Walker, Basketball Player, expected him
to be upset that he couldn't immediately make $100 million because
of the NBA's new Collective Bargaining Agreement. Not a chance of
that. He has been through too much. He has gone hungry too much. He
has seen too much poverty to worry about the difference between
making $12 million a year and $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now he lets his agents haggle over contract details. If he
didn't have an agent, he would not have insisted on ``out'' clause
language after five years. He would have simply signed the contract
and started the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get all this out of the way as soon as
possible,'' he said. ``I didn't want to wait until the end of the
season and I didn't want to go to another team. I want to play here
my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Walker mentioned that he could play for 15
or 16 seasons. The only problem, he said, was that he couldn't see
himself playing PitinoBall and ``pressing when I'm 35.'' He laughed
at the thought. But there was also a time when he couldn't see
himself making $70 million, and that is happening. In fact, it may
happen a couple times over because this is far from his last
contract. When his extension is up, he will still be a month shy of
29.
</P>
<P>
   He is 22 now, staying close to his same friends and appreciating
the same things he did as a child. Even when the money was tight,
he always wanted to win. Nothing has changed. Now that his contract
is settled, Walker says he is playing for NBA championship rings.
Best thing about that? You don't have to buy them.

ATLANTA RETURNER DWIGHT LOVES TAKEOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Atlanta's Tim Dwight received his first kickoff of the NFC
Championship game last Sunday 4 yards deep in the end zone and ran
it out, eyebrows were raised. When Dwight caught another kickoff 2
yards deep and ran it out, eyes brightened.
</P>
<P>
   And when the pint-sized Dwight moved to the back line of the end
zone so he could dash forward and catch the next kickoff _ this
time 5 yards deep in the end zone _ on the full run, it was time to
stand up and gape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take touchbacks,'' the rookie explained. ``And
when my special teams coach (Joe DeCamillis) gave me the go and
said, `Hey, man, catch 'em on the run and it doesn't make a
difference even if they kicked 'em 6 yards deep in the end zone,
because then it's like you're catching them at the goal line,' I
just decided to run 'em out.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, when Dwight dashed back toward his end
zone and caught a punt over his shoulder a foot from the goal line,
then turned and ran madly upfield, all pretensions were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I caught that one real quick and swung it out of
there real fast, because their guy had outkicked his coverage, I
knew I could go somewhere with it,'' said Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   He did. Madly, fearlessly, the rookie dashed to the 28-yard
line, giving the Falcons 8 more yards than they would have had on a
touchback.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were a purple-clad fan of the Vikings, all
objectivity was gone. The Falcons had to win, just so they could
play another game, just so football fans could have a chance to
watch Dwight one more delicious time this season, for he surely is
one of the most fearless returners in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Dan Reeves, heart surgery and all, is not quite as
fearless as his madcap rookie. Dwight and DeCamillis were exulting
on the sideline over that punt return when Reeves ambled over and
tossed in a dose of caution _ a concept unknown to Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really happy getting it out to near the 30,'' said
Dwight, ``and Joe came over and told me, `Good job, good job!' but
then Coach Reeves came over and said, `What the hell are you
doing?' '' recalled Dwight. ``And Coach was (angry). He told me,
`You've got to know where you are on the field when you catch the
ball.' And I said, `Yeah, I know, Coach.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ha ha.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves's cautious words were all but forgotten when Minnesota
tried its next kickoff, this blast by Mitch Berger going 9.9 yards
deep in the end zone. Even though his back foot was nearly touching
the back line of the end zone, Dwight caught the ball and briefly
considered another mad dash upfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew where I was _ I was, like, 9 yards deep _ and I wanted
to bring it out,'' said Dwight, visions of a 109-yard touchdown in
his head. ``Then I said, `Awww, I better not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearless'' is an understatement when describing the football
style of Tim Dwight. Viking after Viking called the 5-foot-8-inch,
184-pounder the most fearless football player they'd seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They list me at 184?'' asked Dwight. ``I weighed in the
morning of the game at 178.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't sit back in football,'' said Dwight. ``You've
got to attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not only fearless, but fast. Dwight was on the University
of Iowa track team last spring, good enough to finish second in the
100 meters in the Big Ten championships, finish fourth in the 200,
and run a leg in the 4 x 100 relay. After his football season ends,
Dwight will return to Iowa to compete in track, which NCAA rules
allow because he is considered a professional only in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be hell-bent for leather,'' said Dwight. ``Look
how big I am. I've got to play aggressive. The way to play football
is to give it everything you've got, and that's the only way I
know. You can't sit back. You can't be afraid. You can't sugar-coat
things. You've got to take it to your opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some football heads look at Dwight's style and wonder how long
he'll survive in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I might not last too long playing this way,'' agreed
Dwight, ``but I can't change. It's the only way I know.''
</P>
<P>
   So, football fans, make sure you're still not at the
refrigerator when Denver kicks off and punts next Sunday. You'd be
missing one of the true treats of football _ little Tim Dwight, the
fearless one.

`SIMPLE PLAN' OVERLY SIMPLISTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until now, Sam Raimi's best-known films were three involving
murderous demons: ``The Evil Dead'' and its two sequels, ``The Evil
Dead 2'' and ``Army of Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   All are operatically violent horror films in which Good,
embodied by doe-eyed youth, battles Evil, embodied by ancient
spirits who turn human beings into decomposed homicidal maniacs.
Raimi found rapture in the frenzied dismemberment of the human
form.
</P>
<P>
   With his new film, ``A Simple Plan,'' he's found something else
_ a cold, murderously mean little B-movie that takes a more
conventional approach to telling the same old story. In ``The Evil
Dead,'' characters are driven to kill by devils in the woods;
wookie-ookie incantations wake them up. In ``A Simple Plan,'' based
on the novel by Scott B. Smith, characters are driven to kill by
another slumbering devil in the woods, a bag of money stashed in a
plane wreck. The humans in question don't start hacking each other
apart with axes, but they do turn into killers _ and that, in
Raimi's schema, is at the tail end of any struggle with evil.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it is Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton), a decent,
barely-making-it Midwesterner with upstanding morals and a load of
responsibility. His wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), is pregnant with
their first child, while his brother, Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton),
is a scruffy ne'er-do-well with no job and few friends other than
the big, rough Lou (Brent Briscoe).
</P>
<P>
   The plot gets kicking when, one day, Hank, Jacob and Lou drive
through a snowy nature preserve. They swerve to miss a fox and slam
into a birch tree. Lou and Jacob chase after the fox with a gun;
Hank chases after Lou and Jacob. Together they stumble into a
gnarly corner of the woods where a downed plane harbors two items
of interest: a dead pilot (and attendant crows, picking at his
face), and $4.4 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the American dream in a (expletive) gym bag,'' says Lou,
to which Hank replies: ``You work for the American dream. You don't
steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob and Lou want to abscond with the money. Hank resists _ at
first. After gnawing over the moral implications, Hank finally
agrees to take the entire stash, on one condition: That he holds it
until springtime. If, by that time, they hear no inkling in the
news of the missing money, the trio will split the take and leave
town. If the missing money becomes news, Hank will burn the entire
load.
</P>
<P>
   It's a not-so-good plan that gets even worse when Jacob
inexplicably tells a local sheriff (Chelcie Ross) that the
threesome spotted a plane flying over the preserve. Why does he do
it? Because Lou eggs him on. Why does Lou egg him on? Because if he
didn't, there wouldn't be a movie. There wouldn't be murder.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a broad strain of illogic that creeps through
``A Simple Plan,'' prompting perplexed viewer head-scratches at
every turn. Why doesn't it occur to anyone that all that stomping
around the woods would leave a few tracks in the snow? Why, when it
becomes clear that the moolah is ransom money for a kidnapped
heiress, is no one worried that the authorities might wonder where
it went? Why don't Hank and company steal part of the money (say,
half), leaving the rest for cops to sort out whenever they find the
plane?
</P>
<P>
   This last question is later addressed by Sarah, who turns out to
have the most actively functioning cerebral cortex in the lot.
Fonda is superb as the hard, smart woman behind Hank's every move;
Hank may be the instigator (and the moral victim) of the plan, but
she's the one pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is just as good: Paxton's performance is
all cool Faust (he sells his soul for a canvas bag), while
Thornton, brilliant as the lonely, stricken Jacob, gives the movie
its single shot of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank, do you ever feel evil? I do. I feel evil,'' he says, and
we can see the flaccid struggle in his face.
</P>
<P>
   All, in the end, are intelligent characterizations of stupid
people. Jacob's supposed to be dumb, and Lou is no great wit _ but
all of them, even Hank, even (eventually) Sarah, behave with the
mechanized dim-wittedness of stock horror characters. Which they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' is a terrifically entertaining movie _ black,
nasty, corkscrewed and taut _ but it's entertaining in the way that
all horror films are, as a welcome affront to logic.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``The Evil Dead's'' doltish teens wander into the woods
knowing full well what demons await them there, Hank and Jacob and
Lou and Sarah make bad decisions as though their lives, or at least
the plot, depended on it. It does. And for the time being, until we
all remember to put our brains back in our skulls, what malicious
fun it is.

`THEORY OF FLIGHT' NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of metaphorical weight to ``Theory of Flight,'' a
pleasing, nicely executed movie that suffers from not being
ambitious enough _ odd for a movie about frustrated dreams and
fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of director Paul Greengrass' film is Helena Bonham
Carter's performance as a wheelchair-using victim of Lou Gehrig's
disease, and indeed it is a winning turn. From Robert De Niro
(``Awakenings'') to Tom Cruise (``Born on the Fourth of July'') to
Daniel Day Lewis (``My Left Foot''), A-list actors are always
looking for disabilities to give them a career boost, so Bonham
Carter's slurring voice, crooked neck and jerky movements aren't
things we haven't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   But the natural sense of humor and almost easy-going geniality
she brings to the role are wonderfully effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theory of Flight'' is so called because of the dreams of
frustrated artist and societal misfit Richard (Kenneth Branagh). He
has spent a great deal of time and effort trying to re-create the
Wright brothers' first flight, building a full-scale replica of the
historic plane and trying to lift off from tall buildings at a
single bound.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is arrested after one of these stunts, and sentenced to
community service. Jane (Bonham Carter) is his assignment.
Actually, though they detest each other initially (natch), they
have a lot in common. Both have foul mouths and cynical outlooks,
and the first third of the film has them trying to adjust to each
other's abrasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Then saucy Jane gets things rolling by announcing one last
request before she dies: To get laid.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly something the Make-A-Wish foundation would grant (or
would they?). Richard agrees to help her _ but because he's
repulsed by her appearance, he won't personally service her. He
instead goes to great lengths to get the job done including an
alternately funny/tragic sequence in which he tries to hire a male
prostitute for her.
</P>
<P>
   As realized by Branagh, who gets to reprise his crusty persona
from both ``Dead Again'' and ``The Gingerbread Man'' (only this
time he gets to use his natural British accent), and Bonham Carter
in a solid follow-up to her Oscar-nominated performance in ``Wings
of the Dove,'' Richard Hawkins' script, refreshingly, does not
depend on melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's formulaic, but there aren't any sappy violins and
there are some great scenes, such as when Jane programs a frank
description of sexual desire into her voice enhancer, and pumps up
the volume in a crowded restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing is, when all is said and done, ``Theory of
Flight'' seems like a bit of fluff, as if it were made for
television and not the big screen. It's too much an actors
exercise, and Greengrass overemphasizes Richard's dreams of flight
as an allegory.
</P>
<P>
   OK, life and society have conspired to constrict these two
people, and they can't get off the ground and fly free. We get it.
</P>
<P>
   A little more realism and complexity would have done wonders for
this movie. By the time the pair take their inevitable flight, the
viewer feels metaphored to death, turning something fun and moving
into nothing more than a simple fable.

 &HT;    A change is gonna come: Even bird clocks may feed my imagination
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everything can change. A few years ago, a friend gave
me a hummingbird feeder, one of those with red plastic encasing a
glass bottle. I put it up and waited for the hummers. They never
came. I figured they didn't like the noise and feel of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Part of me was fine with that, as I didn't care much for the
look of the feeder, anyway; it didn't look natural.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last spring, I revisited the idea, buying the same style
feeder and hanging it at the cabin in McCaysville (Ga.). The red
plastic didn't bother me at all. The birds were the thing. Their
frequent hits on the bottle, their zippy arrivals and departures,
fascinated endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Hummingbirds even illustrated lessons for living. One day, Lyn
and I sat idling, counting the number of times a bird stuck its
icepick beak into the little feeder hole during one trip.
Thirty-six times, we counted. A minute or so later it returned,
only to get buzzed by another hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went, taking turns divebombing each other
away from the feeder, each intent on keeping the other away from
the sweetened water, not realizing _ or not caring _ that the
feeder contains three perches and enough food to feed an army of
hummingbirds. The result: Neither tasted the sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the garden of life.
</P>
<P>
   The hummingbirds are gone south this time of year, but the other
birds lend much beauty and interest to the garden. They stand out
most in winter, not because they are more plentiful than in other
seasons, but because most of the plants have moved off center
stage. Now's the time that birds strut their color and lend
movement with minimal competition.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the orange pyracantha berries and purple beautyberries
and red magnolia seeds, leaving only red nandina for bright berry
color in my garden. Too, the tasty tender plants that birds love _
including coneflower, sunflower, pokeberry, butterfly bush, lantana
_ all have died back, taking their color with them.
</P>
<P>
   Among those filling the color void in Atlanta lately are
cardinals, blue jays and a red-bellied woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   I've always made them and others welcome to drink from the fish
pond, but I never put up feeders, as the plants, insects and trees
(one big oak's acorns could feed the entire bird world) seem quite
adequate. But, in yet another change, I've begun to toss bread into
the garden once in a while. The other day, I saw a blue jay
standing on a bagel, pecking away at it. I got within three feet of
it, as I had with two doves a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the woodpecker that tiptoes up the tulip tree,
eating bugs as it goes. Half a dozen times in the last month or so,
it has come within a few feet, too, walking around the porch roof
outside my second-floor office window.
</P>
<P>
   Together, this goes beyond bird-watching; it feels like
bird-communi-cating.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me of the mysterious call of a bird up at the
cabin. (As mysterious as what looked like a great blue heron
soaring along Fightingtown Creek one day.) Each morning I hear the
call, from the same spot in the woods, wondering what bird makes
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bird books try to show calls, but there's nothing like hearing
them. I've been thinking about those clocks that mark each hour
with a different bird call, but I like them about as much as I used
to like hummingbird feeders. Maybe it's time for another change.

 &HT;    Caring for orchids
 &HT;    By Danny Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Most orchids are epiphytes, or plants that grow on trees or
rocks in the tropics, so their roots prefer light and air. When
potting an orchid, use a loose mixture of fir bark, charcoal and
perlite, never heavy potting soils, says Becky Brinkman, greenhouse
manager for the Atlanta Botanical Garden. Soak the mixture
overnight and drain before use. Rock chips and sphagnum moss also
can be used.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Orchids prefer a drop of temperatures at night of 10 to 15
degrees to bloom. Most fall into one of three categories. The ones
in the warm group (64 degrees and higher nights), such as
Phalaenopsis and Haemaria, or jewel orchids, like morning light,
preferably from an east window. The ones in the intermediate group
(55 to 60 degrees nights), including Cattleya and Oncidium, prefer
bright afternoon light from a west window. The ones that like cool
nights, or 50 to 55 degrees nights, such as Masdevallia and
Miltonia, aren't recommended for the Southeast, Brinkman says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The most common mistake is overwatering, says Cathy Meincer of
Florafarm nursery in Cumming. Most orchids prefer to dry out
between waterings. Push your finger 1 inch into the soil. If it's
dry, it's time to water. Water thoroughly until it drains through
the bottom of the container.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In general, orchids are light feeders because their thick
leaves and roots store water and nutrients. Apply a half-strength
20-10-20 fertilizer every two weeks in spring and summer and
monthly during winter, Brinkman says. In October, use half-strength
10-30-20 (high phosphorous) to increase budding for spring flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tie the orchid to a bamboo stake early, or when the plants
reach 8 to 10 inches. (Don't turn the plant around as it leans
toward the light because it will make the stem grow contorted,
Brinkman says.)

 &HT;    Beneath the orchid's delicate facade lies a plant not so
difficult to grow after all
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some plants just can't shake a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   We shun roses because they're prone to disease. We shut the door
on African violets because our windowsills don't get the right
light.
</P>
<P>
   And pity the poor orchid, whose only invitation is typically the
senior prom, where its delicate petals get rattled all night on the
wrist or bosom of a boogieing teenager.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to set the record straight: Not all things of beauty
are fragile or should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Take the orchid.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to love them to death, and that's what kills
them,'' says Becky Brinkman, greenhouse manager at the Atlanta
Botanical Garden, which is offering an extensive exhibit on the
plants through April. ``It's true some orchids are difficult, but
if you can grow houseplants there's an orchid for you.''
</P>
<P>
   How tough are they?
</P>
<P>
   So tough they flourish in the burly hands of motorcycle-riding
Terry Root (yep, that's his real name), an expert California grower
who breeds some of the world's most exclusive orchids.
</P>
<P>
   So tough that Ron Determan tells his staff at the Atlanta
Botanical Garden that after repotting an orchid they should be able
to grab it by the stem and swing it around, lasso style, without
harming the plant.
</P>
<P>
   So tough that many can withstand the day-to-day neglect and
temperatures of the average home, despite constant thermostat
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Brinkman warns, ``you have to pay attention to orchids'
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The major reasons people fail at growing orchids are they give
them too little light and too much water, says Cathy
</P>
<P>
   Meincer, an American Orchid Society judge and owner of
Florafarm, a Cumming (Ga.) nursery that specializes in orchids.
``People kill them with kindness because they look fragile. They
baby them to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some orchids prefer subdued morning light, while others love
basking in the afternoon sun. Some like nighttime temperatures at a
brisk 55 degrees; others like it ``hot,'' or 64 degrees and higher.
Some want to snuggle their feet in pots like any other houseplant
because they are terrestrials, but most like to hang out in loose
baskets because they are epiphytes, which means they like to attach
their roots to trees or rocks.
</P>
<P>
   If this family of plants sounds finicky it's because there are
just so many relatives to please _ nearly 25,000 species and
100,000 registered crosses, to be exact. ``They're the ultimate in
diversity when it comes to plants, so you never get tired of
them,'' Brinkman says.
</P>
<P>
   She should know. Her job these days revolves around rotating the
garden's display of more than 150 orchid species vying for
attention inside the entrance to the Dorothy Chapman Fuqua
Conservatory. They are a small sample of the more than 1,500
species _ many rarely seen _ that are grown in its greenhouses. As
one orchid comes into bloom, Brinkman moves it out front to replace
one that's already performed.
</P>
<P>
   And though the exhibit contains many unusual species _ like the
Bucket Orchid that blooms in summer with a pouch that attract bees
_ it also showcases plenty of plants Brinkman and Meincer recommend
for beginners, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Phalaenopsis, or the moth orchid, with its arched sprays of
fuchsia and white blooms that can last six months.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paphiopedilums, or slipper orchids, which contain pouch-shaped
lips and are available in many colors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cattleyas (known for their use in corsages), with their
fragrance, multiple colors and ruffled petals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calanthe, which features a large panicle and goes dormant for
half the year.
</P>
<P>
   The garden grows mostly species orchids instead of hybrids
because it wants visitors to see what already occurs in nature, not
a lab, Brinkman says. The plants hail from the tropics of Asian and
Africa, where many species are endangered by extinction because of
development and thieves, which is why the orchid trade is
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Permits are required to transport an orchid from the wild, and
customs officials at airports from Miami to New York often call the
garden, one of several orchid rescue centers, when one's been
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   The orchids are welcomed to a new home in the garden's
greenhouse, where they are divided among three zones based on light
and temperature needs. It becomes such a full house that next year
the garden plans to build an Orchid House, a $3 million facility
that will emphasize research and conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of money, though many orchids are expensive, prices
have come down as more growers propagate the plants through tissue
culture rather than the more costly method of dividing, Brinkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to invite an orchid home, not just to the
prom.

   Repotting an orchid
</P>
<P>
   Repotting an epiphyte form of orchid, one that grows on trees or
rocks, can be tricky. Becky Brinkman of the Atlanta Botanical
Garden recommends choosing a plant with a new shoot 1 to 2 inches
tall because that means the orchid is entering a period of active
growth. Then:
</P>
<P>
   1-Remove the plant from the pot, knock off the excess potting
mix and gently rinse the roots with water to reveal which are dead
and which are alive.
</P>
<P>
   2-Using a razor blade or sharp knife, trim off dead roots and
remove old ``back bulbs,'' leaving three mature bulbs plus the new
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   3-Position the plant with the oldest growth against the edge of
the pot and the youngest toward the center to allow ample room for
new growth. Cover the roots firmly with new potting mix (fir bark,
charcoal and perlite). Allow the new shoot and the rhizome, or
horizontal root, to rest on the soil surface. If the plant wobbles,
use a rhizome clip to steady to it.

`PARADISE' GOES UP IN SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Clark is a filmmaker who never lets up in his quest for
``realism,'' and after relentlessly and sadistically pounding his
audience into submission with non-actors in ``Kids,'' he proves he
can pulverize us with big stars in ``Another Day in Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again using only natural light _ which makes it worthy for
those cineastes interested in the technical side of things _ and a
hand-held, cinema verite strategy, Clark tells the story of a
makeshift family of thieves who will keep looking for the big score
until either they succeed or their drugs run out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film that never breathes or lets up. From beginning to
end, in every scene, there is a constant stream of profanity,
vulgarity, drug use (primarily heroin and speed) and cigarette
smoking by all four characters.
</P>
<P>
   The story, adapted to Clark's specifications by Stephen Chin and
Christopher Landon from a novel by former criminal Eddie Little,
centers on a teen-age runaway, Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser), who
resorts to ripping off vending machines to support his drug habit
and that of his girlfriend, Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner). On the
lam after killing a security guard in a botched robbery, he is
taken under wing by veteran thief Mel (James Woods) and his
girlfriend/partner, Sid (Melanie Griffith).
</P>
<P>
   The four look for a big score, which takes them to another town
and a series of slimy contacts, cheap motel rooms and drug deals.
Even gays, as personified by the showy cameo by Lou Diamond
Phillips, are a target.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what exactly Clark wants us to get out of this
story. The acting is at times amazing, and the rhythm of the pace
is occasionally effective. But there's no real character
progression in the story, and it's so relentlessly bleak that it
undermines the story's central point: That criminal behavior and
drug use often stems from environment, and such ``lost souls''
constantly struggle with both the desire to run away and the desire
for family and, odd as it may seem, responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``Another Day in Paradise'' focuses on the teen-agers. In
Kartheiser, Clark has found almost a genetic cross between Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet _ for teenyboppers, this would be the
``Titanic''-like story of young love their parents wouldn't want
them to see. Wagner is the daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert
Wagner, but with her short black hair and pixieish appearance, she
may as well have been cloned from Winona Rider (perhaps the
technology was available on the set of ``Alien Resurrection'').
</P>
<P>
   They're OK, but their characters are entirely predictable. If
anything, their work would serve as a perfect demo tape to send to
producers working on other nihilistic indie projects _ they have
that cigarette smoking and vein-popping down cold.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a revelation in this movie, it's in the performance
of Griffith, in her best acting job since the late '80s and her
``Stormy Monday''/``Working Girl'' days. World-weary,
heroin-shooting, hard-edged and motherly all at once, her Sid
achieves what Woods, with another talented but one-note turn, and
Clark could not: empathy.

PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY: OK FOR WALL STREET, BAD FOR AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH ESTES  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The big campaign to ``privatize'' Social Security
is rolling along, with a bipartisan bunch of Democrats and
Republicans succumbing to the siren call of Corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Was that ol' Charlie Wilson turning over in his grave and
shouting ``Hallelujah''?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was President Dwight Eisenhower's defense secretary who
achieved a certain infamy with his declaration that ``what's good
for General Motors is good for the country.'' If Wilson were with
us today, he would surely be delighted with the proposition that
Social Security funds be invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But less-wealthy Americans had better beware. Diversion of any
substantial portion of Social Security funds into the stock market
would produce nothing less than a revolutionary change in our
nation because it would tie the future of every working American to
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Social Security funds are invested in federal
Treasury bonds, as they are today, the security of those funds is
not directly dependent on the performance of the stock market. But
put funds in common stocks, and suddenly what is good for General
Motors and the rest of Corporate America becomes crucially
important to everyone who needs to rely on Social Security during
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If our retirement security depends on the stock market, then we
will evaluate government action by the effect it may have on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations addressing corporate environmental pollution, plant
and product safety, workplace discrimination and sexual harassment,
however necessary otherwise, may be opposed simply because they
might depress affected companies' stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Corporate America's public relations officers,
we may learn to excuse corporate misbehavior and abuse in the name
of our retirement security.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we could expect the income tax burden to be shifted
entirely onto the shoulders of working people.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s corporations paid about one-third of the income
taxes and individuals paid two-thirds. A creeping erosion under
both Republican and Democratic administrations has shifted that
burden, until now 90 percent is borne by individuals and only 10
percent by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But if high corporate profits are seen as necessary to keep
stock prices up to ensure the integrity of Social Security, then
the complete elimination of corporate income taxes will not be long
in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries of this proposal would be the big corporations
whose stock is publicly traded. Not the mom-and-pop companies, the
start-ups, the privately-held entrepreneurial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why we can look for the really big money to be
brought into play on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the dust settles, after the blizzard of bucks has fallen
on Congress and the administration, what would we have? Nothing
less than a different nation, one in which the future economic
security of every worker was tied to stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Who would then be in the driver's seat on national policy? Not
Congress, not the president, not the voters, but Wall Street
traders and corporate executives never elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
   We'd have to come up with a new name for our political system,
because ``democracy'' just wouldn't quite fit. Welcome to the
corpocracy.

<P>
   A walk on a Caribbean beach at sunrise. Champagne and a bubble
bath for two at a quaint bed-and-breakfast. A sleigh ride under
starry mountain skies. A whispered discussion about impressionists
at a great museum.
</P>
<P>
   What's your idea of romance?
</P>
<P>
   No matter their definition, Americans love romantic getaways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest numbers available, 61.8 million Americans
slipped off for at least one romantic holiday. According to the
Travel Industry Association of America, one-fourth of the adults
polled took two or more sentimental journeys during the year.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most popular romantic getaway was the city visit,
enjoyed by 74 percent of those polled. That was followed
not-so-closely by the beach or lake-front romp (44 percent),
gambling and gushing excursions (21 percent), golf and tennis (12
percent don't know love means nothing) and cruising (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the romantic travelers preferred the slopes.
That may surprise the pollsters of Nevada's Ski Lake Tahoe, which
last year proclaimed that romance is on the runs after 56 percent
of their clients said they were more intimate on the mountain than
at home.
</P>
<P>
   We bring up all this lovey-dovey stuff because _ check your
calendar _ Valentine's Day is approaching. And Feb. 14, with its
hearts and expectations, falls during a long holiday weekend
courtesy of Presidents Washington and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Someone you love deserves (or may expect) a surprise. And a
romantic getaway may be just the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But where to go, what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Don't procrastinate. You may be too late to find a place at a
popular ski resort or Caribbean island. The week of Presidents Day
is typically one of the most popular travel weeks of the year. If
you do find space, expect to pay premium rates.
</P>
<P>
   One destination with plenty of space is Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love has declared that ``Love is More Than
A Game'' in a promotion that hopes to fill the 5,000 hotel rooms
that were reserved for NBA All-Star weekend. Eighteen hotels had
rooms blocked off for the Feb. 14 event, which was canceled before
the players and owners reached a contract agreement earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated that the city lost $35 million when the game
was eliminated. Rebounding, some hotels, as well as attractions,
are offering specials good on Valentine's weekend. Call
800-537-7676 for information.
</P>
<P>
   You also can avoid the holiday crowds by opting for a
destination where Presidents Day isn't celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Europe, says Martha Morano, president of Les
Romantiques, a newsletter that spotlights romantic destinations
around the world. (You can get a free copy by calling
800-223-9832.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are opting to go to European cities because
the air fare is so good,'' Morano says. These travelers are waiving
a warm destination or more traditional Valentine's getaway for
three days in Paris or four in London, she explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``And romance doesn't necessarily mean expensive,'' Morano says.
``We have some wonderful finds. Our mission is to find small,
charming places off the beaten path _ places that aren't chains. We
always go and see them. Romance has to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Morano's romantic picks is Le Clos Medicis, a charming
townhouse on Paris' Left Bank. A room and champagne with breakfast
costs under $200 per night.
</P>
<P>
   As a favor to Cupid, we've compiled a sampling of Valentine's
getaways that were still available as of press time. Unless noted,
prices are per couple (What would a romantic weekend be if you were
all alone?). Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Escape to a private island in the Caribbean. Drake's Anchorage
Resort Inn, located on a 125-acre island near Virgin Gorda, is
offering a Valentine's special that is good throughout February.
The package features accommodations for five nights, three meals a
day and watersports, ranging from snorkeling to windsurfing. Cost
is $2,600. This is the place for that secluded beach as the resort
accommodates only 20 overnight guests. Call 617-969-9913.
</P>
<P>
   _ Head for the Texas Hill Country. The Fredericksburg-based
Gstehaus Schmidt Reservation Service, which represents scores of
area bed-and-breakfasts and private guest houses, is celebrating

shopping. Call 800-600-9192.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Will you ... ? If you're thinking of popping the question on
Valentine's Day, head to Palm Beach, Fla., where the Four Seasons
Resort has done all the planning for you. Its ``Hearts and
Flowers'' package features a flower-filled suite where breakfast

engagement ring from Tiffany's. The $25,000 package also includes
dinner for two, 24-hour limousine service, champagne and his and
her robes. Call 800-432-2335.

Colo., have teamed up to offer three romantic Valentine's packages

Area. ``Back Country Romance'' ($680-$800) features snowmobile

<P>
   HEILBRONER-ECONOMISTS (Undated) _ Ask economists in the baby
boom generation why they became economists, and any number will
give some credit to Robert L. Heilbroner. His 1953 book, ``The
Worldly Philosophers,'' which has sold nearly 4 million copies, is
a ``Profiles in Courage'' of the great thinkers who shaped modern
economics. So it is somewhat surprising to find Mr. Heilbroner
increasingly critical of the economists he helped inspire. They
have missed the point, he says. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-J (Undated) _ In unscrambling the puzzle of the books
attributed to Moses, scholars have identified four narratives by
letters _ J, E, P, D. Now, after a dozen years of research, Richard
Elliott Friedman, a professor of Hebrew and comparative literature
at the University of California at San Diego, has tantalizingly
argued that the J narrative is far longer than the three others,
and actually extends considerably beyond the five Mosaic books. The
J source, he says, comprises a ``hidden book'' that is nearly 3,000
years old and that runs from Genesis to the First Book of Kings. By
Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ON-THE-ROAD (Undated) _ Consider them latter-day nomads. Or
maybe, come to think of it, more like venerable turtles, who carry
their homes on their backs. They are the hundreds of thousands of
elderly and retired people who take to life on the road, spending
all or much of the year wandering around North America in assorted
trailers, converted buses, campers and motor homes. (850 words)

   GLORIA-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Gloria'': Sidney Lumet,
director; with Sharon Stone and Jean-Luke Figueroa. Reviewed by

<P>
   Q. I am 41 years old and I live comfortably within my needs on a
salary of $50,000 a year. I have a 401(k) plan through my employer
in which I now have about $40,000 invested in Fidelity's Magellan,
Asset Manager, and Equity Income funds. I have been contributing 8
percent of my salary, with most of the additions going into
Magellan; in March I plan to move to 10 percent contributions --
the most allowed for me under than plan. I also have $18,000 in
cash saved for emergencies, and $7,000 invested in shares of Home
Depot and Dell Computer. What would be a good place to invest about
$200 to $300 a month so that 20 years from now I would have some
financial security, even if I need to continue working?
</P>
<P>
   P.W., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. My suggestion for the first decade or so of this program is
to begin a long-term dollar- cost-averaging program in a mutual
fund invested in health care stocks -- and specifically a fund
focusing on the pharmaceutical and medical supplies end of the
business, to the exclusion of the funds which tend to favor biotech
and health care delivery issues. Good examples are the health care
funds of both Fidelity and Vanguard, both of which have built very
solid long-term records.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there's no question that this isn't a riskier
investment that the portfolio you're building in your 401(k)
program. When I checked with the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports I
discovered, to my horror, that the average health care sector fund
has a portfolio price earnings ratio of 38.3, and that the two
funds I am suggesting had even pricier portfolios, with an average
PE of 39.2 for Vanguard Specialized Health Care and 39.4 for
Fidelity Select Health Care funds. On the other hand, there are two
factors that would calm my jittery nerves if I were embarking on
such a program. One is that the discipline you propose is basically
dollar cost averaging, and over the course of time your regular
sequence of investments should arrive at a reasonable average cost
relative to the eventual market value. The second, of course, is
the very long-term investment time frame -- 20 years by your
specifications, and even longer if you decide you don't want to
retire early.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I say ``for the first decade or so'' back there at the
beginning? That was because despite its attractiveness for a
long-term investor, health care remains a volatile and expensive
sector of the markets, and my guess is that it's likely to remain
so. The chances are good that after about 10 years, the position
you'd have established in this 'extra' retirement account would
have grown to a point where it represents about 25 percent of the
total retirement portfolio. If you let it exceed that level by
much, you would be assuming more risk than I like to see in one
higher-risk market sector.
</P>
<P>
   You might at that point consider an entirely different sector
for some of your further investments -- adding to the health care
position only to the extent that the position doesn't exceed 25
percent of the total retirement portfolio. For the remaining funds
you might look to another sector, such as perhaps computer
technology, or you might decide that in your early 50s it's time to
begin moderating portfolio risk a bit. Who knows what the markets
and your feelings about them will be a decade hence; fortunately,
it's question neither of us have to consider for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my suggestion is that you use a Roth IRA for the lion's
share of these savings, seeking to balance the larger tax-deferred
account you are building with the 401(k) with money that you can
withdraw on a tax-free basis in retirement, and withdraw without
any mandatory schedules of withdrawals involved. Even if you were
to save the maximum $300 a month, $166 of it -- more than half --
could go into a Roth account. The remainder could be invested in a
taxable account, and when it reaches a critical mass, you could
consider whether you want to put it into a variable annuity account
which would shelter that money from short-term taxes as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My question concerns the difference between investments in
bond mutual funds and investments in individual bonds or bond unit
trusts. As I understand it, bonds are generally more stable and
less risky than equities, the bond market frequently moves in the
opposite direction of equity markets, and bonds generally preserve
the investor's principal. Many financial advisors, yourself
included, recommend using bond funds, arguing that they reduce risk
through diversification. But unlike individual bonds or unit
trusts, mutual funds can also reduce the prospect for preservation
of capital -- a fund's price can fluctuate daily, and there's no
preordained maturity date when the investor is ``guaranteed'' to
recoup his or her original investment. Considering this important
drawback in bond mutual funds, why do you recommend them rather
than unit trusts or individual bonds?
</P>
<P>
   J.W., Austin, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. You spell out some of the advantages of owning bonds rather
than stocks pretty well, but you omit several of the advantages
that bond funds have over direct purchases of bonds. And for most
people, the advantages of bond funds are considerable. One is the
greater ease of record keeping; this chore can become daunting when
dealing with a portfolio of callable bonds or mortgage-backed bonds
which make periodical returns of both interest and principal to
their owners. If you own a fund, the fund manager and the fund
company deal with all of this. Another advantage of funds is the
considerable greater ease of reinvestment, whether it be of the
yield stream or reinvestment of returns of principal. Much more
important, with a bond fund you should expect that you are buying a
sophisticated management team to keep an eye on the portfolio --
noting investment opportunities and signs of potential trouble
before an individual investor would be likely to.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you don't mention what I consider to be the
greatest disadvantage of bond funds -- expenses. Typically bond
fund expenses run in the neighborhood of 1.1 percent annually.
That's 1.1 percent of the total assets under management, which is
simply deducted from the income stream before distributions are
made. When you buy individual bonds, you pay a broker's fee when to
them, and after that you pay only whatever account maintenance fees
your broker may levy. If your position is sizable, these costs will
quickly melt into relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   To my thinking the variance in expenses is a much more important
factor in deciding whether to own bonds or a bond fund than your
concerns about risk. For one thing, the value of individual bonds
tend to fluctuate almost on a daily basis, just like the value of
bond funds. Investors simply don't tend to notice it, because if
they plan to hold on until maturity, they simply forget about them
and don't check the papers or read their quarterly reports
carefully to see what the principal is worth. Of course, that's all
right -- such an investor is taking a long-term point of view. But
the investor in a good bond fund can also take a long-term point of
view -- calculating that over a decade or so the fund should see
very little in the way of erosion of principal.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, exceptions to that last statement. There
are funds which, in attempts to produce a high yield, frequently
buy bonds at prices above par. If these holdings remain in the
portfolio until maturity, the effect is a gradual erosion in
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund owners, aware of this, counter this effect by
requesting distributions which are a bit less than the expected
income stream, leaving the balance of the distributions to be
reinvested so as to mitigate against loss of principal. A careful
reading of a fund's prospectus should let you know whether erosion
of principal should be a concern over the long haul. (You should
remember, as well, that a fund which typically shows erosion in
principal value isn't necessarily bad -- total returns remain the
name of the game. But the investor has simply to be aware of it,
and adjust withdrawals from the account if maintenance of principal
is a paramount concern.) But this is a tactic you would not have to
adopt only with a few funds. Over a reasonable period of time --
say a decade -- the better bond funds tend to show very little
change in principal value.

WINDOWS PITTED ON INSIDE GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have 14 replacement windows that have become pitted, on the
inside. I live near the sea and get plenty of salt spray, but this
pitting is on the inside. The window representative suggested using
``some kind of solution,'' which isn't much of a help. My
neighbors' windows, similar to the ones I have, are not pitting,
inside or outside. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   JACK VALERI, Nahant, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the windows are pitting on the inside, and the pitting you
can actualy feel, then I think they are defective, and should be
replaced gratis by the manufacturer. Actual pitting (etching of a
sort) cannot be fixed, in my experience.
</P>
<P>
   If the pitting cannot be felt, maybe it is just discoloration.
If so, try this: 1. Wash with equal parts white vinegar and water,
or straight white vinegar. 2. Wash with a damp sponge rubbed on a
bar of Bon Ami. 3. Use Lime-Away, or Zud, sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a relatively new window cleaner on the market called
Clear Vue. I have not seen it, but it is made by the Lawrence Plate
and Window Glass Co. Call them to see where you can get it. It is
supposed to be the be-all and end-all of window cleaners; its
contents are proprietary, so you cannot reproduce it at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The water won't drain out of my kitchen sink unless I use the
disposal. How can I fix it? Also, I have a small television set
that is very sticky and dirty. How can I clean it?
</P>
<P>
   IRENE, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Obviously, the disposal doesn't stay open when it isn't
working. It might have broken, or needs a simple adjustment. Check
the manual; if there is no information on blockages or there is no
manual, then call a plumber. If the disposal is not broken or
defective, it may be sinple to fix, but it escapes the handyman.
</P>
<P>
   To clean the TV set, disconnect it and clean only the top and
sides, and the screen, not the back or anywhere else there are
wires. A set can give you a shock even unplygged. The best cleaning
solution for this is a half cup of ammonia in a bucket of warm
water; the ammonia will cut the grease very nicely. Don't soak the
surface; squeeze out a sponge till almost dry and wipe lightly. It
doesn't take much oomph. While you're at it, you can clean the
stove and microwave the same way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I clean my ceramic tile floor to get rid of the grout left on
the face of the glazed tile. It's only a film, not big chunks, but
when I wash it, it comes right back when it dries. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID DuVERNAY, Rindge, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. A film of grout is indeed a pain, a little like plaster dust
that cannot be washed off; you wash it and it comes right back. So,
for the grout film, polish the face of the tile with a dry cloth.
If that doesn't work, make a weak solution of muriatic acid and
water (one part acid to five parts water) and paint this on the
tile, then rinse. Then polish with a dry cloth. Wear skin and eye
protection when working with acid; and when mixing it, always pour
the acid into the water.
</P>
<P>
   And, if all else fails, try this trick, the one that gets that
pesky plaster film off wood floors. Mix one tablespoon boiled
linseed oil in a bucket of warm water. Mix furiously. It won't mix,
but you will distribute the oil a bit in the water. Dip a sponge in
this solution, squeeze it nearly dry, and wipe the tiles (or
floor). Your hand will feel very oily, but very little oil will get
on the tile or floor; there will be enough, indeed, to do its job
of grabbing the grout or plaster dust.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The weatherstripping between my tilt-out replacement windows
and frame has worn out; it is a fuzzy stuff and I can't find a
replacement; the window people told me they wouldn't sell just the
weatherstrip. That seems like a fine how-de-do in which only the
window people win. Is there something I can use to replace that
fuzzy weatherstrip? It is needed to keep the tilt-out connection
airtight.
</P>
<P>
   NAZ DIRINIAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It certainly is a fine how-de-do, and you are the victim of
modern technology that doesn't work very well. It is particularly
galling that the window people can't be bothered helping you. It is
one reason that repaclement windows are not always the way to go
when you try to tighten up the house.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to remove what's left of the fuzzy stuff to do
this: Glue a strip of felt (still sold as a weatherstrip of sorts)
on the edge, using Pheno-Seal, a phenolic vinyl adhesive caulk as a
glue. This stuff comes in a caulking cartridge widely available in
hardware stores, and it really does stick to many things. Apply a
bead on the window edge, smooth and spread it out with your fingers
to cover the entire edge, and apply the felt. Wait overnight before
closing the window.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that might work is spring bronze weatherstripping.
It might be hard to find, but if you can find it, it will do a good
job sealing that movable joint. It will take some innovation, but
that's what we New Englanders are all about. Then you can tell the
world how badly you were treated by the window people.

MAZDA PROTEGE _ WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT ALL YOU GET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love sleepers.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about trains here. Nor those ``good bets''
lurking deep in the draw of the NCAA Basketball Tournament brackets
_ even though I'm fond of both of those, too.
</P>
<P>
   The sleepers in question today are ones I've loved since I was a
kid: cars that have a bit more power lurking under their
unprepossessing hoods than you'd suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 1999 Mazda Protege ES.
</P>
<P>
   I did _ even though it was for a far shorter time that I would
have liked.
</P>
<P>
   A sleeper?
</P>
<P>
   It looks like something my mom would drive _ slowly. It also
looked like a car she'd keep cleaned and waxed and be able to drive
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. G looked it over. Granted, it didn't look like much,
sitting there covered with salt and road grime after a week of
sloppy weather. It didn't take long for that first impression:
``It's a nice enough little car, but it doesn't have much
personality. Give me my Jag any time.''
</P>
<P>
   She isn't really going highbrow. She drives an '88 rust-infested
Jag of which John White advises: ``Make it into a lawn sculpture;
after all, it's the right shade of green.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this Mazda is the right shade of green, too. A nice paint
job was resting under all that salt.
</P>
<P>
   A little personality, too.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle was powered by Mazda's 1.8-liter, 122-horsepower
four-cylinder engine. We didn't take out the stopwatch, but this
gem sure seemed to get to 60 very quickly, the hornets' nest under
the hood revving quickly to just under 6000 rpm before smoothly
shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first excursion wasn't nearly that exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Globe, we were stuck in city traffic for 40 minutes,
enough time to check out the intricacies of the radio-CD player. It
had a nice sound, and also offered a neat CD storage compartment
(with door) directly under the radio. Best of all, the unit's
controls were pretty much self-explanatory.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been my contention that the owner's manual will
yield at least one interesting nugget of information.
</P>
<P>
   This manual's gem was the Auto/M button on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Hit ``auto'' in a strange area and the radio will automatically
seek out and temporarily store as presets the six strongest
stations on the AM and both FM bands. Turn back to Auto/ manual and
your original presets are still there. I'm not an audiophile, but
this seemed like a neat touch.
</P>
<P>
   The sticker wasn't anywhere to be found, not in the spacious
door storage areas, the average-sized glove box or the small area
under the armrest.
</P>
<P>
   So we went to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $14,925, the ES package, automatic
transmission, and sound system pushed the total sticker to $17,775,
maybe not a bargain, but a fair price for a well-equipped car that
packs a ton of performance. Included in all that was cruise
control, air conditioning, power door locks (with keyless remote
entry) and 15-inch aluminum alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never had the experience of keyless entry, you're
missing one of life's little pleasures, one you'll never want to
skip again. I'm hooked. No more fumbling with keys. Just hit the
remote once to unlock the driver's door and a second time to unlock
the other three doors.
</P>
<P>
   Another neat little engineering twist is the cup holder. There's
a little storage area under the heater controls (they're the dial
type). The edge of the storage area is a spring-loaded retainer
that you flip over to create a double cupholder. Of course, if
you're like me, you generally arrive at your destination with
coffee spots on your clothes through no fault of the cupholder.
</P>
<P>
   Staying on the inside, there's adequate room in back, and the
front seats not only were comfortable but had plenty of lumbar
support for a lower back aching mightily from moving snow not only
from my own driveway, but from chopping number one son's Sable out
of a giant frozen ice block where it had been plowed in at the
Wonderland T lot.
</P>
<P>
   Once out on the road, the Protege's power steering has a solid
feel, matching the suspension. Both might be a little harder than
average, but they're perfectly matched to the car's performance
characteristics. The Protege crisply obeyed a quick avoidance
maneuver on Route 93 north, dodging a bumper and trail of debris
from a just-happened accident in the wee hours of Martin Luther
King Day.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have the car long enough to check the mileage
properly, but the projected 26 city, 30 highway, seemed, if
anything, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   For one _ and the only _ thing, the door handles. They're too
short to provide enough purchase for proper opening. The handle
generally slipped out of my grip on the first try, then opened fine
on the second attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, this car gets you where you're going fast enough
to allow plenty of time for fiddling with a door.

`GLORIA': BRASSY EX-CON WITH A HEART OF MUSH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharon Stone may have left her heart in San Francisco, but the
rest of her is strictly from Noo Yawk in a richly comic performance
as the heroine of ``Gloria.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Ms. Stone turning ``off'' into ``awf,'' ``all right''
into ``awright,'' ``the'' into ``duh'' and ``go ahead'' into
``g'head'' is a delight all by itself. But her Gloria also talks
tough, spews obscenities, wields handguns with unflinching
authority, drives like a demon, makes grown males strip, tells a
little boy precisely why, anatomically, he is not a man and gives
him advice about the kind of fun she expects him to have when _ and
if _ he grows up, which involves booze, gambling, tuxedoes and
skinny but otherwise well-endowed blondes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like sleeping with you,'' the little boy tells Gloria after
they have spent a night in a motel.
</P>
<P>
   And Gloria says, ``You know, you're not the first guy to tell me
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described broad, Gloria is a brassy, gutsy, foul-mouthed
ex-con who finds she has an unexpected heart of mush when her
error-prone path through life crosses that of little Nicky Nunez
(Jean-Luke Figueroa), whose father made the mistake of taking work
home.
</P>
<P>
   Because Nicky's father is an accountant for a gangster named
Kevin (Jeremy Northam), and because the work in question consists
of a computer disk containing the incriminating names of police
officers, judges and congressmen on the mob payroll, Kevin is
understandably eager to recover it.
</P>
<P>
   So he dispatches one of his henchman to the apartment where the
Nunez family lives. And because Nicky's father is reluctant to
reveal the whereabouts of the disk at once, the henchman
successively shoots and kills Mrs. Nunez, her mother, Nunez and his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The disk, at this time, is on its way down a fire escape in the
custody of Nicky, who is seized by the gangsters just in time to be
present in Kevin's headquarters when Gloria returns from a
three-year absence. Since he was once Gloria's lover, these
premises are her former apartment, and since she is just out of a
Florida prison on parole after taking a rap for Kevin, she is
understandably testy.
</P>
<P>
   When Gloria realizes that 6-year-old Nicky has been marked for
murder, she takes matters into her own hands, and off they go on a
run through New York City. Kevin meanwhile, is sweating out a
deadline imposed by his boss, the smooth but menacing Ruby (George
C. Scott), another of Gloria's ex-lovers; and Gloria, who shouldn't
be in New York in the first place, is sweating out the deadline for
an imminent date with her parole officer in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Steve Antin and directed by Sidney Lumet with his
customary fine eye for the urban landscape of New York City, this
``Gloria'' is a smoother, funnier, more suspenseful and more
endearing version of the 1980 John Cassavetes film of the same
title.
</P>
<P>
   Young Figueroa makes a fine foil for the intermittently maternal
Gloria. And Ms. Stone, who in one guise or another has always been
a treat, turns in a performance that definitely merits the key to
Noo Yawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes multiple murders, a bloody car wreck,
threats on the life of a small child and uninhibited conversation.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As a younger, dumber man, I wasted hundreds of hours and
dollars hanging around in chat rooms on the CompuServe on-line
service, typing messages in real time to other users of the
network. You paid a dime a minute back then, and the massive
CompuServe bills _ along with the massive idiocy of on-line
conversations _ soured me on Internet chat for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I've left the issue of on-line chat pretty much
alone, until now.

   A lot has changed since I gave up on chat. Cheap Internet access

little or no cost, Internet users can plunge into thousands of
never-ending discussions of computers, politics, sports _ and yes,
sex, even sex. For more information, visit http://www.irchelp.org.
</P>
<P>
   My experiments with Linux software led me back to the universe
of chat. Desperate for help, I found an excellent IRC channel where
Linux users swap advice 24 hours a day. Those guys have bailed me
out on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But I've no idea who helped me, because IRC chatters are usually
anonymous. As a result, most IRC channels are filled with
trashtalk. While CompuServe and America Online chat rooms have at
least a few rules, IRC is like Chicago in the era of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chat has a bad reputation among serious computer
users, but the technology is getting a second chance thanks to the
concept of ``instant messaging,'' a variation of chat which could
become an indispensable business tool.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging brings new precision and power to the concept
of chat, mainly because it introduces a concept called
``awareness'' _ the ability to know whether particular people are
actually connected to the network at that time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online made the first big move in instant messaging
three years ago. Its Buddy Lists would tell you if a friend was
connected to AOL at that moment, and let you pop him a message. But
the most dramatic success story comes from Tel Aviv. There a
company called Mirabilis Ltd. produced ICQ, a system that allows
any Internet user on Earth to hunt up friends and colleagues for an
instant chat.
</P>
<P>
   A network of ICQ servers is scattered around the Internet, and
members like me download a small piece of free software that runs
on my computers. (You want it? Go to http://www.i.com.) Whenever I
log onto the Net, my ICQ software tells the server I'm available.
Other ICQ users can now message me, or I can block out everybody
but my friends and colleagues. You can set ICQ so that you're only
visible to people you want to hear from.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis hasn't advertised its product, instead counting on
word of mouth. That was enough. Over 25 million people worldwide
use I, 60 percent of them outside of the United States and Canada.
Last summer, AOL bought the company for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of people who live their life on the Web, and
ICQ became their product,'' said Fred Singer, chief operating
officer of AOL's ICQ subsidiary. Most are hobbyists, but a growing
number use ICQ as a powerful business messaging tool. Imagine
knowing at a glance whether a client or colleague is at his desk.
Or being able to round up several co-workers at a moment's notice
for an impromptu chat session about an important project.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is well past the hobby stage. ICQ now offers a
version designed for corporate networks. The company is also
looking at ways to let Internet retailers use ICQ to communicate
with customers. Millions of us get e-mail messages announcing
bargain airfares, but it may be hours before we see them. Send that
same message via I, and many customers will whip out their credit
cards on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. foresees a bright future for instant
messaging inside the corporation. On Monday, at the Lotusphere
conference in Orlando, Fla., Lotus showed off SameTime, which lets
anyone on a corporate network locate and chat with anyone else on
the network _ wherever he or she is. Lotus CEO Jeff Papows told me
he used SameTime to collaborate with colleagues on his keynote
speech while zipping southward at 30,000 feet in the corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time communication about real work. It's enough to give
Internet chatting a good name.

THE NETWORKS PLAY A NUMBERS GAME AGAINST CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The cable industry knows what people are
watching on television and brags about the rising numbers of
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But either those lucky Nielsen families aren't keeping good
diaries or they just can't remember anything beyond the Big Four,
because network television is finding it pretty easy these days to
mock the numbers claims of the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   This aggressive attack strategy started a little more than a
year ago when high-ranking members of the broadcast networks got
together and said something had to be done, a war needed to be
waged, against the mounting media attention paid to cable and its
claims of rising numbers while the networks were sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Now understand that in the television industry every network is
out for its own good and none of them would shed tears if another
went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry, on the other hand, has always been about
helping one another. Most of the channels are involved in niche
programming, which means they are not competing in the literal
sense. They are grabbing specific genres _ sports, food, cartoons,
to name a few. Even when there is overlap, there is a certain sense
of camaraderie. That's why the National Cable Television
Association has a long-standing motto: ``The Future Is On Cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable is an emerging force but, for whatever reason, the ratings
aren't there. Many people believe that the vast number of cable
channels simply dilutes the audience so the numbers will never be
comparable to the networks. Some even believe that viewers just
can't remember what they watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsens are not based on fuzzy memories.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the broadcast networks have snatched this ratings
discrepancy and, frankly, are all too giddy about making fun of
wrestling and old movies sitting at the top of the cable ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Every broadcast network likes to tout the superiority theme. For
example, ABC says that the number of people 18-49, over a one week
period, watching the network is 65.1 million. And for the most
popular cable channel, TBS, that figure is 19.2 million. ABC took
it one step further and said that among 245 cable channels _
national, regional and local _ only six are up in household ratings
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Take that _ and all the numbers spun by the networks _ for what
you will. From here it smells like fear. The networks know that the
way we watch television in this country is changing, and they are
industrial machinery in a high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   It may not make headlines right now, but the networks are
scrambling to reinvent themselves before they collapse, a very real
possibility in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   How people watch television is going to be revolutionized, and
flipping for cable channels is just the beginning. Already patterns
have changed. Viewers care about good shows, not what network
they're on.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, some of the best dramas and comedies are on basic
cable. Then factor in HBO and Showtime, which have the best
made-for-TV movies. Cable often produces the best documentaries and
is rivaled only by PBS for outstanding information series.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cable takes more chances than broadcast networks and
consequently produces more mature, intellectual programs. While the
networks are locked into antiquated ideas about what Americans will
watch _ a practice that leads to programs that speak down to the
viewer _ cable understands it has to be better to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, cable has the shows. The beginning and the end for
broadcast networks was yesterday.

 &HT;    REEVES CREDITS LANDRY FOR HIS SUCCESS
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, JAN. 24
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dan Reeves played football for the Dallas Cowboys, he
understood the offensive playbook better than some of the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In Coach Tom Landry's complex system, Reeves was a runner,
passer, blocker and receiver. When there was a trick play to be
made, Reeves usually was part of it. He became the first Cowboy to
score four touchdowns in a game, and some remember him as the most
versatile player to wear the helmet with the star.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Reeves became coaching royalty in the NFL, he was a
player who made the most of his opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was a quarterback at the University of South Carolina
when he signed with the Cowboys as a free agent in 1965. Unable to
play quarterback in Dallas, he earned points with his willingness
to play a variety of positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan never had great speed, but he was an extremely intelligent
player,'' Landry recalled last week. ``Not only did he know his own
assignments, he knew what every other player was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry said the Cowboys were lucky to get Reeves. The Cowboys
had 20 picks in the 1965, but the only two quarterbacks chosen were
Craig Morton and Ernie Kellerman, an unknown player from Miami
(Ohio) who failed to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves made the roster and quickly became one of Landry's
favorites. He finished his pro career with 1,990 rushing yards, 129
receptions, 25 touchdowns and four knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And a burning desire to follow in Landry's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   It came as little surprise to Landry when Reeves announced his
intention to coach. Reeves played for the Cowboys eight years, long
enough to digest Landry's innovative schemes to football.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously absorbed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves leads his Atlanta Falcons in next Sunday's Super
Bowl against favored Denver, he will carry 34 years of NFL
experience. He was a successful player in Dallas, and he been a
winning coach with Denver, the New York Giants and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who celebrated his 55th birthday on Tuesday, gives
credit to the man with the funny hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've accomplished as far as coaching is concerned
is related to what I learned from Coach Landry,'' Reeves said. ``I
had no ambitions of ever coaching until I was around him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Landry-Reeves relationship grew during Reeves' 16 years with
the Cowboys. After retiring as a player in 1972, he was hired as a
Cowboy assistant, a position he kept for nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   During those years the Cowboys were 84-32.
</P>
<P>
   Landry helped his protege get his first head coaching job in
1981. When Reeves was hired by Denver, he became the youngest head
coach _ 37 _ in the history of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 years Reeves' teams _ the Broncos, Giants and
Falcons _ have a combined 164-117-1 record. He was named NFL Coach
of the Year for the sixth time last week after leading surprising
Atlanta to the NFC West championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33-year history of the Super Bowl, Reeves has played or
coached in nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who still keeps an eye on the NFL, knows what makes
Reeves successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's teams are always prepared and ready to play,'' Landry
said. ``When I see his teams, they're all under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consider that a hallmark of Landry's old teams. The Hall of
Fame coach was known for having disciplined teams. The Cowboys
rarely were a team that beat themselves, and Landry helped them
reach the Super Bowl five times.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons certainly showed discipline in last week's 30-27
overtime victory against Minnesota in the NFC championship game.
The Falcons finished with only four penalties and two turnovers in
perhaps the league's most exciting game of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   This might be Reeves' best coaching job ever. He has taken a
group that was 3-13 two years ago and placed it in Super Bowl
XXXIII. By comparisons, his teams in Denver and New York had
considerably more talent than Reeves inherited in Atlanta in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And it Atlanta's most memorable season, Reeves had
quadruple-bypass surgery in December. Showing some of the toughness
Reeves displayed during his playing days in Dallas, he was on his
feet in less than a week, telling reporters of his desire to coach
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Reeves' sudden hospitalization stunned his former
coach. Landry, 74, spoke to Reeves two weeks ago to make sure his
former assistant was not rushing back to football too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This was not just another knee injury, Landry told his former
pupil. There are times when rest is the best medicine a workaholic
coach canswallow.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves assured Landry that the heart surgery went well and he
feels great. He did not want to miss the most exciting finish in
Atlanta Falcons history.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' health was put to the test in the thriller over the
Vikings. Landry, who stays in contact with two of his former
players _ Reeves and New Orleans Sainrs coach Mike Ditka _ admits
he was ``surprised'' by Atlanta's latest victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have advanced to their toughest test of the year,
and Landry promises to watch Super Bowl XXXIII from his Dallas
home. Denver is a seven-point favorite to knock off the Falcons,
but at least one interested viewer gives Atlanta a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by anything Dan's teams do anymore,'' Landry
said.

MAZDA PROTEGE _ WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT ALL YOU GET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love sleepers.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about trains here. Nor those ``good bets''
lurking deep in the draw of the NCAA Basketball Tournament brackets
_ even though I'm fond of both of those, too.
</P>
<P>
   The sleepers in question today are ones I've loved since I was a
kid: cars that have a bit more power lurking under their
unprepossessing hoods than you'd suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 1999 Mazda Protege ES.
</P>
<P>
   I did _ even though it was for a far shorter time that I would
have liked.
</P>
<P>
   A sleeper?
</P>
<P>
   It looks like something my mom would drive _ slowly. It also
looked like a car she'd keep cleaned and waxed and be able to drive
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. G looked it over. Granted, it didn't look like much,
sitting there covered with salt and road grime after a week of
sloppy weather. It didn't take long for that first impression:
``It's a nice enough little car, but it doesn't have much
personality. Give me my Jag any time.''
</P>
<P>
   She isn't really going highbrow. She drives an '88 rust-infested
Jag of which John White advises: ``Make it into a lawn sculpture;
after all, it's the right shade of green.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this Mazda is the right shade of green, too. A nice paint
job was resting under all that salt.
</P>
<P>
   A little personality, too.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle was powered by Mazda's 1.8-liter, 122-horsepower
four-cylinder engine. We didn't take out the stopwatch, but this
gem sure seemed to get to 60 very quickly, the hornets' nest under
the hood revving quickly to just under 6000 rpm before smoothly
shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first excursion wasn't nearly that exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Globe, we were stuck in city traffic for 40 minutes,
enough time to check out the intricacies of the radio-CD player. It
had a nice sound, and also offered a neat CD storage compartment
(with door) directly under the radio. Best of all, the unit's
controls were pretty much self-explanatory.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been my contention that the owner's manual will
yield at least one interesting nugget of information.
</P>
<P>
   This manual's gem was the Auto/M button on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Hit ``auto'' in a strange area and the radio will automatically
seek out and temporarily store as presets the six strongest
stations on the AM and both FM bands. Turn back to Auto/ manual and
your original presets are still there. I'm not an audiophile, but
this seemed like a neat touch.
</P>
<P>
   The sticker wasn't anywhere to be found, not in the spacious
door storage areas, the average-sized glove box or the small area
under the armrest.
</P>
<P>
   So we went to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $14,925, the ES package, automatic
transmission, and sound system pushed the total sticker to $17,775,
maybe not a bargain, but a fair price for a well-equipped car that
packs a ton of performance. Included in all that was cruise
control, air conditioning, power door locks (with keyless remote
entry) and 15-inch aluminum alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never had the experience of keyless entry, you're
missing one of life's little pleasures, one you'll never want to
skip again. I'm hooked. No more fumbling with keys. Just hit the
remote once to unlock the driver's door and a second time to unlock
the other three doors.
</P>
<P>
   Another neat little engineering twist is the cup holder. There's
a little storage area under the heater controls (they're the dial
type). The edge of the storage area is a spring-loaded retainer
that you flip over to create a double cupholder. Of course, if
you're like me, you generally arrive at your destination with
coffee spots on your clothes through no fault of the cupholder.
</P>
<P>
   Staying on the inside, there's adequate room in back, and the
front seats not only were comfortable but had plenty of lumbar
support for a lower back aching mightily from moving snow not only
from my own driveway, but from chopping number one son's Sable out
of a giant frozen ice block where it had been plowed in at the
Wonderland T lot.
</P>
<P>
   Once out on the road, the Protege's power steering has a solid
feel, matching the suspension. Both might be a little harder than
average, but they're perfectly matched to the car's performance
characteristics. The Protege crisply obeyed a quick avoidance
maneuver on Route 93 north, dodging a bumper and trail of debris
from a just-happened accident in the wee hours of Martin Luther
King Day.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have the car long enough to check the mileage
properly, but the projected 26 city, 30 highway, seemed, if
anything, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   For one _ and the only _ thing, the door handles. They're too
short to provide enough purchase for proper opening. The handle
generally slipped out of my grip on the first try, then opened fine
on the second attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, this car gets you where you're going fast enough
to allow plenty of time for fiddling with a door.

THE SECRET OF PRESIDENTIAL SURVIVABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does he do it? How does Bill Clinton take just about the
worst thing that can happen to a president of the United States _
impeachment _ and turn it into a 76 percent job approval rating?
</P>
<P>
   That's the score he racked up in an NBC poll after delivering
his State of the Union address Tuesday night. If the poll truly
reflects public opinion in this country, it means that even as the
president stands trial in the Senate on articles of impeachment
voted by the House of Representatives, three out of every four
Americans are pleased as punch with the job he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't like Clinton and would like nothing better than
to see his Senate trial end with conviction and removal from office
want to believe that the polls are rigged _ that either the
pollsters are misrepresenting public opinion or the public is being
duped by trick questions that produce pro-Clinton answers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash, folks: The polls aren't fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans _ even those who believe that Clinton is
ethically and morally inadequate _ are perfectly satisfied with the
job he's doing as president. The same polls that placed Clinton's
job approval in the mid-60s to mid-70s suggested that at least 60
percent of Americans do not want him removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that such numbers would discourage the
anti-Clinton forces in their relentless campaign to drive him out
of the White House. But it seems that the more the public supports
the president, the more desperate his enemies are to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to withstand their attacks makes the
Clinton-haters hate him all the more, which drives them to
intensify their attacks on him, which drives his approval ratings
ever higher, which drives the attackers ever crazier.
</P>
<P>
   None of which answers the question: How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Clinton's State of the Union speech was a triumph
of spine-tingling rhetoric. It was basically a 77-minute grab bag
of policy proposals, delivered less in the manner of a thoughtful
statesman addressing the nation's future than in the style of a
flashy carnival barker promising spectacular prizes in a ring-toss
game that any fool can see is unwinnable.
</P>
<P>
   Surely those 76 percent of Americans who think Clinton is doing
a great job don't imagine that he will deliver all the goodies he
offered in his something-for-everyone speech.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to save Social Security and Medicare, reform public
education, solve the race problem, improve health care, increase
the minimum wage, clean up the environment, crack down on crime and
reinvigorate the national defense.
</P>
<P>
   And he was just warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he survives his impeachment trial in the Senate, Clinton
will be in no position to push such an aggressive agenda through a
hostile Congress. Heck, he couldn't turn most of his ideas into
legislation before he was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   So. If most Americans know that Clinton is a scoundrel _ the
polls say they are well aware of his deficiencies _ and they also
know that he can't do all the wonderful things he wants to do, why
do they keep propping him up?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guess: It's because they actually believe that he cares
about them and their problems. Even this week, as his lawyers were
ferociously battling in the Senate to save his presidency, Clinton
spent his time focusing on the country and on the needs of its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who don't trust Clinton as far we can throw him
could argue all day long that his devotion to ``real'' issues and
``real'' problems is a ploy _ that it's merely another
manifestation of the con-man charisma that has defined his
presidency from the start. But we'd be wasting our breath.
</P>
<P>
   If people believe that he's sincere, it doesn't matter if he is
or he isn't. Perception is reality _ and countless numbers of
Americans perceive that Clinton cares about them.
</P>
<P>
   They have a right to their perception. And they have a right to
see their president finish the four-year term he won in the 1996
election.

GRAND MARQUIS IS BIG AND COMFY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the last big, traditional American sedans, the Mercury
Grand Marquis, is back for 1999, fresh from an update that brought
a more aerodynamic shape and other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes for the '98 models were new front and rear
fascias, bumpers, grille, hood, deck lid, moldings, park and
turn-signal lights, tail lights and outside mirrors. Sixteen-inch
wheels became standard, second-generation air bags were added, and
the car got a new rear suspension system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster have gone away,
the last big rear-drive sedans left in this class are the Grand
Marquis and its Ford counterpart, the Crown Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lincoln-Mercury dealers sold nearly 110,000 of the Grand
Marquis last year, the vehicle will probably remain in production
for a while; but don't expect them to last much longer. These big
cars will eventually go away, to be replaced by smaller and more
fuel-efficient models (just like Chevy's new Impala, unveiled this
month at the Detroit auto show).
</P>
<P>
   If you really want one, now might be the time to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Marquis reminds baby boomers what cars were like when
we were growing up. Ford understands that the Crown Vic and Grand
Marquis appeal more to our parents than to us, describing the
vehicle as roomy enough to ``take the grandkids to a burger joint
and still feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is plenty big enough for six adults to stretch out
comfortably, which is tough to do in most other sedans. The trunk
is cavernous, too. A whopping 20.6 cubic feet is available to store
whatever you'd like to take with you on a cross-country cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Marquis comes only with a V-8 engine. The base
4.6-liter single-overhead-cam engine cranks out 200 horsepower and
275 foot-pounds of torque; a dual-exhaust upgrade raises that to
215 horsepower. The engine is connected to a smooth-shifting
four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive; no manual gearbox
is offered.
</P>
<P>
   When you're behind the wheel, the Grand Marquis doesn't feel
like the big boat that it is; it handles pretty well for such a
large vehicle. Still, road handling isn't what a car like this is
all about, so don't expect something that will thrill you on
winding mountain roads. The Grand Marquis is at its best doing 70
mph down the interstate with the cruise control set and Big Band
music playing on the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest putting your teen-age children in one of these
as a first car; it's one of the safest vehicles on the road. It
garnered a five-star rating in U.S. government crash tests, ranking
best in class for front-seat occupant safety.
</P>
<P>
   These vehicles don't come cheap, though. The base GS model
starts at $22,220 (plus $605 transportation); our test vehicle, the
uplevel LS model, lists for $24,120 plus transportation.
</P>
<P>
   For that money, the LS comes with power four-wheel disc brakes,
manual air- conditioning, speed-sensitive power steering, keyless
entry, dual power mirrors, rear-window defroster, cruise control,
tilt steering wheel, AM/FM/cassette stereo, power windows and door
locks, eight-way power adjustable driver's seat, luxury cloth
interior, cornering lamps and an automatic parking-brake release.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with some options that ran the final sticker
up to $28,745, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ultimate Package'' ($2,400) added electronic instruments,
dual eight-way power seats, antilock brakes, automatic climate
control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, premium AM/FM/cassette
stereo, an electric auto-dim rearview mirror with digital compass
(''Do I go left or right for north, dear?''), and lacy spoke
aluminum wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our vehicle included leather seats ($735),
trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer ($350), and a handling package
($535) that brought a 3.27 ratio axle, dual exhaust system (this
gave our car the extra 15 horsepower) and rear air suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is a lot better than that of the big cars of the
'60s and '70s. EPA estimates for the Grand Marquis are 17 miles per
gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. With its 19-gallon
gas tank, the vehicle has a range of up to 450 miles.
</P>
<P>
   SILVERADO IS TOP TRUCK: The Texas Auto Writers Association named
the all-new Chevrolet Silverado the ``best truck of Texas'' for
model year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup won the top honor among 10 awards made by the auto
writers group after testing of 50 trucks and specialty vehicles on
highway, city and off-road courses in Granbury during last
October's Texas Truck Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the best overall truck honor, the Silverado tied with
its clone, the GMC Sierra, as best large pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the other categories and award winners:
</P>
<P>
   _Best off-road vehicle: Land Rover Discovery II.
</P>
<P>
   _Best luxury sport-utility vehicle: Lexus LX 470.
</P>
<P>
   _Best large sport-utility: Toyota Land Cruiser (a clone of the
Lexus LX 470).
</P>
<P>
   _Best new vehicle and best medium sport-utility: Jeep Grand
Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   _Best small sport-utility: Isuzu Amigo.
</P>
<P>
   _Best compact pickup: Dodge Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   _Best specialty/all-wheel-drive vehicle: Mercedes-Benz E320 S
wagon.

   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, six-passenger, V-8 powered,
rear-drive sedan, which was updated last year along with its Ford
counterpart, the Crown Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: The Grand Marquis and Crown Vic are the last gasp

<P>
   NEGATIVES: There is nothing sporty or youthful about these cars,
which feel more like police cars and taxicabs than modern family
cars; prices are steep, especially when the most popular options
are added; but they do fill their niche nicely.

<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Chrysler LHS, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler
Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, Buick Park Avenue, Pontiac Bonneville,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Health information abounds on the Internet, sometimes making it
difficult for the public to find useful, accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   To make this job a bit easier, Medical Tribune News Service
highlights three helpful sites this week.
</P>
<P>
   MEDLINEPLUS
</P>
<P>
   http://medlineplus.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/
</P>
<P>
   For the health consumer who wants to go directly to original
research on a particular topic, MEDLINEPLUS is invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides easy-to-follow links to search the National
Library of Medicine's huge database of journal articles as well as
links to a variety of other helpful information.
</P>
<P>
   Once you go to the site, you are presented with a list of
medical subjects, from AIDS to menopause to urinary incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Click on obesity, for example, and you'll be given links to a
Body Mass Index Chart, courtesy of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute; a physical activity and heart disease IQ test,
also courtesy of the NHLBI; and the Weight-control Information
Network's list of the health risks of being overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Click on obesity again and you'll get a listing of the latest
research from 3,900 biomedical journals.
</P>
<P>
   If the subject you're interested in isn't on the list, click on
the word MEDLINE for programs designed to search the journals for
your topic.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the site contains links to dictionaries for
defining medical terms, medical clearinghouses and organizations
devoted to consumer health.
</P>
<P>
   American Medical Association
</P>
<P>
   http://www.ama-assn.org/
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association (AMA) site is a curious mix of
consumer-oriented health information and doctor politics.
</P>
<P>
   On the home page, for example, there is a link to an explanation
by the AMA's president of why the Journal of the American Medical
Association dumped its editor after he ``interjected JAMA into a
major political debate that had nothing to do with science or
medicine'' by publishing an article that looked at what American's
mean when they say they've ``had sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting juxtaposition, the association's webmaster
placed next to this link a pointer to a document entitled the
``AMA's response to the State of the Union Address.''
</P>
<P>
   For members of the general public interested in health
information, the site provides links to JAMA itself and a variety
of health topics, including women's health, men's health and HIV. A
rotating weekly section discusses a health topic tied to a recent
JAMA article.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the women's health section, for example, and you will
be offered a choice of links to abstracts from the latest medical
literature, top news stories, and information on sexually
transmitted diseases and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the information here is written for the lay person,
while some is highly technical. For example, most of the guidelines
on screening and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases are
lifted directly from Center's for Disease Control and Prevention
Bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's health section, layperson-friendly articles
describe diagnosis and treatment for a variety of conditions,
including benign prostatic hyperplasia and abdominal hernias.
</P>
<P>
   Center for Narcolepsy at the Stanford University School of
Medicine
</P>
<P>
   http://www-med.stanford.edu/school/Psychiatry/narcolepsy/
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of those people who feels constantly tired and
sleepy, you might want to check out the Center for Narcolepsy's
site. Although experts estimate that one in 2,000 people suffer
from this sleep disorder, many do not get diagnosed until many
years after symptoms first appear.
</P>
<P>
   The site contains lay-person friendly descriptions of narcolepsy
symptoms as well as detailed information on drug therapies and the
latest research into the neurochemical causes of narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the topic of research are the latest theories of what goes
wrong in patients with narcolepsy. Discussions are somewhat
technical, but understandable with a medical dictionary.

CHIP PRICING WAR PLEASES CONSUMERS

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the key reasons why personal computers have become so
inexpensive is that the brains within these brains have become much
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessor makers are engaged in a power and price war.
Advanced Micro Devices, with its K6-2 chip, and National
Semiconductor/Cyrix, with its MII processor, are doing battle with
the king of the hill, Intel Corp. In response to those powerful,
low-cost chips, Intel has started selling the Celeron, a variation
of its Pentium II design.
</P>
<P>
   What this means for you, the cash-strapped PC buyer, is that
computers that would have sold a year ago for $2,500-$3,000 are now
going for $900-$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two machines that use different, budget chips.
The amount of bang for the buck is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5190, $1,500, Compaq Computer Corp.: Inside this
mid-priced, mini-tower PC is an AMD K6-2 chip running at 400
megahertz. The K6-2 has some extra code for improving 3-D graphics
and sound called 3D Now!
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that would make this an excellent gamer's machine _
provided the programs being used take advantage of 3D Now! Not all
do.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the machine has plenty of muscle. There's the chip,
which is AMD's fastest so far. It sits on a motherboard that can
pass data to the chip at 100 megahertz. There's a generous 128
megabytes of memory; a 12-gigabyte hard drive; a built-in Iomega
Zip drive; a DVD-ROM drive; a 56K fax modem; an ATI Rage LT Pro
graphics card with four megabytes of video memory; a built-in
Ethernet connection for home networking; Aureal 3D positional
sound; and a connection for a digital flat panel display.
</P>
<P>
   I used this with a 17-inch Presario MV700 monitor, which sells
for only $400.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a system that can handle any kind of software you
want to throw at it, ranging from envelope-pushing 3-D games to
bloatware office suites to Web browsers to graphics editing
programs. It will be a long time before you feel limited in your
capabilities with this system.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of exceptions, it's a well-designed system. The
Universal Serial Bus ports are on the front of the 5190, which is
smart, because the whole point of USB is convenient connection of
devices. Most manufacturers put these ports on the back of the
case, making it hard to get to.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has put the graphics adapter on a removable board in an
AGP slot, rather than as a chip on the motherboard. While the ATI
Rage Pro is a decent card, it's not the best out there, but with
this design it can be easily replaced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pavilion 4450, $900, Hewlett-Packard:  &UR;  &LR; Sub-$1,000 computers
continue to improve as demand for them grows. Computer makers get
smarter about designing them with each product cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard has opted to go with Intel's 366-megahertz
Celeron processor. The Celeron chips, while zippy, run on
motherboards capable of transmitting data only at 66 megahertz.
That makes them less desirable for higher-end applications and
state-of-the-art games.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion comes with 64 mebabytes of system memory; a
6.4-gigabyte hard drive; a 32X CD-ROM drive; a 56K fax modem; an
ATI RagePro Turbo video card with 4 megabytes of video memory; and
3-D audio. I tried the 15-inch M50 monitor, which provided an
adequate display at 640-by-480 and 800-by-600 pixel resolution, but
had an annoying flicker at 1,024-by-768.
</P>
<P>
   These specifications are less than the Presario, which costs
almost twice as much. But the Presario doesn't run basic home PC
software noticeably faster.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you begin to demand more of your computer that the
limitations in the Pavilion will show up. If you are the kind of
user who has a Web browser, a word processor and a spreadsheet
going all at once _ and throw in e-mail and maybe a music CD as
well _ then the Pavilion will bog down in performance faster than
the Presario will.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this is an excellent system for low-impact home
use. It's also fairly well designed, though it lacks some of the
nice touches of the Presario.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion has three open slots _ AGP, PCI and ISA. The
graphics adapter is built into the motherboard, but the AGP slot
lets you upgrade the graphics card. You don't have to pull anything
out _ just pop a new card in, and it automatically turns off the
onboard video.
</P>
<P>
   The case is quite small, with an even tinier footprint than the
Presario, and as a result it's fairly cramped inside. I had to
remove the cable for the floppy drive before I could insert a
full-length card in the PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   I have two minor complaints about this system. It's the second
low-cost HP model I've tried with a very noisy fan. It's very
distracting, and it doesn't need to be that way. Quieter fans don't
add that much cost to a system.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the Compaq, the USB connectors are on the back of
the unit. Come on, HP _ move 'em up front!

U.S. CATHOLICS LOOK FORWARD TO VISIT BY POPE, BUT MANY QUESTION HIS
POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATTHEW BRADY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next week, hundreds of thousands of people will crowd the
streets of St. Louis to welcome Pope John Paul II to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But although the pope is widely respected and beloved in the
United States, he is also widely viewed as the chief obstacle to
changes American Catholics would like to see in the church.
</P>
<P>
   That the pontiff finds American excess distasteful is no secret.
He has criticized U.S. military missions in the Persian Gulf and
described Western society as a ``culture of death'' because of its
leanings toward abortion and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American Catholics chafe under what they consider
John Paul II's authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who admire a lot of things about
this pope _ his deep personal piety, the role he has played on the
world stage,'' said John Allen, opinion editor for National
Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper based in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, it is also clear that there is a deep sense
that there are some reforms in the internal life of the church that
are long overdue and that this pope has resisted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of observers such as Allen, chief among those
reforms are more inclusive roles for women in the church, increased
freedom to debate church doctrine and increased decision-making
power for local parishes.
</P>
<P>
   But those reforms are unlikely to take place under John Paul II.
Although in form, he is among the most progressive popes in history
_ snow-skiing before health problems forbade it, jetting around the
world, granting an audience to folk/rock star Bob Dylan _ in
substance, John Paul II is stubbornly traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Two events last year highlighted John Paul II's approach.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he issued an apostolic letter tightening restrictions
on theological debate. The letter, titled Ad Tuendam Fidem (''To
Defend the Faith''), outlined penalties ranging up to
excommunication for theologians who questioned church teachings
such as the nonordination of women or abstinence before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, his staff overruled translations of
liturgical texts by U.S. bishops. Critics say it was an effort to
stop gender-neutral language from creeping into the liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that he has clearly taken stances on certain
issues,'' Allen said. ``He has not allowed conversation to continue
about it. That is incredibly frustrating to people who do not
regard it as a closed issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allen and other observers acknowledge that, in many ways,
the pope plays a valuable role. In a world in which the United
States often is seen as the playground bully, doing whatever it
wants whenever it wants, Pope John Paul II has made it clear that
American Catholics are but a fraction _ less than 74 million _ of a
church that counts over 1 billion members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we Americans look myopically at the world through
our American lens,'' said Charles Curran, Scurlock professor of
human values at Southern Methodist University. ``I think it is very
helpful to have our position criticized. We've got to recognize
that the church is bigger than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Curran said John Paul II has often achieved uniformity at the
expense of unity, but noted that struggling to strike a balance is
not a problem unique to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize there have always been tensions in the
church and there always will be,'' Curran said. ``Perhaps the
challenge, which is a very significant challenge, is, `How do we
achieve unity amid so much diversity in the world?' This is not
only a problem for the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church,
it is a problem for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, if the Christian Church can't accomplish it, no
one can.''
</P>

CHOOSING THE RIGHT SHOWER HEAD

 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The shower head has become a state-of-the-art
fixture in most homes and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a shower to a bath, you can now select from a
large variety of shower heads, from water-saving and pulsating
water-massage models to safety anti-scald devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time people want a hand-held shower head or a
larger hotel-style shower head that's made of heavy-duty
chrome-plate or brass,'' said Rick DeFries, vice president and
co-owner of Shaker Ace Hardware in Latham, N.Y. ``Most people look
for models that they can get as much water out of as possible,
whether it's in a fine or heavy spray. Personally, I find that the
heavier-weight showerheads and those of solid brass are the most
dependable.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFries said some plastic is basically more resistant to mineral
build-up than shower heads made of metal or inferior plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shower heads made of the newer Ceylon pale gray-colored
plastic have less of a tendency to clog up,'' he said. ``But if
you've purchased a shower head that does get clogged up,
restricting water flow, just soak it in any lime-away product or a
50/50 solution of vinegar and warm water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live in an area where there is a high sediment content,
you should clean your shower head on a regular basis to maintain
its high performance,'' he said. ``Any little bit of grit will play
havoc with a shower head.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent burns in the shower, place an anti-scald adapter
between the shower arm and the showerhead. A thin metallic wafer in
the adapter expands at a certain temperature and shuts the water
off if it gets too hot. Anti-scald adapters cost $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   WaterPik makes a showerhead with a 15-inch adjustable snake-like
arm, and claiming to have 124 spray channels, for $53.99 that also
features a pause function to save water while soaping up and
briefly stepping out of the spray.
</P>
<P>
   Shower heads with anywhere from one to six settings cost
approximately $6 to $60 _ and up to $500 in the designer range. A
brass showerhead with adjustable spray sells for $28.99, and a
shower massage model with five settings costs around $55.

CHIP PRICING WAR PLEASES CONSUMERS

   One of the key reasons why personal computers have become so
inexpensive is that the brains within these brains have become much
cheaper.

<P>
   Microprocessor makers are engaged in a power and price war.
Advanced Micro Devices, with its K6-2 chip, and National
Semiconductor/Cyrix, with its MII processor, are doing battle with
the king of the hill, Intel Corp. In response to those powerful,
low-cost chips, Intel has started selling the Celeron, a variation
of its Pentium II design.

LET CLINTON HAVE HIS `VICTORY'

<P>
   It's over. The votes aren't there for conviction. They're never
going to be there. Those of us who thought the US Senate might
recoil at the prospect of allowing Clinton's conduct to set the
standard for public service in the future were wrong. Those of us
who believed that principled people in the Democratic Party would
draw the line at immoral behavior and illegal acts were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who thought a sense of shame might cause Clinton to
resign for the good of the country were wrong. What we failed to
appreciate was the breadth of Clinton's cynicism and the
willingness of his supporters to enable its political success.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Clinton is a liar. Everyone knows that he
repeatedly committed perjury under oath. Everyone knows that he
engaged in a months-long effort to delay and obstruct the
administration of justice. And everybody knows, because of
lock-step Democratic partisanship, that he will not be convicted of
these crimes.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. Rather than whine about the outcome, Republicans
should simply walk away from it. Let Clinton and his supporters
have their ``victory.'' Let him break out the drums and the unlit
cigar, as he did after the Paula Jones case was dismissed. Let his
enablers write the resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Let them explain why his disgrace and dishonor do not merit his
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should demand an up-or-down vote on conviction on
Monday. If a majority of senators vote to convict, but a two-thirds
majority cannot be attained, then the record will be clear. History
will show that the House impeached Clinton and that a majority of
senators validated that finding. Clinton will not be removed from
office, but the stain on his presidency will be indelible.
</P>
<P>
   Once the vote is taken, Republicans should immediately disengage
from the politics of impeachment. Clinton is entirely dependent on
enemies, real and imagined. They are the essential ingredients of
his political survival. Deny him his enemies and all that remains
is his shamelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Having undertaken an honorable but unpopular cause, Republicans
should return to basic issues of governance. They might start by
giving an honest accounting of the nation's finances. Last year,
the federal budget deficit rose from $5.486 trillion to $5.618
trillion, an increase of $132 billion. At the same time, Social
Security receipts rose by $200 billion, a function of baby-boom
demographics and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the two together, Clinton proclaims budget surpluses for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who participate in this delusion lend credence to a
lie. Tax cut proposals and promises of plenty only further that
delusion. Voters will never take seriously politicians who are
manifestly unserious. Why bother with the moving expenses if the
net result is the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Republicans have lacked a serious government
agenda since the political collapse of House Speaker Newt Gingrich
in 1995. They have articulated no substantive plan to save Social
Security, fix Medicare, enhance economic growth, improve education
or better provide for the national security. As a result, their
pursuit of Clinton has been recast as their defining purpose.
Absent a substantive GOP agenda, Clinton has been able to assert
that only he cares about ``the people's business.'' He couldn't
care less, of course. Since the Lewinsky scandal erupted one year
ago, Clinton has tailored his entire administration toward the
furtherance of just one goal: beating the rap. Tuesday's State of
the Union Address was crafted for a single purpose: preventing his
conviction in the Senate. Once he is acquitted, most if not all of
the agenda he outlined will never be mentioned again.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans do not fill this void with substance, then
their political circumstances will further deteriorate. The truth
is that Clinton has won a crucial battle. He has convinced the
electorate that politicians and the political process are corrupt.
He has made ``the politics of personal destruction'' a fact of
modern life. He has made cynicism the state of political art.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cannot compete with Clinton at this level of the
game. They don't know how and their constituencies wouldn't abide
it even if they did.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's only hope is to return to the principles that have
long guided their path; smaller government, greater individual
freedoms, free trade and a commitment to an internationalist
foreign policy. The sooner they develop a serious and substantive
agenda, the quicker they'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans can take pride in their case against Clinton. They
were right to pursue it, despite the political cost. They stood on
principle, which is what matters in the end. Now they must make the
case for themselves.

THE NIGHT THE GIRLS WENT OUT TO PLAY (AND THE BOYS RAN AWAY) 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 24) 
(JT) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My answering machine heard it first: ``Hi! I'm Lucy's maid of
honor. She said the party's up to us, but she definitely wants to
kiss some boys in a bar, and she also wants a stripper, so we're
all chipping in to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the stuff of bachelor parties: naked women
bursting from cakes, stag films, drunken toasts. Bachelorette
parties, on the other hand, have a reputation for cosmopolitans and
frilly lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   But in a spirit of equality of the sexes, bachelorette parties
seem to be getting more debauched. I have heard of bridesmaids
shopping for sex toys and of parties where women play ``truth or
dare'' in a bar, asking strange men to eat the candy necklaces from
their throats.
</P>
<P>
   And so it happened that we were going to have a stripper at
Lucy's party. But where to hold it? Nobody in our group of
20-something women wanted a strange naked man in her apartment. And
the yuppie bars of the Upper West Side that we asked to play host
to our event turned us down. Offended bar managers hung up on the
maid of honor. ``It was as if I was some kind of pervert,'' she
said. Finally, a dive in the neighborhood said there was room at
the inn. Passing a stuffed bear near the entrance, we found a nook
of tables where we watched Lucy open tasteless gifts, while
awaiting HIS arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The stripper turned out to be a bronzed, pectorally gifted
specimen of Australian descent, complete with business cards that
said ``The Thunder From Down Under.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads turned. Men blushed. Women befriended us. The bride acted
surprised, insisting she'd never requested a stripper. The Thunder
unbuttoned things. He performed suggestive push-ups, then held Lucy
aloft, whispering in her ear.
</P>
<P>
   He gyrated over and asked me to dance. But who wants to lose a
good chair in a crowded bar? I hesitated. He did acrobatics with
the other guests, then looked at me pointedly. What kind of party
pooper was I? A grown man flouncing in leopard underpants was
managing to make me feel ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   So I let the boy toy twirl me around. He inched close and
whispered, ``Now I've got you going.''
</P>
<P>
   That was his sultry spiel? It couldn't have been half as good as
what he kept murmuring to the bride.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his act, he asked where we were going next.
Dancing, we answered, but didn't say where. The guy was fun, but he
got naked for a living.
</P>
<P>
   We were distracted by the last few minutes of a ball game on the
wide-screen television. I spotted our stripper alone in the corner.
Sweaty and a bit disheveled, he started collecting his belt, socks
and undershirt. Bought, paid for and discarded.
</P>
<P>
   One bridesmaid, after discovering that she and the hired hunk
were both out-of-work actors, invited him to come out with us. He
said he'd have to go home and change first. His trousers were
special stripper's pants with Velcro in lieu of seams. He'd feel
embarrassed wearing them dancing. We lied and told him they looked
normal. He seemed skeptical and never did show up.
</P>
<P>
   At the club, Lucy thought we ought to find kissing partners for
her. This didn't seem terribly hygienic. But more remarkable was
the male reaction. Several asked, ``How many men has she kissed so
far?'' One said, ``I'll only do it if I'm the first.'' Had this
bar-hopper cruising for women been reading Victorian novels? We
just wanted the pure stupid fun we heard the bridegroom's men would
be having. And we wanted it without the guilt. But it was not to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I asked Lucy about the titillating nothings I'd seen
Thunder whispering in her ear. She laughed. ``He kept asking me if
I felt comfortable,'' she said. ``He kept saying, `If any of this
makes you uncomfortable I can stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. I didn't realize strippers were now politically correct.
Was it possible to harass someone who is paying you to remove your
clothes? I tried to picture a female stripper saying those things.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a short way, baby.

HOW TO FIND THE PLANTS YOU WANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 24) 
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily, I'm a gardener of little design. The vegetables get
some advance planning, because otherwise I might forget I had
already sowed the beets and plant the beans right over the top of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But flower gardens tend just to happen. One perennial bed is a
serendipitous mix of Siberian iris, Russian sage, Carpathian
bellflower and Turk's-cap lily, melded together with drifts of
coral bells, sweet woodruff and forget-me-nots. Most of the plants
were rescued from a garden center's discount shelf at the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   A professional designer looks at a garden site, envisions what
it could be, and draws up a list of ideal plants. I look at a plant
in a pot, envision it in the ground somewhere, and go looking for a
place to dig a hole. Garden designers aim for a tapestry effect; my
garden tends more toward sampler. The new raised deck has a
clematis planted at the base of each supporting post, and each
clematis is a different color.
</P>
<P>
   Nuances of flower and foliage inspire collectors, but in the
grand scheme of my oversize yard, these are of secondary
importance. As far as I'm concerned, all hardy azaleas are created
equal, and a day lily of any color or season of bloom is a day lily
worth having. My motto is that if you can't plant what you want _
or you don't know what you want _ plant what you can get. It would
probably sound better in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is occasionally necessary to find a specific
plant, usually at the request of someone else. I'm on the mailing
lists of dozens of nurseries and seed houses, which makes me
something of a neighborhood research facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the sleuthing is easy, but often it is not, especially
when the request comes in something like this: ``I want a shrub
like the one Mrs. Phillips has in her front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for further information, the plant-seeker recalls that
the shrub blooms in the late spring, with pink flowers, and that
its leaves turn color in the autumn. What color? ``I forget.''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to Mrs. Phillips' yard finds a Kerria japonica, which has
yellow flowers in early spring, and foliage that does not change
color in autumn. Was the plant-seeker thinking, perhaps, of someone
else's yard? ``Oh, no, that's the one. I just forgot what color the
flowers were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrias are easily acquired, once identified. More troublesome
was a yellow-flowered lilac, tracked down at a wholesale nursery in
the Pacific Northwest that sold them only in groups of 10, at a
price that made the idea of an entire hedge of yellow-flowered
lilacs unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   An orange-flowered rhododendron like the one outside the local
bank could not be identified by cultivar, but the bank people are
friendly and granted permission for a few cuttings to be taken for
propagation purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This business of finding plants used to be more difficult.
Tracking down a specific cultivar, especially on the basis of a
sketchy description, required several large botanical reference
books, a shelf of catalogs and many long-distance telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the results were hardly guaranteed. A catalog might
describe a particular hibiscus as having lavender blossoms with
rose-colored throats, but the plant itself, once procured, planted
and brought to bloom, might decide that its flowers should be
magenta. This is yet another reason to love what you can get,
rather than yearn for that which you do not have.
</P>
<P>
   At least now, thanks to the humming computer and the Internet,
plant detective work is somewhat easier. The better nurseries even
flash full-color pictures of their wares, the better to tell if
that's really the Euonymus of your dreams or the precise shade of
salmon-apricot-pink azalea needed to set off the house's new
Victorian paint job.
</P>
<P>
   Some quarry remains elusive. Several months ago, I went
cybersearching for a vegetable called crosnes (pronounced crone, as
in a Shakespearean hag) _ a creamy white tuber that looks a bit
like a potato but is wrinkled rather than smooth. It is popular in
Europe, where it is often served creamed, and in Asia, where it is
frequently pickled. A friend had spotted a pile of crosnes in a
grocery store in New Zealand, but was not served any.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary book research turned up its full common name,
crosnes du Japon, although it is' also called Chinese artichoke,
Japanese artichoke and knotroot. Its botanical name is Stachys
affina, although it is' sometimes also listed under Stachys
sieboldii.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a perennial, but that may be because some of the
tubers would naturally escape being harvested. In that sense, it
would be like a Jerusalem artichoke, which isn't an artichoke
either, but another tuberous vegetable that, once planted, is
difficult to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search for Stachys affina, by entering that phrase
in the usual search engines like Yahoo and Alta Vista, turned up
nothing. A search for crosnes found dozens of informative pages,
including recipes for crosnes salad with salsify, crosnes with
bechamel sauce and many others. Unfortunately, all of the pages
were written in French, which I recognize when I see it but do not
read.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to my reliable, if old-fashioned, shelf of catalogs,
and there I found crosnes, listed as Chinese artichokes, in the
estimable catalog from Richter's, herb specialists from Canada
(Goodwood, Ontario, L0C 1A0; 905 640-6677).
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the fine print says the tubers may be shipped only to
Canadians. I will have to be content with Jerusalem artichokes.

CALIFORNIA PANEL FOULS THE AIR WITH NEW RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board has wrought a lot of misery
in the name of clean air. Now the Specialty Equipment Market
Association, an industry group representing after-market equipment
manufacturers and suppliers to the auto industry, is suggesting
that CARB is ignoring California law in its zeal to destroy old
cars in the name of environmental correctness.
</P>
<P>
   CARB has approved regulations instituting a program to scrap
150,000 cars a year for the next 10 years to meet emissions
reduction goals, SEMA says, but has ignored California law that
dictates parts be recycled under the scrappage rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chris Kerting, SEMA vice president of government
affairs, CARB has ignored a San Diego Air Pollution Control
District pilot ``Repair/Upgrade'' program that would achieve
emissions reductions at half the cost of scrappage programs. The
repair/upgrade program allows older cars to be voluntarily
submitted for repair and installation of emissions upgrade retrofit
equipment, SEMA says, thus improving air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The scrappage-only route achieves some unwelcome goals while not
significantly changing air quality. First, it destroys a valuable
parts resource upon which the lower economic classes _ working
poor, we call them _ depend for vehicle repair. The car is
especially important in California, largely devoid of convenient
public transport, for the working poor to get and hold jobs. It
also removes from the planet the sustenance of the old-car hobby _

   The cars that are scrapped don't really subtract much dirt from
the atmosphere, SEMA contends, since they are usually vehicles that
have already expired or are on their last legs. Usually they are
replaced by old vehicles that still run and do contribute to poor
air quality _ scrappage alone can be a net loss in air quality.
</P>
<P>
   What SEMA doesn't mention _ and it bears mentioning _ is that
the scrappage program was instituted not simply to clean the air
but to gain ``pollution credits'' for industry. Such credits enable
a business to avoid installing new equipment to reduce its
emissions _ buying time with the credits _ or to make a little
extra cash selling credits it doesn't need to other polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Californians still breathe dirty air. Ever notice how
many antisocial programs are justifed as necessary for the good of
society?
</P>
<P>
   What's important for us in the East to remember is that every
daffy idea CARB floats seems to be embraced in Massachusetts, where
the lads and lasses on Beacon Hill are just as wont to lean on
motorists to take the heat off business.

<P>
   In a similar vein, consider that two Japanese companies, Honda
and Toyota, are about to field low-emissions, high-fuel-economy
hybrid vehicles in the American market. Domestic companies have
been preoccupied with the California-Massachusetts et al. mandate
to peddle electric-only autos and now find themselves one-upped _
again _ by the Japanese. With help from the California
environmental elitists, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to settle the electric car issue is to mandate that
legislators drive them exclusively during their terms _ especially
in winter.

   The year 1999 is the centennial of a celebrated automotive event
in New England, the 100th anniversary of the first ascent up Mount
Washington of an automobile. Aug. 31, 1899, Freelan Oscar Stanley
and wife, Flora, drove a spindly little Locomobile up the Carriage
Road to the top of the 6,288-foot peak, New England's tallest and
the place of possibly the freakiest weather in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Locomobile was a 4-horsepower steamer, and the trip to the
mountaintop was both a promotion for the particular make of car and
for the car in general. Freelan and twin brother Francis Edgar
Stanley had founded the steam-car company and sold it to partners
who would run it as Locomobile. Part of the deal was that the
Stanleys promote the car.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers (one a paving contractor whose company is still in
business) fell out within a year, and the Stanleys bought the
patents back and resumed building steamers under the Stanley name.
The Locomobile survived for quite a long time _ as a
gasoline-fueled internalcombustion car.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 8 is the 138th anniversary of the opening of what is now
the Mount Washington Auto Road, and on that date the centennial of
the Locomobile ascent and the opening of the then Carriage Road are
to be celebrated with a reenactment _ sort of. A Locomobile owned
by the road company will be transported to the mountaintop for a
celebration _ but real steamers will drive the route.
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine, an
unprecedented gathering for steamers at the mountain is to mark the
event _ mostly Stanleys from just about every year of production
and nearly every model variant, plus a Doble or two, Whites, a
Lane, Locomobiles, and perhaps some other makes. The steam
celebration falls between two other museum events of note, a parts
and car auction on Aug. 7 in Kingfield, and a New Hampshire
steam-car tour following the Mount Washington event.
</P>
<P>
   The public will have access to an exhibit of the steamers at the
mountain during the celebration, and the Mount Washington vehicle
collection. The steamers are to be displayed chronologically by
marque, and the museum is furnishing catalogs with technical
information on the cars to be given visitors as part of the
admission package.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the old steamers are expected to make the ascent, and
they will face the same daunting problem that Freelan and Flora
faced _ getting down again. While Stanley is believed to have used
a log drag to slow his car on the descent, the Stanleys will likely
be using tractors _ other vehicles with tow ropes _ to ease them
down the mountain. The Mount Washington Auto Road is a formidable
ascent or descent, one that some modern cars are prohibited from
attempting, and very hard on brakes; drivers are advised to rely on
the transmission to control descent speed rather than risk
overheating the brakes. But the view is worth it _ terrifying from
a car seat, but still worth it.
</P>

   The Touring Club of New England and the New England
Region-Sports Car Club of America have scheduled a winter rally for
Feb. 6. ``Snow &AMP; Ice 99'' kicks off from the Fairfield Inn,
Concord/Bow, N.H. (exit 13 off Interstate 93) at 8:30 a.m.
Saturday, Feb. 6, for a 175-mile time-speed-distance rally _ a
rally is a driving competition, not a race. Beginners are welcome.
Cost is $50 per car (two-person team), $45 for club members. For
information or resgistration, telephone rallymaster David Lewis at
978-386-2268.

RV NATION: HITTING THE ROAD AND STAYING THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By TOM CHAFFIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider them latter-day nomads. Or maybe, come to think of it,
more like venerable turtles, who carry their homes on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   They are the hundreds of thousands of elderly and retired people
who take to life on the road, spending all or much of the year
wandering around North America in assorted trailers, converted
buses, campers and motor homes.
</P>
<P>
   They are full-time RV'ers, say Dorothy Ayers Counts and her
husband, David Counts, anthropologists who have studied what's
known as recreational vehicle culture. And _ please, they add _
don't confuse RV'ers with people who live in so-called trailer
parks; the latter's houses may arrive on wheels, but once hooked-up
in a trailer park, that's the end of their travels. Exclude, too,
those whose migratory work put them in RVs. As Ms. Counts said in a
recent interview, ``We're interested in the ones who live to
travel, not those who travel to work.''
</P>
<P>
   RV'ers in North America, their numbers estimated at 1 million to
2.5 million, inhabit a sort of dispersed republic of aluminum and
rubber. The RV polity seems in many ways as vast, quirky and
diverse as any explored by Alexis de Tocqueville. Like any country,
RV republic teems with organizations. The largest RV support group,
the Good Sam Club, boasts 936,000 member families. Other groups
cater to more specific constituencies, including singles,
baby-boomers, religious denominations and retired submariners.
</P>
<P>
   Avid tent campers themselves, the Counts opened their file on
RV'ers in 1982 out of curiosity about the seemingly ubiquitous
procession of elderly and retired people sojourning in trailers
whom the couple met while traveling. For the two anthropologists,
who ended up writing ``Over the Next Hill: An Ethnography of RVing
Seniors in North America'' (Broadview Press, 1996), the stories the
RV'ers told about life on the road posed more questions than they
answered. How, for instance, do they manage finances during their
wanderings? Or get mail? And what about health care? And don't they
get lonely so far from family and friends?
</P>
<P>
   Tent-trailers, the predecessors of today's larger metal
carapaces, first appeared in the 1920s and were the conveyances of
choice among elite campers. Not until the next decade's Great
Depression, when transients began to use them, did car-campers lose
their once genteel image. Today's RV'ers are typically retired
couples who enjoy travel and owning a home but who cannot afford
both.
</P>
<P>
   Among RV'ers, how best to manage the pursuit of happiness
remains a lively debate. Some prefer developed campsites with
water, electricity and sewage hookups. Others prefer boondocking,
squatting free without the amenities in any open area, whether it
be a Kmart parking lot or a stretch of desert. Some RV'ers like to
stay put for weeks; others are afflicted by ``hitch-itch,'' the
compulsion to hitch up each day for a new destination.
</P>
<P>
   The Counts set off to research RV'ers in 1990 by renting an old
trailer for two and a half months, camping and talking with RV'ers.
A second, longer trek, in 1993-94, took them still deeper into the
RV world. In ``Over the Next Hill,'' RV'ers emerge as a proud,
often stubborn, lot who feel misunderstood, even put upon, by
immobile society. They complain about age and class prejudices: 37
percent of the 369 respondents to a project questionnaire were 66
or older, 64 percent had an annual income of $20,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever romantic affection North Americans otherwise display
for life's vagabonds falls short of RV campgrounds. RV'ers complain
that outsiders link them with a host of unsavory societal images.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Counts described most RV'ers as ``profoundly conservative
with a small c.'' The Counts admire what they call the RV'ers ``zen
affluence,'' their ability, mandated by cramped conditions, to live
with few material possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Counts, who is 61, teaches at the University of Waterloo in
Ontario. Counts, 64, teaches at nearby McMaster University. While
both balk at any suggestion that they have, in anthropological
lingo, ``gone native,'' they do readily confess to being
enthusiastic RV converts. They recently bought their second rig, a
20-foot Bigfoot fifth-wheel travel trailer. When time allows,
combining pleasure and research, the couple and Perdita, their
Great Pyrenees dog, enjoy exploring the lower 48's Great Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Why not stay in a motel? ``What people say is, if you stay at a
motel, how many friends do you make?'' Ms. Counts explained.
Devotees, she said, also feel that RVing provides a balance between
freedom and community. ``We think they are willing to extend trust
and help to other RV'ers because they are basically independent and
can move on if the commitment becomes too intense,'' she said.
``When folks get too demanding, they can turn their key and move
on.''

ROOMING WITH A GUY NAMED MOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 24) 
(JT) 
 By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen DeRosa, a co-star of the Off Broadway hit comedy ``The
Mystery of Irma Vep,'' was catching up with a few fellow alumni of
the Yale School of Drama at a midtown diner.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wound down and the others drifted off to their
various closet-slotsize apartments on Manhattan's Lower East Side
or in Brooklyn, DeRosa, 30, hopped into a ruby-red Mercury Mystique
and sped home to a four-bedroom house in Westchester that he likes
to call ``my mother's place.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it is. After finishing graduate school in
1996, DeRosa moved back to the spacious house he grew up in, to
save money while building an acting career. But three years and a
steady paycheck later, he has no plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I give up all that space to live in some rat-hole
walk-up?'' he said. He admitted that his living situation isn't
great for his love life. ``I'm left with three options,'' he said.
``Your place or yours? Your place or my car? Or say good night and
go home because there is probably food in the fridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rent can't be beat: it's free. ``It allows me to
afford the bigger necessities, like going out to dinner and
therapy,'' DeRosa said. ``Rent is money thrown away.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in their 20s and 30s are in his shoes, young
adults who have given up the privacy and independence of living on
their own to become roommates with Mom and Dad, in quarters where
the cooking is the ultimate in comfort food and the cable bill is
usually subsidized. Particularly in low-paying creative careers
like acting, publishing and music, such young people seem to
abound, as they try to maintain the amenities of well-heeled
upbringings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said: `Ah, the prodigal sons and daughters
returning. I bet there are a lot of you,''' said Elda Rotor, 28, an
associate editor at Oxford University Press, who lives with her
parents and 9-year-old brother in the building she grew up in
Manhattan. ``The doorman is usually Al, who's known me since I was
about 2,'' she said. ``I say, `Good night, Al,' and he says, `Good
night, sweetheart.' He's like an uncle. He doesn't say anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of ``boomerang kids,'' who refuse to leave the
nest even after parents have fulfilled the generational compact by
feeding and sheltering them through the college years, was first
noted by demographers in the 1980s. Census data showed that the
proportion of adult children living with their parents rose
throughout that decade, spurred by rising real estate prices (and
entry-level salaries that couldn't keep up with them), college debt
and the rising age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, the numbers have leveled off nationally. But in
high-price Eastern cities like Boston, Washington and New York
(where the market rate for a studio apartment is $1,200 to $1,800 a
month), the trend has accelerated, said Paul Attewell, a
sociologist at the Graduate School of the City University of New
York. He is studying the grown-up live-at-homes, whom he calls
``incompletely launched young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no figures are available for New York City, Attewell's
research found that in Boston, 27 percent of married couples over
35 have a child older than 21 at home. A quarter of the
live-at-homes are older than 29. Attewell said the phenomenon has
long been more common among lower-income groups but is rising among
the middle class in high-rent cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The living arrangement might even be said to be cool. Shoshanna
Lonstein, 23, a young woman about town who recently introduced a
line of lingerie that was in the windows of Bloomingdale's, lives
in her parents' Fifth Avenue apartment. And last fall, CBS
introduced the comedy ``Maggie Winters,'' starring Faith Ford as a
33-year-old divorced woman who moves back home with her mother,
played by Shirley Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge for Maggie is getting people to treat
her like an adult,'' said Kari Lizer, the executive producer. ``But
she has also realized that she really enjoys being roommates with
her mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Winters' challenge _ not only being taken seriously as an
adult, but also accepting an adult's responsibilities _ is typical
of boom-erang kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real concern among social scientists,'' Attewell said.
His research found that the living arrangement is stressful for
many parents and that when adult children finally leave the house,
their parents' lives improve because they have fewer financial and
emotional burdens. ``We worry that it is putting off a life
transition for parents, and for kids that the situation is
unhealthy because they lack the self-esteem that comes from
independence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Rotor, Elda's father, says he hopes his daughter
understands that she will not always be free to spend money she
saves on rent on fashionable accessories, like her Kate Spade bag
and leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that she is mature enough to know that it's not going
to last forever and that at some point she will have to take
responsibility for the rent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite Attewell's gloomy findings, many New York parents
with adult children at home say the arrangement works fine, in part
because the generation gap of the past is less pronounced today.

<P>
   ``There isn't the divide that there was between my generation
and my parents,'' said Lynn Nesbit, the literary agent, who shares
her Upper West Side apartment with her 27-year-old daughter, Claire
Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gilman, who is studying for a doctorate in art history at
Columbia University, has lived with her mother for five and a half
years. (Her fiance, Sasha Greenewalt, a student at Columbia's law
school, lives with his parents here.) Like many other Manhattan
natives who grew up in a cocoon of private schools and buildings
with doormen, Ms. Gilman realized in the first anxious months after
leaving college that life in a luxury apartment a block from
Central Park would be much better than ``some hole in the wall'' in
a ``not-so-good neighborhood.'' Even though she can afford her own
apartment now that she has a part-time job and an educational
grant, she chooses to continue rooming with Mom.
</P>
<P>
   It means traversing uncharted terrain, as parents and children
rewrite the rules of family living. ``When my mother says, `You
left the light on,' which is what any roommate could say, it still
feels more authoritative,'' Ms. Gilman said. When her mother
recently gave a party, Ms. Gilman was free to attend, but she felt
``shoved back'' in her room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nesbit said: ``It's almost like a role reversal. I have
opera on while she is studying and she says, `Don't play your music
so loud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University, who is
writing a book about the generation born between 1969 and 1980,
confirmed the notion that parents and their offspring in their 20s
are closer than previous generations. Living with one another, she
said, doesn't necessarily signal a failure of fledglings to leave
the nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more of a sign of a close-knit relationship than
a refusal to grow up,'' she said. ``This generation tends to feel
more respected by their parents, and parents respect their
independence. Ironically, this might make it easier for kids to
stay closer to their parents, because they don't feel that their
parents are trying to lead their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise DeRosa, Stephen's mother, said: ``I'm not like my mother.
All her focus was on her kids. Because I have always had a separate
career and life, I think that allows us to be more independent of
each other. As his roommate, I try hard not to pry into his life
and act too much like his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Many adult children who live at home say that the experience has
led to a more mature relationship with parents. ``I've become
friends with my mom as an adult, and I see her on a whole different
level,'' DeRosa said. ``A lot of people run away from home when
they want to become an adult, instead of learning to deal with the
issues as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that he and his mother now appreciate each
other's favorite television shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also runs deeper in terms of the emotional support that
we give each other,'' he said. ``If she gets worried about bills,
I'll step in and do a reality check, and if I didn't get a part,
she'll say, `Tomorrow's another day.''' Although he doesn't pay
rent, he does do his mother's taxes and manages the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Reid Maclean, 26, moved home after he spent a year living in
India studying the sitar. Living with his parents for the last
three years, he said, has let him focus on his music career, and
has taught him a new sense of responsibility to his family. ``I see
my parents getting older, and I like knowing that I'm there to help
them if they need me,'' he said. ``I've gained that Old World view
about families sticking together.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Linea Maclean, said she and her husband, Alan, love
having him around. ``He adds a youthful spirit to the house,'' she
said. His band often practices in the living room while his parents
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Jackson Stegal, a psychologist in Seattle and the author
of the 1987 book ``Boomerang Kids: How to Live With Adult Children
Who Return Home'' (Little, Brown), said that many such children
have what she calls ``narcissistic entitlement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these young adults have the feeling that they are
special, and entitled to have everything they want come without
effort on their part,'' she said. ``Parents have failed if they
raise their children to have these expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some boomerang kids feel mildly ashamed of their
situation. They are aware of the ironies and contradictions in
their lives. ``Sometimes I wonder whether I would be more
productive if I was forced to pay the rent,'' Reid Maclean said.
When James Engel, 28, goes home at night to his mother's apartment
on the Upper West Side, he recoils walking by the doorman. ``I feel
like some cocky prince walking in, saying, `My mommy lives here,'''
he said. ``I mean, I don't deserve a doorman. I haven't earned
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel, who graduated from the Dalton School and Vassar College,
was living in a tiny studio on the Lower East Side and working as a
telemarketer while struggling to become an actor. He moved back
home after being accepted to a yearlong program at the Actors
Center. ``After five years, the euphoria of independence wasn't
worth the struggle to pay rent,'' he said. ``My mother is an
artist, so she is pretty supportive. When I had to play Jerry
Seinfeld in an acting exercise, she helped me comb my wig.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children interviewed for this article said the
arrangement complicates their sex lives. When they spend the night
with a lover, it's usually at the lover's apartment. But others saw
no problem. While Engel said he and his girlfriend usually stay
over at her apartment on the Lower East Side, they sometimes stay
at his mother's and ``pretend to be Upper West Side yuppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Herschel Thompson, a graduate of the former Lenox School in
Manhattan and Vassar, was working 60-hour weeks as a
currency-trading trainee at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. when his father
died of complications from surgery in 1994. Thompson said the death
made him realize that he really wanted to become an entrepreneur
and market a device his father had invented to help people stop
smoking. He quit his job, bought a laptop computer with his credit
card and moved back into the bedroom he used as a teen-ager on the
Upper East Side, converting it into an office.
</P>
<P>
   Working from a desk built from a door and two file cabinets, he
raised $150,000 in financing. ``I'm not some trustafarian,'' he
said. ``In order to start my business, I was dependent on not
having to pay rent.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Nancy Thompson, said that living with her son has
taught both of them to see each other as adults. ``We can't hide
from each other,'' she said. ``He sees me as a person, not just as
a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson can now afford to move. ``But the second-hardest thing
in New York, next to running a business, is finding an apartment,''
he said. ``I'm just too busy to move out.''

CALIFORNIA PANEL FOULS THE AIR WITH NEW RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board has wrought a lot of misery
in the name of clean air. Now the Specialty Equipment Market
Association, an industry group representing after-market equipment
manufacturers and suppliers to the auto industry, is suggesting
that CARB is ignoring California law in its zeal to destroy old
cars in the name of environmental correctness.
</P>
<P>
   CARB has approved regulations instituting a program to scrap
150,000 cars a year for the next 10 years to meet emissions
reduction goals, SEMA says, but has ignored California law that
dictates parts be recycled under the scrappage rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chris Kerting, SEMA vice president of government
affairs, CARB has ignored a San Diego Air Pollution Control
District pilot ``Repair/Upgrade'' program that would achieve
emissions reductions at half the cost of scrappage programs. The
repair/upgrade program allows older cars to be voluntarily
submitted for repair and installation of emissions upgrade retrofit
equipment, SEMA says, thus improving air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The scrappage-only route achieves some unwelcome goals while not
significantly changing air quality. First, it destroys a valuable
parts resource upon which the lower economic classes _ working
poor, we call them _ depend for vehicle repair. The car is
especially important in California, largely devoid of convenient
public transport, for the working poor to get and hold jobs. It
also removes from the planet the sustenance of the old-car hobby _
candidates and parts for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The cars that are scrapped don't really subtract much dirt from
the atmosphere, SEMA contends, since they are usually vehicles that
have already expired or are on their last legs. Usually they are
replaced by old vehicles that still run and do contribute to poor
air quality _ scrappage alone can be a net loss in air quality.
</P>
<P>
   What SEMA doesn't mention _ and it bears mentioning _ is that
the scrappage program was instituted not simply to clean the air
but to gain ``pollution credits'' for industry. Such credits enable
a business to avoid installing new equipment to reduce its
emissions _ buying time with the credits _ or to make a little
extra cash selling credits it doesn't need to other polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Californians still breathe dirty air. Ever notice how
many antisocial programs are justifed as necessary for the good of
society?
</P>
<P>
   What's important for us in the East to remember is that every
daffy idea CARB floats seems to be embraced in Massachusetts, where
the lads and lasses on Beacon Hill are just as wont to lean on
motorists to take the heat off business.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, consider that two Japanese companies, Honda
and Toyota, are about to field low-emissions, high-fuel-economy
hybrid vehicles in the American market. Domestic companies have
been preoccupied with the California-Massachusetts et al. mandate
to peddle electric-only autos and now find themselves one-upped _
again _ by the Japanese. With help from the California
environmental elitists, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to settle the electric car issue is to mandate that
legislators drive them exclusively during their terms _ especially
in winter.

   The year 1999 is the centennial of a celebrated automotive event
in New England, the 100th anniversary of the first ascent up Mount
Washington of an automobile. Aug. 31, 1899, Freelan Oscar Stanley
and wife, Flora, drove a spindly little Locomobile up the Carriage
Road to the top of the 6,288-foot peak, New England's tallest and
the place of possibly the freakiest weather in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Locomobile was a 4-horsepower steamer, and the trip to the
mountaintop was both a promotion for the particular make of car and
for the car in general. Freelan and twin brother Francis Edgar
Stanley had founded the steam-car company and sold it to partners
who would run it as Locomobile. Part of the deal was that the
Stanleys promote the car.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers (one a paving contractor whose company is still in
business) fell out within a year, and the Stanleys bought the
patents back and resumed building steamers under the Stanley name.
The Locomobile survived for quite a long time _ as a
gasoline-fueled internalcombustion car.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 8 is the 138th anniversary of the opening of what is now
the Mount Washington Auto Road, and on that date the centennial of
the Locomobile ascent and the opening of the then Carriage Road are
to be celebrated with a reenactment _ sort of. A Locomobile owned
by the road company will be transported to the mountaintop for a
celebration _ but real steamers will drive the route.
</P>
<P>
   Under the auspices of the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine, an
unprecedented gathering for steamers at the mountain is to mark the
event _ mostly Stanleys from just about every year of production
and nearly every model variant, plus a Doble or two, Whites, a
Lane, Locomobiles, and perhaps some other makes. The steam
celebration falls between two other museum events of note, a parts
and car auction on Aug. 7 in Kingfield, and a New Hampshire
steam-car tour following the Mount Washington event.
</P>
<P>
   The public will have access to an exhibit of the steamers at the
mountain during the celebration, and the Mount Washington vehicle
collection. The steamers are to be displayed chronologically by
marque, and the museum is furnishing catalogs with technical
information on the cars to be given visitors as part of the
admission package.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the old steamers are expected to make the ascent, and
they will face the same daunting problem that Freelan and Flora
faced _ getting down again. While Stanley is believed to have used
a log drag to slow his car on the descent, the Stanleys will likely
be using tractors _ other vehicles with tow ropes _ to ease them
down the mountain. The Mount Washington Auto Road is a formidable
ascent or descent, one that some modern cars are prohibited from
attempting, and very hard on brakes; drivers are advised to rely on
the transmission to control descent speed rather than risk
overheating the brakes. But the view is worth it _ terrifying from
a car seat, but still worth it.

 &HT;    OHIO CLOCK STANDS SENTINEL TO HISTORY
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, the Senate's enigmatic Ohio Clock is
standing sentinel to history.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a tiled foyer outside the Senate chamber, the
12-foot-tall mahogany clock overlooks the frantic moments of
interplay between participants and reporters during the brief
breaks in the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With the media action having moved from the federal courthouse
here to the Senate, the corridor has become the ``Monica Beach'' of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Clock has long been a key meeting point for journalists
and senators. Ticking faithfully since 1816, the clock was the
official Senate timekeeper in bygone decades. Capitol lore has it
that senators stashed bootleg whiskey in its wooden base during
Prohibition. Terrorists are believed to have hidden explosives near
the clock before a 1983 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Now still photographers _ banned from the Senate chamber during
the trial _ while away the hours between breaks in portable seats
set up beside the clock. Reporters covering the trial rush down
from the third floor press gallery for hurried interviews when
Chief Justice William Rehnquist approves a respite inside the
second-floor chambers. TV technicians set up for evening press
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how the Ohio Clock got its name. In 1803,
Ohio became the 17th state admitted to the Union, and there are 17
stars on the shield carved into to clock casing. Thus, a myth arose
that the clock came to the Capitol in commemoration of the
admission of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the clock arrived in 1816, there were already 19
states in the growing country. One of the clock's 17 stars is also
different from the other 16, prompting suspicions of Buckeye State
boosterism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real origin of the clock's name is unknown,'' concedes the
official Senate Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Still photographers are hardly happy with their forced stakeout.
The trial is being covered live by TV, radio and print. Newspaper,
wire service and magazine photographers must make do with hurried
shots of senators, presidential lawyers and House managers walking
past the Ohio Clock on their ways into and out of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might as well be covering the Oscars,'' freelance
photographer Chuck Kennedy complained to Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper. ``At least at the Oscars, you're covering nice suits and
gowns.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask economists in the baby boom generation why they became
economists, and any number will give some credit to Robert L.
Heilbroner. His 1953 book, ``The Worldly Philosophers,'' which has
sold nearly four million copies, is a ``Profiles in Courage'' of
the great thinkers who shaped modern economics. So it is somewhat
surprising to find Heilbroner increasingly critical of the
economists he helped inspire. They have missed the point, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Heilbroner, 79, is at one end of a growing debate over whether
economics, as practiced today, is effective. Sure, economists do a
lot of good research, Heilbroner acknowledges. Some of it yields
important insights. But their models are too simplistic. They
overlook factors that shape the economic and social system and in
doing so forfeit the deep understanding achieved by an Adam Smith
or a John Maynard Keynes, two of his worldly philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worldly philosophers thought their task was to model all
the complexities of an economic system _ the political, the
sociological, the psychological, the moral, the historical,''
Heilbroner said. ``And modern economists, au contraire, do not want
so complex a vision. They favor two-dimensional models that in
trying to be scientific leave out too much and leave modern
economists without a true understanding of how the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   The worldly philosophers would have agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noneconomic motives are an essential element of economic
theory,'' Joseph A. Schumpeter wrote in 1942, two years after
Heilbroner graduated from Harvard, where he had heard Schumpeter
lecture. A few years earlier, Keynes had said that ``no part of
man's nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside an
economist's regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Marshall, the 19th-century British economist, warned that
``economics cannot be compared with the exact physical sciences,
for it deals with the ever changing and subtle forces of human
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift from this way of thinking came after World War II,
when economics gradually ceased to be a social science and took on
the techniques of a natural science. Mathematics became the
language of economics, and computer models of the economy became
the chief research tool. These models require assumptions about the
way markets and people behave, assumptions that are often
unrealistic, although in recent years economists have fed more and
more actual data into their equations in an attempt to approximate
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If math is correctly used, then it can incorporate all kinds
of things that really make the analysis very much broader,'' said
George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``The best of this new work pays attention to psychology
and sociology.''
</P>
<P>
   That still falls short of what Heilbroner has in mind. The
modern economists separated out the subjective, often intuitive
judgments that earlier economists had considered so important.
These were considered not susceptible to scientific inquiry, not
measurable.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, economists also squeezed out the word
capitalism, the once traditional name for the market system, with
its subjective connotation of class struggle between owners or
managers and workers and with its suggestion of the privileges that
go with various levels of wealth. The word capitalism no longer
appears in popular textbooks for Economics 101.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why, N. Gregory Mankiw, a 40-year-old Harvard
economist and author of a popular new textbook, ``Principles of
Economics,'' said: ``We make a distinction now between positive or
descriptive statements that are scientifically verifiable and
normative statements that reflect values and judgments. The
question is, can you do positive economics without normative
economics. I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The science of economics, for example, has found that the causes
of extreme income inequality, a relatively new phenomenon, can be
objectively measured. Those who are well educated are well paid in
the American high-tech service economy, and those who have not gone
beyond high school are not well paid. For Mankiw, that is a
``positive'' statement in that it is verifiable.
</P>
<P>
   But left out of this finding are factors like job insecurity,
which tends to make wages more unequal _ whatever the education
level _ and labor union bargaining power, which helped to equalize
wages until union power declined. These are subjective observations
that Mankiw or Paul Romer, a 43-year-old Stanford University
economist, would classify as political or public policy issues but
not part of a scientific explanation of the workings of the
economic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kind of a hubris among earlier generations of
economists who thought they themselves could make the scientific
statements and then the value judgments,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   He likens an economist's role to that of a doctor who explains
what will happen if a cancer patient is taken off an aggressive
program of chemotherapy and radiation. ``You can let the pastor,
the legislator, the family and the philosopher struggle with the
moral question of whether to actually stop the treatment,'' Romer
said, ``but what you want from a doctor is correct scientific
statements about what will happen if.''
</P>
<P>
   Keynes made no such distinctions. Drawing on intuition,
observation and his own broad experience, he concluded that the
nation found itself stuck in the 1930s Depression in large part
because business refused to invest, although the nation offered
plenty of savings to finance investment. Keynes' sweeping insight
forever changed the way economists think about the way a capitalist
system functions. Keynes, having found the problem, saw no reason
to be shy about solutions, calling for enormous government spending
to offset the decline in business investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keynes certainly had a view of what was a good society,'' said
Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``And he tried to save society from
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern economists reject such a role. Romer's father, Roy Romer,
the former governor of Colorado, had to decide while in office
whether to cut taxes or spend more on education, a value judgment
properly left to politicians, in the son's view. ``I saw my father
as someone very skilled at what he does,'' the son said. ``I have
sought to be as skilled on the scientific side.''
</P>
<P>
   The father chose more education, partly on the advice of his
son, who told him of the economic profession's scientific finding
that income inequality is a result of unequal education.
</P>
<P>
   But in this sort of a case, science does not take you far
enough, says Heilbroner, an economic historian at the New School
for Social Research. ``You have to ask, what is the correlation
between high levels of education and high levels of wealth.'' he
said. ``Is education in our system a privilege of wealth and a
function of the class structure?''
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that science cannot address but economics
must, says Mark Blaug, an economic historian. Otherwise economic
findings are skewed. ``There are so many things going on in the
economic world at the same time,'' he said. ``Not just standard
economic forces, but all the other elements that shape an economy _
politics, morals, psychology, sociology _ and therefore economics
will always be vague and imprecise, more like history than math.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond science sits easier with older economists like
Heilbroner or Blaug, who is 71, or Solow, who is 74, and like
Heilbroner and Blaug came of age as an economist in the 1950s,
while Keynesianism was still in its heyday and the Cold War had not
yet helped squeeze value judgments out of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Solow, however, is a pillar of mainstream economics. His
economic growth theory, in which he explained the interactions of
capital, labor and technology in generating economic expansion, is
a model of economics practiced as a science. He would never, he
said, ``advise a student to go to work on the nature of the class
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are condemning him to failure,'' he continued. ``We do not
know if there are applicable rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an autobiographical sketch, he argued against thinking of
economics as science with a capital S. ``That is perfectly
consistent,'' he wrote, ``with a strong belief that economics
should try very hard to be scientific with a small s. By that I
mean only that we should think logically and respect fact.'' Fact,
he said, should be enlarged ``to include, say, the opinions and
casual generalizations of experts and market participants,
attitudinal surveys, institutional regularities, even our judgments
of plausibility. My preferred image is the vacuum cleaner, not the
microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually economics is moving this way. The younger generation,
while holding tight to its scientific approach, is nevertheless
opening up its equations, feeding into them all sorts of new data
from other disciplines, then trying, more than in the past, to make
the hypotheses fit the data. Surveys are increasingly being used,
and old assumptions _ that supply and demand, for example, balance
at a healthy level _ are being amended or put aside.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach was on display at the recent annual meeting of
the American Economics Association, where economists at one session
reviewed their research into today's unusual spectacle of an
unemployment rate and an inflation rate falling together instead of
moving in opposite directions, as economic theory dictates and as
they once did. Drawing on psychology, the researchers even tried to
quantify how people actually behave or feel about work.
</P>
<P>
   Heilbroner applauds. But it is not in his view enough. The
questions that absorb the younger economists are too narrow, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, for example, cannot just chronicle the rise of
output as an economy grows. There must also be a judgment about the
quality of that output: Does it show up as more school construction
or warmer clothing in winter or as more channels of bad television
programs and higher pay for chief executives. That is how the
worldly philosophers would have thought, Heilbroner suggests in a
new chapter added to the seventh edition of ``The Worldly
Philosophers,'' to be published in the spring by Simon &AMP; Schuster.

   tremendous midwinter ritual it truly is, were it not elevated

off on Jan. 31, featuring a cast of 1,200 performers, from
high-school cheerleaders to pop stars Gloria Estefan and Stevie
Wonder, Maggi Rosenberg can finally take a rest. The
Wellington-based Rosenberg, a one-time professional dancer and now
a popular children's entertainer on the South Florida circuit _ her
stage name is ``Miss Maggi'' _ has been recruited to be the
rehearsal coordinator for the massive production. (It turns out
she's an old friend of one of the producers.) It's her job to coach
all the different performers and then bring them together on the
final day. Right now, she's still auditioning dancers. On Jan. 23,
she'll do her first major run-through, with up to 600 members of
the cast. On Jan. 30, she'll do a dress rehearsal with everybody.
And on Jan. 31 . . . it's showtime. (Passy, Palm Beach Post). 40.

Atlanta, the city too busy to hate, may have trouble working up
animosity for its Super Bowl foe. So, as a public service, we offer
this primer: Learning to Hate Denver, Or Things You Need To Know
About the Enemy. It goes beyond ugly uniforms and the sorry way
they treated Dan Reeves. Did you know that Denver claims to have
invented the cheeseburger? And that it brews more beer than any

high-school cheerleaders to pop stars Gloria Estefan and Stevie
Wonder, Maggi Rosenberg can finally take a rest. The
Wellington-based Rosenberg, a one-time professional dancer and now
a popular children's entertainer on the South Florida circuit _ her
stage name is ``Miss Maggi'' _ has been recruited to be the
rehearsal coordinator for the massive production. (It turns out
she's an old friend of one of the producers.) It's her job to coach
all the different performers and then bring them together on the
final day. Right now, she's still auditioning dancers. On Jan. 23,
she'll do her first major run-through, with up to 600 members of
the cast. On Jan. 30, she'll do a dress rehearsal with everybody.
And on Jan. 31 . . . it's showtime. (Passy, Palm Beach Post). 40.

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the traditional interpretation of the Bible, the Five Books
of Moses are exactly that: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and
Deuteronomy, written by Moses at God's command.
</P>
<P>
   What may not be as well known is that during the last two
centuries, many biblical scholars have offered a different type of
analysis, concluding that those biblical books, also known as the
Pentateuch, are a compilation of four separate narratives, woven
together by ancient editors, or redactors, to create a single text.
</P>
<P>
   In unscrambling this puzzle, scholars have identified the four
narratives by letters _ J, E, P, D _ each of which represents a key
word in the text. (J, for example, is the first letter of the
German spelling for the name Yahweh; E comes from Elohim, the
Hebrew word for God; P stands for the priestly source, referring to
passages concerned with religious law, while D signifies
Deuteronomy.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a dozen years of research, Richard Elliott Friedman,
a professor of Hebrew and comparative literature at the University
of California at San Diego, has tantalizingly argued that the J
narrative is far longer than the three others, and actually extends
considerably beyond the five Mosaic books.
</P>
<P>
   The J source, he says, comprises a ``hidden book'' that is
nearly 3,000 years old and that runs from Genesis to the First Book
of Kings.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it, he declares, the world's first book-length
prose work.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction of other scholars to Friedman's theory has been mixed,
ranging from praise for his boldness and extensive research to
critical doubt that the idea will be widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the J source alone, which scholars have
traditionally viewed as the oldest, has received far more public
attention than the E, P or D sources. J has been the subject of
several recent popular books, best-known among them ``The Book of
J,'' in which the Yale literary scholar Harold Bloom argued that
J's author was a woman. One reason, at least, for J's popularity
may be that as scholars have broken it out of the overall biblical
text it includes some of the most vivid passages of familiar
stories, like that of Noah, and it includes material, like the
Tower of Babel story, that is not placed by scholars in the other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   By linking J with subsequent sections of the Bible, particularly
what scholars call the Court History, which tells the story of King
David, Friedman has theorized that the Bible was constructed around
an original long narrative, about 3,000 sentences altogether, which
runs from the creation of humanity to David's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know of poetry that is earlier, but this is the oldest
prose literature: a long, beautiful, exciting story,'' he writes in
his book, ``The Hidden Book in the Bible,'' recently published by
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says the ``hidden book'' has a theme, if not a single
plot. Beginning with Adam and Eve's eating of the fruit in the
Garden of Eden, it tells the story of how human beings gain the
ability to tell good from bad, and then what they do with it over
many generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see people making choices of good and bad, and making
choices and paying prices and learning from that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's theory is in some sense as much literary detective
work as an example of biblical scholarship. In a telephone
interview, Friedman said recurrent words and phrases that appear
nowhere else in these sections of the Bible first led him to
believe that J extended further than all but a few scholars had
previously thought. He titles his 200-page translation of this
narrative ``In the Day,'' a phrase taken from the first three words
with which the J source begins (in Genesis 2:4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just where the evidence goes,'' Friedman said.
``I didn't set out looking for common themes. When I first started
looking at J and the Court History, it started with language,
because that's still the most common thing. It was the language
that first sort of mapped where I should be looking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that certain references to deception, phrases like
``kindness and faithfulness,'' references to Sheol, a place of the
dead, as well as some other words and phrases occurred only in this
text. He also found cases in which words and phrases were repeated
sequentially in separate stories in J and the Court History, which
he took as another link.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said he had found numerous recurring images
within the two sections, among them no fewer than seven stories of
brothers warring against brothers, with the action taking place in
a field, beginning with Cain and Abel.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is the author and editor of other books written for a
lay audience, among them ``Who Wrote the Bible?,'' which describes
the process by which J and the other narratives were identified.
That book is used as a text in some biblical studies courses.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, he said, he implies no criticism of the
religious belief of Orthodox Jews and conservative Christians that
Moses wrote the five books attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Avi Shafran, a spokesman for Agudath Israel, a strictly
Orthodox organization, said that academic ``higher criticism'' of
the Bible was predicated on a different set of assumptions about
the text than those held by people who believe the text was
divinely given to Moses. ``We're talking from totally different
premises, so it's not really an argument,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars offered mixed assessments of the Friedman theory.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cooper, a professor of Bible who holds a joint appointment
at Jewish Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary in
New York, said he doubted whether many experts would accept
Friedman's theory that there is a single, long-running narrative in
the Bible. ``But I do think people will have to take his evidence
very seriously,'' Cooper added, saying that biblical scholars would
have to study the data Friedman had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Ziony Zevit, professor of Bible at the University of Judaism in
Los Angeles, said he did not think the similarities that Friedman
found pointed to a single narrative. Still, he called Friedman's
translation of the biblical books that make up his proposed
narrative ``a tour de force.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman attributes the single narrative to a ``literary
artist,'' probably a lay person (possibly female), writing about 28
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the person who came along with the instincts of
the historian, to tell a long saga, to tell it all,'' he said in
the interview. He added that the cultural conditions made a
historical narrative possible because the ancient Israelites, with
their belief that God existed outside nature, possessed a linear
view of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``God meets Moses at the bush and says, `I'm the God of your
father,''' he said. ``It's only in a model like that you'd start
writing history. The pagan world didn't write like that.''

SNOWSHOES BECOME HOT FASHION FOR WINTER ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GABRIELS, N.Y. _ Arms pumping, legs kicking, Birger Ohlsson
huffs and puffs his way through the chilly powder. Despite those
sled-like baskets strapped to his Nikes, the man is covering ground
like a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to break 60 seconds in 400 meters,'' Ohlsson, 30,
said after finishing first in one of the sprints last Saturday at
the Bobcat Snowshoe Race west of Saranac Lake in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson is like more and more elite runners. He discovered the
sport of snowshoeing and embraced it with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people take to it right away,'' said Jim Tucker, who
calls himself Dean of Fun at Paul Smith's College and is a driving
force for the sport. ``I've been enjoying snowshoes all my life.
It's only natural when you live up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's race last weekend, which attracted more than 30
entrants of all ages and sizes, is but the tip of a snowshoeing
iceberg that has sailed into view during the last few winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's easy and it's fun,'' said Marta Tebbutt of Rainbow
Lake, a snowshoeing neophyte who was born and raised in steamy
Colombia. ``I moved up here with my husband and soon found out
about snowshoes.''
</P>
<P>
   She mistook them for tennis rackets or oversized fly swatters.
With their bright colors, lightweight aluminum frames and diversity
of design, snowshoes of today barely resemble their wooden
ancestors, which date back centuries. ``I didn't have any trouble
at all,'' said Josh McDougall, 13, who zipped around the
8,000-meter cross-country course at the Bobcat event at the Sports
Annex of Paul Smith's, which teaches winter sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've competed in snowshoes and liked it
right away.'' McDougall, who is schooled at home in his rural
community of Peru, is a member of the national Junior Olympic
cross-country running team. Snowshoeing, therefore, was a perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a way of augmentation for my runners, then it
developed its own life,'' Mark Elmore said in explaining the
Beekmantown Eagles, a thriving snowshoeing club near Plattsburgh.
``As a high school track coach, I was looking for a way for the
kids to stay in shape during the winter. Pretty soon, they were
winning more medals at snowshoeing than running.''
</P>
<P>
   As a discipline still in its infancy, snowshoeing doesn't harbor
a large body of rules and records. The North American Snowshoe
Classic, one of the major events in the sport, began only 12 years
ago at Paul Smith's. It was known as the Sherpa World Cup then,
when 135 athletes from 15 countries competed.
</P>
<P>
   George Bosworth, founder of the United States Snowshoe
Association, conceived the event, with Tucker an avid supporter. It
caught the attention of Sports Illustrated magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowshoeing has become a popular sport at Paul Smith's,'' said
Jeff Langmaid, a student. ``It's readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that the type of student to attend the remote
college also is likely to be attracted to snowshoeing. Ajith
Fernando of Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, was a
new student in Tucker's class back in the early 1990s when he was
exposed to snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   Several medals later, Fernando is hooked. Now a travel agent in
New York City, he still snowshoes every chance he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our events share some of the characteristics of a flea market
and small-town carnival,'' Tucker said. ``Hot food vendors mix with
those selling wool outer garments.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key nature of events fosters friendships and common
purpose. ``Everyone seems willing to help and make suggestions,''
said Lisa McDougall, a mother of three who quickly found herself
comfortable in a pair of snowshoes. ``I wasn't planning on doing
it, but everyone looked like they were having so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Good snowshoes aren't cheap (at least $100), but they are almost
indestructible. Some manufacturers even will make repairs free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wearing the same pair for years,'' Elmore said. ``I
think they're bulletproof. I expect I'll wear out before they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the sport, which appears to be on a steep rise.
``Snowshoe athletes race for the competition and opportunity to
measure their conditioning and training, rather than for
international honor and glory,'' Tucker said. ``That's not so bad.
I'll take a quiet walk in the woods any day instead of governing
bodies and their politics.''

<P>
   Her book column is sponsored by Amazon.com. Bolanos said that
more than a million have visited the three-month-old site, and she
already has thousands of members who pay $19.95 a year for a Cindy
CD-ROM and an autographed photo _ ``a $39.95 value,'' the site
exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Easton, the Los Angeles writer, said Schwarzenegger is
planning to create a top-quality site, which can cost around
$150,000 to start up and about $50,000 a year to run. The site will
be nonprofit and will include such features as a list of
Schwarzenegger's favorite CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Ms. Easton said, it may offer a high-tech variation
on an old carnival attraction _ photographs of Schwarzenegger
hugging a ``friend'' _ a scanned-in photo of the fan's face. If all
goes well, Ms. Easton said, Schwarzenegger may introduce a
for-profit site based on his favorite sport, skiing.
</P>
<P>
   For the increasing numbers of celebrities who fashion themselves
as entrepreneurial corporations, Web sites are a means of direct
marketing. Ms. Henner intends to sell copies of her new self-help
book, ``30-Day Total Health Makeover,'' (Reagan Books, $22) via her
Web page as soon as copies are ready this spring. Ms. Seymour's
site will help promote a series of children's books, which she
wrote with her husband, James Keach, an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Trumper, who helps run William Morris' new six-person
department to advise celebrities on their Internet presence, said
clients can also benefit from the demographic research a site can
provide. ``Let's say an actor wants to lobby for a particular movie
role and the studio is unsure she has a good enough fan base,'' he
said. ``If she has a Web site, she can actually prove that she has
hundreds of thousands of fans. And she can prove to the studio that
they're the right fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some celebrities are drawn by the lure of the bully pulpit.
Barbra Streisand was exposed to the Internet when she did a
``chat'' on America Online in October, shortly before the
elections. Her manager, Martin Erlichman, said she was excited by
the reaction she got.
</P>
<P>
   America Online gave her a temporary Web page soon after, on
which she posted the text of her speech in support of Rep. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., and a list of other candidates from across the
country she supported. Erlichman said that 80 percent of Ms.
Streisand's political choices triumphed in last November's
elections. She was so excited, Erlichman said, that she decided to
hatch her own site.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a Web site can be harder for stars than for their
fans. First, there is the issue of ``domain name,'' the identifying
address for every site. Anyone can own a domain name merely by
registering it with a quasi-governmental agency called Internic,
for a small processing fee, on a first-come basis. But often when
celebrities decide to set up their own site, they find that their
name has already been snatched up.
</P>
<P>
   An Internic search shows that BradPitt.com is owned by Khalib
Alzarooni of the United Arab Emirates. When he was setting up his
site, as a safeguard, Schwarzenegger registered 31 variations of
his name to account for potential misspellings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the name is registered by a fan, but often the culprit
is a cyberheister, as they're commonly called, betting that one day
the celebrity will come calling to make a deal. Alzarooni, for
example, has not put up a site for Pitt. Internic regulators frown
on such tactics, but often celebrities relent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henner bought Marilu.com for an undisclosed amount. Ms.
Crawford was luckier, she only had to ask nicely to get Cindy.com
back from the company that had registered the name.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of photo rights. Most photographs are
owned by the publication that printed them or the photographer.
Fans blithely scan them onto their sites, but aren't often
prosecuted since they don't have much money and aren't worth suing.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, however, are another matter. ``If I put up pictures
from a magazine, a lawyer would be on the phone to me in a
second,'' Ms. Crawford said. ``I have to go through all the steps
of clearing them. Which means that right now there are some fan
sites that have more pictures of me than my own site does.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson some celebrities are learning is that even in
cyberspace, fans can be very demanding. While the medium allows the
celebrities to answer frequently asked questions en masse with a
single posting (``They all want to know how I got started,'' Ms.
Crawford said), most stars also get thousands of private messages a
week on their site. Ms. Crawford answers only a handful.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike old-fashioned letters, which generations of fans sent
with little hope of hearing back, e-mail seems to demand an
immediate response. Ms. Henner said: ``If I don't change the
recipes on my site often enough, I get a ton of nasty mail from
people who take it personally. And if I don't e-mail them back,
they get even madder. It's great in a way, but it's also a little
scary.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 24, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scheduled for the dress page &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORLD-ORDER-REVIEW (Washington) _ The new world order that
was confidently predicted when communism collapsed a decade ago is
nowhere to be seen. Around the world, crises pile up, and the
resulting headlines are not pretty. International organizations
from the U.N. to NATO seem powerless. Streams of important people
go humbly to the feet of Saddam, Gadhafi, Milosevic, Hun Sen to beg
for a modicum of good behavior. What happened? By Barbara
Crossette. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-BLACKLIST-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Elia Kazan, one of
America's greatest film and theatrical directors, is scheduled to
receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st annual Academy Awards in
March. It will not only serve as the most prestigious honor of
Kazan's career but, in many ways, spell the end of the tormented
legacy of the 1950s Hollywood blacklist. By Bernard Weinraub. (`a'

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It seems likely that
witnesses will be called at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
In interviews with The New York Times, four lawyers who have
followed the proceedings assess the advantages and dangers for both
sides. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   WITCH-HUNT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With all the current hyperbole _
``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White House
counsel Charles Ruff to describe the impeachment charges against
President Clinton trial _ it might be useful to reflect on the days
back in the 13th through 16th centuries when a witch hunt was
really a hunt for witches.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORTS-XRAYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed like a good idea:
Customs Service officials at airports in New York and Miami began
offering suspicious travelers the choice between the traditional
but humiliating strip search or a modern, hi-tech X-ray search. To
officials' surprise, many are opting for the good old strip search.
By Alan Finder.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `i' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ With Labor and Likud facing
deep identity crises and new parties constantly forming, Israel is
producing a new multi-party system that is chaotic and will make it
difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition. But
the trend is a political expression of something more deepseated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-POWER-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ With the discovery of great
energy reserves around the Caspian Sea, not only offers oil
companies the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a
place to test their strength. The U.S. States, Russia, Iran and
other countries are waging strong campaigns to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. These grand rivalries have turned the
Caspian into the world's newest stage for big-power politics. By
Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Ever since Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev signed it in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty has been one of the cornerstones of arms control. Its
fundamental premise, which held throughout the Cold War, was that
limiting missile defenses limited offensive missiles. Now, the
cornerstone has crumbled a bit. A look at the new theory of missile
defense. By Steve Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PHOTOS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ When the Khmer Rouge
seized power in 1975, cameras were among the artifacts of
technology that were banned. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers were allowed to operate. One of them, Nhem Ein, left
behind a stunning body of work: some 7,000 portraits of horror. By
Seth Mydans.

for Sunday, Jan. 24, will move Saturday.

<P>
   &UR; Scheduled for the dress page &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORLD-ORDER-REVIEW (Washington) _ The new world order that
was confidently predicted when communism collapsed a decade ago is
nowhere to be seen. Around the world, crises pile up, and the
resulting headlines are not pretty. International organizations
from the U.N. to NATO seem powerless. Streams of important people
go humbly to the feet of Saddam, Gadhafi, Milosevic, Hun Sen to beg
for a modicum of good behavior. What happened? By Barbara
Crossette. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-BLACKLIST-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Elia Kazan, one of
America's greatest film and theatrical directors, is scheduled to
receive an honorary Oscar at the 71st annual Academy Awards in
March. It will not only serve as the most prestigious honor of
Kazan's career but, in many ways, spell the end of the tormented
legacy of the 1950s Hollywood blacklist. By Bernard Weinraub. (`a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `a' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-WITNESSES-REVIEW (Washington) _ It seems likely that
witnesses will be called at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
In interviews with The New York Times, four lawyers who have
followed the proceedings assess the advantages and dangers for both
sides. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   WITCH-HUNT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With all the current hyperbole _
``witches' brew'' was the term used last week by White House
counsel Charles Ruff to describe the impeachment charges against
President Clinton trial _ it might be useful to reflect on the days
back in the 13th through 16th centuries when a witch hunt was
really a hunt for witches.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORTS-XRAYS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seemed like a good idea:
Customs Service officials at airports in New York and Miami began
offering suspicious travelers the choice between the traditional
but humiliating strip search or a modern, hi-tech X-ray search. To
officials' surprise, many are opting for the good old strip search.
By Alan Finder.

<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Also moving in the `i' category: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ With Labor and Likud facing
deep identity crises and new parties constantly forming, Israel is
producing a new multi-party system that is chaotic and will make it
difficult to build and sustain a lasting government coalition. But
the trend is a political expression of something more deepseated,
what many have called a new tribalism that is eroding the
traditional singleminded unity of an Israeli people devoted to
Zionism above all. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-POWER-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ With the discovery of great
energy reserves around the Caspian Sea, not only offers oil
companies the prospect of great wealth. It gives outside powers a
place to test their strength. The U.S. States, Russia, Iran and
other countries are waging strong campaigns to win decisive
influence in the Caspian. These grand rivalries have turned the
Caspian into the world's newest stage for big-power politics. By
Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Ever since Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev signed it in 1972, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty has been one of the cornerstones of arms control. Its
fundamental premise, which held throughout the Cold War, was that
limiting missile defenses limited offensive missiles. Now, the
cornerstone has crumbled a bit. A look at the new theory of missile
defense. By Steve Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PHOTOS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ When the Khmer Rouge
seized power in 1975, cameras were among the artifacts of
technology that were banned. Only a handful of officially approved
photographers were allowed to operate. One of them, Nhem Ein, left
behind a stunning body of work: some 7,000 portraits of horror. By
Seth Mydans.

 &HT;    Atlantans onstage The wages of art
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Below are local theaters' wage scales as set forth by
Actor's Equity, the stage actors union headquartered in New York.
There are 250 Equity members in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Equity members are almost always paid more than non-Equity
actors but may find themselves ``overpriced'' for a financially
pinched theater when less expensive actors of comparable talent are
available. Thus, many actors opt not to join the union, preferring
a larger choice of roles to the higher paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL PROFESSIONAL THEATERS (SPT)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Theaters covered ART Station, Shakespeare Tavern, Horizon
Theatre, Theatre in the Square, 7 Stages
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Typical weekly range, including non-Equity actors $125-$300.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Equity weekly minimum $194-$275, plus benefits. Figures vary
from theater to theater.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Comments These theaters agree to use a set minimum of Equity
actors in every show in return for low-wage minimums. Rehearsal
weeks may be more than 40 hours, performance weeks as short as 16
hours.
</P>
<P>
   GUEST ARTIST (GAC)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Theaters covered Actor's Express, Georgia Ensemble Theatre,
Theatre Gael, Jewish Theatre of the South.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Equity weekly minimum $330,
</P>
<P>
   plus benefits.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Comments These are not official Equity theaters such as SPTs,
so although they offer higher minimums it's for fewer actors, and
not in every show. Mostly they use non-Equity actors.
</P>
<P>
   LETTER OF AGREEMENT (LOA)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Theaters covered Georgia Shakespeare Festival, Jomandi

   plus benefits.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    As city's theater scene thrives, fiscal recognition remains
thespians' thorniest problem
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the 32 actors of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' take
their bows on the stage of the Alliance Theatre, leading theater of
the Southeast, it's a moving moment _ for reasons beyond the power
of the play itself.
</P>
<P>
   Moving, because 31 of them are Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   As the ovation swells and these inhabitants of John Steinbeck's
saga stand and gaze back at the audience, their pride is a palpable
force, filling the room. Only a decade ago it would have been
impossible to cast the epic with so many, so talented, who call
this city home.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at Actor's Express, the acting is no less exciting
in Dostoyevsky's ``The Devils.'' There, too, the curtain calls are
emotional, for among the 15 Atlanta actors are several whose
talents are fully realized for the first time under the brilliant
director Chris Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   These productions are only the leading edge of the groundswell.
There are an estimated 1,000 actors who show up for local
professional theater auditions each year. This week alone, scores
of them all over the metro area will practice the 3,000-year-old
craft of Thespis, the first professional actor. You can see
seasoned pros in Marietta (Ga.), at Theatre in the Square (``Cash
on Delivery,'' a saucy British farce); in Atlanta, at 7 Stages
(``States of Shock,'' an eerie Sam Shepard drama) and the Horizon
Theatre (``Mere Mortals,'' a witty David Ives brain teaser); and in
Roswell (Ga.), at Georgia Ensemble Theatre (``Crimes of the
Heart,'' a warm Southern comedy). Next month, Jomandi Productions
will bring back ``Sisters,'' an original comedy that has won hearts
all over the country thanks to its fine Atlanta players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong pool _ we can do almost anything with
the actors in Atlanta,'' says Vincent Murphy, artistic director of
Theater Emory. He should know. The Boston-bred Murphy mounted one
of the fall's best-acted productions, ``Cockfighter,'' at PushPush,
a theater in the Floataway factory complex that's so new and small
it doesn't even have a formal relationship with Actors' Equity, the
stage actors union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta actors have grown to the point where, when I go to New
York, the performances seem more surface-y, actor-y,'' says Lisa
Adler, who runs the 15-year-old Horizon with husband Jeff. ``Our
actors seem more genuine and connected to life, even in a spiritual
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta actors are indeed more grounded, it may reflect an
Atlanta lifestyle that is healthier for the inner life of an artist
than New York (if not always as intellectually stimulating) and may
even be better for the artist's mind than Los Angeles. In those
cities the rat race can consume every conversation, as horrific
rents come due and actors clamor desperately for roles, much like
the Vietnamese civilians begging for a place on the escape
helicopter of ``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Stephens, Ma Joad in ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' has
established herself in New York and Chicago enough that she can
field phone offers and live where she chooses. She chooses Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, no one's waiting to rip your guts out,'' says
actress-director Shannon Eubanks (Roswell's ``Crimes of the
Heart''), a native Charlestonian who has worked extensively in Los
Angeles. ``Even the actors you're reading against give you hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The brutal bottom line
</P>
<P>
   So what drives actors away from Atlanta? Often it's money _ or
at the least the illusion of making more of it. Apart from
Broadway, theater wages are woefully, insultingly low. ``This ain't
the NBA,'' cracks actor-producer Tom Key.
</P>
<P>
   Equity reports that its 36,000 members nationally earn an
average of less than $15,000 a year from stage work. In Atlanta _
where there are 250 dues-paying Equity members and hundreds of
actors choose not to join Equity because it limits their choice of
roles _ the average yearly stage income is probably half that.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that during a 12-month period, a local Equity actor in
demand might get one Alliance role (seven weeks at $600 per week),
one medium-theater role (seven weeks at $350) and two smaller roles
(14 weeks at $250) for a grand total of 28 weeks and $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lucky actor. One of the fortunate handful.
</P>
<P>
   True, during performance weeks, an actor may be in the theater
as little as 16 hours (few Atlanta theaters can draw enough
audience on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to even open their doors on
those nights). But the standard three weeks' rehearsal can be
brutal, culminating in the dreaded ``10 out of 12''-hour days, the
theater's equivalent of ``two-a-day'' football workouts. Not only
do some producers pay less for rehearsal than performance, but they
increasingly shave days off rehearsal or replace rehearsal days
with preview performances, arguing that audience feedback helps
actors' preparation more than rehearsal in front of empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But are we ready for an audience?'' asks Lorilyn Harper, who
moved from Dallas two years ago with actor-husband Chris Paul (both
are in ``Cash on Delivery'') because they were so impressed, and
still are, with what they'd seen and heard about the Atlanta
theater market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks is not enough for developing a textured
performance,'' she adds, ``especially in the classics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, these are the '90s,'' cries Eubanks sarcastically. ``It's
all about cost efficiency!''
</P>
<P>
   Nature of the beast
</P>
<P>
   No producer, nor anyone else, is getting rich from this cheap
labor. In order to preserve the intimate experience of theater,
there can only be so many seats (an average of 200 for most Atlanta
houses) and thus only so much revenue. Theater by definition is
labor-intensive: Each performance is created from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   This built-in economic straitjacket ensures that only on
Broadway can stage actors attain middle-class wages ($1,000 a week
minimum) or riches ($30,000 a week for a musical superstar such as
Jerry Lewis or Glenn Close), because higher ticket prices and more
weekly performances support the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``An actor friend once told me to go to a producer to demand
more money,'' says La La Cochran, starring in Horizon's ``Mere
Mortals.'' ``And the producer said, `I don't have it.' And I
stopped, took a deep breath, and said, `Of course you don't.' ''

   ATLANTA: course you don't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back to reality
</P>
<P>
   So, having resigned themselves to the necessity of a day job,
how do Atlanta actors get by? The short answer: any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Harty (``The Devils'') must ``go straight home after the
play, otherwise how am I going to get to work (as an administrative
assistant) by 8:30 every day and still keep my energy up?'' Sean
Daniels, when not serving as artistic director at Dad's Garage or
organizing its ``8 1/2 x 11'' showcase of young directors, can be
found tending bar at that Little Five Points (Ga.) warehouse. Jared
Simon (``Conversations With My Father'' at Jewish Theatre of the
South) has a chiropractic practice and not much spare time, so he
must be selective about his roles. LaParee Young (``Grapes'') has
shot several film and TV roles around the South, but they are so
erratic that the 42-year-old had to wait tables last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's truth to the old waiter stereotype: Scores of
Atlanta actors scrape by on tips. Of course, film, TV and
commercials, which can pay thousands of dollars for a few days'
work, are the day job of choice for most Atlanta actors, but they
are tough to get, and their producers have no patience for ``I have
to be back at the theater by 7.'' Elizabeth Wells laughs as she
recalls the time she slipped away from the Alliance's ``A Christmas
Carol'' on her day off for a movie shoot in Charleston, only to
find that the other actor in her scene was ``Carol's'' Al Hamacher,
similarly moonlighting. Afemo and Elizabeth Omilami used to be
frequently seen performers at such theaters as the Alliance and
Jomandi, but now one of them is on the road almost constantly _
especially up to Wilmington, N.C., hottest film center of the South
_ while the other stays home with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the theater but can so rarely afford to do it,'' Afemo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Family matters
</P>
<P>
   Temp work, especially in word processing, ``fills the gaps,''
Harper says, but she and Paul, in their late '30s, decided not to
start a family because, ``our working schedule would not be fair to
a child.'' Still, many theatrical couples decide to stay in Atlanta
precisely because it's a better place to raise a child on a limited
income than most theatrical markets.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Cline, actress and artistic director of Soul-stice
Repertory, says that she and actor-director husband Hudson Adams
have a ``dream life'' with an infant daughter, a Decatur (Ga.)
lakeside ranch house and artistic variety. A dream life, if one
doesn't mind a killer schedule. Cline commutes to Rome (Ga.) to
teach at Berry College, Adams works at Kinko's four nights a week
and they trade off babysitting assignments at all hours of the day
and night. ``Our toughest financial time is when we are producing
Soul-stice,'' Cline writes in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not think children were an option for us,'' she
continues, ``until I looked around and saw (theater couples) Teri
and Chris Kayser, Teresa DeBerry and Allen O'Reilly, John Ammerman
and Kathleen McManus (the latter two couples do some form of
teaching by day). I think we all kept looking at each other
thinking, `If they can do it, so can we.' And we're making it.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest proposal
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nonprofit theaters by definition do not earn all
their revenue at the box office, often getting up to 40 percent of
their income through corporate and individual gifts. Why are these
gifts almost never earmarked for artist wages?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked this of a number of funders,'' says Express
director Chris Coleman, ``and naturally they're concerned that
artists might leave the city. Facilities, bricks and mortar; stay
put. Our job is to convince funders that actors, too, are a vital
community investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Peck, 64, one of the rare actors able to practice his craft
in Atlanta for 30-plus years (crediting his higher-earning wife for
the privilege) has seen many less fortunate colleagues flee Atlanta
for the movie money of the West Coast. He asks: why not corporate
sponsorships for individual actors? Under Peck's modest proposal,
an actor would receive, say, $50,000 for an entire year of acting
assignments at various theaters, relieving those theaters of the
burden of paying him or her. For the rest of the actor's normal
working hours, he or she would teach a master class in acting under
the corporate banner, an even more vaulable role to the community
at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work could only get better,'' Peck argues, ``once the
actor isn't living in constant financial anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Why they do it
</P>
<P>
   And yet the lack of such grants _ or indeed of any financial
incentive whatever _ cannot stop thespians from coming back to the
purest form of their craft _the stage.
</P>
<P>
   When Harper and Paul finish their temp shifts on a Thursday
afternoon and head off to their theater gigs, ``I feel sorry for
the people in those offices who hate their work and live only for
the weekends,'' Harper says, ``That's when I feel lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Culpepper, who pockets a six-figure income as perhaps the
premier voice-over man in the Southeast _ his is that rugged
baritone extolling the toughness of Ford trucks, for example _ has
announced more retirements from the stage than the late Frank
Sinatra did from singing. Yet he was recently dragged back into
service by independent producer Chad Darnell for a virtually unpaid
gig in ``The Lizzie Borden Story'' as the oft-whacked Mr. Borden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applause is an enormous high,'' Culpepper says. ``Theater is
so much more alive than a microphone.''

 &HT;    Accessory market is true to trends
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New designs in home decorating accessories take their
cue from furnishings. Whatever's hot in sofas, chairs and tables
spills over into lamps, pillows, frames and rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of today's most popular themes and motifs for furniture
manufacturers are retro, Asian and garden. And when it comes to
accessories, nowhere were those categories more evident than at
last week's Atlanta International Gift &AMP; Home Furnishings Market,
held at the wholesale complex AmericasMart.
</P>
<P>
   Even dogs _ and we don't mean bad merchandise _ seemed to show
up in packs, from the fine to the funky.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the newest products, which should be in area
stores by September.

 &HT;    An Atlanta author is helping churches prepare for 'service and
witness' as Y2K approaches.By Gayle White

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A prudent man foresees the difficulties ahead and prepares for
them; the simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Proverbs 22:3
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shaunti Christine Feldhahn sits in front of a plate of
Belgian waffles at a Dunwoody (Ga.) restaurant with a copy of her
book, ``Y2K _ The Millennium Bug,'' on the table in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter approaching with a coffeepot notices the book. ``Y2K,''
he says, ``are y'all worried about that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested,'' Feldhahn replies. ``I'd say interested, not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   At 31 years of age, with a graduate degree from Harvard
University and a background as a financial analyst, Feldhahn has
taken on the mission of preparing the nonprofit community,
especially the church, for Y2K. The results of her efforts are
already remarkable:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her book, written in only 50 days last summer and released
just three months ago by Multnomah, has sold 165,000 copies and is
in its fourth printing. She has a workbook for churches and a Y2K
book for youth in the works.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Joseph Project 2000, launched by Feldhahn with a rally at
New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in DeKalb County (Ga.) in
September, now has working chapters in 40 cities with contacts in
more than 100 others. (It takes its name from the Old Testament
character Joseph, who learned in a dream of seven years of plenty,
followed by seven years of famine, and led preparations for the
coming shortages.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Joseph Project 2000 Web site _
http://www.josephproject2000.org _ gets as many as 20,000 hits a
day. And its executive offices in Atlanta take up to 600 telephone
calls and e-mails on the busiest days.
</P>
<P>
   Feldhahn now spends much of her time traveling the country to
speak, meet with other organizations, and make media appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Her message is not the alarmist rhetoric of a religious zealot
who believes the New Year will bring on the end of the world. In
fact, the subtitle of her book is ``A Balanced Christian
Response.'' Her goal, she says, is to give a realistic view of some
of the problems that might occur when the world's computers have to
cope with double zeros, and to give practical advice on how
individuals, nonprofit organizations and communities might help
each other through the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the Christian community don't want to
debate whether this is the end times,'' she says. ``They just want
to see the church ready for what could be a very important time of
service and witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldhahn, who was raised Presbyterian outside Washington, gave
her life to Jesus at a Catholic retreat while a senior at William
and Mary. ``That's where my life changed forever,'' she says.
``It's been a growth curve ever since.'' She now worships at
Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for the U.S. Senate Banking Committee during part of
the savings and loan crisis, then enrolled in Harvard for a
graduate degree in public policy. While there she met her husband,
who was heading Harvard Law School's Christian Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   She spent four years in New York as a financial analyst for the
Federal Reserve Bank and moved to Dunwoody a year ago with her
husband, a lawyer in the nonprofit sector.
</P>
<P>
   Feldhahn says she had no intention of becoming a spokeswoman on
Y2K, but began collecting information to satisfy her own curiosity.
A friend suggested that she write about the situation for a
Christian audience. When one thing after another fell into place,
Feldhahn became convinced that God was intervening. The project and
the response to it were far greater than she could have imagined,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay on board the train as it sped out of the
station,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Several metro Atlanta churches are among those acting on her
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer and Praise Christian Fellowship in Woodstock (Ga.) has
dug a well and a cistern, increased contributions to the church
food pantry, and prepared to turn the church into a community
shelter in case the neighborhood loses power. Hard copies of all
the church's important financial papers are safely stored, and
there are cash reserves for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Larry Baker, 52, pastor of the 120-member flock and
head of the Joseph Project 2000 in Cherokee County (Ga.), cites
Proverbs 22:3 on the wisdom of being ready for any eventuality.
``We have a responsibility to make preparations,'' he says. ``We're
not moving in fear but in faith.'' Baker says he is also
encouraging his congregation to prepare spiritually for Y2K, so
that they have a ``spirit of hope'' to get them through any
economic or logistical setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He justifies the actions his church has taken because the
cistern, the well and the food pantry will all be of use without
Y2K troubles. ``We're not being extravagant,'' he says. ``If
nothing happens, we've got a good mercy ministry in place.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying the Y2K issue, Susie Snow says, she realized how
inadequately she was prepared for any kind of disaster _ ``natural
disaster, blackout, I didn't have the provisions I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow, 40, is a stay-at-home mother married to the pastor of the
500-member Atlanta City Church in Fairburn (Ga.). She says she
spends about an hour a day searching the Internet, reading or
talking to people about Y2K preparation. ``The information I'm
obtaining, I'm sharing with our congregation and with other
churches on the Southside,'' she says. ``My goal basically is to
network churches and small businesses on the Southside with current
information on potential Y2K problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow is making up a bulk order for supplies such as water
containers, flashlights, battery-operated radios and kerosene
stoves, which she is circulating through the church.
</P>
<P>
   At home, she has a wood-burning stove and a generator. She
recommends considering nine areas of potential difficulty:
communication, finances, food and other basic supplies, health
needs, power, transportation, water, sanitation and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm getting prepared, I have peace of mind,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Snow spoke recently at Braelinn Baptist Church in Peachtree City
(Ga.). Under the leadership of an assistant pastor, the Rev. John
Hamblen, 52, the 730-member church is conducting a series of five
workshops on Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is that we really want to make people aware
without scaring them to death,'' says Hamblen. ``If we're all
working together, we'll get through it. If you start into
survivalist mode, it creates panic and doesn't do anybody any good.
We think as Christians, we are to be in the midst of any problem
helping and encouraging, not running and hiding and scaring
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dunwoody resident Feldhahn, the tornadoes of April 1998
serve as a ``useful reference'' in explaining to people what they
may face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a tornado hits, what happens?'' she asks. ``Power can go
out. Businesses may have to close. It takes five minutes and you're
still cleaning up five months later. It's not some big, weird
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Y2K bug can bring people together as they prepare, cope
and help each other, then it has served a purpose, she says. ``The
bottom line is that Y2K is just a catalyst I believe God will use
to get the church back to maybe where it should have been all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   Shaunti Feldhahn and Susie Snow offer the following advice on
how to prepare for Y2K:
</P>
<P>
   Family:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check appliances, security systems, heating and air
conditioning for date-related functions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check personal computer and software.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider the preparedness of services such as utilities,
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Store necessities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make arrangements for back-up phone, power.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Decrease debt or, if possible, be debt-free.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Maintain financial liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have copies of important family records.
</P>
<P>
   Church or business:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In logistical preparation, follow advice for families.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Provide information to the congregation and the community.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Examine how to reach out physically and spiritually to the
community in case gasoline distribution is disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Develop a strategy for working with other churches.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seek out high-risk households and plan to help meet their
needs.

 &HT;    Spoleto celebration a 70th birthday fete for beloved pianist
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Decked out in a blue seersucker suit and white suede
shoes, Charles Wadsworth has been resident cut-up at Spoleto
Festival USA's chamber-music series for the past 22 years. Tickling
the ivories and audience members' funny bones with equal aplomb,
the Newnan(Ga.)-born impresario has become one of the festival's
most beloved institutions.
</P>
<P>
   So for the maestro's 70th birthday, the Charleston, S.C., fest
will pay homage with a gala benefit starring pianist Peter Serkin,
violinst Pinchas Zukerman and an ensemble of yet-to-be-named
musicians championed by Wadsworth over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, set for June 1 at the historic Dock Street Theatre,
was announced Friday as the festival unveiled final plans for its
$5.5 million shindig, May 28-June 13. With the recent demise of the
Arts Festival of Atlanta, Spoleto is the South's only major
interdisciplinary arts fest this year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a new work by performance artist Laurie Anderson, the
U.S. premiere of a Kurt Weill opera and a trio of Puccini one-acts,
Spoleto '99 promises to be a mecca for music lovers of every
stripe. And while there is no festival-within-a-festival to compare
to last year's ``Echoes of Africa,'' there's a strong continuum of
Latin-inflected dance and music: Spain's Ballet Flamenco de Antonio
Canales, Cuban jazz pianist Frank Emilio Flynn, Brazilian dance
group Quasar and the Miami City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Rollins, widely regarded as the world's best tenor
saxophonist, is the jazz headliner. Also on the roster: Oregon, a
pioneer world-music ensemble, and Denise Jannah, a Surinam-born
chanteuse who sings in the classic style of Sarah Vaughan and Ella
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fret if you can't make the Wadsworth champagne soiree.
He'll preside at 34 chamber-music programs over the 17-day
festival. His series, in which he engages audiences with his witty
repartee, often affecting a hilarious faux-Italian accent, is one
of Spoleto's most popular components _ a routine sell-out.
</P>
<P>
   After Leonard Bernstein, Wadsworth, who led the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center for 20 years, has probably done more than
any other American figure to demystify the classical idiom. His
personable style is exactly what the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is
seeking in a new conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I'm being very selfish,'' says Wadsworth, known for
discovering soprano Jessye Norman, violin virtuoso Joshua Bell and
numerous other celebrity musicians while still in their youth.
``I'm giving myself the present of scheduling my favorite pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dvorak piano quintet, the Mendelssohn string octet ... It
will just go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber series is so popular that the Spoleto board of
directors recently decided to take it on the road. On Feb. 26,
Wadsworth and his Spoleto chamber group departs for its second
tour, playing 12 dates across the United States and Canada through
March 22. He says he eventually hopes to bring the group to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, whose birthday is May 2, will be toasted April 9 and
April 11 at Lincoln Center. He's doing gigs at Calloway Gardens
(GA.) on April 16-18. And on Feb. 20, he'll be in his hometown of
Newnan for a concert with pianist Stephen Prutsman, cellist
Kristina Cooper and violinst Sunsuke Sato, 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the greatest young fiddle player to come along
since Midori,'' says Wadsworth, who was honored last year when
Newnan named its municipal auditorium after him. He continues to
live in New York. Meanwhile, Spoleto producer Nunally A. Kersh says
she's eager to see how ``Mamba's Daughters'' _ a 1939 play by
Charleston native Dubose Heyward which has been restaged by New
York director David Herskovits _ will play with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the community feel a really personal
connection to the play,'' says Kersh. The Gullah drama, about an
African-American mother who sacrifices herself for her daughter,
will be performed throughout the festival run in the city where
Heyward wrote the novels ``Porgy'' and ``Mamba's Daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowcountry imprint can also be seen in a visual arts
installation by Washington, D.C., artist Martha Jackson-Jarvis,
whose ``Rice, Rattlesnakes and Rainwater'' was featured in the 1997
exhibition ``Human/Nature: Art and Landscape in Charleston and the
Low Country.'' Her new piece _ ``Rue, Rooks and Robin Eggs'' _ will
use house forms, oyster shells, historic images and wrought iron.
</P>
<P>
   In the new music series, one program will juxtapose composer
Charles Ives' 1899 music with work written in1999. Other concerts
will showcase compositions by John Luther Adam and series director
John Kennedy. Opera lovers may feast on original productions of
Puccini's ``Il Trittico'' and Weill's ``Die Burgschaft'' (``The
Pledge''). Other notable performances: Compagnie Philippe Genty, a
modern dance group from France; ``Kwaidan,'' a puppet show that
originated at the Center for Puppetry Arts last year; ``Ricky Jay
and His 52 Assistants,'' a one-man sleight-of-hand show directed by
David Mamet, and the Laurie Anderson musical theater production,
``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick.''

   Single tickets go on sale Monday. To order: 843-720-0402. To get
a brochure: 843-722-2764. Website: http://www.spoletousa.org.

OFFICIALS SAY TONY AWARDS WILL GO ON DESPITE RIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials of the 1999 Tony Awards said Friday that
this year's event would almost certainly proceed despite a
lingering contract dispute between the two organizations that
oversee the awards and the news that Rosie O'Donnell, a popular
recent host, would not work on this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, reported Friday in The New York Post, involves the
American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and
Producers, who are partners in a group that oversees the annual
theater awards.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the league announced that it would not renew its
agreement with the Wing to produce the show after 1999, and it has
been reported to be considering founding a rival awards program.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement apparently stems from the marketing of the
awards, now in their 52nd year.
</P>
<P>
   The league, a trade organization, has been aggressive about
promoting the Tonys, pushing for sponsors and other corporate
tie-ins for the awards. But officials at the wing, a philanthropic
group that started the awards, say they are skeptical of some of
these proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two organizations has delayed the
signing of this year's deal with the CBS network, which
traditionally broadcasts the show.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, officials for both the wing and the league
said they were close to an agreement for this year's event, to be
held in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make it happen,'' said Roy Somlyo, president of
the wing. ``I would find the possibility that there would be no
show extremely remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Somlyo's counterpart at the league also sounded hopeful. ``We
are optimistic that the regular discussions that both organizations
have been having will bear fruit in the next few weeks,'' said Jed
Bernstein, executive director of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the host of the program is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell was the host of the awards show last year and the
year before. In 1997 she was widely credited with increasing the
show's Nielsen ratings and its national visibility. Last year the
show's ratings slipped slightly, dipping below those of the 1993
broadcast, for which Liza Minnelli was host, but they were still
above those of the 1994, 1995 and 1996 broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said that Ms. O'Donnell, who has a daily TV talk
show and will be host of the Grammy Awards next month, was
overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is solely because of scheduling conflicts,'' said Jennifer
Glaisek, Ms. O'Donnell's publicity agent, who added that no formal
contract for this year's program had been signed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glaisek said Ms. O'Donnell's decision had nothing to do with
the dispute between the wing and the league. ``She loves
Broadway,'' she said, ``and if her schedule permits next year,
hopefully she would be able to do it.''

EITHER WAY, YOU WILL PAY
</HEADLINE>

By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there some way to install Win95 (after
formatting the hard drive) with the service packs rather than
standing in line again to download them and the various other
upgrades?
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting Over
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OVER: Yes. It's a three-step process:
</P>
<P>
   1. Become really good friends with a paramedic. Buy him a few
beers one night, and do some male bonding. Open up to him and let
him know you really care about his feelings and fears, his hopes
and dreams. Toast your friendship with five or six boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't stop yet. Take your newest best bud out to the finest
steakhouse in town. Start with 20-year-old single malt-scotch, have
a nice beaujolais with your dinner, then retire to the cigar room
for three or four rounds of Grand Marnier or perhaps Courvoisier _
this choice is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   3. On your way home from the restaurant, pick up a couple of
six-packs of Colt 45, then dare him to chug-a-lug. When he finally
passes out, take his keys, drive back to the firehouse, steal the
Jaws of Life, pry 90 bucks out of your wallet, find an all-night
software store and buy a Windows 98 upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're starting from scratch, so it doesn't make any sense
to load an ancient version of Windows, then apply a bunch of bug
fixes and patches to it. And that's all Win98 is: a debugged Win95
with some features that should have been in the original, but
weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Your other option _ and it's not exactly legal _ is to find
somebody who has the OSR2 release of Win95 and install that. You'll
be happier with 98.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I leave my machine on all day and only shut it
down at bedtime. I have it set to turn off the monitor after a
half-hour of non-use, the hard-drive after an hour, and often put
the system in standby mode if I know I'll be away from it for a
while. Is this OK to do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Power Ranger
</P>
<P>
   DEAR RANGER: That standby stuff makes more sense for laptops
with limited battery life than it does for desktop PCs. It doesn't
hurt anything, however _ the PC is just sucking up less juice while
it's in standby, helping to preserve our vital natural resources. I
get the feeling, though, that if you're already leaving the thing
on all day, that's not exactly No. 1 on your priority list. Don't
worry, I won't tell the tree-huggers.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How do you clean the mouse pads and wrist rests
that get full of dirt, dried sweat and whatever else there is while
we spend hours upon hours looking at stuff that we know we are not
supposed to?
</P>
<P>
   _ Big Mess
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIG: You know, I'm not entirely sure I want to know what
you're trying to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, guy! These are mouse pads! Mouse pads! Take two bucks
and go buy a new one, because _ believe me _ you're never going to
get all those stains out. And this time, get a wrist rest with a
removable, washable cover, one of those things with a gel filling.
Not only are they extremely comfortable, they also have a certain
sensual quality that I find really ... but perhaps I've said too
much already.

AMID TV'S HYPE, THERE'S HOPE _ `SUNDAY MORNING'
</HEADLINE>

By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Here in the land of fluff and fantasy, where
most decisions are based on bottom line and buzz, and where youth
and beauty are more valuable than talent, Charles Osgood is an
engaging enigma.
</P>
<P>
   The host of ``CBS News Sunday Morning,'' the acerbic
newsmagazine whose 20th-anniversary show airs at 8 a.m. CST Sunday,
is 65, for one thing. And in the many years he has reported for CBS
News, he has defied network demographics and some ticked-off
consultants by making tightly knotted bow ties his on-air calling
card.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News President Andrew Heyward kicked off a recent news
conference by introducing Osgood and his producer, Missie Rennie,
who made brief comments before opening the floor to questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first was about the bow tie. What, someone asked
Osgood, was his take on ``Dress for Success'' author John Molloy's
theory that bow ties undercut credibility?
</P>
<P>
   This obviously has been of constant amusement to Osgood, who
leaned back and smiled. ``Studies have been done on this,
actually,'' he said, sounding like a kid who'd been holding on to a
secret. ``It shows that people do not trust you if you wear a bow
tie. (Molloy) says, if you're going to wear the bow tie, you may as
well wear the rest of the ensemble: a beanie with a propeller.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, but later, after the news conference, Osgood
took a more serious tone. ``I think once we start attaching those
kind of theories on the human mind and human heart, it can become a
little dangerous,'' he said. ``We're all independent thinkers. We
shouldn't be told that a bow tie, or anything else, cripples
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Committed fans of ``Sunday Morning'' know that during its
two-decade run, during its first 15 years with host Charles Kuralt
and its transition to Osgood, nothing has disturbed the Sunday
morning peace that is the show's foundation. How, then, could a
fashion accessory?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that in April, Osgood will celebrate his five-year
anniversary as host is a testament to how gently he has moved into
the mix of television's most distinctive and thoughtful series.
</P>
<P>
   For years, ``Sunday Morning'' has represented television's last
great novella of short stories, storytelling and heartfelt
programming. It almost seems like overkill to speak of it in terms
of touching the heart, mind and soul of viewers. But it remains the
only place where you can find slice-of-life and hard-edged stories
on theater, arts, music, literature, sports and history _ all
within a 90-minute program, all told without time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Even while keeping its pace slow and mood-soothing to align
itself with the leisurely rhythm of a weekend morning, ``Sunday
Morning'' has continued to be intelligent and distinctive and even
current, providing news updates from CBS News correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has, obviously, changed since Charles Kuralt retired,''
Heyward said. ``But one of the things that has been encouraging to
me is how increasingly it has become Charles Osgood's program,
something that reflects his personality and his interests and his
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood still opens the show standing next to the Plexiglas
tower, and it still ends with buzzing and chirping from some nature
outpost. Kuralt's ``Milepost,'' a thought of the week to open the
show, has become ``The Osgood File.'' But generally, Osgood has had
a hands-off approach.
</P>
<P>
   It has apparently appeased the ``Sunday Morning'' audience, a
demanding group whose average age is slightly over 55. There was
some audience erosion, which Heyward expected, given Kuralt's
dedicated following. But the audience numbers, almost 4 million,
are finally closing in on pre-Osgood levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that surprises me is that, with all of the
new broadcasts, nobody is doing what we do,'' Osgood said. ``It was
Fred Allen who said, `Imitation is the sincerest form of
television,' but in fact, nobody has really tried to imitate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Osgood paused. ``Because deep down, in their souls,
television people don't believe that people really want this stuff.
They don't really believe that people are intelligent, and that
they care about the arts, and they're interested in nature and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood has had a roundabout career. As a student at Fordham, he
worked on the college radio station with actor Alan Alda. He went
to work at ABC Radio after a stint as the announcer for the U.S.
Army Band. At ABC, he was forced to drop his real last name, Wood,
for his middle name, Osgood, because a Charles Wood already worked
there.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC Radio in the early '60s, he met a young reporter named
Ted Koppel. The two became friends and together proposed a morning
show for ABC television that Osgood says was designed to compete
with NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   Osgood left ABC for CBS Radio when the network ran with the idea
but passed on him as host. He soon began filling in for TV anchor
Roger Mudd, however, and from then on his name surfaced as a
possibility for a number of high-profile, on-camera jobs, until
Kuralt retired.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder radio continues to be Osgood's first love. Every
weekday morning, he delivers his ``Osgood Files'' commentaries on
CBS Radio. There are four each morning, usually addressing some
offbeat story that Osgood has found on the news wires or some
equally offbeat issue that seemed ripe for his delectable prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear people talk of the format and whether you can stick
anyone in it and make it work,'' says Rennie. ``You can't. That
Charles has made the transition seem so effortless is a testament
to his talent, not how tightly formatted the show is.''
</P>
<P>
   All this season, ``Sunday Morning'' has been rebroadcasting
classic segments, such as a Joe DiMaggio interview conducted about
15 years ago, a profile of Yo-Yo Ma at age 20, Tiger Woods at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Rennie counts as one of the extraordinary traditions of ``Sunday
Morning'' its discovery of unique talents and voices early on in
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we're really striving to do is present a show
that five or 10 years from now somebody else is pulling from the
archives and saying, `This is an extraordinary piece, an
extraordinary story, and it deserves to go on television again,'''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   And the bow tie? ``I'm certain that'll be a topic of
conversation in the decades to come, as well.''

JERRY FALWELL HAS A LOT OF APOLOGIZING TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another high-profile evangelical, this time the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, has stuck his foot in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell would like to take back his remarks made recently
stating that the evil Antichrist probably is alive today and, of
course, will be a Jewish man.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, who made his remarks at a recent pastors conference in
Kingsport, Tenn., has apologized. He said his remarks were not
meant to be anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   They only reflected, he said, a theory that the Antichrist
likely would disguise himself as Jesus of Nazareth, who, of course,
was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jesus came to the earth the first time 2,000 years ago
as a Jewish male, most evangelicals believe the Antichrist will, by
necessity, be a Jewish male also,'' Falwell explained in a
statement aimed at clarifying his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But others saw the comments as millennial madness.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's statement represents ``an especially vicious tradition
of Christian theological anti-Judaism,'' said Abraham Foxman,
national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears clear that after years of Christian-Jewish
dialogue, Rev. Falwell hasn't learned a thing,'' Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If Rev. Falwell and others persist in these
statements, they will be instigating an anti-Semitism rooted in
Christian theological extremism.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's blunder reminds me of a similar faux pas made almost
20 years ago by another well-known evangelist, the Rev. Bailey
Smith, then president of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declared ``God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a
Jew'' during a speech before 20,000 religious right conservatives
in Dallas. Ronald Reagan, then a presidential candidate, also spoke
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith was castigated for his statement, he apologized for
any offense he had caused. He even led his denomination in
establishing a new Baptist-Jewish dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Smith accepted an invitation to attend a Passover Seder
with the family of Mark Briskman of Dallas, the Southwest regional
director of the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it as if it were yesterday,'' Briskman said this
week of the Bailey Smith controversy. He still is regional director
of the Jewish human rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Briskman believes _ and I agree _ that Falwell is sincere in
saying that he did not intend for his remarks to be taken as
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Jewish leader said Falwell's remarks were
``surprising, troubling and very problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does, he says, is help to legitimize the Jew haters,
the anti-Semites,'' Briskman said. ``Clearly, I don't think that
was Falwell's intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian leaders, including the Rev. Clyde Glazener,
pastor of the Gambrell Street Baptist Church in Fort Worth, don't
agree that the Antichrist has to be a Jewish male.
</P>
<P>
   Glazener said no one knows who the Antichrist will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people in the past identifying Hitler, Mussolini and
other obviously evil people as the Antichrist,'' said Glazener.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't have a clue who the Antichrist will be. And
as little as I know about it, I think I know as much as Jerry
Falwell.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg,
Va., has traveled to Israel 30 times and has met with every Israeli
prime minister from Menachem Begin to Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, he is strong supporter of Israel as a nation. He
sees himself as a friend of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   But he could undo a lot of the good will he has established
unless he continues to apologize loud and long for his
shoot-from-the hip remarks about the Antichrist.

 &HT;    History-infused quilts showcase fabric of Georgia women's lives'
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even in the 1800s,'' notes an Atlanta History Center
ad, ``women kept diaries. They just slept under them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the lives of Georgia women through the quilts they left
behind is at the heart of the history center exhibit ``Georgia
Quilts: Piecing Together History,'' which continues through Sept.
5. Made up of 80 hand-sewn treasures dating from 1800 to 1920, the
show is bookended by birth and death.
</P>
<P>
   The first section visitors see, contained in two glass cases at
the entrance, is titled Rites of Passage. On the left, beside her
1895 quilt, Lilla Owens Thrash looks out from an old photograph,
posed with a man and two young boys. She made her quilt in
anticipation of the birth of her first child. Because all four of
them died at birth, her family portrait was taken with her husband
and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Jordan pieced together the orange-red ``Pickle Dish'' in
1910 to commemorate the birth of her first son, Vernard. She
stitched their names into the corner in golden thread, noting that
her boy was ``Age 9 Mo. old When the quilt Was Finished.'' Her
picture is propped under the pieces of her old wooden quilting
frame.
</P>
<P>
   In the case to the right, Elizabeth Grace Jones Dunn's ``Quilt
of Words'' fills the back wall. Made in Arkansas in 1890, her final
project conveys her dying thoughts: ``O THAT I HAD WINGS LIKE A
DOVE THEN WOULD FLY AWAY AD BE AT REST AFTER SEVENTY EIGT YEARS AND
SIX MONTHS E G DUNN FINI.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne McKinne Winter's extravagant ``Tumbling Blocks'' is a
statement of another sort. A luxuriantly geometric field of rich
blues and golds, deep reds and brown, her quilt was made to
commemorate her own widowhood. When her husband died in 1861,
Winter was only 35. Once she put on black to mourn him, she never
took it off. She cut her expensive Paris-made trousseau into bright
cubes of satin for a quilt, anchoring the bottom of each with a
diamond of black velvet. She backed it with the fabric of a red
dress her husband had bought her in New York and that she had never
worn. She died 51 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Co-curator Janice Morrill says it's her favorite quilt in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her story is so dramatic,'' she says. ``Talk about a symbolic
gesture!''

   FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24, 1999
</P>
<P>
   By Larry Lipman
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service 1999
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the heart of President Clinton's answer to
Social Security's long-term fiscal problems is a question: should
the federal government invest in the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message last week, Clinton offered two
ways of boosting Social Security by investing in the stock and bond
markets.
</P>
<P>
   One way involves the government directly investing a portion of
the surplus; the other way involves individuals investing part of
the surplus in accounts which they will control.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hate the first idea but love the second. Democrats,
generally, are receptive to the first idea but wary of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of that dispute could play a large role in
determining whether Congress and the White House fix Social
Security for the next half century or not.
</P>
<P>
   To get the Republican-controlled Congress to accept his plan to
have government investments, Clinton offered to use some of the
projected $4.4 trillion federal surplus for individual investment
accounts, which he calls ``universal savings accounts'' or ``USA
Accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he'll give them those USA Accounts, Clinton wants to
use another part of the surplus _ about $700 billion over 15 years
_ to invest in the stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of government investment are worried primarily about
two things: how the investments would be made and what happens if
government owns stock in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the Ways and Means
Social Security subcommittee, says he can envision heated
congressional debates over whether to invest in strip mining or
nuclear waste disposal. Ways and Means Chairman, Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, questions whether the government would invest in tobacco
companies or gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morality is in the eyes of the beholder,'' Shaw said, noting
that products shunned by some individuals _ such as cigarettes or
guns _ is embraced by others. ``We'd be putting the Good
Housekeeping seal of approval on some and blackening the reputation
of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed similar
concerns about investment decisions being influenced by politics
when he appeared Wednesday before Archer's committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate
such huge funds from governmental direction,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel acknowledges the
difficulty in insulating investment decisions from politics, but he
said he believes it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the administration believes that it should be the
government that is choosing stocks,'' Apfel said. ``The modest
investment in equities would be done by an independent body from
the private sector shielded from any public influence.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of such models, Apfel said, including the
federal employees' pension fund and virtually every state and local
government employee pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   State and local pension funds nationwide invest an average of 60
percent of their money in the market, rather than in government
securities, Apfel said. At the height of the Social Security
investment _ in about 15 to 20 years _ roughly 15 percent of the
Social Security system would be invested in the private market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, state and local pension investments account for about
10 percent of the money in the stock market. In about 20 years, the
Social Security investment would account for between 4 percent and
5 percent of the market, Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan is a sharply reduced version of a proposal
endorsed by six of the 13 members of the government's Social
Security Advisory Council of outside experts two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Ball, a former Social Security commissioner under
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, was the lead author of the
council's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security has been handicapped over the years in being
made to invest in low-yield government bonds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, political influence would be minimized by
investing in broad-based index funds that would include 3,000 to
5,000 stocks. It would be further minimized by appointing a control
board, similar to the Federal Reserve Board, whose members would
serve for long terms that extend beyond the tenure of a
presidential administration, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also are concerned with the impact of government
ownership of so much stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's back-door socialism,'' said Michael Tanner, director of
the Cato Institute's project on Social Security privatization.
</P>
<P>
   (Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   He notes that state employee pension funds are increasingly
attempting to influence corporate decisions regarding the
environment, economic development and ``humanitarian problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Arnone, a partner in the accounting and consulting firm
Ernst and Young, said Wall Street firms ``just inherently don't
like the idea'' of government investments in private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnone said ``I don't think there would be significant
opposition to index funds.''

<P>
   PARIS _ Just about everyone who comes to the haute couture
collections knows that Nan is Nan Kempner, that Deeda is Deeda
Blair and that Liliane Bettencourt, who was seated Wednesday in the
front row at the Yves Saint Laurent show and wearing an orange
muffler, is the richest woman in France.
</P>
<P>
   They may or may not know that the youngest couture customer at
Givenchy is all of 8, or that Dodie Rosekrans, the San Francisco
art patron and couture stalwart, recently bought a full-size
guillotine covered with the Chanel logo for her home in Venice. But
give them time. Paris is probably the only place on earth where the
world's rich, titled and tucked can always count on being
connected, if only through clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Couture separates the small-time fashion player from those who
can play the game at its liveliest, which is to say at the big
Paris houses where a custom-made suit without any detail to speak
of costs about $10,000. Throw in some embroidery, a chiffon blouse,
maybe a coat with feathers around the throat, and suddenly madame
is in a different stratosphere: $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 even
$100,000 for a dress.
</P>
<P>
   But that's why it's called haute. There are only about 300 women
in the world who have the couture life style and the means to
indulge it regularly. Some of them are well known, like Mrs.
Kempner. But most are rich unknowns from Florida or Brazil, whose
husbands made it big in lumber or real estate. As Karl Lagerfeld
said last week, ``They don't want to be known, but they have money
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with so many magazine editors running up to see
Josephus Thimister, one of the newer haute couture designers, or
over to the Marais to catch an exhibition by Tom Sachs _ it was
Sachs, a New York artist, who came up with the idea of constructing
the Chanel guillotine, bought by Mrs. Rosekrans, out of police
barricades _ couture is also a scene. Up at Chanel, Lagerfeld was
holding forth, talking to this editor and that, sketching with his
special blend of brown ink, quoting Verlaine, sipping Diet Coke and
saying he thought Sachs' guillotine was amusing _ but not that
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too obvious, no?'' he said, squinting.
</P>
<P>
   What about the clothes that finished out the spring
haute-couture season on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld's Chanel show on Tuesday had all the lightness that
one has come to expect from modern fashion. He took out the linings
of his mostly short, body-hugging jackets, so that they fitted as
cozily as cardigans and, in one superb number, actually finessed
the question of fabric by embroidering an orange-flecked boucle
check on tulle.
</P>
<P>
   This was a testament to the designer's imagination and the skill
of the Chanel workrooms. But the trouble with so much lightness is
that it lacks substance, and even though these fluid, sporty
clothes were close in spirit to Coco Chanel's ultramodern ideal,
they seemed destined to fade into the woodwork. Women want
something that looks like a skirt or a blouse _ not some drippy,
indecisive silhouette in the bleached-out hues of the seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld also seemed to be having trouble with his bottoms.
Baggy in the rear, loose through the leg, his many trousers pooled
in sloppy folds around the ankles, where they were buttoned.
Giorgio Armani tried this style more than a decade ago, and it may
have worked then, but it's hard to believe that Lagerfeld's
customers can honestly picture themselves going for it now _ and
with cargo pockets, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, Lagerfeld said, ``In a way, everything that's
interesting has roots.'' This is true, but it's also possible to
get lost in the past. Lagerfeld, bored or merely resting, needs to
shake the dust off those bones.
</P>
<P>
   There was something almost brutal about Christian Lacroix's show
in the opulent ballroom of the Grand Hotel _ brutal in its
single-minded vision, brutal in its attempt to remain true to the
past. Yet it was profoundly, brilliantly alive. Lacroix did this in
a number of ingenious ways. A pale pink bustier, worn with a short
skirt hemmed in lacquered Chantilly lace, came wrapped with thin
bands of taupe velvet that were given a kind of destroyed look by
sewing wisps of frayed denim to each band.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix is a great post-modernist. He knows how to mix the
street with the luxe, in the same way that Saint Laurent did a
quarter-century ago, but now with the subtlety demanded by a more
jaded, sophisticated world. Here was a collection that was often
sumptuous _ overblown skirts in rose-colored satin, an extravagant
bow, a pile of lace. Then out came a pale-yellow sheath in
stiffened chiffon, its bodice embroidered with tiny strips of
frayed gray and brown gauze, so that it resembled the feathery
remains in an abandoned nest. This was the real thing _ couture
with a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lot of what turns up on the runways looks old and
bland and safe, it can't be said that couture is dying. New people
keep coming along, designers like Thimister, a Belgian who will
show his first ready-to-wear collection for Genny next month in
Milan, and Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, who work out of
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor and Rolf, as they are called, put on a terrific show on
Tuesday in one of those arty dumps with chipped concrete walls and
ducts running everywhere. The clothes were all black and white _ a
black satin pants suit with tiny pinstripes of ruffled white gazar,
a tuxedo with a preposterously large Flemish ruff in fraying, white
silk.
</P>
<P>
   The designers staged their show in black light, so that all you
could see were the white details, and the audience's teeth. It was
weirdly brilliant and a more modern take on Surrealism than
Galliano's Dali trip the day before. It brought to mind a scene in
Tom Wolfe's profile of Marshall McLuhan, when he and McLuhan were
sitting in a dimly lighted restaurant being served by topless
waitresses, and McLuhan said, ``When you dim the visual sense, you
step up the sense of taste,'' adding: ``You are brought together
sensually and sensorially, forced out of the isolation of the
visual man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viktor and Rolf show had the same effect, except without the
breasts. It made you think of fashion in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   Thimister's show also was compelling, mainly for its couture
treatment of cheap fabrics like cotton voile. For instance,
Thimister used heat and plastic on long voile skirts and dresses to
make them look crinkled and papery. He recycled two military
raincoats into a strapless gown, folding and draping the lapels and
sleeves of the coats around the hem, so that the original garments
were absorbed into the new one. It was intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yves Saint Laurent and Oscar de la Renta,
designing for Balmain, brought the season to a close with good,
wearable clothes that are the mainstay of the two houses.

PARIS: two houses.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing to a packed front row of loyal and well-coiffed clients,
including Catherine Deneuve, Mrs. Blair and France Goldman _ a
relatively new haute couture customer from Florida, who attended
all the big shows with her husband, David _ Saint Laurent showed
his classic suits with sheer chiffon blouses. The colors were
vintage Saint Laurent, with lots of purple, peacock blue, vivid
pink and smoky brown mixed with black.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, there were mostly draped gowns in flowery chiffon
or silk crepe, one in white with dark feathers splashing over the
shoulders. It was a predictable collection, but with Saint
Laurent's influence everywhere these days, particularly at Jean
Paul Gaultier, it's hard to hold that against him.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of Balmain as ``Oscar's show,'' and who at
Balmain can complain? Everyone who counts was there, from European
aristocrats to a couple of the Miller sisters, Alexandra Von
Furstenberg and Marie-Chantal, wife of Crown Prince Pavlos of
Greece, who was attending with her.
</P>
<P>
   As for the show, there were lots of cream- and sand-colored
jackets and slim pants; a lovely stone-colored cocktail ensemble
with a silvery beaded top, and a white caftan embroidered in
rustic, red-hued paisley. The collection had a light, young touch,
though it could have been a little less bread-and-butter correct
and more flesh-and-blood sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the Balmain show, Mrs. Goldman, a blonde, who is
French-Canadian, gave her summary of the season. ``I liked
Jean-Paul Gaultier,'' she said. ``To me, his was one of the best
collections. And Christian Lacroix. I was a little disappointed
with Dior. Galliano has the atelier, all the backup and talent, but
I don't know what's happening to him. The last two collections have
been a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, whose business is in metals and chemicals, was
obviously taking a keen interest in the whole thing. He had marked
the numbers he liked for his wife. ``Well, we have our fittings
tomorrow, and I think we have five,'' he said. ``There's something
in every line that we will probably buy.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the worst violence in Indonesia since
May, 45 people have died in four days of rioting between Muslims
and Christians on the island of Ambon, local officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's rioting, burning, looting,'' said one American who
fled to Australia, in an interview on Australian television. Some
40 foreigners fled to Australia from the island.
</P>
<P>
   Police say more than 100 people have been injured, 88 homes
destroyed along with three mosques, and three churches burned.
Vehicles and shops have also gone up in flame. A curfew has been
imposed on the city and some 2,500 soldiers and police have been
deployed to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said more than 4,000 residents had sought
shelter in police and army compounds after riots erupted Tuesday,
sparked by an argument on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In his first response to the Ambon violence President B.J.
Habibie said Friday that the town was now secure. ``The armed
forces commander has reported that the situation in Ambon is
quiet,'' he said. ``Religious leaders and public figures have
discussed it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport remains closed and large areas of the city are still
without power.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Ambon, a resident, Demi Luthermas,
said the security forces had gained control of the town. ``Today
there are not so many problems _ the military has taken control.
All shops and offices are closed and the army is patrolling the
streets,'' he said. Ambon, 1,300 miles northeast of Jakarta, is the
capital of Maluku province, formerly known as the Spice Islands or
Moluccas.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's police chief, Lt.-Gen. Roesmanhadi, told a news
conference in Jakarta on Thursday, ``This violence is purely
criminal in nature and has no political background.'' He said that
rioting had also broken out on neighboring Seram island just north
of Ambon and that two churches had been set alight. But the clashes
follow months of unrest, and diplomats warn that the security
situation is likely to worsen before the national elections on June
7.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting, and fears of it spreading, were behind a drop in
the Indonesian currency in trading on Friday, financial analysts
said.

 &HT;    KEY MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE DEFENDS GIANT'S CONDUCT
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Microsoft executive accused of once
threatening to ``cut off Netscape's air supply'' takes the stand
Monday at the company's antitrust trial, he will describe
Microsoft's climb to the top of the software world like a game of
king of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz's 159 pages of written testimony, released Friday,
portray a brutal business universe in which Microsoft's rivals
relentlessly strive to knock the industry's giant off its high
perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid innovation and strong competition in the computer
industry means that no company, including Microsoft, has a
guaranteed position,'' Maritz wrote. As the company's flagship
product, Windows ``faces intense competition from many sources,''
even as it serves as the operating brain of 90 percent of the
world's personal computer, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As the first of nine Microsoft employees to be called by the
defense, Maritz will seek to persuade U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that a dozen prior government witnesses either
exaggerated or lied.
</P>
<P>
   He brands the teller of the infamous ``air supply'' quote as a
liar. ``I never said, in the presence of Intel (Corp.) personnel or
otherwise, that Microsoft would 'cut off Netscape's air supply,' or
words to that effect,'' Maritz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Maritz must champion the defense cause in the face of
hundreds of his own e-mail messages already entered into evidence _
with many more to come next week _ each aimed at buttressing the
government's broad charges of illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Firing back, Maritz accuses the government of seeking to
``portray instances of routine interaction between companies in the
computer industry, who inevitably must deal with one another, as
something nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group vice president for platforms and applications, Maritz
falls in seniority below only Microsoft's multibillionaire
chairman, Bill Gates, and its billionaire president, Steve Ballmer.
A multimillionaire in his own right, the executive who pilots
Microsoft's core operating-systems business has studiously
cultivated a low profile during his 13 years with the Redmond,
Wash., firm.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed when the federal government, in filing its
antitrust suit last May, focused on his alleged ``air supply''
comments to portray Microsoft as predator that has sought to
leverage its huge market power to crush its competitors, including
Netscape Communications Corp., its main rival in the browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to cut off their air supply,'' Maritz was quoted
as having said at a November 1995 meeting in discussing Microsoft's
plans to drive Netscape to the wall. ``Everything they're selling,
we're going to give away for free.''
</P>
<P>
   That testimony came from Intel Vice President Steven McGeady,
who earlier in the trial recalled the conference with Maritz and
other Microsoft brass in Oregon to review technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and some of the other attendees made some fairly colorful
statements that stick out in my memory,'' McGeady said on the
stand. ``... It was Microsoft's plan to cut off Netscape's air
supply. By giving away free browsers, Microsoft was going to keep
Netscape from getting off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers accused McGeady of making up the quote. They
confronted McGeady with his own notes about the disputed meeting,
which failed to mention Maritz's purported ``air supply'' comment.
And they produced notes from two other Intel executives, who also
didn't include it.
</P>
<P>
   But McGeady stuck to his account, telling the court: ``The
phrase was so far out of bounds with what I consider to be an
acceptable business practice. It stuck out clearly in my mind.''

CHILD RESEARCHERS QUESTION IDEA OF INBORN ABILITY TO COPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Minnesota)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Despite awful home and school environments
that thwart some children from growing up well, other children in
seemingly similar circumstances grow up just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have identified those children as resilient,
singling out a trait that seems to keep them on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   But a panel of scientists gathered here Thursday disputed the
idea of inborn capacity to succeed against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, studies show that children who get support
and nurturing early in life _ or who get the support when the going
gets tough _ are the ones who best weather adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way kids come out depends on their experience,'' L. Alan
Sroufe of the University of Minnesota said at the American
Association for the Advancement of Science meeting. ``There aren't
kids who can make it all right no matter what. If experience throws
you enough slings and arrows, you will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 23 years, Sroufe has followed the successes and
failures of 180 poor children in Minnesota. His findings led him to
call resilience in children a ``developmental achievement'' that
comes from earlier positive experiences, rather than a ``mystery''
that seems to randomly visit one child rather than another.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his collaborators had been able to predict by age
3 with 77 percent accuracy which children in the sample would later
drop out of school. The predictions were based on environmental
factors such as the responsiveness of caregiver, how well the child
was provided for, and the level of chaos in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Although brothers and sisters from the same family often turn
out differently, Sroufe said, that doesn't mean their home lives
weren't a factor, since parents vary in the way they treat each
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child they treat most harshly will be the child that shows
the most problems,'' Sroufe said.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems even well-functioning children, if put in a poor
environment, will fare worse than poorer-functioning children in a
good environment, according to Arnold Sameroff, a researcher at the
University of Michigan who has followed another set of children
from birth through age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more things going wrong in a family, the worse the outcome
will be,'' Sameroff said. ``Can they overcome their context? The
answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sameroff ticked off more factors that can contribute to a
child's downfall, including poverty, bad schools, discrimination,
family stress and bad neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He said research shows that a single factor, such as poverty,
does not doom a child, but it is only when several are piled on
that the weight becomes too great.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Masten, a psychology professor at the University of
Minnesota, has followed yet another set of children and has found
some traits _ including good thinking skills and self confidence _
that are markers of children who seem to bounce back. But effective
parents are essential, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the going gets tough, for sure parenting begins to really
matter, and intellectual development matters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One hopeful sign is that children whose environments improve do
seem to get better. There have been reports of striking recoveries
of some children rescued from awful orphanages in Romania, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   And Sroufe said there were children in his group who appeared to
be headed down the wrong path but later recovered. It usually
coincided with the child's mother forming a strong, stable
relationship. (Most of Sroufe's subjects came from families headed
by a single mother).
</P>
<P>
   And he said a mother who recovers from depression can have a
positive effect on some children.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the
eastern Ohio Valley will be lifted by a powerful jet-stream
disturbance resulting in heavy rain with embedded bands of potent
thunderstorms. Meanwhile, unsettled weather will be common west of
the crest of the Rockies as a series of disturbances begin to draw
colder air into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms accompanied by torrential rain, hail and
damaging winds will erupt in the tepid air ahead of a cold front
from the southern Appalachians to Florida. Farther north, heavy
rain will gradually move east from the eastern Ohio Valley into the
central Appalachians. On Saturday night, melting snow and ice will
combine with the downpours to heighten the risk of flash flooding
from northern Ohio to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing winds from the south will displace cool air near the
northeast coast. The milder air will meet resistance over extreme
northern New England where a period of freezing rain and drizzle
will occur. Otherwise, mostly cloudy conditions will prevail
Saturday and Saturday night before heavy rain arrives early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few snow and rain showers will linger over the
northern Mississippi valley as northerly breezes deliver colder
air. Farther west, mainly dry conditions will prevail from the
Plains to the east slopes of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A band of rain and heavy mountain snow will accompany a cold
front as it moves south through central and northern California.
The Northwest will be chilly with coastal showers and patchy snow
in the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Time for Twisters
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of just eight minutes Thursday evening, two
tornadoes tore across Searcy, Ark. Meanwhile, at Greenville, Miss.,
two tornadoes were reported in a little more than two hours late
Thursday. Tornado season begins along the Gulf Coast in January and
February, when warm, humid air streaming rapidly northward from the
Gulf of Mexico is lifted by cold, potent jet-stream disturbances
from the Pacific Ocean or Canada. North of the Gulf Coast states,
tornado season begins in spring or summer, waiting until the
retreating jet stream and Gulf air simultaneously arrive.

VENEZUELA FEELING THE HEAT OF COLOMBIA'S CIVIL WAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Jan. 24) 
(Eds.: Accent mark needed over i in Pais) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL NULA, Venezuela _ The creased, handwritten note from the
Colombian guerrilla was cordial, but to Venezuelan rancher Santiago
Moncada, it read like a not-so-subtle threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of this is to find out whether it's possible to
provide us with two head of cattle. If so, please deliver them to
the night watchman,`` said the letter, which was addressed to
Moncada and signed by ``Lenin'' of the National Liberation Army,
known by its Spanish initials ELN.
</P>
<P>
   As Colombia's civil war enters its 35th year, the conflict is
increasingly spilling over into peaceful, oil-rich Venezuela.
Rebels from the ELN, Colombia's second-largest Marxist guerrilla
group, cross the border at will to escape the Colombian army to
treat wounded fighters and to raise money through extortion and
kidnappings, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers like Moncada risk being abducted unless they comply
with rebel demands to provide them with food and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either collaborate with them or you leave the area,''
Moncada explained.
</P>
<P>
   In response, some Venezuelan ranchers have started paying
Colombian paramilitary death squads for protection, according to
human rights activists in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan government has dispatched thousands of troops to
the zone and has built a ``model city'' to retake control of the
border. But the militarization of the frontier has led to a surge
in human rights abuses. And as ranchers and businessmen pull out,
the local economy has become a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to invest due to the insecurity of the
area,'' said Margarita Urbina, a rancher who lives near the border
town of El Nula in Apure state and has put her land up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela isn't the only nation suffering the fallout of
Colombia's war.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has become a rear-guard safe haven and a gunrunning route
for Colombian guerrillas. The tiny nation, which was once part of
Colombia, has absorbed about 2,000 war refugees. An isolated
Panamanian jungle village was raided by paramilitaries 14 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Colombian guerrillas regularly cross into Ecuador
to run guns, hide kidnapping victims and to rest up following
military operations, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, however, has the most to lose if the conflict
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Part of its border area with Colombia has turned into an ELN
sanctuary. The 3,000-member rebel group, which has kidnapped
hundreds of Colombians each year for huge ransoms to help finance
its war, began targeting Venezuelans in the mid-1990s when
Colombia's economy began to stagnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombian ranchers are poorer,'' said Juan Francisco Mesa of
the Bogota group Pais Libre, which counsels the relatives of
kidnapping victims. ``The Colombians also have better
anti-kidnapping capabilities. So, (the guerrillas) crossed the
border.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Venezuelans are kidnapped annually, including 72 last
year. Many abductions, however, are the work of common criminals,
said Feijoo Colomine, Venezuela's vice minister for borders.
</P>
<P>
   With its army overextended trying to turn back rebel threats
across its own country, Colombia has paid scant attention to the
problem in Venezuela, Colomine said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has beefed up police and National Guard border
patrols, but that may have made matters worse, human rights
officials say. More than a dozen Venezuelan troops have been killed
or wounded in skirmishes with the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas know the area better than the armed forces,''
said Alvaro Cattini, who directs a palm-oil project on the border.
``This is their back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that Venezuelan soldiers aren't always viewed
as the good guys.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, they massacred 14 fishermen in a botched raid on
guerrillas. Constitutional guarantees along the border were
suspended in 1994, giving troops the right to enter homes and
arrest Venezuelans without judicial orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel hostile toward the armed forces because they
mistreat them,'' said Colomine, who was once detained overnight by
soldiers despite the fact that he showed his government ID badge.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Colombian newsweekly Semana, Hugo Chavez, who
will be sworn in as Venezuela's president on Feb. 2, met secretly
with ELN leaders in 1995, urging them to call off their military
attacks and to refrain from kidnapping Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, tensions have eased slightly, but the ELN continues
to operate as a kind of parallel government in remote Venezuelan
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Some border residents have grudgingly accepted the rebels'
presence. In return for food or payments, the ELN provides
protection from cattle rustlers and an informal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Cattini said the rebels demand that Venezuelan ranchers pay
Colombian laborers fair wages. They have also mediated divorces and
recently pressed a drunken driver to pay for damages and medical
costs following a car accident, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rely on the guerrillas when they have no one else to
resolve their problems,'' said Alfredo Ruiz, a researcher for the
Caracas-based Peace and Justice Network, a human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Even road contractors for a government-funded highway connecting
the border with the Venezuelan capital of Caracas were forced to
pay ``war taxes'' to the ELN to finish the last leg of the project,
Colomine said.
</P>
<P>
   With little faith in government authorities, large landowners
have considered forming their own paramilitary squads. One group
requested, and was denied, a government permit to import assault
rifles, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Colombian side of the border, such infrastructure is
already in place. Formed in the 1980s to fight the guerrillas and
their civilian supporters, the Colombian paramilitaries number
about 5,000 fighters and have carried out hundreds of massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Venezuelan authorities detained six Colombian
paramilitaries in the Venezuelan border state of Apure. Mesa, of
Pas Libre, has talked with Venezuelan ranchers who have admitted to
paying Colombian paramilitaries for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are paramilitary groups financed by
Venezuelan ranchers,'' Mesa said. ``It's easier for them to pay
Colombian paramilitaries than to rely on the National Guard'' for
help.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence that Venezuelans are operating
their own militias, Ruiz said. But Carlos Castano, a self-styled
warlord who heads Colombia's paramilitary umbrella organization,
told Semana last August that Venezuelans have joined one of his
fronts operating along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group of 70 people in the border area with
Venezuela. Half are Venezuelans. They came to our training
schools,'' Castano said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's efforts to attract people and private investment to
the frontier have largely failed. Last year, the government built
Ciudad Sucre as a kind of border-town buffer in an area teeming
with ELN rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But during a recent visit, most of the 210 concrete row houses
were empty. A sparsely stocked grocery store had no customers, and
the only sign of life was a salesman who parked his truck on a
deserted street to peddle vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said that instead of building towns from scratch and
waiting for the people to come, the state should improve
infrastructure and services in existing border communities _ where
the military is often the only government presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say there is little hope that conditions will
improve as long as the fighting goes on. As the war shows signs of
turning into a regional conflict, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana is under growing international pressure to reach a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He opened peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group, two weeks ago. The ELN
has announced a ``national convention'' in February to discuss an
eventual truce.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his concern, Venezuelan President-elect Chavez
recently flew to Havana to meet with Pastrana and Cuban President
Fidel Castro about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling here is: `Why do we have to suffer for a distant
war?''' said Maria Victoria Cristancho, a Caracas-based journalist
who writes for the Bogota daily El Tiempo. ``That's why they say:
Peace in Colombia is peace in Venezuela.''

MARGINALLY TASTELESS, MOSTLY FUNNY `DILBERT' DEBUTS ON UPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were making a comics sandwich, ``The Far Side'' would be
the scene-stealing ham, ``Peanuts'' the smooth cheese, and
``Dilbert'' the oven-fresh wry.
</P>
<P>
   When transferring these ingredients to TV, wry is always the
hardest to keep fresh. Even ``Seinfeld,'' the pumpernickel of
television comedies, got a little stale after co-creator Larry
David left the show.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is hoping another Larry with ``Seinfeld'' connections _
Larry Charles _ can keep the humor sharp and satirical as
``Dilbert'' goes from the printed page to the TV screen. Charles
was a writer and supervising producer on the early years of
``Seinfeld'' before moving to ``Mad About You'' for a couple of
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Dilbert,'' he is teamed with the strip's creator, Scott
Adams, and their first effort, taking the place of the canceled
``Guys Like Us,'' is amusing, if not exactly knee-slappingly
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   For UPN, which desperately needs a winner, amusing is good, no
matter what Matt Groening says. Groening, the wisecracking creator
of ``The Simpsons'' and a new sci-fi animation show for Fox called
``Futurama,'' joked last week that in the future there will be
5,000 networks, ``and UPN is still going to be in last place.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, if Charles and Adams can infuse the TV ``Dilbert''
with the same sardonic observational humor that has made the
newspaper version the favorite of millions of working stiffs.
Problem is, there will be more than a half-dozen animated comedies
in prime time soon, and no one is sure if if all of them can
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, and this might be mine alone, is the
appropriateness of the character's voices. Daniel Stern, who voiced
the adult Kevin Arnold for the entire six-season run of ``The
Wonder Years,'' is fine as Dilbert _ the sometimes assertive,
sometimes wimpy spokesman for the corporately frustrated. But Chris
Elliot as Dogbert, Dilbert's mean-spirited housemate, and Kathy
Griffin as Alice, Dilbert's supportive workplace colleague, don't
strike my ear just right.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this first episode, titled ``The Name,'' is a mostly
funny, sometimes tasteless sendup of corporate behavior as the
nameless company where Dilbert works tries to come up with a name
for a new product that doesn't yet exist. The product is needed
because the most recent product, an organic throat lozenge,
contained anthrax bacteria and, thus, didn't encourage repeat
business. As the pointy-haired boss (voiced by Larry Miller) points
out: ``We have to make up for the revenue shortfall and there are
only two ways to do that: Create a new product or make massive,
painful budget cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogbert, hired on as a consultant, informs the group: ``As you
probably know, all the good product names have been trademarked by
companies who are competent.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Wally (Gordon Hunt), the terrified follower, replies:
``Competent! How we gonna compete with that?'' Fortunately, no one
at UPN recognized, or was terribly offended by, the metaphor,
because the line made it to air.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the network should be congratulated. Absent some
needless network meddling, Charles and Adams may actually have
something here, and the last thing they need is more input from a
corporation. As Dilbert warns in the first episode: ``Everyone will
want to have input, because input is easier than doing real work.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask a TV critic.
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert. Half-hour animated comedy about workplace frustration,
based on the comic strip by Scott Adams. Premieres Monday on UPN.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS OMIT ABORTION AS TOP PRIORITY FOR 2000
 &HT;    730&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Committee, retooling after
a disappointing election last fall, backed away from its staunch
opposition to abortion Friday in favor of pocketbook issues aimed
at winning working families back from the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, who won a spirited but lopsided campaign for
re-election Friday as chairman of the RNC, declared that tax
relief, saving Social Security, improving education and national
security were the party's top priorities through the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hutchinson, RNC deputy press secretary, said Nicholson
developed the party's list of priorities ``in consultation with the
congressional leadership'' of the GOP, House Speaker Dennis Hastert
of Illinois and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   With narrow majorities in both houses and the Republican Party
facing its lowest approval ratings in decades, GOP leaders appeared
reluctant to press an unpopular issue that seems to have little
chance of surviving congressional opposition and presidential
vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC decision to move abortion to the back burner was
announced during the RNC's winter meeting at a downtown Washington
hotel even as thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators marched in
protest from the White House to the Capitol on the 26th anniversary
of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The new list of party priorities cheered Ann Stone, the leading
advocate of abortion rights in the GOP, but contrasted sharply with
the campaign rhetoric of would-be GOP presidential candidates at
the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) meeting in
suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, whose organization is called Republicans for Choice, said
she felt as if she was ``returning from the wilderness,'' having
promoted abortion rights since the early days of the Reagan
presidency, when the GOP's anti-abortion fervor began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our number one priority as a party should be winning
elections,'' she said. ``Jim can help us do that by building a
strong grass-roots party and returning us to a party that looks for
real proactive solutions to reduce abortions _ not off-the-wall
anti-choice antics and empty rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Bauer, a staunch anti-abortion activist who is expected
to announce his presidential candidacy next week, said ``protecting
the lives of children waiting to be born'' is crucial to the
Republican Party. ``To forget the sanctity of life ...must not
happen in the party of Lincoln and Reagan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, millionaire magazine publisher Steve Forbes, a 1996
presidential candidate who is expected to run again in 2000, warned
CPAC that ``establishment'' Republicans think abortion is ``a
losing cause'' for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have us walk away from it, drop it, leave it
alone,'' he said. ``But we are a party of principle ... and it is
time to put abortion on the road to extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Slade, the former Florida state GOP chairman who had
challenged Nicholson for the national chairmanship, said Friday he
hoped the national party would follow the lead of the party in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took the issue off the table,'' he said. ``We decided
we were not going to talk about things we can't do anything about
...and so the issue went away.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Florida legislature enacted a ban on so-called partial
birth abortions and passed a law requiring parental notification
when minors seek abortion, ``I haven't even heard the word
'abortion','' Slade added.
</P>
<P>
   But Rusty Paul, chairman of the state GOP in Georgia, said that
despite Nicholson's speech, ``this party is as committed to our
platform today as it was two and a half years ago when it was
written.'' He added, ``I fully expect that two years from now, that
platform will be no weaker than it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 GOP platform called for constitutional guarantees of
life to ``the unborn child'' and the prosecution of physicians who
perform abortions. The anti-abortion provisions of the platform
prompted Bob Dole, the party's presidential nominee that year, to
assert that he was not bound to run on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weddington, the GOP state chair in Texas, insisted that
the Republican Party is not moderating its position on banning
abortion even though Nicholson did not make it a party priority.
``Our respect for life is fundamental to being a winning party,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, winning re-election to the party chairmanship on a
127-36 vote, acknowledged that the Republican Party had ``sustained
political damage, at least in the short term,'' for its drive to
impeach President Clinton. But he promised that the party would
rebound with an agenda to help working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the top of our priority list, we need to give American
families and job creators tax relief _ at least 10 percent across
the board,'' he said. ``This is a matter of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the GOP's second priority would be ``to protect and
strengthen Social Security.'' He said the GOP would work with the
president, insisting ``only on two things _ that the plan contains
no tax increases and no cuts in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The third priority, he said, is ``to make our public schools
work for our children again'' through increased accountability and
more funds for classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The final priority he cited was the renewal of the Reagan
administration's proposal to protect the United States from weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take more than a few missiles fired at convenient
moments to defeat the growing threat posed by terrorists and rogue
dictators,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nicholson said the GOP is willing to meet the president
and Democrats ``even more than halfway'' on numerous issues, he
also blasted Vice President Al Gore as if the 2000 election
campaign had already begun.
</P>
<P>
   He called Gore the ``chief defender'' of the president and the
``heir apparent as leader of the tax-and-spend wing of the
Democratic Party.'' He also unveiled a ``Gore Spend-o-Meter'' to
keep track of Clinton spending proposals over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who will seek the GOP
presidential nomination in 2000, also took aim at Gore. He told
CPAC conference delegates that Clinton's State of the Union address
is ``Al Gore's platform'' for the Democratic Party's 2000
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris LeHane dismissed Nicholson's comments as
``just politics'' and referred to Quayle as ``a medieval
conservative.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the White House completed arguments this week, experts on
impeachment said the president's lawyers had offered constitutional
and factual arguments powerful enough to counter the momentum of
the House's case and blunt the effort to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the experts _ professors of constitutional law at
law schools around the country _ said creative legal arguments and
a risky strategy of challenging some facts in the case against the
president helped counter what were generally considered effective
arguments from the House impeachment managers last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the president's fate is a political question. But
from a legal point of view, lawyers defending the president could
not have accomplished much more, said Eric Freedman, a law
professor and expert on impeachment at Hofstra University School of
Law in Hempstead, N.Y. ``The sides now are at least even,'' he
said, ``and if the sides are even, that's neither enough legally or
politically to get a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gerhardt, an impeachment expert and professor at the
College of William and Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Va.,
agreed. ``I think the White House argument helped move the ball
back toward the thinking that the need for witnesses on the floor
of the Senate may not be as strong as some people may have
thought,'' he said. ``And it might have alerted the Senate to be
very careful in accepting what the House managers say is
affirmative evidence of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the experts showed that, for all its historic
significance, the impeachment trial is taking on the rhythm of an
ordinary trial, with each side's arguments swaying sentiment only
to see it sway back again.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional experts, many of whom praised the House
managers in interviews last weekend, said this week that the White
House lawyers, with the eloquent help of former Sen. Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas, combined some novel legal arguments with the
rhetorical flourish that can make oratory decisive both in politics
and law.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers provided the necessary counterweight to
their opponents' assertions, said Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of
constitutional law at Yale Law School. ``Just as the House managers
tried to connect the dots, the White House folks poked holes; they
broke the lines of connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional scholars said the president's lawyers
presented some new legal arguments that were clearly aimed at
senators concerned about the precedent Clinton's trial will set.
</P>
<P>
   Cass Sunstein, a professor of constitutional law at the
University of Chicago Law School, said he was particularly
impressed by an argument of Gregory Craig, a special White House
counsel. Craig combined two legal points in asserting that the
House managers were unfairly adding to and changing their
assertions against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's first point cited established rules holding that
criminal charges, like perjury, cannot be vague because a defendant
has a right to know details of charges against him. The second
argument was that to the extent that the managers were amplifying
the sparse language of the impeachment articles, they were
improperly taking on powers delegated in the Constitution to the
House alone.
</P>
<P>
   Craig complained that the charges ``have been a moving target
for us throughout this entire process.'' Sunstein said Craig's
legal claims raised that assertion of unfairness to constitutional
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunstein said it was not clear that argument was legally
correct. But he called it ``creative, original, plausible and
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ackerman, a Yale authority on impeachment law, said
Craig's argument was one of the strongest against conviction. ``The
issue is: Can agents of the House usurp the power of the House to
impeach a president and define `high crimes and misdemeanors'?''
Ackerman said. ``They can't,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A second significant legal step in the White House presentation,
some of the experts said, was a concession by the chief White House
counsel, Charles Ruff, on a constitutional question that has been
central to the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Citing history and the words of some drafters of the
Constitution, some supporters of the president have argued that
impeachment was not intended as a punishment for what they called
purely private conduct, like lying about a sexual affair. That
absolutist argument was considered a weak point for the White House
because it opened a debate about whether its proponents meant that
a president could not be impeached even for the most serious
private crimes, like murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff denied that had ever been the White House view, saying the
managers ``attribute to the president the argument that impeachment
can never reach personal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff then tried to shortcut the debate. ``That is not our
position,'' Ruff said, adding that when a president's ``very
capacity to govern is called into question'' as a result of private
wrongdoing, removal would be warranted. ``Judgments must be made,''
Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Susan Low Bloch, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown
University Law Center in Washington, said Ruff's statement made it
clear that the White House lawyers accept the view of most
constitutional scholars that in some extreme cases private conduct
could have enough effect on political matters to be impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the concession also served the strategic
purpose of removing an argument of the House managers that had some
intellectual appeal. ``It was,'' Sunstein said, ``a very
straightforward and honest way of handling a persuasive argument
made by the House managers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation on Thursday, Bumpers seemed to retreat from
Ruff's position, asking, ``What are we doing here?'' and once again
arguing that ``Nobody has suggested that Bill Clinton committed a
political crime against the state.'' But some of the experts said
Ruff's view and Bumpers' could be reconciled, with Bumpers simply
arguing that even if some private behavior might be impeachable,
Clinton's was not that kind of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the law professors said the riskiest move by the White
House lawyers was their decision to make detailed arguments
challenging some of the facts about the case stated by the House
managers.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House struggles to avoid unpredictable Senate
testimony by witnesses, the tack of quarreling about the House
version of the facts held its own dangers. In court cases, judges
generally rule that sharp disagreements over facts indicate that
witnesses are needed to clear up any disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardt of William and Mary said the White House lawyers were
``walking along a razor's edge'' by arguing both that no testimony
was needed to acquit and that the evidence so far was not what the
House managers described. ``The potential downside,'' he said, ``is
the more the White House lawyers talk about the facts, the more the
White House helps make the case for witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experts generally agreed that the White House lawyers
had persuasively raised questions about the House managers' version
concerning several pivotal events, including the circumstances
surrounding the decision by the president's friend, Vernon Jordan,
to step up efforts to try to get a job for Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman of Hofstra said it was a traditional defense lawyer's
tactic to suggest that jurors should be suspicious of prosecution
assertions. Defense lawyers often focus on proven errors in a
prosecution case and then urge jurors, Freedman said, to ask: ``I
wonder where else something like that may have happened?'' Freedman
said the president's lawyers were encouraging the senators to ask
the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts said the final statement by Bumpers
appropriately moved the White House presentation away from the
legalisms that dominated many of the presentations. Because
impeachment is a unique mixture of legal and political decisions,
Bloch said, the president's case was strengthened by Bumpers'
sweeping arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought a sense of what the role of the Senate is in the
process; a sense of history and the role of precedent and what this
case may mean in the future,'' Bloch said. ``And he made people _
he certainly made me _ step back from the minutiae.''

PENTAGON FIGURES SHOW RECORD NUMBERS OF GAYS KICKED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The armed forces discharged homosexual personnel in
record numbers last year, despite a controversial policy that
allows gays and lesbians to serve under certain conditions,
Pentagon data showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures represent the largest number of homosexuals
discharged from the military in any year since President Clinton's
controversial ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'' policy went
into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The number of discharges in 1998 _ 1,145 personnel in all four
branches of the military _ compares with a total of 997 in 1997 and
was the highest level since 1987 when 1,380 men and women were
released, according to a report by Rudy de Leon, undersecretary of
defense for personnel and readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force outpaced the other military services last year,
letting go a record of 414 gay and lesbian personnel, compared with
309 in 1997, 282 in 1996, 234 in 1995 and 180 in 1994, according to
Air Force figures.
</P>
<P>
   Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio led the way in the Air
Force, accounting for 271 basic trainees severed from the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Army discharged record numbers of homosexuals in 1998,
according to Pentagon figures, with 310 personnel dismissed
compared with 197 in 1997, 206 in 1996, 182 in 1995 and 136 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy released 345 sailors in 1998 compared with 413 in 1997,
302 in 1996, 260 in 1995 and 245 in 1994, according to the Pentagon
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, the smallest military branch, released 76
homosexual troops in 1998, 78 in 1997, 60 in 1996, 46 in 1995 and
36 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   T'jae Gibson, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said a
majority of the Air Force's discharges in 1998 _ 391 cases _ were
because the service member voluntarily came forward and revealed
his or her homosexuality to a commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people walked into their boss and said, `I am gay' or `I
engage in homosexual or bisexual activity,''' said Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said an internal Air Force report conducted at Lackland
found that most of those at the facility who said they were
homosexual did so ``solely for the purpose of self-eliminating from
basic training and the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in gay discharges in the Air Force was first
disclosed by the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a leading
gay rights legal organization, complained that the Air Force
actively roots out gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have also heard that spin before from the Air Force,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-director of SLDN, which provides legal aid to
troops tossed from the military under the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real reason for gay discharges is that commanders continue
to ask, pursue and harass people whom they suspect are gay,'' she
contended.
</P>
<P>
   The current Pentagon policy of ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' _ the result of a bruising battle among the White House,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress in 1993 _ means that
homosexual activity is banned in the military, but that gays and
lesbians may serve as long as they keep quiet about their sexual
orientation and aren't caught engaged in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that commanders may not inquire of a service
member's sexual orientation, according to the rules. However, they
may do so if they have ``credible information'' that a service
member engages in homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pentagon efforts to clarify the policy, homosexual
rights organizations maintain that gays and lesbians in the ranks
are routinely drummed out even though they comply with the rule.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director for SLDN, said, ``The new
numbers suggest that rather than providing any kind of relief for
gay people under this policy, commanders are going after people
even more fervently.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy ``has intensified the ousting of people thought to be
gay or lesbian,'' said Rob Blanchard, a San Antonio-based state
vice president of the Log Cabin Republicans, a nationwide group of
15,000 gays.

BAN ON HORSE MEAT HURTS AUCTION HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There were slim pickings at this month's Jones
Horse Auction in Bakersfield, California's biggest sale. Just 60
horses went on the block, less than a third of the normal offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the `killer buyers' weren't present or they weren't
bidding,'' said Cathleen Doyle of Sun Valley in Los Angeles County.
``Real people were bidding on those horses. In the past, 85 percent
would go to the killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 6, an initiative passed by California
voters in November making it a felony to sell horses for human
consumption, say the new law appears to have lowered significantly
the number of horses sold at auction in the state. But with little
official enforcement of the law, they aren't relaxing their vigil.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sherry DeBoer, founder of Political Animals,
offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of anyone violating Proposition 6, and brochures were
mailed to every auction yard in the state, cautioning them of the
risk they run by selling to slaughterhouses or their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   All four American slaughterhouses that turn out filly filets and
colt chops for horse meat sold mostly in Europe have been warned
not to accept horses from California.
</P>
<P>
   But both critics and proponents of the law agree it's far too
early to say whether sales have ended, or whether they will just be
disguised by Californians who sell their horses to, say, a
middleman in Utah, before they're shipped to Texas for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The financial incentive is substantial. Some 7,000 California
horses were sold for meat last year, many for $1,000 each, a high
price for an animal many ranchers otherwise would have to euthanize
or give away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen is that people will go out of state to
sell,'' said Brent Heberlein, manager of the Belgian-owned company
Bel-Tex in Fort Worth, Texas, the nation's biggest horse
slaughterhouse. ``As far as I'm concerned, if it comes from Utah,
then it's a Utah horse; doesn't matter where it started out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Heberlein said, the effect of Proposition 6 on Bel-Tex's
business is imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, a chief sponsor of the voter initiative, acknowledged
that enforcing the measure isn't even on the attorney general's
radar screen. But she said she believes the community of horse
traders will enforce the law themselves, especially with the
enticement of a $10,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen is that they (the buyers) will be
turning each other in,'' she said. ``It's not a nameless
constituency. We know who they are, and as soon as we come down on
them, there's no doubt that if they're sitting there with a felony
doing jail time, that'll be a real deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Livestock auction operators see Proposition 6 as a boneheaded
scheme that is going to cause only trouble in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is a bunch of horses in California that people
won't put down because of the law,'' said Jim Warren, manager of
101 Livestock in the Prunedale area north of Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no value in a worn-out or otherwise useless horse,
Warren said. And because it costs about $500 to have a veterinarian
euthanize a horse, he predicts many horse owners will ``just take
off the halter and let it go. I guarantee you that in 18 months
there are going to be horses hit on the freeway like you wouldn't
believe.''

<P>
   Smurfs? Cabbage Patch Kids? Pogs? Who'd have thought it?
</P>
<P>
   Now for the latest craze. The toy of the moment is a toy of the
past, a relic from the bygone days of jacks and marbles. Kids have
rediscovered the yo-yo, a gadget that until recently lay dormant in
junk drawers or collecting dust on dime-store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of its resurgence are everywhere. Natural Wonders in the
Northridge Fashion Center has a waiting list for yo-yo string.
Yo-yo aficionados swap tips on the Internet. More than 40 kids
gather every Saturday at Golden Apple comics in Northridge to learn
new yo-yo tricks.

   And in playgrounds and school yards around the country, children

   ``It's driving us nuts,'' said Ken Handler, assistant principal
of Portola Middle School in Tarzana. ``I've got a drawer full of
them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, technology has helped yo-yos come whirling out of
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Yo-yos were everywhere in the '50s and '60s. Contests and
demonstrations were common. Then the yo-yo started its downward
spiral. In 1965, Duncan, the yo-yo pioneer that started
mass-producing yo-yos in 1929, went bankrupt, a victim of
competition from Frisbees and Super Balls and a lost legal battle
over its trademarked name.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was bought by another company, Flambeau Products, that
continued to sell the discs, but the yo-yo was headed for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s brought the string that broke the yo-yo's back: video
games. Kids discarded low-tech toys like yo-yos and Hula Hoops and
started feeding their allowance money into video games like Pacman
and Frogger.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1980, Michael Caffrey patented ``the yo-yo with a
brain'' that causes an automatic return when the spin slows to a
specific rate. While old yo-yos had a fixed, wooden axle, the new
yo-yo has a clutch, weight and spring device that brings the yo-yo
back up to the hand automatically, letting rookies learn advanced
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a trans-axle yo-yo with a metal axle and a
ball-bearing, allowing for reduced friction and longer, faster
spins. Cold Fusion, the Maserati of yo-yos that sells for about
$150, is of this type.
</P>
<P>
   It set the record for the longest ``sleep'' _ when the yo-yo
remains spinning at its lowest point _ for seven minutes, eight
seconds, unheard of with old style yo-yos.
</P>
<P>
   It's this ``sleep'' phase that lets you do tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Yo-yo makers were also determined to pull the little toy back up
through more aggressive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Duncan Toy Co. started advertising on
Nickelodeon and sponsoring major kid draws like World Wrestling
Federation matches, said Mike Burke, marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   They sent a lesson plan to 80,000 science teachers, showing them
how to use yo-yos to teach students about the scientific method,
the pendulum and basic physics, then offered yo-yos for students at
a discount.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of yo-yos took an upswing, companies started
coming out with novelty and limited-edition yo-yos _ gold-plated
yo-yos and those made of aircraft aluminum, and yo-yos with
scorpions, killer bees and shark teeth imbedded in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them coffee-table yo-yos,'' said Bill Liebowitz, 57,
owner of Golden Apple comics and a yo-yo champion in Brooklyn in
the '50s. ``They're for collectors. They just look so good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Liebowitz worked as a demonstrator for Duncan yo-yos,
earning appearances on ``Howdy Doody'' and ``The Steve Allen
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he passed into manhood, it got harder to find anyone
interested in seeing his tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would offer to do tricks and nobody would take me up on
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday afternoon, Liebowitz runs a yo-yo clinic in his
Northridge store, where he carries a full line of yo-yos. About 40
kids show up to play.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this stuff seriously,'' Liebowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was winning contests, stunts like ``walk the dog''
and ``baby in the cradle'' were about as advanced as you could get.
</P>
<P>
   With the new, technologically advanced yo-yos, ``kids are doing
them within a week,'' Liebowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the kids at the Saturday gathering are first-timers.
Others are true-blue enthusiasts whose goal is to join a yo-yo
travel team and compete nationwide in competitions.
</P>
<P>
   A yo-yo champion from Japan is coming to offer some hints at
Liebowitz's yo-yo clinic Saturday. Yomega, a yo-yo company, fields
its own team that travels the country doing demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Best friends Robbie Uslan and Derek Wyatt, both 10, want to get
on it. Their mothers are behind them _ they wore ``Yo-Yo Mom''
T-shirts during a recent yo-yo demonstration the boys and Liebowitz
put on for the students at Castlemont Elementary School in Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice and practice until we can get the trick,'' Robbie
said. ``Before school, all day at school, at recess, after school.
I try to practice as much yo-yo as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   From Tamagotchis to Furbys, kids know what they like, and
they'll make sure parents know, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to the mall and I have $20, I would probably go for a
yo-yo first before a Beanie Baby,'' said Sharon, who was introduced
to yo-yoing by her 9-year-old brother, Adir. ``I don't know anybody
who can stand watching someone using a yo-yo for a while and not
want to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzipi Bar-Noy, mother of Sharon and Adir, has resorted to hiding
the yo-yos just to get the kids to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how kids are getting attached to it,'' said
Bar-Noy, whose children have badgered her into buying several dozen
yo-yos. ``If they don't have it, it's like they're missing a meal
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   For many yo-yo aficionados, the reasons for yo-yos' new-found
popularity are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't require batteries. It doesn't require set-up
instructions. You can carry it anywhere you go. It's very
affordable,'' said John Small, 48, who runs the Southern California
Yo-Yo Club in Valencia from his store, Kite Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   For yo-yo men like Liebowitz, the thrill of this second coming
of the yo-yo is passing on the memories of their childhood to a new
generation of yo-yo lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a talent I've had that I've only been able to whip out
at company parties and family gatherings, and they thought I was a
freak,'' Liebowitz said. ``Now I'm the king of the 8-year-olds. My
wife says she's never seen me happier.'' &QL;

HORSES STILL BEING SOLD DESPITE HORSE-MEAT BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS headline to correct; story stands.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There were slim pickings at this month's Jones
Horse Auction in Bakersfield, California's biggest sale. Just 60
horses went on the block, less than a third of the normal offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the `killer buyers' weren't present or they weren't
bidding,'' said Cathleen Doyle of Sun Valley in Los Angeles County.
``Real people were bidding on those horses. In the past, 85 percent
would go to the killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Proposition 6, an initiative passed by California
voters in November making it a felony to sell horses for human
consumption, say the new law appears to have lowered significantly
the number of horses sold at auction in the state. But with little
official enforcement of the law, they aren't relaxing their vigil.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sherry DeBoer, founder of Political Animals,
offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of anyone violating Proposition 6, and brochures were
mailed to every auction yard in the state, cautioning them of the
risk they run by selling to slaughterhouses or their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   All four American slaughterhouses that turn out filly filets and
colt chops for horse meat sold mostly in Europe have been warned
not to accept horses from California.
</P>
<P>
   But both critics and proponents of the law agree it's far too
early to say whether sales have ended, or whether they will just be
disguised by Californians who sell their horses to, say, a
middleman in Utah, before they're shipped to Texas for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The financial incentive is substantial. Some 7,000 California
horses were sold for meat last year, many for $1,000 each, a high
price for an animal many ranchers otherwise would have to euthanize
or give away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen is that people will go out of state to
sell,'' said Brent Heberlein, manager of the Belgian-owned company
Bel-Tex in Fort Worth, Texas, the nation's biggest horse
slaughterhouse. ``As far as I'm concerned, if it comes from Utah,
then it's a Utah horse; doesn't matter where it started out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Heberlein said, the effect of Proposition 6 on Bel-Tex's
business is imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, a chief sponsor of the voter initiative, acknowledged
that enforcing the measure isn't even on the attorney general's
radar screen. But she said she believes the community of horse
traders will enforce the law themselves, especially with the
enticement of a $10,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen is that they (the buyers) will be
turning each other in,'' she said. ``It's not a nameless
constituency. We know who they are, and as soon as we come down on
them, there's no doubt that if they're sitting there with a felony
doing jail time, that'll be a real deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Livestock auction operators see Proposition 6 as a boneheaded
scheme that is going to cause only trouble in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is a bunch of horses in California that people
won't put down because of the law,'' said Jim Warren, manager of
101 Livestock in the Prunedale area north of Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no value in a worn-out or otherwise useless horse,
Warren said. And because it costs about $500 to have a veterinarian
euthanize a horse, he predicts many horse owners will ``just take
off the halter and let it go. I guarantee you that in 18 months
there are going to be horses hit on the freeway like you wouldn't
believe.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; John Boorman puts little value on possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too. It's enabled the 65-year-old English director
to follow a particularly distinctive career that has always been
blessedly free of the commercial considerations _ and high-living
materialism _ that can drive even the most independent movie
artists toward hit-hungry compromise.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it kept Boorman from holding a grudge against
Martin Cahill, the Irish criminal mastermind who once stole a
number of Boorman's valuables and is now the subject of one his
best films, ``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I became aware of him was in 1981, when he
broke into my house and took a few things,'' says the trim,
snowy-haired Boorman, who has lived in Dublin for many years.
``Amongst them was this gold record that I had for the music from
`Deliverance,' `Dueling Banjos.' He must have thought it was made
of real gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police told me they knew who'd done it; even then, Cahill
was always flaunting his robberies and taunting the police to prove
he'd done it. I was very angry, in a way, at the time. But if you
saw `Hope and Glory,' that was my childhood. We lost our home and
everything during the London Blitz; everything was rationed, we had
nothing. Ever since then, possessions have never meant that much to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anarchy, on the other hand, has always rated high on Boorman's
list. ``Hope and Glory,'' after all, was a schoolboy's celebration
of how Hitler's bombs shattered England's strict, inhibiting social
control.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hollywood hits (``Point Blank,'' ``Deliverance''),
personal projects (``Glory,'' ``Excalibur'') or the strange stuff
that fell somewhere in between (``Zardoz,'' `Exorcist II: The
Heretic,'' ``The Emerald Forest,'' ``Where the Heart Is''), Boorman
has always been fascinated by what happens to people when their
familiar world falls apart. And he's especially intrigued by the
unconventional rebels who facilitate that, especially ones that
subvert civilized authority.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cahill, then, was a dream come true. A congenital thief
from early childhood, he grew up in a Dublin slum to which he was
fiercely loyal _ he even camped out on its rubble after the
buildings were bulldozed for urban renewal. Cahill recruited a gang
from his old neighbors, which he ruled with a combination of
brilliance, brutality and the sheer force of his larger-than-life
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a 20-year gross of some $60 million worth of loot
helped maintain gang loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill made a point of not only taunting the police, but also
the Catholic Church (he fathered children with his sister-in-law as
well as his wife, reportedly with the ongoing consent of both
women) and the Irish Republican Army (which ultimately took credit
for Cahill's assassination). As played by the pugnacious Brendan
Gleeson in the movie, Cahill's audacity was matched only by his
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Some have complained that the movie lionizes a violent criminal.
Typically, though, Boorman takes a wider, if no less subversive,
view. He covers Cahill's ruthless cruelty, self-destructive egotism
and moments of crippling self-doubt as thoroughly as he does the
character's latter-day Robin Hood qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the film, for me, was to humanize the criminal,
to make you feel like you could get inside of him, like you could
actually be this character,'' Boorman says. ``Of course, he was
something of a folk hero. If you mention his name in Dublin, people
will smile _ except, of course, his victims and the people who
suffered under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there definitely was this grudging admiration people had
for someone who was prepared to stand up against the whole of
society and take everything on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some of that spirit in Boorman himself. A determined
individualist, he's been known to walk away from projects he's put
years into developing _ the currently in release, widely acclaimed
``A Simple Plan'' was the last example _ when studio interference
grew too great.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The General's'' case, Boorman organized shaky independent
financing that guaranteed him creative freedom, and he used it to
cast the unknown (though brilliant) Gleeson rather than a star name
and shoot the thing in uncommercial black and white. No effort was
made to alter authentic Irish accents for a large potential
audience of American ears, either.
</P>
<P>
   For his uncompromising efforts, Boorman earned the Cannes Film
Festival's directing award and a raft of glowing reviews. But the
movie, which was released on a limited basis at Christmastime in
the United States, has been greeted by indifferent box-office
figures and few year-end awards and nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Boorman isn't the kind of guy who cares about such
things. Maybe it's a philosophy. More likely, it's an outgrowth of
the reckless exuberance he's always associated with filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Voight, who plays Cahill's primary police pursuer in
``General'' and is a longtime friend of the director, tells a story
that illustrates Boorman's approach to his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Deliverance,' we had this pool the size of a football
field, surrounded by cliffs,'' Voight recalls. ``They had a dam up
top that they could let water through. The day before this
particular incident, John had asked for half a gate's worth of
water, and that was plenty enough for us to do all these stunts
under this huge waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning, John gets on the walkie-talkie and says,
`Gimme a gate. No, a gate and a half! Gimme two gates!' We hear
this sound and all of a sudden, thundering over this cliff, is a
huge amount of water. The water in this football field-sized pool
is visibly rising. He's got a camera in there and he's standing
behind it with a hat on. I dive in and I'm not acting, because I
see the water rising up the legs of the tripod _ fast! It goes
right up across the lens, over tha [Ux

POST-HOLIDAY STYLIN' GOES ON

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's that time of year when you're forced to see
the damage done over the holidays. You know, all of those See's
chocolates that you wolfed down when nobody was looking, the family
grazing fests with homemade pies and Christmas cookies that make
your thighs jiggle like Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you could go cold turkey and cut out all fats and
frantically start gardening and decorating to tone those muscles.
And in those areas, Miz Hot Tips has some stylin' suggestions
you'll find below.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could say to heck with the diet and buy into that cool
new line of clothing worn by Camryn Manheim of ABC's ``The
Practice.'' She's the classy plus-size actress who often is seen in
designs by Tamotsu, and soon will be appearing in fashion magazine
ads as the company's celebrity model.
</P>
<P>
   The new line will be called Hana, which means flower in
Japanese, and will include sporty separates in black and ivory made
of that trendy microfiber Tencel. Look for them soon at Nordstrom,
Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue, and expect to pay about $80
to $170 per item.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING SOIREE: If you are of a mind to work off those holiday
calories, Miz Hot Tips suggests some mall-hopping to see what's
new, like the Art of Shopping exhibit at the Glendale Galleria,
Glendale. Included is the Rag Factory, a new boutique that puts art
on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park also has an exhibit, ``The Making
of a First Lady.'' The exclusive collection of Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis photos will be on display through Jan. 31 in the center
court.
</P>
<P>
   Or head out this weekend for the grand opening of Dancing on
Clouds at 1521 S. Robertson Blvd. in Los Angeles. The new store
specializes in dance and activewear for girls and teens.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Feb. 13, the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills will hold its
12th annual children's beauty pageant. They have trophies for
babies and older kids, but you have to call (818) 340-5981 to
register.
</P>
<P>
   What if you're too lazy to get in the car?
</P>
<P>
   Try the QVC channel today, where fashion designer Nolan Miller
will host ``Extreme Shopping: Hollywood'' live at the historic
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Other alternatives coming up are Neiman Marcus' new Refresh
catalog that focuses on health and beauty, and Nordstrom's new
online shopping catalog (Nordstrom.com) that debuts Feb. 15. Among
the 61,500 items will be Callaway golf clothing and Nordstrom's own
shoe designs.
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING PANACHE: You've avoided cleaning out the flower beds
in the front yard for way too many reasons, including not having
the right tools? Miz Hot Tips spotted a fashion-forward garden tool
kit in dark green with floral-trimmed handles on the trowel, hand
rake, clippers and edgers that match the spiffy pink gardening
gloves. Sure to make the neighbors jealous, it's priced at $22.50
in the Paragon spring catalog, (800) 343-3095.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC ON HIS MIND: Fashion's latest hero, Tommy Hilfiger, is
sponsoring the Rolling Stones ``No Security'' tour that comes to
Southern California Feb. 9-11, so naturally he's dressing the
famous band with a new clothing logo. It incorporates the Rolling
Stones' tongue and the Tommy Hilfiger flag, and you can find it on
T-shirts and other stuff at the concert and Macy's stores. &QL;

THE ATTACK ON NORTHEASTERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The ugly little episode of the public threat to
Northeastern University by what the Globe refers to as ``one top
Cellucci aide'' raises the question of political thuggery by an
administration that should consider itself lucky to have just won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Goon Squad motif that we'd hoped was just part
of the usual election tomfoolery, this top aide was quoted
anonymously in last Sunday's ``Political Capital'' collection of
tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   First came a warning to potential contributors who might be
thinking of writing a check to former Atty. Gen. Scott Harshbarger,
who lost the governor's race by 3.4 percent. Harshbarger had a
$205,000 debt, after raising some $5 million, and prior to starting
to teach at Northeastern and its Law School, the Democrat wanted to
retire his debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some like to play it both ways but we're keeping an eye on
that,'' said the ``top aide'' to Cellucci. In other words, anyone
writing a check to Harshbarger might incur the ire of the
Republican administration, which is fast developing a post-Weld
reputation for squalid political ballgames. But then came the
threat to Northeastern _ an important educational institution that
is on the rise under President Richard Freeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's become a liberal resting place,'' said the anonymous
Cellucci aide, and Northeastern officials ``are going to find some
doors shut to them around here if Harshbarger becomes a public
policy spokesman there.'' This must have been a reference to
Michael Dukakis, a part-time teacher at Northeastern who spends
part of the academic year in California and also has a presidential
appointment to Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   The double-edged threat seems to have kept some donors away from
Harshbarger's fundraiser at the Sonesta in Cambridge Thursday
night. Some big-name civic leaders who'd initially agreed to come
shied away from the event. But approximately $125,000 was raised
nevertheless from the 300 or so on hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Suffolk County Dist. Atty. Ralph Martin _ a
Republican _ to crack that he might have put himself in the
Republican doghouse by showing up. ut he was not the only
Republican who spoke. Former Attys. Gen. Jane Brady of Delaware and
Jeff Pine of Rhode Island delivered testimonials to Harshbarger, as
did Mike Moore, the former attorney general of Mississippi who
enlisted Harshbarger in the landmark tobacco settlement which is
giving Massachusetts some $300 million a year to spend on health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's successor in the AG's office, Tom Reilly,
announced an award to be made in his predecessor's name. Also on
hand: Martha Coakley, new Middlesex County DA, and, like Martin and
Reilly, a prosecutor who got hired by the guy who'd have been
elected governor, if he only could have changed one vote out of 50.
</P>
<P>
   The intention of the anonymously quoted ``top Cellucci aide''
was obviously to make it harder for Harshbarger to get rid of his
debt and get on with his life. Petty, mean-spirited, cheap-jack,
sure; but no big deal. The big deal is the nasty dig at
Northeastern, where Freeland is well on his way to putting the
school on the map the same way John Silber did at BU beginning 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The campus is hopping, graceful new buildings sprout, the
student body has been slimmed down and test-scored up, and when
Freeland announced Harshbarger would teach and work on the school's
criminal justice programs and the Tobacco Products Liability
Project, it was considered a smart move by a school that's on the
move. ``He will be a valuable voice on public policy issues,'' said
Freeland. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Cellucci Goon Squad, with threats and bluster. On
Thursday, Cellucci tried to duck responsibility: ``I did not make
the comments, and I would not make them,'' he said. ``I think it is
great that Scott Harshbarger will be at Northeastern.'' Yeah.
Right, Governor. That's your story, and you're sticking to it, even
while the Globe quoted a Cellucci operative as repeating the
threats to the school, that ``if Northeastern is going to give him
a perch to launch another race for governor, they can't expect to
get away scot-free.'' Or should that be Scott-free?
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci knows a good deal about politicians on academic
payrolls. He was on the Boston College payroll for $30 K a year for
teaching one two-hour class once a week for 28 weeks; that's $535
per teaching hour. When that proved controversial, Cellucci's wife
went on the BC payroll at $42,000 a year as preservation manager
for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of politicians moonlight at local colleges. Harshbarger for
a time taught at BU Law School, though he was and is a political
foe of BU Chancellor John Silber, with whom he frequently clashed.
But for the Cellucci crew to start mucking about with threats to
important institutions at this level of pettiness raises unsettling
questions about how Cellucci will conduct his office for the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects him to be in Bill Weld's neighborhood as an
intellect nor as a political innovator; Cellucci's victory is
attributable to a local economy going gangbusters, his virtual
incumbency as acting governor, Harshbarger's inability to nudge his
way over the goalline, and defections by some key Democrats who had
an ax to grind on Harshbarger's neck. Fair enough; that's politics.
But would a Weld have countenanced his henchmen thus browbeating a
prominent university? No way.
</P>
<P>
   The unabashed vendetta against Northeastern, affirmed in the
Globe first Sunday and then reaffirmed in comments made Thursday,
both times anonymously, by spokesman for the same governor who
disavows such thuggery, leaves a whiff of hypocrisy in the air. If
just one voter in 50 had switched, it would be Cellucci who's
looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening Northeastern _ twice in five days _ is stupid.
Because at least two of Northeastern's trustees raised a lot of
money for Cellucci. And for his hirelings to bluster in his name,
while he issues only pale and wan disclaimers, means we will all
have to keep a much closer watch on this lowbrow crew from here on
in.

 &HT;    AtHome considers WorldNet buy to boost its Internet access
service
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet industry is like the weather. If you
don't like it, wait a minute.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Wall Street Journal, AtHome, the high-speed
Internet access arm of cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., is
considering the acquisition of WorldNet's estimated 1.3 million
consumer subscribers and its one million business customers.
</P>
<P>
   That comes on the heels of an announcement Tuesday that AtHome
would acquire Internet search engine Excite for $7.5 billion in
stock. Both companies, along with hoards of analysts and most media
outlets, said the deal trumpeted the arrival of a new age of high
speed Internet access for ordinary users. AtHome specializes in
high speed access to the Internet using cable TV modems.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rumors are true that AtHome is considering purchasing
WorldNet's conventional telephone dial-up service in a $1 billion
stock swap, it may mean Web surfers will have to wait a bit longer
before the busy signals stop.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome's possible acquisition of the WorldNet service is being
described as an attempt to make it more competitive with the No. 1
online service provider, America Online. AOL has 15 million
subscribers and is the largest dial-up Internet service in the
world. AT&AMP;T's WorldNet service ranks third behind CompuServe and
Microsoft Network. Each of those companies has roughly 2 million
subscribers. MindSpring, Earthlink and WorldNet are in a virtual
dead heat for third with about 1 million consumer subscribers each.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome delivers Internet access over cable TV lines using
special modems to 330,000 customers nationwide, a drop in the
bucket compared with Internet providers that offer service using
modems and conventional telephone lines. It's likely AtHome would
eventually want to upgrade the 1 million-plus WorldNet subscribers
to the high speed cable modem service once it becomes widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   Reports are that the deal won't go through until AT&AMP;T completes
its $41 billion acquisition of TCI in February. If the TCI deal
goes through, AT&AMP;T will be AtHome's major shareholder.
Representatives for AtHome and AT&AMP;T declined to comment.
Atlanta-based Cox Communications, which along with Comcast, has a
minority stake in AtHome, referred all inquiries to AtHome. Cox
Communications is a public company controlled by Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about rumors that AtHome would acquire WorldNet
subscribers, Zia Daniell Widger, an analyst for Jupiter
Communications, said, ``I think it would be a logical step, not
inevitable step, but it does make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Wigder, the AT&AMP;T-AtHome deal is similar to AtHome's
deal with Excite. ``It's a way for AtHome to market its service,''
she says. ``It's also about
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T trying to shift its assets around and make AtHome the
center for its consumer Internet business and push up the valuation
of AtHome.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications estimates that more than 80 percent of
all 'Net users will still be using the dial-up connections such as
those provided by AOL, MindSpring and AT&AMP;T WorldNet. ``Dial-up is
not going to disappear anytime in the near future,'' Wigder says.
``The people who can afford the $40-50 per month for cable modems
or ADSL (high-speed Internet access provided by telephone
companies) is a very small and elite audience right now,'' she
says, ``That number will grow as prices come down and access
becomes readily available.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would also give AtHome a significant subscriber
base of more than 2 million consumer and residential customers, but
Wigder says its hard, if not impossible for any ISP to catch up to
AOL's 15 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is too far ahead right now,'' she says. ``Nobody can catch
them. (AOL founder) Steve Case has developed an easy-to-use service
and a strong online community. AtHome has a similar model of
combining ease of use and community only for high-speed access. As
the price comes down, there will be people coming to cable modem
service who will need a bit more hand holding.''

 &HT;    IRS workers will stay employed after reorganization, official
says
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Internal Revenue Service workers in Atlanta should not
fear losing their jobs because of a reorganization that will phase
out the regional and district offices here, John Stocker, an
assistant deputy commissioner of the IRS, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS employs about 6,500 people in Atlanta _ 1,600 in the
regional and district offices downtown and 4,900 in the Atlanta
Processing Center and the Atlanta Customer Service Center in
Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no decrease in employment,'' because the
regional and district employees are expected to become part of the
headquarters of the new IRS operating division to be established in
Atlanta, Stocker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the current organization is needed in the new
operating organization. There will be a job for everyone, and we
will try to make natural fits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason Atlanta was selected for the new headquarters was
the many good employees we have in the processing and customer
service centers there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was named headquarters of the IRS' Wage and Investment
Income Operating division, one of four new divisions established by
the agency to fulfill a congressional mandate to improve customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters, expected to be operational in late 2000, will
oversee IRS offices and employees across the nation that deal with
wage and investment income taxpayers. With about 88 million
taxpayers in that category, the Atlanta division will be the
largest of the four.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters will be based in current IRS space in Atlanta,
although new facilities might have to be leased or constructed
later.
</P>
<P>
   The other three new IRS divisions are the Tax Exempt Operating
Division, based in central New Jersey, and the Small Business and
Self-Employed Division, and the Large and Mid-Size Operating
Divisions, both based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions were established because the IRS Restructuring and
Reform Act of 1998 directed the IRS to replace its geographically
organized structure with one based on units serving particular
groups of taxpayers.

 &HT;    Ga. State Merit switch to PPOs faces delays
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state's plan to move 400,000 state employees and
dependents into managed-care networks apparently is in limbo until
a new department of health is organized.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Roy Barnes said the proposed super-agency
would decide on the State Merit System changes. Legislation to
create the new agency will be introduced in the next two weeks,
spokesman Gary Horlacher said.
</P>
<P>
   The health agency is Barnes' brainchild. It would combine the
Department of Medical Assistance, State Merit System, State Health
Planning Agency, and possibly some Department of Human Resources
units, including the Division of Public Health. The University
System's health plan could come under the agency as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still options on what to include in the agency,''
Horlacher said. ``Some (units) are borderline.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's formation could delay the projected July
startup of the State Merit System's plan to shift members from
traditional insurance into preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
</P>
<P>
   The State Merit System has turned to managed care in order to
halt troubling losses. For the current fiscal year, 1999, the plan
is projected to lose $83.5 million, after losing about $32.4
million in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A PPO allows more freedom than an HMO. A patient can choose a
physician or hospital outside the network, but must pay more for
that choice.
</P>
<P>
   The State Merit System, dividing the state into nine regions,
was set to award PPO contracts in December, culminating a
high-stakes competition among insurers and hospital-based groups.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, State Merit covers about 263,000 Georgians, including
teachers and school employees. Along with dependents, the total
reaches 546,000; about 138,000 belong to HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it retains its traditional insurance option, the state
benefits program still plans to raise employees' deductibles and
out-of-pocket spending limits, which would also come under the PPO
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing them will dampen unnecessary utilization of medical
services,'' said Merit Commissioner Dana Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected: an 8 percent increase in premiums that employees
will pay. School systems and other state agencies will also be
charged higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, in his supplemental and regular budget, has devoted $80
million to State Merit to sustain the program through fiscal 2000,
including about $55 million from higher premiums from agencies,
Russell said. The deductible and other increases will bring another
$20 million, he added.

AMERICA ENTERING NEW PHASE IN DEALING WITH PEOPLE HIV POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more effective AIDS treatments develop,
Americans must change the way they think about people infected with
HIV and the role they have in society, health officials and legal
specialists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer about how to treat the dying; it's about how
to treat the living,'' said John Kane, senior judge of the U.S.
District Court in Colorado, at a conference here on the future of
public policy toward AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said the growing effectiveness of drugs in delaying the
onset of full-blown AIDS in HIV-positive people means that those
taking the medicines can live for years before becoming sick.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of them will choose to continue their normal lives,
society must learn to deal with this ``new minority,'' Kane said.
He added, ``We need to make sure that people infected with HIV are
not just allowed to work but that they are treated equally and
fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Supreme Court ruled that HIV infection
constitutes a physical impairment under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, which prevents unjust discrimination against
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kane said legislatures need to enacts laws that will
clarify how employers should treat workers with HIV or AIDS and
what kinds of accommodations must be made for them.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of 1997, more than 647,000 cases of AIDS had
been reported in the United States, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. As many as 900,000 more
Americans have the virus, and it infects about 40,000 people a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bayer, a professor at Columbia University's School of
Public Health, said the country also needs to change its image of
who is being infected by the virus. He said that while gays are
still at risk, the main growth in HIV infection is among
heterosexual drug users, minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer said the changing demographics of of infection means
public health policy must develop new ways to fight its spread.
``How we educate and whom we educate must reflect the new
populations at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Des Jarlais, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York City, said that with the growing number of
drug users contracting HIV, the government should reconsider its
opposition to needle exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are cheap and simple and can save thousands of
lives, so why not use them?'' he asked. Des Jarlais pointed out
that in Britain, needle exchange programs have nearly eliminated
HIV infection among intravenous drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Andrias, an associate justice of the New York Supreme
Court, said the changing face of those infected with the disease
will also strain the public health system, since drug users, women
and minorities are more likely not to have health insurance than
gay, white men.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 million people in the United State are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Andrias said the expensive drugs used to fight AIDS should not
be withheld from people who can't afford them because that denial
creates a two-tier system of care for people infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   He said current law allows health care providers to deny drugs
to people infected with HIV for various reasons, including the fact
that the patient is a drug user. ``We cannot allow a hospital to
turn down the fastest growing group,'' Andrias said.
</P>
<P>
   This practice will eventually cost more than it saves because as
the addicts become ill, the expense of their prolonged hospital
care will be far greater than that of the anti-AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if (you) don't like drug users and feel they're getting
what they deserve, you'll want to the country to save money,''
Andrias said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people worldwide are currently living with
HIV or AIDS, and more than 90 percent of them live in developing
countries, according to World Bank figures. Since the epidemic
began in the early 1980s, 11.7 million people have died of
AIDS-related causes, the World Bank said.

PROVIDENCE THREE ASSESS THE EXPERIENCE IN THE BIG LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Their bags were packed. They were ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   While Ray Bourque and Dmitri Khristich offered their views on
their roles in Sunday afternoon's NHL All-Star Game in Tampa and
some of their teammates lamented the way the Bruins had just played
in a 3-1 loss to Ottawa heading into the weekend break, defensemen
Terry Virtue and Brandon Smith and forward Andre Savage went about
their business in the Boston locker room Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Providence Three _ the latest cavalry called to fill in for
injured players _ were heading back down Interstate 95 that night.
They were to join the Providence Bruins for a game Thursday night
at home against Fredericton, then Savage was off to Monday's AHL
All-Star Game in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After that, with defensemen Dave Ellett and Grant Ledyard and
forward Chris Taylor among the Bruins on the mend, their NHL
futures are a bit up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen from there,'' Smith said
as he finished packing his bag. ``I've just got to keep working and
hopefully get another shot. They said go down and keep working. You
don't want to see anybody get hurt again, but fortunately, we got a
shot here. They gave us a good opportunity, and you try to make the
best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   All three got their first taste of the NHL in the last couple of
weeks. All have something to take back to the AHL. Savage, 23,
scored his first goal against Nashville Monday and played six
games. Smith, 25, made his NHL debut in Toronto and played in four
games. Virtue, 28, played in three, and the two defensemen usually
were paired together, each compiling a plus-3 here.
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, with NHL expansion coming, any exposure and
experience are a plus.
</P>
<P>
   For Virtue, it was a delayed debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, I was called up by St. Louis and I was
supposed to play in a game in Toronto,'' Virtue said. ``That's
where I was born. I took warmups and they told me I wasn't playing.
That was kind of a big letdown, so it was nice to get up here and
get a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage, Smith, and Virtue were all signed as free agents last
summer to add depth to the organization. Savage finished four years
at Michigan Tech last year, Smith had been in the minors with
Detroit, and Virtue spent the last couple of seasons in Worcester
with the St. Louis organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up taking a buyout,'' Virtue said. ``They kind of
basically told me they didn't have many plans for me. Larry Pleau
was coming in and he wanted to bring in his guys, and that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtue shopped around, talked with Providence coach Peter
Laviolette, against whom he had played and whom he had known for
some time, and signed with Boston Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   All three played key roles in helping Providence to a big first
half. Savage was second on the team in scoring and led AHL rookies
with 16 goals and 22 assists when he was called up. Smith (8 goals,
22 assists) and Virtue (4 goals, 21 assists) were 1-2 in team
scoring for defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   All three have now had a taste of the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an idea of what it's like up here, how I have to play,
work on my defensive game maybe,'' Smith said. ``Now it just makes
me more hungry to want to be up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, making what he hopes is his NHL breakthrough, takes
inspiration from the likes of Rob Murray, called back to the NHL
recently from Springfield after a long tour of duty in the minors.
The day before Virtue was called up, in fact, he read about
Murray's goal and assist, which earned him first star in his first
game up with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that and figured I still do have hope here,''
Virtue said with a laugh. ``Twenty-eight is older, but some teams,
that's what they're looking for, some older guys that can jump in
and play right away.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Virtue, Smith, and Savage zipped up their
black-and-gold Providence Bruins bags and zipped back down the
highway together.
</P>
<P>
   Savage spoke for all of them: ``It was great, a good experience
up to now. Hopefully, I'll get back up here soon.''

COURT TO RESOLVE LOUISIANA CASE INVOLVING VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In time for the next round of post-census
redistricting, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to resolve a
long-running dispute over how the Voting Rights Act applies to new
district lines that, while not making matters worse for minority
voters, nonetheless fail for discriminatory reasons to make things
better.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a joint appeal by the Justice Department and by a
group of black voters in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana.
The 12-member Bossier Parish school board, with members elected
from separate geographic districts, has never had a district with a
black majority and, as of the 1992 redistricting at issue in the
case, never had a black member. The population of the parish, or
county, is 20 percent black, with black residents concentrated in
two areas.
</P>
<P>
   In drawing new lines after the 1990 census, the school board
rejected a proposal from the local chapter of the NAACP that would
have created two majority-black districts. Instead, it adopted the
same lines that had already been drawn for the Police Jury, the
local governing body, which had 12 majority-white districts.
</P>
<P>
   After the Department of Justice refused in 1993 to approve the
new school board lines, the board appealed, under provisions of the
Voting Rights Act, to a special three-judge U.S. District Court
here. The court approved the redistricting, ruling that the absence
of intent to make the plan ``retrogressive'' _ to dilute black
votes to a greater extent than they already were _ was sufficient
to pass Voting Rights Act review.
</P>
<P>
   In their Supreme Court appeal, the Justice Department and the
black plaintiffs are arguing that even in a situation without
actual or attempted retrogression, the Voting Rights Act bars
approval of a plan that shows intent to entrench a status quo that
has limited black electoral power.
</P>
<P>
   ``A voting change must be denied preclearance if it was enacted
with a discriminatory purpose,'' the department's brief told the
court, ``even if that purpose was not necessarily retrogressive,
i.e. intended to make the position of minorities worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the case, Reno vs. Bossier Parish School Board, No.
98-405, is important in light of the coming round of redistricting,
in which actual retrogression is less likely than the more subtle
goal of entrenching an existing discriminatory system.
</P>
<P>
   The legal context for this dispute is Section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act, which applies to Southern states and parts of states
outside the South, including parts of New York and California. In
these ``covered jurisdictions,'' no change may be made in an
election practice without either the permission of the attorney
general, known as preclearance, or a declaration from the U.S.
District Court here that the change ``does not have the purpose and
will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote
on account of race or color.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the meaning of the word ``purpose,'' which the
lengthy litigation in this case, including a 1997 Supreme Court
decision, has yet to clarify. The precise question is whether the
purpose that the law prohibits is one that is discriminatory but
non-retrogressive.
</P>
<P>
   The school board, asking the justices to dismiss the appeal,
said recent developments proved that there was no discriminatory
purpose behind the board's choice of district lines in 1992. Two
black candidates were elected to the school board in 1994, one from
a district that was only 26.7 percent black. Both were re-elected
to four-year terms last year in an election in which a third black
candidate was also successful in a district that is only 21 percent
black.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, this was not a typical day at the court. Not
only was the chief justice, William Rehnquist, across the street
for the impeachment trial in the Senate chamber, but thousands of
anti-abortion demonstrators converged on the court in their annual
march to mark the anniversary of the court's decision in Roe vs.
Wade, issued 26 years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police barricades blocked the streets around the court, and the
building itself, with access limited to those who had business
there, was ringed by helmeted officers. Inside, however, aside from
the televisions turned on in some offices for the unusual sight of
the chief justice in another venue, there was no sign that anything
out of the ordinary was taking place.

CHIEF JUSTICE IS LENIENT ON SPEAKERS' TIME LIMITS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The face was familiar, the voice was familiar, the
robe with the four gold stripes was familiar _ but could this
really be the chief justice of the United States allowing House
impeachment managers and White House defense lawyers to run way
past their allotted times in answering senators' questions?
</P>
<P>
   In his own domain across the street from the Capitol, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist is the exacting keeper of the clock.
In this role, he is following tradition; Charles Evans Hughes,
chief justice in the 1930s, is said to have cut lawyers off in the
middle of the word ``the'' if that was when their time expired.
Rehnquist usually lets lawyers complete a word, if not an entire
sentence, once the red light comes on.
</P>
<P>
   His role as presiding officer of the Senate is decidedly more
deferential. At the beginning of the question phase of the
impeachment trial Friday, he announced a ``rebuttable presumption''
_ legal jargon for a rule with wiggle room _ that answers should be
no longer than five minutes. But there was no red light, and it
quickly became apparent that no one was really counting.

SYMPHONY HALL DECLARED A NATIONAL LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Friday Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior,
designated Symphony Hall a National Historic Landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The news surprised most music lovers, who have considered
Symphony Hall a national treasure all along. According to Boston
Symphony Orchestra managing director Mark Volpe, ``This is a nice
distinction _ we join a select list of only 2,000 other structures,
including Carnegie Hall and Jordan Hall. We feel this designation
confirms the place Symphony Hall holds in history. Also we hope it
will ultimately help access funds that we haven't been able to tap
into before. We've very happy about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, too, was surprised that Symphony Hall had not previously
been named a National Historic Landmark. John Marksbury, the BSO's
former director of development specializing in government, did the
paperwork for this project.
</P>
<P>
   Symphony Hall celebrates its centennial in the fall of 2000. Two
years ago the electrical systems were completely overhauled, and
this year work was undertaken in the public areas, chiefly the
renovation of the restrooms. Volpe says that the organization will
take 6-12 months to study what needs to be done to keep the hall
fully functional while doing nothing to adversely affect the
internationally celebrated acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said, ``We have to look at all the functions, the
orchestra's use, the requirements of other users, staff issues,
artists' needs, public amenities, and merchandising. We want to
stop the process of encountering problems and then dealing with
them in an incremental kind of way; we want to understand the whole
picture of what needs to be done, and to learn from what other
orchestras have done with their historic halls, like Orchestra Hall
in Chicago and Severance Hall in Cleveland. Another factor we have
to consider is that Symphony Hall is one of the busiest facilities
in the country, with only 6-7 weeks of down time a year, so we will
have to work around that. It is not our intention to leave the
hall, the way the Cleveland Orchestra did so that the work could be
done in Severance. All of this means that the restorative work in
Symphony Hall will not be complete by the centennial, although we
will have made progress by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said the designation will not ``box in'' the BSO's plans
for the hall. ``The guidelines are well within what we can live
with.'' The advantage is that ``there are many funds set aside to
preserve our national historic landmarks,'' he said. ``This
designation helps us make our case that the government and private
donors should invest in Symphony Hall because it not only serves
the Boston Symphony Orchestra but also the entire community.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems to have become easier for a camel to slip through the
eye of a needle. That is the implication behind the proliferation
of a particular kind of investor: one who considers social values
as well as returns.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of assets in managed portfolios and mutual funds screened
for social issues of all kinds has snowballed. From mid-1995 to
mid-1997, such assets under management grew 227 percent, to $529
billion _ almost three times faster than all assets under
management, according to the latest data from the Social Investment
Forum, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it isn't just ecological or tobacco issues that are
being factored into investment decisions, although such traditional
screens are still the most common. Investors are increasingly
screening for, say, drug companies that supply products used in
abortions, or a company's contributions to political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Current research suggests that at least some social screens, in
themselves, have no adverse effect on performance. Indeed, the
performance of the Domini Social Index of 400 companies has gone a
long way to mute skepticism. The index, which screens for dozens of
kinds of corporate behavior, from ownership of nuclear power plants
to good employee relations, returned an average 21.5 percent a year
from its inception in May 1990 through December 1998. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index of large-capitalization stocks returned an
average of 19.4 percent a year in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced. A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper
Inc., the Summit, N.J., research firm, thinks social investments
have just been lucky. ``The Domini index has done well because it's
underweighted in basic industries and energy, sectors with lower
social standing'' and, recently, lower returns, he said. ``And it
emphasizes technology and services,'' sectors that have led the
bull market, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the credible performance of the Domini benchmark is just
one factor that has brought more investors into the fold. Steve
Schueth, president of the Social Investment Forum, said much of the
increase stemmed from investor antipathy toward Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend has been aided by the mushrooming of options.
There are now 66 socially screened mutual funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, versus 12 in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   While such funds are often lumped together, many now use very
different criteria. Some bond funds that do not support military
spending will not hold United States Treasuries but instead hold
agency bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Others will not buy gambling stocks. And the Women's Equity
fund, with less than $10 million in assets, screens by the number
of senior-executive women at a company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who buy individual stocks through brokerage firms have
the most flexibility in how they screen stocks. Lisa Leff, a
portfolio manager with Salomon Smith Barney Asset Management who
runs the social awareness investment program, says a broker at her
firm can create a customized, screened portfolio for an account
with $50,000 or more, and the fees are comparable to nonscreened
equity portfolios. Assets managed using these screens have risen
from $310 million in January 1996 to $1.4 billion now.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Jaffray, among others, recently set up a similar service.

A JEWISH MUSEUM OPENS IN BERLIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Michael Blumenthal has a room with a typically
disjointed Berlin view. In the foreground, the gracious,
18th-century dome of the German cathedral, the work of an imperial
power that ended badly. In the background, a maze of cranes,
symbols of this city's latest stab at inventing a glorious future.
</P>
<P>
   Past and future are everywhere in this town where museums and
vast construction sites abut each other awkwardly, but few people
bear as onerous a responsibility in trying to reconcile them as
this 73-year-old American whose life has come full circle to place
him back in the city from which Hitler drove him.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal accepted a symbolic key to Berlin's new Jewish museum
from a city official on Friday in a ceremony marking the building's
completion. Designed by the American architect Daniel Libeskind,
the museum amounts to an architectural sculpture whose disorienting
form and towering empty spaces capture the vertiginous pinnacles
and voids of Jewish life in Germany and of Berlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult task of filling this building in a way that tells
the story of the 2,000-year Jewish presence in Germany now falls to
Blumenthal, the museum's director. A secretary of the treasury
under President Carter and retired chief executive of the computer
company Unisys, his qualifications for this arduous aesthetic
undertaking are by no means self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   But within Blumenthal are many of the same tensions that this
city and its new museum must struggle to resolve. In this sense, he
is a natural occupant of a building where it is very hard to draw a
straight line from one point to another.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's internal grappling _ memories of a sunny early
childhood in Berlin, the Nazi cataclysm that took many relatives,
success in his adopted American home, and an unexpected desire to
return and resolve some unfinished business _ is merely one version
of the many dislocated stories that make it so difficult for
Berliners to link past and future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here often say to me, `You are really a Berliner,' and
of course I could be German if I wanted,'' Blumenthal said. ``But I
feel very strongly about the United States, which has been very
good to me over 50 years, and I'd like to borrow my adopted
country's message of building bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled, a disarmingly open smile that breaks into a hard face
and gruff manner with unexpected warmth. ``What really concerns me
is whether remembrance can be brought to the point where there is
harmony, or at least understanding, or will each side, Germans and
Jews, remember in a way that brings resentments?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich, long
after former Chancellor Willy Brandt's moving genuflection in the
Warsaw ghetto, in the wake of countless other official and personal
German acts of contrition and remembrance, it may seem pretentious
or even heavy-handed to talk yet again of the shaping of memory.
</P>
<P>
   But as Blumenthal has discovered, the theme is inescapable in
today's Berlin. Of course much has been said and done over the last
half-century. But the Cold War, German division until 1990, and the
lingering shame of Hitler's generation combined to produce areas of
silence that the abrupt rebirth of Berlin as capital has shattered.
</P>
<P>
   In the immense tracts of land where the Berlin wall once stood
and a new city is now being born, in the former buildings of
Hitler's Reich now set to become federal ministries once again, the
question is endlessly posed by the silhouetted cranes: How should
the past be remembered in a way that secures and solidifies the
future?
</P>
<P>
   The question is there for former East Germans abruptly released
from the confines of communism into a Western world that has
sometimes been less than welcoming, just as it is there for this
Jewish American businessman whose family fled Berlin in 1939,
passed the war years in Shanghai, China, and arrived penniless in
the United States in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was swept under the carpet is now coming out
in the form of endless questioning by the Jews and also by the
Germans,'' Blumenthal said. ``The stolen art. The stolen money. The
forced labor. It is very hard, very tortured, sometimes very
bitter, and perhaps we will need to wait a further generation for
more sober reflection. But meanwhile, we want to show what Germany
lost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal is working closely with Shaike Weinberg, the first
director of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, on what he
hopes will be a compelling narrative of the rich Jewish presence in
Germany that was shattered by Hitler. The intention is not to show
a host of Jewish artifacts, however splendid, but to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   The last Jewish Museum in Berlin was opened on Jan. 24, 1933,
just before Hitler came to power. It did not survive long. Since
then, the German view of Jews, who now number about 80,000 in
Germany, compared with a prewar total of 500,000, has inevitably
come to be filtered through the overwhelming prism of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want young Germans to view Jews solely as victims,''
Blumenthal said. ``I want to show that their own history was linked
to a flowering Jewish intellectual, professional and cultural
presence for many years. I want to ensure that Jews are seen as
what they once were here: citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   In this task, the museum director faces an obvious danger: the
building _ fractured, destabilizing, troubling _ may overwhelm any
exhibit with the force of a message that is in many ways dark.
Another danger, now looming, is that Blumenthal may be overwhelmed
by the sheer scale of what he has taken on.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as the Jewish Museum develops _ it will be open
to the public from next month but will not contain any exhibits
until the end of next year _ another enormous project about
remembrance is supposed to take form. This is the Holocaust
Memorial, next to the Brandenburg Gate, and under new proposals
made this month Blumenthal would oversee this project too.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the distinction between the museum and the memorial is
clear. The former will tell a history of the Jews; the latter _ a
vast field of stones, a 65-foot-high wall of books, and a research
center _ will be a place of remembrance and reflection. ``If both
projects have a single authority, we will avoid duplication,''
Blumenthal argued.
</P>
<P>
   But already the mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, has objected,
saying the latest plans for the memorial ``raise more questions
than they answer.'' A prominent Christian Democrat politician, Uwe
Lehmann-Brauns, said Friday that a new design for the Memorial by
the New York architect Peter Eisenman was ``repulsively
functional.''
</P>
<P>
   And some newspapers have begun to ask why the Jewish Museum and
the proposed Holocaust Memorial are both designed and run by
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is enormous,'' Blumenthal conceded. ``The German
thirst to be `normal' again is strong. I often hear from Germans
that enough is enough, and in some ways I understand. But the
enormity of what happened demands that, even at this late hour, we
find the right symbols of remembrance.''
</P>
<P>
   His apartment with the view of the dome and the cranes occupies
the place where a legendary 18th-century Berlin woman, Rahel Levin,
hosted a remarkable literary salon attended by Goethe. A Jew, she
established herself in German society, converted to Christianity,
changed her name and married a nobleman, only to develop a
late-life interest in her Jewish roots under the pressure of a
resurgent anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her story illustrates the constant trials of Jewish life here,
the questions never resolved,'' Blumenthal said as he gazed out
over his readopted city. Rahel Levin's was also a life much like
his own: a story of emancipation and uncertain return.

NATION NEEDS TO RETHINK POLICIES ON THOSE WITH HIV, EXPERTS SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more effective AIDS treatments develop,
Americans must change the way they think about people infected with
HIV and the role they have in society, health officials and legal
specialists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no longer about how to treat the dying; it's about how
to treat the living,'' said John Kane, senior judge of the U.S.
District Court in Colorado, at a conference here on the future of
public policy toward AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said the growing effectiveness of drugs in delaying the
onset of full-blown AIDS in HIV-positive people means that those
taking the medicines can live for years before becoming sick.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of them will choose to continue their normal lives,
society must learn to deal with this ``new minority,'' Kane said.
He added, ``We need to make sure that people infected with HIV are
not just allowed to work but that they are treated equally and
fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Supreme Court ruled that HIV infection
constitutes a physical impairment under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, which prevents unjust discrimination against
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kane said legislatures need to enacts laws that will
clarify how employers should treat workers with HIV or AIDS and
what kinds of accommodations must be made for them.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of 1997, more than 647,000 cases of AIDS had
been reported in the United States, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. As many as 900,000 more
Americans have the virus, and it infects about 40,000 people a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bayer, a professor at Columbia University's School of
Public Health, said the country also needs to change its image of
who is being infected by the virus. He said that while gays are
still at risk, the main growth in HIV infection is among
heterosexual drug users, minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer said the changing demographics of of infection means
public health policy must develop new ways to fight its spread.
``How we educate and whom we educate must reflect the new
populations at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Des Jarlais, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York City, said that with the growing number of
drug users contracting HIV, the government should reconsider its
opposition to needle exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are cheap and simple and can save thousands of
lives, so why not use them?'' he asked. Des Jarlais pointed out
that in Britain, needle exchange programs have nearly eliminated
HIV infection among intravenous drug users.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Andrias, an associate justice of the New York Supreme
Court, said the changing face of those infected with the disease
will also strain the public health system, since drug users, women
and minorities are more likely not to have health insurance than

   About 70 million people in the United State are uninsured.

<P>
   Andrias said the expensive drugs used to fight AIDS should not
be withheld from people who can't afford them because that denial
creates a two-tier system of care for people infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   He said current law allows health care providers to deny drugs
to people infected with HIV for various reasons, including the fact
that the patient is a drug user. ``We cannot allow a hospital to
turn down the fastest growing group,'' Andrias said.
</P>
<P>
   This practice will eventually cost more than it saves because as
the addicts become ill, the expense of their prolonged hospital
care will be far greater than that of the anti-AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if (you) don't like drug users and feel they're getting
what they deserve, you'll want to the country to save money,''
Andrias said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people worldwide are currently living with
HIV or AIDS, and more than 90 percent of them live in developing
countries, according to World Bank figures. Since the epidemic
began in the early 1980s, 11.7 million people have died of
AIDS-related causes, the World Bank said.

TCU PROGRAM OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONSERVATIVE BAPTIST
SEMINARIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tony Morgan is not exactly a Southern
Baptist in exile.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministerial student left a highly conservative Southern
Baptist seminary to enroll in the Baptist Studies Program at Texas
Christian University's Brite Divinity School, which is affiliated
with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a place where I could study free from all the
political power playing'' between Baptist conservatives and
moderates, said Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 29, is still a loyal Southern Baptist. But he felt out
of place studying for three semesters at Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., which in recent years has
seen a revolution from moderate to conservative control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I was told, `People like you don't belong here now
that we are in control,' '' said Morgan, who is a theological
moderate. He is one of 38 students in the Baptist Studies Program
at TCU this year. Almost all of the students are receiving
financial aid through the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist Studies Program, established in 1995, is a moderate
alternative to more conservative Southern Baptist seminary
training, said William Hendricks, a longtime Southern Baptist
educator who was called out of retirement to be director of the TCU
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strong point is that we are ecumenically oriented and we
are intentional about seeking to train women in the ordained
ministry,'' Hendricks said. About half of the Baptist students are
women.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist conservative leaders in recent years have
enforced a strict conservatism on professors in the six Southern
Baptist-supported seminaries, including Southwestern in Fort Worth.
All support women in ministry, but some teach that it is unbiblical
for a woman to serve as a senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Growing prohibition of women in the ordained ministry by
Southern Baptist conservatives was one reason that Linda Ford chose
Brite for her doctoral program. She is one of 10 Ph.D. students in
a new program at Brite. Five of the Ph.D. students are Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also wanted to attend a non-Baptist school to broaden her
education, since she received a bachelor's at Southwestern Baptist
University in Bolivar, Mo., and a master's at Golden Gate Baptist
Theological Seminary in Mill Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that if I had a Southern Baptist Ph.D., I
might be limited to Southern Baptists seminaries to teach,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also is worried that Southern Baptists in the conservative
camp may be moving toward a doctrine of prohibition of women in the
ordained ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been limited in my ministry so far. I've been
encouraged by Southern Baptists,'' she said. ``But I'm afraid that
the prohibitions may become more pronounced five or six years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist Studies Program gets financial support from moderate
churches and organizations, including the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship and the Alliance of Baptists. Participants study Baptist
history and theology and have firsthand interviews with many
Baptist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said it is beneficial for Brite students of other faiths
to realize that there are Baptists who are not so conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people when they hear the word `Baptist' these days,
think of people who targeted the Jews for evangelism, or those
people who said you should not go to Disney movies,'' he said.
``People need to know that there are Baptists who are not rigidly
fundamentalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is president of the Baptist students group at Brite,
which is sponsoring church-state lectures Feb. 1-2. The principal
speaker will be James Dunn, director of the Baptist Joint Committee
on Public Affairs. Conservative Southern Baptists withdrew funding
from Dunn's organization, saying it took liberal stands on
political and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another Baptist touch will come during TCU's Ministers Week,
Feb. 8-11, when Molly Marshall will deliver the Scott Lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, the first woman to teach theology at a Southern
Baptist seminary, was forced out of her position at Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary when conservatives took over. Now she
is professor of theology and spiritual formation at Central Baptist
Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Other Baptists associated with Brite Divinity School include
Andrew Lester, professor of pastoral theology and pastoral care,
and Jeff Pool, director of Brite's annual fund and lecturer in
theology. Also, Darren J.N. Middleton, a Baptist, teaches in TCU's
religion department.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said TCU's Baptist program, with its small numbers of
students, is no threat to Baptist seminaries, such as the
3,000-student Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be complementary rather than competitive,'' he
said.

CARCRAZY (Phoenix) - Every January, Phoenix and Scottsdale go
bonkers for old cars. You see them everywhere, beautifully restored
or ratty original, classic cars parked on the street corners with
for-sale signs, cruising past on the highway _ muscle cars, classic
cars, even valuable Ferraris _ they just come out of the woodwork.
It's most evident in the Republic classified, where the typical
single column of classic-car ads suddenly turns into two full
pages. Or more. On the auction site, bidding reaches a fevered
pitch as people vie for their hearts' desires. At the automobilia
auction in the morning, where people pay top dollar for old
automotive artworks, toys and collectibles, you see such sights as
a veteran auctioneer holding up a small metal car. ``What am I bid
for this exquisite Rolls-Royce Dinky toy, only missing one
headlight?'' It sold for 50 bucks. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move

IMPEACH-BOREDOM (Phoenix) - The impeachment trial is a sad and
disreputable sight. That is why most of us Americans simply cannot
watch the damn thing. It is why we flip the channel to basic cable,
since that seems to be the only way to avoid it. Let me watch
Animal Planet or the Travel Channel. Please. We are no longer
citizens, but sports fans. In this corner, with leather masks, the
tag team of Bill Bennett and Pat Buchanan; in the other corner,
wearing capes, is Lanny Davis and Michael Kinsley. They will debate
to the death. Unfortunately, the death involved is the one we die
of boredom. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story will move in the ``K''
category. Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 24. &QL;

KERRY SAYS CAMPAIGN DEBT MOSTLY PAID BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry has nearly wiped out his campaign debts
from the 1996 election, according to papers that will be filed next
week with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   By whittling down the debt, Kerry said he is in a position to
decide whether to engage in a presidential bid, as well as the
fund-raising that comes with a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, Kerry raised $1.2 million from 4,400
donors for the second half of 1998, and a total of $2.9 million
during the last 18 months. During the past six months, he received
donations from more than 1,400 first-time contributors, said
William Elsbree, Kerry's campaign treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he expects to wipe out the remaining $480,000 debt
during the first quarter of 1999. He also said he would expand his
fund-raising operation, bringing in an additional person to work
with Peter Maroney, who used to raise money for former US
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel elated, relieved,'' Kerry said Friday. ``I feel as if
I'm back in control over that portion of my life again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he has continued to hold meetings with friends and
advisers to discuss a presidential run. One concern, he said, is
whether his donors overlap with Vice President Al Gore and former
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, diminishing his ability to raise
enough money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the analyses that has to be made,'' said Kerry,
eyeing a February decision.

TRIAL'S WAR OF ECONOMISTS PITS STUDENT AGAINST TEACHER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last few weeks the Microsoft antitrust trial has heard
warring economists provide sweeping overviews of each side's case.
These two particular economists have a history.
</P>
<P>
   The government's witness, Franklin M. Fisher of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the thesis adviser of
the chief Microsoft economics witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, also
of MIT. Perhaps that is why Schmalensee appears to take impish
delight in poking fun at his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's case, he says, boils down to arguing that ``consumers
will be made better off if they are deprived, by court order, of
Web-browsing functionality that Microsoft wishes to provide at zero
marginal cost and that consumers are free to ignore or replace.''
Put that way, the government's case does sound vapid.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, counters Fisher. He traces the steps by which Microsoft
crossed the line between fierce competition and illegality.
Microsoft, he argues, has attempted to use its Windows monopoly to
seize control of the market for browsers. The threat is not merely
that Microsoft will wrest the browser market away from the current
leader, Netscape Communications. Worse, he says, Microsoft might
well use browser domination to eliminate potential competition in
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The latest browsers have the potential to replace the operating
system as the platform from which computers run word processors and
other application programs. With a browser like Netscape's that can
work with many operating systems, a user might soon be able to do
without Windows. Microsoft perceived the threat and, Fisher argues,
pounced.
</P>
<P>
   First, it bundled its browser into Windows without charge and
forced computer manufacturers to sign contracts that prohibited
them from substituting Netscape's browser for Microsoft's. These
contracts cut Netscape off from one large channel of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Microsoft wrote contracts with Internet companies like
America Online, putting short cuts to their Web sites in a
prominent spot on Windows computers in exchange for the companies'
tilting their customers toward Microsoft's browser. These contracts
cut Netscape off from another distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's point is that, other than setting the browser's price
at zero, these contracts did not benefit consumers, though they did
hurt Netscape. He goes on to label the zero price ``predatory'' _
set to lose money in the short run just to drive a competitor out
of business. So what appears to be a wondrous gift to consumers is
in fact a manipulative ploy to protect Window's monopoly position.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust laws permit Microsoft to prosper by selling
superior products. They do not allow a monopolist like Microsoft to
use tactics that serve only to impose costs on potential rivals.
With Microsoft behaving that way, it is impossible for
entrepreneurs who want to develop a rival product to find financial
backing.
</P>
<P>
   So by crushing competition, Microsoft crushes innovation _ a
dire threat to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a compelling argument, except for one inconvenient
fact. When asked during cross-examination whether Microsoft's
tactics had harmed consumers, Fisher said, ``On balance, I'd think
that the answer is no up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not, however, a devastating admission, since. under the
antitrust laws, the government doesn't have to prove that consumers
have been harmed, only that Microsoft's tactics pose a substantial
threat of harm.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee labels his former teacher's ruminations about
consumer harm ``sheer speculation.'' Microsoft keeps the price of
Windows low and steadily improves the product, he says, and its
contracts have not shut Netscape off from potential customers. In
fact, the number of users of Netscape's browser increased by about
20 million from early 1996 to last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee stingingly accuses his teacher of elementary error.
Microsoft's zero price for the browser cannot be labeled predatory,
he argues, because even at a zero price, the browser makes money by
bolstering sales of Windows and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schmalensee's testimony falls flat in key places, too. He
breathlessly asserts that bundling the browser with Windows helps
consumers. But Fisher's complaint is less with the bundling than
with the no-substitution contracts and the fact that Microsoft made
the technical task of replacing its browser with Netscape's
needlessly difficult. Schmalensee says that Netscape enjoys ample
distribution channels, but Fisher's point is that Microsoft's
contracts deny Netscape the most lucrative ones.
</P>
<P>
   So who wins this battle of wits? Fisher has made a compelling
case that Microsoft's tactics are illegally anticompetitive.
Schmalensee has made the case that the threat of harm is
speculative. That may leave the court to rule cautiously in favor
of the government, but to tread even more cautiously when it
designs remedies.

9,000 NEW JOBS CREATED IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts added 9,000 jobs in December and
continued a trend of declining unemployment rates every year since
1992, the state reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate rose slightly last month, to 3.1
percent from 2.9 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
   But December's job gain was the biggest one-month increase since
last spring. Employers increased their payrolls in order to meet
the usual seasonal hiring demands for the holidays as well as an
unusually warm month that contributed to job gains in the
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, the state averaged a 3.3 percent unemployment
rate, the lowest annual rate since the economic boom of 1988. The
average annual rate has declined every year since peaking in 1991
at 9.1 percent, according to the monthly jobs report released
Friday by the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the nation's longest-running peacetime boom, Massachusetts
has fared even better than the nation as a whole. The state's
unemployment rate has been below the national rate for five
consecutive years. US unemployment was 4.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Massachusetts economy is setting the pace for the
nation,'' Gov. Paul Cellucci said in a statement released with the
state's report.
</P>
<P>
   There were more people employed in December than in November,
though the number of unemployed also rose. Last month, 3,174,900
people were working.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 9,000 jobs added last month, nearly half _ 4,100 _ were
in the services sector, including business and engineering
services. These two groups accounted for more than half of the new
service jobs created over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry added 1,700 jobs in December. The
manufacturing sector, which has lost export volume due to global
economic shocks, lost only 200 jobs last month as the pace of
decline slowed.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech, non-manufacturing companies added 900 jobs last
month, more than offsetting a slight loss of 300 tech manufacturing
jobs.

Lundberg, the former editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, those did not involve any possibility of Lundberg
being rehired in any capacity, AMA officials said Friday. Others
familiar with the talks said on Thursday that some sort of future
relationship between Lundberg and the group is possible, and they
said that possibility led Lundberg to cancel an interview he'd
scheduled for Friday with the CBS news magazine ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George is not coming back to the AMA,'' Emerson Moran, the
AMA's interim vice president for communications, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't characterize the discussions because those have been
between counsels for both sides,'' Moran added. ``Any report that
Dr. Lundberg will become an employee of the AMA is inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, who was in Cambridge, Mass. Friday for a conference at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, could not be reached for
comment. Neither could his lawyer, who on Thursday confirmed that
there had been discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said Friday that he could not say what the discussions did
involve, but he could say that the AMA was not wavering in its
resolve to separate itself from Lundberg, who had edited the
highly-esteemed JAMA for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg's firing centered around the publication in this week's
JAMA of an article in which a majority of students at an unnamed
Midwestern college agreed with President Clinton's controversial
contention that oral-genital contact does not constitute ``having
sex.'' The article came out just after Clinton's impeachment trial
began in the Senate. That timing, AMA Executive Vice President E.
Ratcliffe Anderson explained last week, suggested that Lundberg was
``inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting JAMA into a major
political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he had other complaints against Lundberg, but
declined to say what they were.

RED SOX VALUE POURS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the spring of 1967, and a troubled Tom Yawkey sat behind
his desk at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   His team had lost 90, 100, and 90 games the previous three
years. Red Sox attendance the prevous six years never reached 1
million, and in 1966, it dropped to a pathetic 652,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a new ballpark,'' the Red Sox owner said. ``I'm losing
too much money. I'm not trying to make money, but I don't want to
lose any, either. I told (general manager Dick) O'Connell to put
everything we take in back into the ball club, but I can't keep on
going on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Yawkey forgot his troubles. The Red Sox had an
unforgettable season, vaulting from ninth place the year before to
win the American League pennant. Late in the season, when the Sox
were on the way to drawing 1.7 million to Fenway, Yawkey announced
that he didn't need a new ballpark anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But what I remember as much as anything else from that
conversation was Yawkey's lament about the politicians of that era.
After World War II, when most Americans got automobiles for the
first time and were making it their primary mode of transportation,
Yawkey asked the city of Boston to help him get some space for
parking. He suggested taking some of the land used for Victory
Gardens along the Fens. The city laughed at him. He got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you look at the history of the Boston Red Sox, who
will be 100 years old in two years, neither the city nor the state
has ever done anything to help them out. The Sox built the park.
They pay taxes on the park. And they have surely generated billions
of dollars over the last century for the economy of this city and
state, getting nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox soon will announce a plan for a new Fenway Park, and
already, opponents are lined up. Most troubling are the remarks of
Speaker of the House Tom Finneran, who says he will apply the same
``principles'' he used to drive the Patriots out of state. He has
painted himself into a corner with his actions against the Patriots
and now finds it hard to do something for the Red Sox, which he
should.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran has made it plain that he does not want to do anything
to help ``fat-ass'' millionaires get richer. Well, in the case of
the Red Sox, this does not apply. Tom Yawkey and his wife, Jean,
have left a legacy for Boston and the state that few can match,
though neither was a native of Massachusetts. When Tom died in
1976, he left $10 million in a charitable trust, with 5 percent to
be distributed each year to Boston and South Carolina charities.
Even before she died in 1992, Jean Yawkey left a $30 million
charitable trust that has been spinning out more than $2 million
annually, almost entirely for local charities.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what Tom Finneran should know, and understand, makes
the Red Sox stadium deal different. The estate of Jean Yawkey owns
55 percent of the team, plus the park. When the team is sold, 55
percent of the purchase price will go into her estate and then be
distributed to local charities.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner reportedly has been offered $780 million to
sell the Yankees to Cablevision. Someday, most likely in the next
10 years, the Red Sox, by law, will have to be sold. The team
playing in a new Fenway Park would perhaps triple in value. Within
three years after moving out of old Municipal Stadium in Cleveland,
the Indians went from taking in $50 million (that's taking in, not
making) a year to $150 million a year in the new ballpark, Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, some 30 individuals or groups have written to the
Red Sox expressing intrerest in buying the team. When the team is
ready to be sold, there will be a bidding process. John Harrington,
who runs the team for the Yawkey Trust, has the fiduciary
responsibility, according to the wishes of Jean Yawkey's will, to
get the best possible price for the team and the park in order to
maximize the funding for the Yawkey Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a guess that five years from now, the Red Sox and a
new park sell for $600 million. Then 55 percent of the net profit,
let's say $300 million, would go into the Yawkey Trust, be combined
with the $30 million plus already there, and form a base of $330
million from which 5 percent will be donated annually to local
charities, in perpetuity. That will help a lot of local people who
are destitute at the Pine Street Inn, or sick kids under the
auspices of the Jimmy Fund, or any number of schools. And let us
not forget, the Jimmy Fund, of which we in New England are all so
proud, was built by the Red Sox _ Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski,
et. al. They have backboned the Dana Farber Institute, recognized
as one of the best cancer treatment centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is a part of the Red Sox that transcends dollar values,
and the politicians who run this city and state should understand
that. For six months a year, the Sox give people in hospitals and
every small town and village across this part of New England
something to talk about and to look forward to watching or
listening to. They have been doing it for nearly a century. The
Yawkeys have had a continual impact, even in death, since 1932.
When they died, they left most of their money here to continue to
do good for other people. All that is worth something.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if you are one of those people beefing about the
Red Sox and Dan Duquette, come up with the $600 million now and
you've got a deal. You won't have to wait . . . Saturday marks the
first time the Boston College women's basketball team has ever sold
out Conte Forum. The Eagles have sold more than 8,000 tickets for
the game against Connecticut, the nation's second-ranked team . . .
By the way, football coach Tom O'Brien and athletic director Gene
DeFilippo have big smiles these days because they believe that when
all the results are in Feb. 3, BC will have its best recruiting
class in years, probably the best in the Big East.

   More than 300 people from South Boston toasted their national
champion midget hockey team of 25 years ago in Florian Hall in
Dorchester. South Boston has sent 10 teams to the national midget
championships over the years, but the 1973 team is the only one
that went all the way. The proceeds from thereunion will go toward
sending this year's team to the nationals . . . Who said this: ``I
just don't think it is right. This team has had great support over
the years. The team is loved in the region. The television ratings
are at the top of the league. To me, this does not fit the
guidelines we have in the league for moving.'' Bob Kraft when the
Cleveland Browns were preparing to move to Baltimore . . . How
would you like to be Pete Carroll and read that the Patriots are
thinking of bringing in Art Shell as offensive line coach? Shell,
now coaching the offensive line in Atlanta, reportedly wants out
whether the Falcons win the Super Bowl next week or not. Shell is a
head coaching candidate. If Carroll has another tough season and
gets fired, Shell would have to be given first consideration as the
next head coach if he were here. Carroll, knowing that, would be
looking over his shoulder all year.

</P>
<P>
   Friends claim that Todd Rucci has been told he will be selected
by the Browns in the expansion draft Feb. 9 . . . Others claim that
Bill Belichick will bypass the chance to interview for head
coaching posts. He has already been guaranteed the job with the
Jets when Bill Parcells steps down as head coach . . . Antoine
Walker is the captain of the team and he is the last guy to show up
for Celtics practice. Teams should not give the title to any player
who does not act like a captain should . . . Chuck Knox is the only
coach to win three NFL division titles for three different teams
besides Parcells. Knox won with the Rams, Bills, and Seahawks
during his illustrious career.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ As top Olympic officials gather here to
cope with the still-growing Salt Lake City bidding scandal, a new
and potentially more perilous controversy surfaced Friday over
allegations of vote-buying in Sydney's campaign for the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian International Olympic Committee member on Friday
admitted to a Sydney newspaper that he offered $70,000 in
inducements to two African IOC members the night before Sydney won
the 2000 Games by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee,
told The Sydney Herald that he offered $35,000 each to the National
Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC
members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, one of the leaders of the Sydney bid, said he offered
the money in the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members
to vote for Sydney. ``I thought it was necessary for us to show our
commitment to those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,''
Coates said. ``My view was that it might encourage them to consider
their votes for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper(CQ), Australia's senior IOC member, acknowledged in
Lausanne that the offer could be seen as a bribe and bring demands
for Sydney to be stripped of the Games. ``I think that's possible
given the narrowness of the margin,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney won the Games in 1993 by narrowly defeating closest rival
Beijing by 45-43 on the final ballot the day after Coates made the
offer. Because the vote is taken in a secret ballot, it is
impossible to determine how the members actually voted.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, an IOC executive board member, said Coates's statements
``lead to the conclusion that he was trying to influence an outcome
even if he didn't put money into the pockets of IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sydney newspaper account, Coates denied the money was a
bribe and said it would go toward helping sport in Kenya and
Uganda. ``You have these developing countries which don't have
sponsors or fund-raising potential,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity to leverage the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the matter would be reviewed by the executive board
this weekend and probably would prompt an IOC investigation.
However, Gosper said he would ask the executive board to first
confirm that Sydney and Salt Lake City -- which is hosting the 2002
Winter Olympics -- would not be stripped of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would bring some stability at a very difficult time,'' he
said. ``Time has moved on, huge investments have been made, people
have certain expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no precedent for the IOC's taking the Games away from a
city once they have been awarded. Such a move could be legally
complicated because of a host of contracts not only between the
Sydney organizing committee and IOC, but between broadcasters and
sponsors of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, as Olympic officials were becoming aware of the
new allegations from Australia, a second IOC member resigned over
allegations related to the Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya delivered his resignation to
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch in person Friday, one day
before a special IOC commission is to conclude its inquiry into the
Salt Lake scandal. More resignations were expected, perhaps before
Saturday morning when the IOC executive board is scheduled to hear
accused IOC members make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gosper and other IOC members were meeting with
Samaranch in his private suite at the Lausanne Palace Hotel. There
was a sense of heightened gravity over the new allegations, which
come as the IOC was trying to get beyond the Salt Lake City crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Sydney's offer were contained in a package of
previously confidential Sydney bid documents released to Australian
news media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The files contained letters outlining the offers dated Sept. 23
, 1993, the date the IOC selected Sydney. The letter to Uganda's
Nyangweso said that ``if Sydney is successful'' the Australian
Olympic Committee would pay $5,000 a year to Uganda's National
Olympic Committee up to and including 2000 to help support the
Uganda National Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney newspaper said the two committees have been receiving
their $5,000 checks yearly as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also disclosed that Coates had written to Mukora
and Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their
way to Monaco for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Salt Lake City scandal, Attarabulsi, an IOC member since
1977, stepped down because of revelations that his son, Suhel,
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham
Young University and a community college, plus $700 a month for
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and
for us,'' Samaranch told the Associated Press Friday. ``He's a good
man. He did (make) a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her
ex-husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from Salt
Lake City and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Director General Francois Carrard told reporters that both
resignations were ``in the higher interest of the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to
Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old IOC president has called a special IOC assembly
here for March 17-18 to vote on expulsions and ratify new
site-selection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has
no intention of
</P>
<P>
   resigning.

 &HT;    POPE ARRIVES IN MEXICO TO CHART COURSE FOR 'THE CONTINENT OF
HOPE'

   MEXICO CITY _ Blessed by unusually blue, clear skies, Mexico
City welcomed Pope John Paul II on Friday for a celebrated five-day
visit that could help chart the future of the Catholic church
throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Americas ``the continent of hope,'' the frail
pontiff stepped off his Alitalia plane at the Mexico City airport
to shrieks of joy from a crowd of 4,000 Catholic schoolchildren,
Mexican Indians and others selected for the arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``May God see that this visit that I begin today encourages all
in the effort to announce Jesus Christ with renewed ardor as the
new millennium approaches,'' the 78-year-old pontiff said in
Italian-accented Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He read his speech at the airport with shaking hands while he
was buffeted by a slight breeze that graced the normally smoggy
city.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is in Mexico, the second biggest Catholic nation in the
world, to celebrate the closure of a special conference of bishops
from the Americas designed to address challenges to the Catholic
church in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Before he heads to St. Louis, Mo., for a 30-hour visit and
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, the pope is
expected to speak on those challenges, which include human rights,
economic policies and poverty, the loss of faith and other
traditional religious doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Stooped and moving slowly with a help of a cane, the pontiff was
welcomed to Mexico for the fourth time since 1979 by Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all the times you've visited us before, you are received
by a people that loves and admires you,'' Zedillo said. ``You
represent the eagerness for justice that should be in the heart of
all human beings and should be the daily task of all people and
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Mexico is a country ``that suffers a lack of
material goods'' but enjoys ``immense spiritual richness'' and is
proud of its Catholicism, freedom of religion and its mixed ethnic
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The president thanked the pope for choosing Mexico as the nation
to deliver ``a message of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope praised the ``rich sensibility'' of Mexico's Indian
people and recalled the Spanish missionaries who left their
cultural imprint on Mexico. He referred to Mexico's national
symbol, the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe, as the ``little dark
one'' and said he would pray to her for ``the opening of a
fraternal and peaceful'' next century.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexicans waited for the pope's plane to touch down, thousands
of people flashed mirrors toward the sky, hoping that the Catholic
leader would see the reflections welcoming him.
</P>
<P>
   The devout lined the route the pontiff took to Mexico's historic
downtown plaza, where some of the first churches in the hemisphere
were erected by the Spanish and still stand. There the pope
received the keys to the city from Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and
later met with bishops from the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Cuevas Benitez, 26, a Mexico City street vender, blended
her faith with business as she sold hats along the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the pope's visit brings peace to Mexico,'' she said.
``There is much violence and insecurity. I hope this calms the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Ortega traveled with his family from the Mexican state
of Hidalgo -- northeast of Mexico City -- to see the pope, arriving
Friday at 9 a.m. (local time) to try to reserve space along the
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to see him. We know we can't get near enough to
ask him for something,'' he said. ``Mexico needs this visit just
like we need many other things. We hope he blesses us so we can
live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Also along the route was Serafina Ferrera, who had brought her
17-month-old baby Fabiola to Mexico City from the state of Hidalgo.
The baby suffers from a brain illness and Serafina was holding up a
banner that asked for the pope's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to receive the pope's blessing because my baby had an
operation four months ago that didn't work,'' Serafina said. ``But
faith moves mountains and the pope is the person who is closest to
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which the pope has said is ``always faithful,'' was the
first country the pontiff visited after he was elected pope in
1979. It was one of the first countries in the Americas converted
to Christianity nearly 500 years ago, and it remains more than 89
percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the pope comes to Mexico on a mission of
reconquest, seeking to shore up the Catholic church in the
Americas. About half the world's 1 billion Catholics live in the
Americas, but the church has been rapidly losing members to
Protestant faiths spread by missionaries in Latin America and to
secularism.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican views Mexico as a cornerstone of Catholicism in this
hemisphere despite an anti-clerical past. The Latin American
country is considered a bulwark against the spread of other
religions and the influence of a materialistic United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is expected to condemn abortion and reiterate
traditional Catholic views on the family while in Mexico, but he
may also urge more respect for the rights of the indigenous and the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   With the twilight of communism, so vigorously opposed by the
pope, the Catholic leader has issued surprisingly strong statements
against the excesses of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the pope celebrates mass in Mexico City's Our Lady
of Guadalupe Basilica, the second most-visited Catholic sanctuary
in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The shrine commemorates Mexico's beloved national symbol, the
Virgin of Guadalupe, who is said to have appeared before an Aztec
Indian peasant in 1531.
</P>
<P>
   He will also appear at the Hermanos Rodriguez Racetrack in
Mexico City before hundreds of thousands of people on Sunday and at
the city's Aztec Stadium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1 million tickets for several events have been
distributed to Catholics throughout Mexico who want to see the
pope.

 &HT;    POPE ARRIVES IN MEXICO TO CHART COURSE FOR 'THE CONTINENT OF
HOPE'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Blessed by unusually blue, clear skies, Mexico
City welcomed Pope John Paul II on Friday for a celebrated five-day
visit that could help chart the future of the Catholic church
throughout the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Americas ``the continent of hope,'' the frail
pontiff stepped off his Alitalia plane at the Mexico City airport
to shrieks of joy from a crowd of 4,000 Catholic schoolchildren,
Mexican Indians and others selected for the arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``May God see that this visit that I begin today encourages all
in the effort to announce Jesus Christ with renewed ardor as the
new millennium approaches,'' the 78-year-old pontiff said in
Italian-accented Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He read his speech at the airport with shaking hands while he
was buffeted by a slight breeze that graced the normally smoggy
city.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is in Mexico, the second biggest Catholic nation in the
world, to celebrate the closure of a special conference of bishops
from the Americas designed to address challenges to the Catholic
church in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Before he heads to St. Louis, Mo., for a 30-hour visit and
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, the pope is
expected to speak on those challenges, which include human rights,
economic policies and poverty, the loss of faith and other
traditional religious doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Stooped and moving slowly with a help of a cane, the pontiff was
welcomed to Mexico for the fourth time since 1979 by Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all the times you've visited us before, you are received
by a people that loves and admires you,'' Zedillo said. ``You
represent the eagerness for justice that should be in the heart of
all human beings and should be the daily task of all people and
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Mexico is a country ``that suffers a lack of
material goods'' but enjoys ``immense spiritual richness'' and is
proud of its Catholicism, freedom of religion and its mixed ethnic
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The president thanked the pope for choosing Mexico as the nation
to deliver ``a message of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope praised the ``rich sensibility'' of Mexico's Indian
people and recalled the Spanish missionaries who left their
cultural imprint on Mexico. He referred to Mexico's national
symbol, the dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe, as the ``little dark
one'' and said he would pray to her for ``the opening of a
fraternal and peaceful'' next century.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexicans waited for the pope's plane to touch down, thousands
of people flashed mirrors toward the sky, hoping that the Catholic
leader would see the reflections welcoming him.
</P>
<P>
   The devout lined the route the pontiff took to Mexico's historic
downtown plaza, where some of the first churches in the hemisphere
were erected by the Spanish and still stand. There the pope
received the keys to the city from Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and
later met with bishops from the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Cuevas Benitez, 26, a Mexico City street vender, blended
her faith with business as she sold hats along the route.

<P>
   ``I hope the pope's visit brings peace to Mexico,'' she said.
``There is much violence and insecurity. I hope this calms the

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ As top Olympic officials gather here to
cope with the still-growing Salt Lake City bidding scandal, a new
and potentially more perilous controversy surfaced Friday over
allegations of vote-buying in Sydney's campaign for the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian International Olympic Committee member on Friday
admitted to a Sydney newspaper that he offered $70,000 in
inducements to two African IOC members the night before Sydney won
the 2000 Games by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee,
told The Sydney Herald that he offered $35,000 each to the National
Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC
members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, one of the leaders of the Sydney bid, said he offered
the money in the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members
to vote for Sydney. ``I thought it was necessary for us to show our
commitment to those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,''
Coates said. ``My view was that it might encourage them to consider
their votes for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper(CQ), Australia's senior IOC member, acknowledged in
Lausanne that the offer could be seen as a bribe and bring demands
for Sydney to be stripped of the Games. ``I think that's possible
given the narrowness of the margin,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney won the Games in 1993 by narrowly defeating closest rival
Beijing by 45-43 on the final ballot the day after Coates made the
offer. Because the vote is taken in a secret ballot, it is
impossible to determine how the members actually voted.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, an IOC executive board member, said Coates's statements
``lead to the conclusion that he was trying to influence an outcome
even if he didn't put money into the pockets of IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sydney newspaper account, Coates denied the money was a
bribe and said it would go toward helping sport in Kenya and
Uganda. ``You have these developing countries which don't have
sponsors or fund-raising potential,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity to leverage the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the matter would be reviewed by the executive board
this weekend and probably would prompt an IOC investigation.
However, Gosper said he would ask the executive board to first
confirm that Sydney and Salt Lake City -- which is hosting the 2002
Winter Olympics -- would not be stripped of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would bring some stability at a very difficult time,'' he
said. ``Time has moved on, huge investments have been made, people
have certain expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no precedent for the IOC's taking the Games away from a
city once they have been awarded. Such a move could be legally
complicated because of a host of contracts not only between the
Sydney organizing committee and IOC, but between broadcasters and
sponsors of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, as Olympic officials were becoming aware of the
new allegations from Australia, a second IOC member resigned over
allegations related to the Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya delivered his resignation to
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch in person Friday, one day
before a special IOC commission is to conclude its inquiry into the
Salt Lake scandal. More resignations were expected, perhaps before
Saturday morning when the IOC executive board is scheduled to hear
accused IOC members make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gosper and other IOC members were meeting with
Samaranch in his private suite at the Lausanne Palace Hotel. There
was a sense of heightened gravity over the new allegations, which
come as the IOC was trying to get beyond the Salt Lake City crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Sydney's offer were contained in a package of
previously confidential Sydney bid documents released to Australian
news media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The files contained letters outlining the offers dated Sept. 23
, 1993, the date the IOC selected Sydney. The letter to Uganda's
Nyangweso said that ``if Sydney is successful'' the Australian
Olympic Committee would pay $5,000 a year to Uganda's National
Olympic Committee up to and including 2000 to help support the
Uganda National Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney newspaper said the two committees have been receiving
their $5,000 checks yearly as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also disclosed that Coates had written to Mukora
and Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their
way to Monaco for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Salt Lake City scandal, Attarabulsi, an IOC member since
1977, stepped down because of revelations that his son, Suhel,
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham
Young University and a community college, plus $700 a month for
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and
for us,'' Samaranch told the Associated Press Friday. ``He's a good
man. He did (make) a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her
ex-husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from Salt
Lake City and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Director General Francois Carrard told reporters that both
resignations were ``in the higher interest of the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to
Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old IOC president has called a special IOC assembly
here for March 17-18 to vote on expulsions and ratify new
site-selection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has
no intention of
</P>
<P>
   resigning.

 &HT;    Scientists put ailing oceans at top of public health worry list
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The massive amounts of poorly treated sewage,
farm wastes and other pollution dumped into the oceans each day are
coming back to haunt us.
</P>
<P>
   Shellfish poisoning cases are on the rise from coastal New
England to the Carolinas to the Gulf of Mexico. Leaking septic
tanks on the Florida coast are discharging viruses that cause
diarrhea, hepatitis and other infections. And nerve-damaging
pfiesteria bacteria are becoming increasingly common in the
estuaries of the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, reported Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, suggest the
declining health of the world's oceans has become a pressing public
health concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's alarming. In some cases, we're seeing new diseases that
are new to science,'' said University of Georgia marine biologist
James Porter, one of 3,000 researchers attending the meeting. ``Our
level of ignorance of what's happening to the oceans is quite
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rose, a University of South Florida marine specialist, said
disease-causing viruses have shown up on the west coast of Florida
a mile offshore, according to studies done there. The viruses come
from leaking septic tanks. In addition to threatening swimmers, the
microbes can infect shrimp and shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the recent El Nino, human viruses were found to be
transported for up to a mile into approved shellfish harvesting
waters,'' Rose said. ''Forty percent of all shrimp examined in the
study yielded human viruses from contaminated waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said communities along the coast and major lakes _
especially communities with large resort hotels and other
facilities that treat sewage in septic tanks _ likely will be
required within the next decade to install new technology to
prevent contamination. Such undertakings could be very expensive _
the estimated cost for the Florida Keys alone is $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Biologist Donald Anderson of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute said the United States also is experiencing a rapidly
escalating and ''very worrisome'' trend in the incidence of
problems from toxic algae in ocean waters, which some scientists
have linked to sewage and other contaminants. Those problems
include increases in:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paralytic shellfish poisoning in coastal New England and New
York, and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning along the coasts of the
Carolinas and the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ciguatera fish poisoning in virtually all of the sub-tropical
waters of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pfiesteria or pfiesteria-like organisms in the estuaries of
the Southeast and Chesapeake Bay. The organisms have been linked to
long-term nerve and brain disorders among fishermen and others
working in contaminated waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Formerly only a few regions were affected by these harmful
algae blooms,'' Anderson said. ''Now, virtually every coastal state
is threatened, and in many cases, over large geographic areas and
by more than one harmful or toxic algae.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter said dying coral reefs in the Florida Keys are another
warning sign. ''The coral reefs are like canaries in the mineshaft,
an indicator of what's happening to the ocean,'' he said. Reefs
that have persisted for hundreds of years are suddenly dying from
diseases ''we've never seen,'' the UGA expert said, noting the
number of diseased reef sites in the Florida Keys has risen from 94
in 1996 to 131 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new research findings highlighted the opening sessions of
the annual meeting of the AAAS, the world's largest federation of
scientists, researchers, science writers and educators from a
variety of disciplines.

 &HT;    `Funeral' marks end of service for USS Atlanta attack sub
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ USS Atlanta, the last of five American war
vessels to bear the city's name, began a final, bittersweet journey
Friday in a fog-shrouded ceremony that removed the nuclear-powered
attack submarine from service.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed two decades ago at the height of the Cold War, the
sleek, lethal sub is enduring the maritime equivalent of being put
out to pasture. Although it served only 17 years, half its life
expectancy, the $473 million vessel is the latest victim of the
U.S. military downsizing now that the Soviet threat has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta's crew returned recently from the vessel's ninth
deployment, a six-month assignment in the Mediterranean Sea.
Dressed in dark uniforms and white caps, the sailors stood
respectfully during the decommissioning ceremony attended by 90
Georgians who flew to Norfolk from Atlanta on a Navy cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony began with 19 cannon blasts, which made babies cry
and set the somber tone on Pier 11 of the Norfolk Naval Yard, home
of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like going to a funeral rather than a birth,''
said Don Giles, 53, president of the Atlanta Metropolitian Council
of the Navy League of the United States, which organized the
Georgia delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta History Center has requested several items from the
Atlanta. ``It is our hope that some of the artifacts from the
submarine will wind up in the Atlanta History collection,'' said
Myers Brown, associate curator of military history for the center.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items the center would like to have: a silver service
that had originally been purchased by the Atlanta Navy League, a
periscope, a bunk, uniforms and the alarm panel.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long ceremony Friday resembled a funeral. Seated under
a big white tent on the pier, people wearing their Sunday best
talked in muffled voices as the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Band played
``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen World War II veterans who served on diesel-powered subs
sat together, dressed in jackets of blue and gold. Big white
feathers sprouted from their hats, decorated by the dolphin
insignia of the U.S. Navy Submarine Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This military had better open up its eyes and see what is
happening,'' said Al Keck, 70, among several veterans who
complained that the Navy's decommissioning program threatens U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy chaplain urged the Lord to ``bless her crew in these
final moments of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The sub's commander, Maurice M. Montana, fought back tears when
he told the audience of several hundred about giving his three
young children a tour of the Atlanta. Its next voyage, scheduled
for Monday, will be a short one to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard,
where the year-long dismantling begins.
</P>
<P>
   A yellowish sun poked through the fog, casting a soft shine on
the sub's cold, black hull. An officer in white gloves escorted
Colleen Nunn, the wife of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, down the
gangway to the top of the narrow vessel where dignataries sat on a
platform draped in red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baby grew up, met her challenge and was a winner,'' the
Atlanta's original commander, Robin White, told Nunn, who was
cradling a bouquet of red roses. ``It is hard to realize that she
will no longer cruise the sea, a strong and frisky lady.''
</P>
<P>
   When ships are commissioned, the sailors run aboard in a
patriotic ceremony with a band playing ``Anchors Away.'' On Friday,
the tune accompanied the final act by the sub's crew, the removal
of the long, narrow commissioning pennant from atop the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn and her husband, then a junior senator, attended the Aug.
16, 1980, launch of the Atlanta. As the ship's sponsor, Colleen
Nunn was responsible then for cracking a bottle of champagne on the
sub's hull.
</P>
<P>
   It took her two swings, she recalled Friday, because she closed
her eyes the first time to avoid the spray of alcohol. The next
swat launched the vessel which, after a year and a half of
outfitting, began cat-and-mouse patrols with the Soviets in the
Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response to the Soviet threat is the USS Atlanta, shark
hunter par excellence,'' Navy Secretary Edward Hidalgo told the
launch-day crowd in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nunn had worried that the botched christening would
be a ``bad omen . . . We prayed that her awesome combat power would
never be used.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta was the first U.S. Atlantic Fleet sub to have the
capability to employ Tomahawk cruise missles.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the Atlanta's crew is reluctant to discuss what action
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few ``fanciful'' scenes, Hollywood thrillers ``The
Hunt for Red October'' and ``Crimson Tide'' depicted with
reasonable accuracy life aboard the cramped sub, Lt. Gregory Tolle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bit of nostalgia,'' said Tolle, who like other crew
members will be redeployed to other subs. ``When the Atlanta is
gone, we will not have the opportunity to come back and see how
things are going.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Senate impeachment trial is a sad and disreputable
sight. That is why most of us Americans simply cannot watch the
damned thing. It is why we flip the channel to basic cable, since
that seems to be the only way to avoid it. Let me watch Animal
Planet or the Travel Channel. Please.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's trial could have been made interesting and
relevant, but it isn't happening, as we are suffocating under the
avalanche of pontificating talking heads, each with its take on
events. A few heads would be fine, but television is becoming ``all
pundit all the time.'' We gasp for air.
</P>
<P>
   The American public is not so dumb, on the whole, that it cannot
grasp the moral and legal complexities. They are the complexities
we face daily in our real lives. We can come to a balancing of
conflicting views and sort out a workable compromise. If only we
were treated as adults.
</P>
<P>
   What would be interesting (begin ital) are (end ital) the fuzzy
edges:
</P>
<P>
   _It is true, as Republicans would have it, that the impeachment
is not just about sex. But, contrary to their complaints, it is not
merely about lying either.
</P>
<P>
   It is about lying about sex. You cannot shave off one part of
the equation without falsifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans seem to feel ambivalent about that. Yes, they want the
president to behave better; they are embarrassed by his tasteless
zipper-yanking. But they also know their own sex lives could not
stand the examining we give Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _It is also true, as Republicans would have it, that the
president is relying on legalese and hair-splitting when he makes
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Republicans are doing their own hair-splitting
and, as most of them are lawyers, they should know better than to
bad-mouth their own bread and butter. Hair-splitting is what law is
all about. If it weren't, we wouldn't need lawyers to negotiate the
law.
</P>
<P>
   _It is true, as Democrats would have it, that the alleged lying
would almost never be prosecuted in a civil case. It is also true,
as Republicans have it, that such cases have, indeed, been tried
and won.
</P>
<P>
   _There are those who have said that the Senate cannot censure
the president for his behavior, that censure is not in the
Constitution. Well, there's a lot that isn't in the Constitution,
and furthermore, one president has already been censured in the
past. Andrew Jackson suffered that.
</P>
<P>
   Time and time again, one side plays loose with the truth and the
other side counters with its own wobble and wiggle. Each side wants
to simplify the complex case, turning it into a slam dunk for its
interests. But then, the interesting ambiguities and complexities
are nudged out in favor of sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has an unattractive intolerance for the other's point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if the people who make the decisions in television
believe we can only be interested in it as a prizefight _ or more
accurately, professional wrestling, with clearly drawn rooting
interest: one side righteous, the other the very devil. Choose your
team colors.
</P>
<P>
   We are no longer citizens, but sports fans. In this corner, with
leather masks, the tag team of Bill Bennett and Pat Buchanan; in
the other corner, wearing capes, is Lanny Davis and Michael
Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   They will debate to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the death involved is the one we die of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, neither side is interested in the complexity of
truth; each side wants to score points and win big. That is the
nature of partisan politics; it is a constant struggle to achieve
and hold power for ``our side.''
</P>
<P>
   They are ingenuous who say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There is a core of Clinton haters on one side, and nothing he
does will please them. He could make every policy decision they
have advocated _ and come to think of it, he has _ and they'd only
complain that he has no principles.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a smaller core of Clinton supporters, who believe
the man can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after all, has oodles of personality. Republicans, who
basically have nothing but issues to run on, must envy him. One
supporter I know, when the scandal began, responded with a
heartfelt, ``Let my Elvis go!''
</P>
<P>
   But in the issue of impeachment and removal, most of us look for
some ray of light, and there is none, only constant droning of
partisan flacks.
</P>
<P>
   And for us, the whole process from beginning to end, has been
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   A pox on both your houses. &QL;

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE'S CHIEF WILL RETIRE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I. Michael Heyman, a legal scholar and university
administrator who has led the Smithsonian Institution since 1994
through a period of growth and arguments over academic freedom,
will retire, officials of the institution said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman's retirement as secretary of the Smithsonian, to be
announced formally at Monday's meeting of its board of regents,
opens one of the nation's most coveted cultural positions. A search
is likely to attract candidates from science, education and the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a chore that the regents are not often called up to
perform. Since the Smithsonian was founded in 1846 with a bequest
from James Smithson, a Briton who had never seen the United States,
Heyman, 68, was its 10th secretary. The Smithsonian is the world's
largest museum complex, with 16 museums and galleries, mostly in
Washington, and the National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman has had good relations with the board of regents, which
asked him to stay beyond the five years he said he had agreed to
serve as secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that he is scheduled to release Monday, he
states, ``After considerable thought, however, I have now informed
the regents that I will step down as secretary at the end of
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he looked forward to returning to California in
2000, when he will turn 70, ``and re-establishing my ties with the
University of California and the San Francisco Bay area.'' Heyman's
wife, Therese Thau Heyman, is on leave as senior curator at the
Oakland Museum in California.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman was traveling Friday and his staff said he was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   One Smithsonian museum director, Milo Beech, who leads two Asian
galleries, the Freer and the Sackler, praised Heyman for his manner
of making the institution a welcoming place. ``He has been
extraordinarily deft in terms of building up a public constituency
for the Smithsonian,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Beech said the matter that attracted the most notoriety during
Heyman's tenure, the dispute at the Smithsonian's Air and Space
Museum over an exhibition of the airplane that dropped the first
atomic bomb on Japan in 1945, was begun before Heyman became
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Many veterans groups and political leaders had complained that
the text for the exhibition of the airplane, the Enola Gay, was too
sympathetic to the Japanese. The pressure that these complaints
created led the Air and Space Museum to alter the text and forced
the director of the museum, Martin Harwit, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had a long-term effect when the Republicans took
control of the House of Representatives and Speaker Newt Gingrich
appointed one of Harwit's critics, Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, as a
regent.
</P>
<P>
   When another dispute over an exhibition came up, however, Heyman
supported his curators over Johnson's objections.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was a show on sweatshops at the National Museum
of American History. Johnson protested at a regents meeting that it
was faulty because it focused on the negative aspects of the
apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons Newt appointed me was to keep the
historical revisionism under control,'' Johnson said at the time.
In resisting Johnson's attempts to have the exhibition modified,
Heyman said, ``I have a great deal of respect for Sam Johnson, but
I disagree with him on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Between a Rock and a Hard Place: A Dialogue on
American Sweatshops, 1820 to Present,'' went on largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's budget this year is $570 million, of which
$407 was provided by Congress. Alan Fern, another director, said:
``government appropriations have not kept up with the rising costs
of salaries, repairs and programs. He has worked to remedy that and
has not been completely successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The regents will select Heyman's successor.
</P>
<P>
   In his academic life, Heyman was a professor of law and city and
regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley as
well as visiting professor of law at Yale and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He was named vice chancellor at Berkeley in 1974 and served as
chancellor from 1980 to 1990, when he resumed his joint
professorships there. He was counselor to Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt in 1993-94 when he became the Smithsonian's secretary. He
received his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and his law
degree from Yale Law School, and was the chief law clerk to U.S.
Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1958-59.
</P>
<P>
   Fern of the Smithsonian noted that Heyman's tenure was
groundbreaking: ``He was the first nonscientific secretary we've
ever had.''

 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the depth of an industrywide slump the best time to go on an
acquisition spree?
</P>
<P>
   Teardrop Golf thinks so. The club maker, which is known mainly
for its Teardrop putter, has been busily rolling up small golf
businesses while bigger competitors like Callaway Golf and Adams
Golf have been bleeding money.
</P>
<P>
   In its two years as a public company, Teardrop has acquired two
well-known but ailing manufacturers, Tommy Armour Golf and RAM
Golf, as well as a golf tour for aspiring PGA Tour players that now
bears the Teardrop name. And it is still on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   It lost out to Golfsmith International in the bidding for the
assets of Lynx Golf, a bankrupt Canadian company, when the price
topped $9 million. But in the process, Teardrop picked up Lynx's
endorsement contract with Fred Couples, the marquee player who is
now Teardrop's top spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Companies usually do not buy in slumps, in part because
acquisition binges are hard to finance in tough times. Teardrop
remains a small company, with estimated 1998 sales of $65 million.
Its market capitalization of $27 million isn't big enough to be on
the radar of major Wall Street analysts or institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Teardrop is expected to post a modest net income of $2.2 million
for 1998 after a loss in 1997, and its margins suffered lately as
it slashed prices on some models to clear away backlogged
inventory. As a result, Teardrop's ability to finance acquisitions
from its own resources is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is paying with common stock, the currency of choice in
technology deals, so easy for Teardrop. Its stock price is stuck in
a sand trap, closing on Friday at $5.25, far off its peak of
$14.0625 a share last May, and the market has been unkind to both
small-caps and golf stocks for months. Teardrop has included stock
in several deals but has yet to make an all-stock acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves borrowing, and Teardrop has loaded up on debt. At
the end of the third quarter of 1998, it carried $21.265 million of
debt on its balance sheet, equivalent to 34 percent of current
assets and more than 127 percent of shareholders' equity _ a level
of leverage that leaves Teardrop vulnerable if things do not go as
smoothly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the cash demands don't end when the ink is dry on an
acquisition. Teardrop is also spending heavily on advertising and
marketing to ``reinvigorate the companies and recreate the ambiance
that these companies are here to stay,'' said Rudy A. Slucker,
chief executive of Teardrop, which has corporate headquarters in
Morton Grove, Ill., and executive offices in Union, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Slucker says Teardrop's stock has been depressed by ``the
Callaway syndrome,'' referring to the problems of Callaway Golf,
the behemoth of the $2.5 billion golf industry. As industrywide
club sales slid 10 percent to 20 percent last year, Callaway
dismissed its chief executive, laid off 700 employees _ a quarter
of its work force _ and closed several noncore ventures. Investors
reacted by bidding down most golf stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Teardrop thinks it can sidestep Callaway's problems. In
1999, ``we'll either lose a little or make a little,'' Slucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the industry has a terrible year, we believe we'll
have a fair year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's debatable whether they will escape the inventory bubble
in the industry,'' said Shawn Milne, an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist in San Francisco. Milne expects golf club sales to grow about
5 percent in 1999 from a weak 1998 and sees a risk of swollen
inventory if an expected flood of new products does not entice
golfers to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Burnson, an analyst at ABN Amro, said that in a climate of
price-cutting, golfers who favor premium brands are unlikely to
switch to Teardrop's lines.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty retailers say the company's products are not flying
out the door. For instance, sales of Teardrop putters and Armour
clubs have been mediocre at the Edwin Watts Golf Shops chain, a
retailer based in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with 46 stores, mainly
in the the South, said Edwin Watts, a co-owner of the chain;
delivery delays for Armour clubs have not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Slucker is optimistic about the prospects for his
company, even in Asia, where Teardrop expects to begin selling this
year despite the region's economic troubles. The reason? The
roll-up strategy is beginning to bear fruit, by giving Teardrop a
range of brands that can pursue complementary market strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Slucker has repositioned RAM as a low-priced line
to sell in sporting goods chains, discounters and warehouse clubs,
where competition is less fierce than in specialty shops. ``They
can effectively address the mass market and the green-grass market
without cannibalizing themselves,'' said Gar Jackson, executive
vice president at Par Valu, a newsletter in Carlsbad, Calif., that
tracks golf stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a business littered with high-flying small companies
flattened by industry selloffs, even Slucker is hedging his bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there may be an opportunity in 1999 for a company
that's aggressive and smart and growing,'' he said. ``I'll put my
hat in the ring for that one. I'm not saying we can do it, but
we'll try.''

MEDICARE SAFETY-NET PROGRAMS UNDERENROLLED, STUDIES SAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ark., Ohio, Mass.) (bl) 
By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many of the poorest among the nation's 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries, those with incomes below $10,000 a year,
are going without aid from government safety-net programs that are
intended to help them pay their health-care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, most generous of the programs covers doctor and
hospital care that Medicare does not cover _ typically 20 percent
to 30 percent of the elderly's health-care expenses. Known as the
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program, it also exempts its
enrollees from paying Medicare's $45.50 monthly premium for
doctors' office visits, which is deducted from Social Security
checks. Two other programs exempt Medicare beneficiaries with
slightly higher incomes from paying the premium.
</P>
<P>
   But studies by Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, as well
as the Urban Institute and research philanthropies like the Kaiser
Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, estimate that 3 or 4
million people, about 40 percent of those who are eligible, have
never enrolled in the biggest safety-net program. Somewhat higher
proportions have not joined the other programs, the groups report.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, the gist of which the Clinton administration does
not dispute, attribute the low enrollments to conflicts between
federal and state agencies that share the cost and administration
of the aid to these factors: a dearth of program leadership and
coordination, labyrinthine red tape and demeaning application
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think we have a generous safety net for health
care,'' said Marilyn Moon, a health-policy economist at the Urban
Institute and a public trustee of the Medicare trust fund. In
reality, she said, the shortfall in enrollment ``is kind of a
secret that people don't want to talk about very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aid has been available for a decade, but until a
study last year by Families USA, little was known of the shortfall.
``We were all surprised by the low levels,'' of enrollment, said
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration, which manages the Medicare, the program for the
elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, the insurance program for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is concerned, Ms. DeParle said, ``and we have a campaign
this year to raise awareness of it.'' Congress, she noted, has
given the Social Security Administration a $6 million grant to test
ways of expanding the programs' coverage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the poor, the issue has become urgent, said William
executive director of the American Public Human Services
Association, formerly the American Public Welfare Association, with
Medicare looking for ways to cut costs. A bipartisan national
commission is grappling with overhauling Medicare to prevent
insolvency soon after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent proposals before the commission ask beneficiaries to
bear more of their medical costs, which would further strain the
poor. In such a case, Waldman said, more of the poor would do
without needed medical care or stand in line for charity care.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Congress has enacted four health-insurance safety nets
for Medicare recipients, with all of them based on the federal
poverty guideline. The programs limit enrollees' assets, excluding
a home, a car, some life insurance and a burial plot, to less than
$4,000 for individuals and $6,000 for couples. Applicants must
apply for the coverage to state agencies that supervise welfare
services.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the programs, enacted 11 years ago, is called the
Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program. It is open to individual
recipients with incomes of less than $8,292 a year and couples with
less than $11,100 in income.
</P>
<P>
   People who qualify are exempted from paying Medicare's monthly
premium, the 20 percent share of the charges for doctors' office
visits and the initial $768 in charges for hospitalization that
Medicare requires of other recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals earning up to $9,900 annually and couples with
incomes up to $13,260, figures that are 20 percent above the
poverty guideline, can enroll in the Specified Low-Income Medicare
Beneficiaries program. This program picks up Medicare $45.50
monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs require that the states pay 23 percent to 50
percent of their costs, which are calculated on formulas based on
the strength of the states' economies. The same formulas are used
to prescribe the states' share of the cost of Medicaid, with the
rest paid for by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Two newer programs, created by the Balanced Budget Agreement of
1997, both of which terminate in 2002, are paid entirely by the
federal government. But unlike the other programs, Congress limited
the financing, so that if demand for them was high, late applicants
would be turned away. The maximum spending is $1.5 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   One, called Qualifying Individuals-1, raises the threshold for
exemption from the Medicare premium to 135 percent of the poverty
line, or $11,112 for an individual and $14,892 for couples and
could aid about 500,000 Medicare recipients. Although enrollment
began a year ago, Ms. Moon said only 16,000 people had signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The second program, Qualifying Individuals-2, subsidizes the
Medicare premium of individual beneficiaries with incomes up to 175
percent of poverty, or $14,328. This plan was the fruit of
political horse trading, and advocates of the poor point out that
it is laughably stingy. Last year it offered enrollees a $1.07
reduction in their $45.50 monthly premium, rising to $2.23 this
year. Enrollment is close to nil.
</P>
<P>
   The first two programs are stirring the most controversy because
of their requirement that the states share the cost of Medicare
benefits, previously covered entirely by the federal government,
while at the same time giving them little flexibility in managing
the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states have no control,'' said Bruce Bullen,
Massachusetts' commissioner for medical services and chairman of
the National Association of State Medicaid Directors. ``They must
follow these Medicare, cookie-cutter approaches to providing
services to seniors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result, said Ms. DeParle of the federal financing
agency, ``the states, shall we say, have been less aggressive in
going out and enrolling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldman of the human services association said, ``There's a
little bit of distrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Struck by the reports of the shortfall in the programs'
enrollments, many states say they are redoubling their efforts to
find low-income people eligible for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair to allege that Ohio has done anything to
hide from these folks,'' said Barbara Coulter Edwards, Ohio's
Medicaid director. But she said, ``We are asking, `Are there some
things we could do to encourage a higher rate of participation?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hanley, Arkansas' director of medical services, said the
state had enrolled 17,875 beneficiaries in the programs, 40 percent
to 45 percent of the eligible. ``We've done what we could
reasonably do,'' he said. For the programs to reach more people,
Hanley said Congress must help with more money and better
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is no federally organized method for seeking
out Medicare recipients who would be eligible for the two main
programs. New retirees, however, can learn of the programs when
they apply at the local Social Security office for their Medicare
card, although critics say the programs are not actively promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But to enroll in the programs, Medicare recipients are directed
to their local state welfare office, where they must fill out
applications listing their incomes and assets and submit supporting
documents. Many eligible Medicare beneficiaries refuse to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real stigma attached'' to visiting welfare offices,
said Tricia Smith, chief federal lobbyist for the American
Association of Retired Persons. ``No one has clear responsibility
for outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Families USA executive director Ronald Pollack explained part of
the shortfall this way: ``Social Security says, `We don't run these
programs. They're run by'' the Health Care Financing
Administration. ``HCFA says, `We have oversight, but they're
administered by the states.'''
</P>
<P>
   To streamline the process and get around the welfare stigma,
Denise Cross, Missouri's director of family services, said her
state, like some others, is encouraging application by mail and
phone.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress has granted the Social Security Administration $6
million to test new approaches, like assigning state welfare aides
to Social Security offices to take and screen program applications.
</P>
<P>
   But given the magnitude of the shortfall, critics call that
tokenism. ``I think it would take a substantial effort to get more
people signed up,'' Ms. Moon of the Urban Institute said. ``I doubt
that $6 million is going to do it.''

BORDER COUNTIES SEEK MORE FEDERAL AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A coalition of 24 counties along the
U.S.-Mexican border on Friday decried the lack of federal money for
everything from jail cells to clean water, and leaders hope their
message will be heard in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we haven't screamed loud enough,'' said Ronald Morriss,
a supervisor from Santa Cruz County, Ariz. ``We're talking some
serious money and some serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Filthy air, stinking water and the impact of illegal immigration
on health care, county jails and courts topped concerns here during
a two-day gathering of the U.S.-Mexico Border Counties Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to get the attention of members of Congress so they
will approve more funds for an area stretching from the Gulf of
Mexico to the Pacific Ocean that has historically been neglected,
said the chairman of the coalition, Carlos Aguilar III.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking of the 6-month-old coalition is that by bringing
together four states, 24 counties and 13 congressional districts,
the region's problems have a shot at being solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a disproportionate share of those problems because
we're on the border,'' said Aguilar, who is a county commissioner
in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His message to Washington lawmakers: ``You need to start
addressing the fastest-growing region in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's plan is to re-energize the House Border Caucus
and establish a similar group in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the coalition seeks better counting in the 2000 census,
saying the region is underfunded because population figures come up
short of the number of people living along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Other tools include improving a dialogue with counterparts in
Mexico and publishing an annual report documenting how the border
influences the economy and health care, roads and other
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials pointed to former Texas Comptroller John Sharp's
report in July that showed that if the Texas border region were the
nation's 51st state, it would be the poorest and least-educated,
have the highest rate of unemployment and have serious problems
with education and medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 12 million people live along both sides of the
border, 6.2 million of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented immigrants need care in hospitals, and people
arrested by federal agents often cost counties a hefty price for
detention and prosecution, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that border communities are unfairly penalized for
environmental problems arising from sharing air and water supplies
with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio Martinez, the judge of Webb County, Texas, applauded
the push for unified front to get Washington's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes good sense for elected officials from border counties
to come together and focus on common issues, problems and work out
solutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, a Republican whose Texas district includes
border communities, commended the coalition for trying to unify the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they need more? Absolutely. They need tons more,'' Bonilla
said. ``I commend them for trying to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which concludes Saturday, was slated to cover
issues such as water quality, telecommunications and the challenges
of tracking financial costs of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico and
a former county commissioner, has said border communities deserve
more federal funds to offset the impact of record number of drug
and immigration arrests made by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Border Patrol agents continue to steer narcotics and
immigrant smugglers from more heavily populated areas, smaller,
rural counties will continue to feel pressure, Kelly said.

`COP DOCS' HELP OFFICERS COPE WITH JOB STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In these trying days of police work, San
Francisco officers have people to help them cope with a range of
emotions _ anger, fear, frustration and sadness _ they may
encounter on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The call themselves cop docs. More formally they are the
Behavioral Science unit of the city police.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with doctorates in psychology, Lt. Alan Benner and Sgt.
Forrest Fulton guide a peer program of 200 fellow police personnel
and 20 therapists to help officers get back on an even emotional
keel, especially after handling shootings and loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of the city's top officers died in a car crash on
his way home. Investigators suspect he fell asleep at the wheel
after a long day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be doing a lot of work on that one,'' Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   Using phrases like ``healing process'' and ``peer support,''
Fulton and Benner say with their program, they have come up with a
model for helping officers cope with one of society's most
stressful jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Studies point to how dangerous and stressful police work can be:
</P>
<P>
   _ While serious crime declined 7 percent nationwide in 1997, the
number of police officers killed on duty rose 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two academic studies in the Southwest over the last decade
suggested that 40 percent of police officers had used violence
against a spouse or child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other studies show the suicide rate three to four times higher
among police officers than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Add all that to an increasingly dangerous and sophisticated
world of police work and involved paperwork and there is the
potential for a host of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the stress in police work, Fulton said, stems from what
he calls the F-word _ ``feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The police are so often required to be in control, in charge and
self-sufficient that asking for help ``is a deficit,'' said Fulton,
a 26-year-veteran of the police department. Historically, officers
have tried to rise above the pressure, but what frequently resulted
was police officers who were marginalized in their careers or dead
at an early age from alcoholism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to repress fear, anger and anxiety. You can't show
it visibly in front of people. You do it for so long you lose
connection (to feelings), but it's pay now or pay later. You're
going to regain those feelings,'' Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
   The peer support program, which took 15 years to perfect and is
now a role model for other cities, formally began four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If it all sounds warm and fuzzy, Fulton said, the help provided
by the program is incredibly important. If you are a cop, he said,
``this is the stuff your life depends on.''

SEN. BYRD ADDS TO MOMENTUM FOR ENDING SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The momentum for bringing President Bill Clinton's
impeachment trial to a speedy conclusion gained steam Friday when
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, a senior Democrat, called for a vote to
dismiss the charges and end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the leading parliamentary expert in the Senate who has
served in the chamber for 40 years, said he would move to dismiss
the case early next week _ not because he believes the president
did no wrong but because there aren't enough votes to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lengthening this trial will only prolong and deepen the
divisive, bitter, and polarizing effect that this sorry affair has
visited upon our nation,'' Byrd said, adding that he doesn't
believe witnesses will add ``anything of consequence to this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop,'' the West
Virginia Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' 55-45 majority falls 12 votes shy of the 67
votes needed to convict Clinton and many Republicans conceded they
don't have the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, reflecting the view of some
Republicans that the trial should continue, said: ``To suggest that
because there may not be a two-thirds vote at the end of the
process is not a justification for short-circuiting the
constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., agreed. ``I'm not one who wants
to get it over with sooner rather than later,'' said Inhofe.
``Cutting it short by a month or day really doesn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's words captured attention on Capitol Hill because of his
stature and because he has been a leading Democratic critic of the
president, sternly rebuking him for his conduct in his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who led the House prosecution team, urged the Senate to
defeat Byrd's motion to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, do I know what a great annoyance we are in the bosom of
this body,'' Hyde said. ``I think dismissing the articles of
impeachment before the trial is over is sending the wrong message
to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., described Byrd's motion as ``a highly
significant move'' because it shows ``momentum toward a prompt
resolution... I believe there are some Republicans who are leaning
to dismiss or vote `no' on the articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, many senators negotiated behind the scenes looking for
ways to end a trial that has been widely unpopular in public
opinion polls at a time when the president's popularity has
continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested holding
another bipartisan meeting in the Old Senate Chamber as a
brainstorming session.
</P>
<P>
   There also appeared to be a slow trickle of Republicans who are
turning away from the idea of calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he ``would have to be
persuaded that there should be witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more apt to cast a vote, yes, the deposition should be
held, than I am to cast a vote the witnesses should be called. But
we'll wait and see,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, the vast majority of whom have argued against calling
witnesses and shortening the trial, appeared jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, this is already coming to a rapid
conclusion,'' said Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. ``Most people feel
that prolonging it serves nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it's ``quite obvious there are not
67 votes for conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some that are putting forth a brave face,
but I think it's obvious this is going nowhere'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the votes are not there to convict it is unclear
whether a motion to dismiss would prevail. Six Republicans would
have to join all of the Democrats in order to stop the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, predicted that Byrd's motion will
fail. The Senate Judiciary Chairman said he favors at least
allowing witnesses to testify in private. He also said may offer a
plan that will allow the Senate to avoid a vote on the articles of
impeachment if its clear the 67 votes to convict are not there. The
Senate could vote to recognize the House vote to impeach as the
highest form of censure against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde wrote Senate leaders Friday saying the House prosecutors
would like to take part in questioning Clinton in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the president is the only individual with knowledge of
almost every material fact relevant to the trial, the House
believes that his testimony could greatly help to expeditiously and
fairly bring this matter to a close,'' Hyde wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, senators questioned the White House lawyers and the
House prosecutors about the case against Clinton. But the dozens of
questions did little to resolve the conflicts between the
prosecutors and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were submitted in writing to Chief Justice William
Rehnquist who then read them aloud.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff maintained that even if the
Senate believes Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of
justice, it is not enough to remove him from office. However, Ruff
admitted similar charges lodged against a judge could warrant
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ask the same questions about the trauma a nation
suffers when you are removing a judge and you are removing a
president,'' Ruff said. ``The answer must be `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that presidential wrongdoing must be ``so violative of
his public responsibilities that our system cannot abide his
continuing in office'' to meet the constitutional standard for
removal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., countered that Clinton engaged in
``a conscious and deliberate and settled choice to violate the laws
of the land'' in conflict with his presidential duty to ensure that
the nation's ``laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady and other House managers renewed their call for witnesses
in response to questions from senators about the need to hear from
key players such as Monica Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty
Currie and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House definitely holds to its position that we should call
witnesses,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the House ``violated'' its constitutional duty by not
calling witnesses when the issue was before its chamber and
irresponsibly punted the witness issue to the Senate. Clinton's
private attorney, David Kendall, warned that it could take ``many
months'' to prepare to take written testimony from witnesses and
possibly have them appear on the Senate floor.

JUSTICES TO LOOK AT LOUISIANA VOTING RIGHTS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide
whether a school board violated the Voting Rights Act when it
intentionally left in place a federally approved election program
that discriminates against black voters after rejecting a
non-discriminatory alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which successfully pressed the court
to hear the case, argued that the Louisiana board ran afoul of the
law by deliberately retaining a system of voting districts that
keeps minorities in a disproportionately weak political position.
The Bossier Parish School Board, which had urged the justices to
let a lower court decision stand, countered that the intention of
board members is relevant under the Voting Rights Act only if they
change an approved election system and the alteration decreases the
voting strength of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in Reno vs.
Bossier Parish School Board by July.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Voting Rights Act, school boards found to have
discriminated against minorities must get the approval of the
Justice Department or a federal court before changing their voting
districts. The justices have yet to decide whether a board violates
the law when it intentionally refuses to change an approved system
of districts despite evidence that the minority vote has become
diluted due to population change and that non-discriminatory
districts can be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to consider the administration's appeal
marks the second time the justices have considered the legality of
the Louisiana board's 1992 decision to leave in place a voting
system the federal government had already deemed _ or
``precleared'' _ as valid under the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   In their first decision, the justices in 1997 ruled any change
in an election system is OK with the Voting Rights Act if the
alteration leaves minorities no worse off than they were under the
old, approved system. But the justices at the time left unanswered
whether the law is violated if board members had a discriminatory
intent in leaving the old system unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the school board in northwestern Louisiana retained the
school district's 12 majority-white voting areas. Board members
opted for the status quo despite the objection of the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which argued that at least two of the jurisdictions could easily be
redrawn to be majority-minority.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court in Washington
rejected the NAACP's challenge, ruling that the decision to retain
the 12 districts was valid under the Voting Rights Act. The law
prohibits school boards from making ``retrogressive'' changes,
which weaken minorities' voting strength, the judicial panel said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Voting Rights Act does not bar a school board, even if
its intent was to discriminate, from leaving a precleared election
system in place, the court ruled. The Clinton administration, which
supported the NAACP, appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

CANADA OFFERS PROPOSAL ON IRAQ  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council, divided by radically
differing Russian and American proposals for dealing with Iraq,
began discussion Friday of a ``third way'' proposed by Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians are hoping to fill the void between what are
basically hardened Russian and American policy stands with new
information on which to base future talks on new programs for
monitoring Iraqi weapons and insuring adequate supplies of
necessary goods to the Iraqi civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that after weeks of stalemate and posturing by
various council members, the Canadians want to get a real
discussion started. Canada became a council member in January for a
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which wants to lift the oil embargo imposed on Iraq in
1990 and abolish the current arms inspection system, has reacted
coolly to the Canadian plan, saying it does not give a prominent
role to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which is prepared to allow Iraq to sell more
oil to buy civilian goods without limits but wants to keep arms
inspections in place, is listening to Canada's ideas with interest,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   France has also made a proposal to the council, recommending the
end to the oil embargo but controls over Iraqi spending once oil
sales resume and continued arms monitoring. Iraq basically wants no
restrictions of any kind, saying it has already disarmed completely
and is not a threat to its neighbors, an assertion independent arms
control experts do not believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians say the Russian and French proposals leave open
important questions about how an arms embargo would be enforced if
sanctions were lifted, and how monitoring can be restored to Iraq,
which now wants no part of arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, with the support of Brazil, this month's council
president, is calling for comprehensive assessments on the status
of Iraqi disarmament and on the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
These assessments would then be the basis for a council debate
about what was needed next, and what would be acceptable to Iraq's
supporters here as well as to President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The arms report would be compiled by experts from the U.N.
Special Commission, known as Unscom, and the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Both have been out of Iraq since the American and
British air strikes in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians are suggesting that Jayantha Dhanapala, under
secretary-general for disarmament affairs, preside over the expert
meetings on disarmament, a proposal that would sideline Richard
Butler, the executive chairman of the Special Commission, whom the
Russians essentially do not want to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Canadian plan, Sergio Vieira de Mello, under
secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, would chair a group of
experts on the civilian programs and the working of the Iraqi
sanctions committee.

PALESTINIANS TO GET COUNTRY CODE FOR PHONE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a step toward virtual statehood, Palestinians are
about to be granted a form of long-distance independence: their own
country code for international telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Over Israeli objections, the International Telecommunications
Union quietly announced this month that area code 970 had been
reserved for the Palestinian National Authority territory in the
West Bank and Gaza. The union, a U.N. affiliate in Geneva, agreed
in principle to give the Palestinians a code at its membership
meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as a very important decision for us,'' Imad
Falouji, telecommunications minister for the Palestinian Authority,
said when he received word of the decision this week. ``It meant
that all of these countries are supporting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the agency formally assigns the code and it is put into
use, the Palestinians have to meet additional legal and technical
requirements. Those include installing new switching systems and
rerouting local telephone numbers. Falouji said that could be done
in two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us an independent gateway to all the countries
of the world,'' said Hatem Halawani, president of Palestine
Telecommunications Co., the Palestine Authority's telephone
monopoly. ``This is going to make communications much better and
easier for the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Over five years the authority has gradually acquired some of the
trappings of sovereignty: a flag, overseas embassies, a widely
accepted passport and a gleaming new international airport.
</P>
<P>
   But an international dialing code is perhaps an even more potent
modern symbol of self-determination. The code will tacitly bestow
global recognition on the self-governed territories, or so Israel
fears. Israel unsuccessfully argued that country codes should be
reserved for U.N. member states.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians countered that two nonmembers, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, had codes, as do several multinational telecommunications
companies like Iridium and Global Star.
</P>
<P>
   The 130,000 telephone lines registered in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip are called from abroad be means of the Israeli 972 area code,
a system that the Palestinians have found objectionable on
philosophical and practical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is symbolic, but not only symbolic,'' Halawani said. ``When
you have a direct connection without an intermediary, it is a big
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   By agreement with Israel, Palestinian Telecommunications
receives the revenue from international calls that originate in
areas under Palestinian control but routes the calls through a
contract with Golden Lines, one of three private long-distance
companies in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Having its own code and switching equipment would open the way
to revenue-sharing deals and technological partnerships with other
countries and international telecommunications companies, industry
analysts said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The International Telecommunications Union governs the global
allocation and regulation of area codes, broadcast frequencies,
Internet bandwidths and satellite signals. It voted to give what it
called Palestine its own country code, as well as its own radio
call signs and broadcast-frequency assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation formally objected, contending that the
move violated the Oslo peace pact of 1995, which calls for the
Palestinians and Israel to negotiate changes in telephone codes and
broadcast frequencies, and the Wye River Memorandum of last year,
which bans unspecified ``unilateral actions'' that affect the
``status'' of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis called the Palestinian request for a country code
``strictly politically motivated, as it lacks any genuine technical
or otherwise objective justification.'' But the Palestinians
prevailed, contending that four years of intermittent talks with
Israel had not led to substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the International Telecommunications Union
cautioned that the Palestinians had ``some work to do'' before the
new code starts. ``They need a switch and a numbering plan, and at
the moment they don't have either,'' said Francine Lambert, chief
spokesman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said the remaining obstacles were financial and
technical, not political. Arab countries have agreed to direct
calls from their state telephone companies to the new code, Falouji
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, however, continue to contend that a country code
can be introduced only with their assent, as part of the broader
peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have to go through us,'' said Izzy Tapoohi,
chairman of the board of Bezeq, the state-owned telephone company
here. ``I assume that they are a law-abiding authority and they
will do what the Oslo accords say.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Bezeq's technical cooperation, the changeover could be
difficult. Palestinian telephone lines still function as Israeli
local numbers, with the 972 code for incoming international calls
followed by two-digit local codes, whether for Gaza or Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   From Israeli-governed Jerusalem, dialing to Ramallah or
Bethlehem in the West Bank is still a local call. Yet Bezeq, like
its Palestinian counterpart, appears intent on disentangling the
interconnection, if only to avoid a costly duplication of services.

MARKET INSIGHT: HOW STOCKS COULD WORK FOR SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 24) 
(bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fun to talk about what to do with 15 years' worth of
projected surpluses in the federal budget, particularly when the
number in question is a tidy $4.4 trillion. That is what President
Clinton was doing last week when he lobbed his Social Security
proposals in front of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a discussion is much more enjoyable than contemplating how
much smaller those numbers might be if _ Heaven forbid _ the
economy fell into recession between now and 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any number of important people inside the Beltway were
far from amused at Clinton's suggestion that part of the surplus he
wants to target for Social Security _ a sum of about $700 billion _
be invested in stocks and corporate bonds instead of Treasury
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and chairman of a panel of the nonpartisan National
Academy of Social Insurance that issued a report on the issue last
month, shared his thoughts on the topic last week via telephone
from Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the president's proposal something you can support?
</P>
<P>
   A. At the moment there are two fairly radical proposals about
Social Security: One would create individual accounts as a
substitute for defined benefits, and the other is to have the
Social Security trust fund invest part of its money in stocks and
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund proposal, which the president put forward, is the
less radical idea of the two. I favor it, and I thought the
president put it in absolutely the right context. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But don't people like Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan have a
point when they say decisions about where to invest the money would
fall prey to political pressure? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The issue here is the design of an institution to do the
investing.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is at the head of an institution that has a lot of
independence to handle monetary policy. Fed governors are appointed
to 14-year terms, but if the president or Congress don't like their
policies, they can't remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could wipe out the Fed and change the rules. But to do
that would obviously be a massive political step.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we can create a separate institution with the same
features as the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan raises the fear that investment decisions and share
voting would be controlled in detail by the House and the Senate.
That, it seems to me, is not a likely outcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aside from creating an independent institution, what else
would you do to try and depoliticize the investing process? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would add two other features. First, restrict stock
investments to broad index funds, ones that cover a wide swath of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the actual investments themselves would be done by
private managers, who would commingle funds for Social Security
with those from private investors.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little point in considering anything but index
funds, which are going to do about as well as other funds and make
more sense from an economic point of view. And if you move away
from them, politics starts to enter into the equation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are all sorts of index funds. What kinds would you
favor? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think one should consider an index fund any narrower
than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. One could actually mix a little
bit, from the S.&AMP; P. out to the Russell 3000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are you indisposed to the idea of individual accounts? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are four reasons why I think using individual accounts
as a substitute for Social Security is a nonstarter.
</P>
<P>
   First, high administrative costs, which eat into returns. Risk
is Point No. 2. With a defined benefit program, ups and downs get
smoothed out. For individuals, market moves are much more
pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The third point, one that has been raised by people like Arthur
Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is that
a system of individual accounts would require a massive education
effort, which is expensive. And the potential for fraud in that
sort of a system is massive. Point 4 is that over time people are
going to be living longer. Individual accounts cut benefits. When
you hit the retirement age, you look at what you can tap. The
longer you live, the less you get out of any fixed sum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have been studying the issues surrounding Social Security
for a quarter of a century. Have other countries decided to invest
public retirement money in stocks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Canada has started to implement a diversified portfolio,
which I think is a good idea. The Norwegians invest some of their
oil revenues abroad through the central bank. But most European
countries have much worse problems with their systems than we do.
They are not running budget surpluses, so they are not raising the
issue.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Western powers warned the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, on Friday that simply allowing the
head of the international monitoring mission to remain in Kosovo is
not enough to avoid the threat of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The six-nation Contact Group on the former Yugoslavia met in
London Friday and urged a new effort at a political solution for
this southern Serbian province where violence between Serbian
forces and the ethnic Albanian majority continues in violation of a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final solution will have to be political, but in order to
achieve it, a military threat may be needed,'' the NATO
secretary-general, Javier Solana, said. The cease-fire reached in
October did not provide for the political status of the ethnic
Albanians of Kosovo, who are seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, underlined the
threat of force by urging Milosevic to ``comply and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has ``made a half-compromise'' by freezing a
deportation order and allowing William Walker, head of the
international monitoring group in Kosovo, to remain in the country,
Clark said. ``But he is still defying the will of the international
community on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, he said, Milosevic's forces ``are still
deploying in the field in violation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 1199 and the commitments he made to NATO, and so the
crisis continues.''
</P>
<P>
   On a cold and foggy day in Kosovo, low-level clashes continued
to keep tensions high. Serbian officials said five Serbs between
the ages of 60 and 70 had been kidnapped during the night from a
village called Nevoljane, near Vucitrn, by masked men wearing the
insignia of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla force known as the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the rebel group denied they were responsible,
calling the event a provocation by the Serbs. Walker, at a news
conference here Friday with Knut Vollebaek, chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that if
the rebels were behind the action ``we would be very critical of
them.'' The organization runs the program of unarmed monitors
directed by Walker, the American delegate to the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces continued Friday to move against suspected
concentrations of guerrillas. Officials of the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees said that some 5,500 ethnic Albanians
have fled Serbian offensives near the villages of Shipolje,
Vaganica and Prica in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek, supported by Washington, Moscow and NATO's threat of
force, succeeded in winning an indefinite freeze on Walker's
deportation. His expulsion was ordered after Serbian officials said
they were outraged by his immediate and explicit condemnation of
Serbian forces in the killing Jan. 15 of 45 ethnic Albanians in the
village of Racak, the event that has prompted the current
confrontation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Walker repeated that he stands by his words, although
he noted that there were circumstances he was unaware of at the
time. He said: ``I'll continue to call them as I see them,''
adding: ``It took me last night and this morning to come to terms
with the fact that I am now a frozen persona non grata.''
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats said the Walker issue was a smokescreen
for the real problem, the Serbian refusal to comply with the
October agreement. The Serbs, saying they were responding to
provocations by the rebels, have moved in more specialized police
and deployed army units and tanks in excess of the limits agreed
upon in October.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The diplomats said the Racak killings crossed a moral threshold
that the West could not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker was a way for Milosevic to get the spotlight off Racak,
so he could muddy that issue,'' one diplomat here said. Milosevic
continues to deny that Serbs had any role in the Racak killings and
maintains that the guerrillas gathered the bodies, changed their
clothes to make them look like civilians and mutilated them.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek, speaking Friday, implied that Milosevic was moving to
comply with another Western demand: to allow the chief prosecutor
of the international war crimes tribunal, Louise Arbour, to
investigate the killings here after she was turned away from the
Serbian border on Monday. He did not elaborate on the development.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, Vollebaek said that if Walker had been expelled,
the entire monitoring force _ currently about 750 people and
scheduled to grow to 2,000 _ would have been removed from Kosovo,
followed by other international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Without the monitors to restrain the combatants, he said, ``the
humanitarian catastrophe would be even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's efforts to negotiate a political deal for enhanced
autonomy for the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, who represent more
than 90 percent of the province's population, have been very
difficult. Not only is Milosevic unwilling to restore significant
autonomy to Kosovo after having revoked it in 1989, but the ethnic
Albanians themselves have so far found it impossible to unify
around a common negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   The West recognizes Yugoslavia's sovereignty over Kosovo and
rejects the widely held ethnic Albanian desire for independence. In
essence, the West's main complaint with Milosevic is the way his
forces behave in Kosovo.

INVESTING WITH PHILLIP N. DAVIDSON: AMERICAN CENTURY VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Ark.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of American Century Value is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is a nice mid-cap value fund like this doing in an
aggressive growth family like American Century?
</P>
<P>
   American Century Value, managed by Phillip N. Davidson since its
inception, was started in 1993 in an effort to ``round out'' the
family of funds of the Kansas City, Mo., company, he said. ``They
had been incredibly successful, and just wanted to diversify their
offerings to their shareholders and in the 401(k) market,''
Davidson added.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his mandate, Davidson has followed a strict value
discipline that is sharply divergent from the more aggressive style
of American Century's better-known growth funds. Unfortunately, the
bull market has been far more generous to large-capitalization
growth stocks than to the mid-cap value category.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American Century Value returned just 5.0 percent,
compared with 26.67 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of
large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davidson can take consolation in average three-year
annualized returns of 24.8 percent through Jan. 15, well above the
median 22.9 percent for the mid-cap value category. And he thinks
that funds like his will soon bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, 43, his co-manager, R. Todd Vingers, and his three
senior analysts use computer screening to look at all American
stocks with market capitalizations above $1 billion. The screens
rank stock prices in relation to earnings, book value, dividend
yield, cash flow and debt-adjusted cash flow. (``The more debt a
company has, the more operating cash flow it has to have to be as
attractive,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for consideration by the fund, he said, a company
must be in the cheapest one-third of the market on at least two of
the five screens. Generally, 250 or 300 stocks qualify, and most
are in the mid-cap category, which he defines as a market value of
$1 billion to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you go through and start doing individual company
analysis,'' Davidson said. He looks for companies that are leaders
in their industries but that are temporarily out of favor because
of, say, a temporary dip in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with total assets of $2.17 billion, usually holds 65
to 70 stocks, about 60 percent of them mid-caps. Generally, once a
stock's price rises to the point that it no longer meets two of the
five value criteria, Davidson sells.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is J.C. Penney. Davidson bought the stock in the
spring of 1997 at about $45, then sold it last year as the price
approached $70. Penney climbed close to $80 last June before it
started dropping, the victim of weak sales.
</P>
<P>
   Penney ``didn't fall back into our own valuation screens until
the low $50s'' in the third quarter, Davidson said, when the fund
started buying it again. The shares closed Friday at $39.875. ``The
primary play here is that they have the traditional department
store _ it's basically no growth, but a nice cash cow _ and then
they got the Eckerd drugstores acquisition'' in 1997, which should
bolster company earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all stocks in Davidson's fund turn over as quickly as
Penney. Take the Mercantile Bancorp., which it has owned since 1994
and is now the fund's biggest holding, at 4.9 percent of the
portfolio. Mercantile is the dominant bank in the St. Louis market
and No. 2 in Kansas City. It has built up its market share with
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   When Davidson started buying the stock in 1994, at $20 a share,
``it was a cheap stock with a good retail deposit base,'' he said.
``And basically, what happened is all that stuff just got better
when they made these acquisitions.'' But the acquisitions slowed
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   As Mercantile's shares slid below $40 last summer, pulling down
American Century Value's returns, Davidson bought more. The stock
closed Friday at $44.8125, still down from a high near $60 early
last year. The acquisition will ultimately benefit the bank, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company whose acquisition shows promise, Davidson said,
is Tyson Foods, the poultry company based in Springdale, Ark. Since
completing the purchase of the rival Hudson Foods last January,
Tyson controls about 30 percent of the domestic chicken market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson stock rose with the acquisition, then came down as
weakness in foreign economies undermined exports and higher grain
prices pushed up costs. Davidson said he started buying the stock
early in 1998 at $18 and $19 a share. The price fluctuated during
the year, and he increased his position during the summer's general
selloff. Tyson closed Friday at $20.50. Davidson expects it to rise
considerably more than the stock market this year.

SALINAS CONVICTION SEEN AS BLOW AGAINST CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ There was no smoking gun, no confession and no
direct link between Raul Salinas de Gotari and the 1994 murder of
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law and a top
political official.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the federal judge who on Thursday issued the verdict in this
country's ``trial of the century'' _ what became Mexico's version
of the O.J. Simpson trial _ said there was enough circumstantial
evidence to convict the brother of former President Carlos de
Gotari of ordering the assasination.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, while millions of Mexicans celebrated the arrival of
Pope John Paul II on a five-day visit, others were busy assessing
the political bomb that had fallen when, for the first time in this
country's corruption-riddled history, a judge sentenced a
president's relative to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a parting of the waters in Mexico,'' Arnoldo Kraus, a
columnist for La Jornada, a left-leaning Mexico City daily, said.
``For years, this country has suffered a crisis in credibility in
politics and business. This isn't a complete antidote, but it helps
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, federal judge Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, who
ordered Salinas to serve the maximum 50-year sentence, conceded
that government prosecutors and investigators had made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest errors, the judge said, was their failure to
produce solid evidence and their inability to establish a clear
motive for Salinas's actions in authorizing Ruiz's murder.
</P>
<P>
   That has left relatives and attorneys for Salinas, who maintains
his innocence, arguing that the decision may have been based more
on political rather than legal considerations. Even some ordinary
citizens found the ruling hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confusing decision because there was no proof to
justify this verdict,'' said one lawyer who requested anonymity.
``But what everyone knows was that (President Ernesto Zedillo) was
under heavy political pressure to win this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who succeeded Carlos Salinas in January 1995, has
staked much of his administration's reputation on eliminating
government corruption. Only a month after taking office, he shook
his own entrenched Institutional Ruling Party by ordering Raul
Salinas's arrrest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday administration officials, many of whom had expressed
anxiety that Salinas would be acquitted, sounded relieved that the
government's gamble had paid off _ for now. Salinas's lawyers have
said they will appeal the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ojeda based his ruling largely on connections that
prosecutors made between Salinas and Daniel Aguilar Trevino and
Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, two accomplices who, authorities
claim, identified the former government official as a participant.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also relied heavily on phone records showing that
Rodriguez and Manuel Munoz Rocha, a former congressman and alleged
accomplice who has since disappeared and is believed to be dead,
had called Salinas the day after Ruiz was gunned down on a Mexico
City sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year trial included testimony from a former Salinas
mistress, allegations of ties to deadly drug cartels and suspicions
about how much President Salinas, in self-imposed exile in Ireland
and Cuba, knew about the killing. The government tried to solidify
its case along the way by adding charges of tax evasion and money
laundering, but most of those charges were later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Other charges of misuse of public funds and illegal enrichment
are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of those lesser allegations, some anaylysts
said, Raul Salinas has already come to symbolize much of what
infects Mexico's political structure: corruption, secret plots and
the ability of powerful people to act with impunity with little
fear of ever being punished for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the brother of an ex-president who everyone thought
was an untouchable,'' Kraus said, adding that, in this case, a
guilty verdict ``is very different from what we're accustomed to in
Mexico.''

&HT;        SHUSTER LOSES APPOINTMENT TO SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine   c. 1999 States News Service   WASHINGTON, Jan.
<TEXT>
22 -- It's been a rocky road lately for Rep. Bud Shuster, chair of
the powerful transportation committee.
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., denied Shuster's request
to be reappointed to a specially-selected committee that oversees
the nation's intelligence operations. Meanwhile, the House Ethics
Committee met for the first time and voted officially to reopen an
expanded investigation into Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a Hastert spokesman, said the speaker made the
decision because Shuster, R-Everett, had served the maximum
allowable number of years on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just simply that he had served all the time allowed
under House rules,'' Feehery said. ``The investigation had
absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's spokesman Scott Brenner said Shuster was disappointed
because he wanted to serve on the committee again, but understood
that ``rules are rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert's decision puts a roadblock up against Shuster's
chances of chairing the Select Committee on Intelligence in the
next Congress. At that point, he will have to step down as chair of
the transportation committee, having served the full term.
</P>
<P>
   He will need to have at least a one-year hiatus before becoming
eligible to chair the transportation committee again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich had decided to grant Shuster a waiver, but Hastert
just didn't want to go against the rules,'' Brenner said. ``I think
he just wanted to give new people a chance to serve on the
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Select Committee On Intelligence are not allowed
to serve for more than four of the last six Congresses. But former
House Speaker New Gingrich, R-Ga., waived the requirement for
Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster served on the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again
from 1995 to 1999, Brenner said. He worked on the Subcommittee on
Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, and the
subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ethics Committee reopened its probe into Shuster's
relationship with his former chief of staff Ann Eppard, who became
a lobbyist for the transportation industry. The committee expanded
its probe to determine whether Shuster's campaign activities
violated House rules.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Common Cause, a non-partisan group which
focuses on campaign finance reform and government ethics, urged the
committee to investigate Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's investigation of Shuster had been suspended
because of a pending criminal investigation in Boston, including a
federal grand jury's indictment of Eppard for her role in that
city's $10 billion ``Big Dig'' highway project.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause officials recently asked the committee to look at
documents filed in Boston outlining charges that two businessmen
and a lobbyist working for them provided Shuster and Eppard lodging
and dinners that violated a House gift ban. The contents of the
documents were reported last week by Roll Call -- a Capitol Hill
publication. The documents also say that Shuster failed to report
the gifts on his financial disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said Shuster was confident he would be completely
exonerated on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will cooperate with the investigation in any way he can,''
Brenner said.

POPE ARRIVES IN MEXICO AMID DECLINING CATHOLIC INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II arrived here Friday to a
thunderous welcome ready to do battle for the souls of the faithful
in a land where the Roman Catholic Church has been the dominant
faith since Cortes arrived in 1519 bearing the sword and the cross.
</P>
<P>
   At Benito Juarez Airport, the 78-year-old pope gingerly walked
down the stairway from his Alitalia jet and was met by President
Ernesto Zedillo, whose government has clashed with the church here.
Also greeting him were various members of the Catholic hierarchy,
including Boston Cardinal Bernard Law, and a mariachi band that
played the classic ``Cielito Lindo.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating issues the pontiff may raise, the Mexican president
raised several senstive topics, including the country's growing
democracy, respect for human rights and the plight of indigenous
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people, many cheering, some crying,
jammed the sidewalks of this sprawling city to catch a fleeting
glimpse of the pontiff as he passed by in a bus painted in the
Vatican's white and yellow colors.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the throngs of jubilant Mexicans greeting him, John
Paul and his church face difficult days in Latin America, where
Catholic hegemony is being seriously challenged for the first time
since Spanish missionaries came armed with the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   The church's claim on Mexico's soul has been steadily eroded by
the dramatic growth of evangelical Protestant denominations,
especially Pentecostal churches, who are finding willing converts
among Mexicans craving spiritual refuge from their daily travails.
</P>
<P>
   The pope did not touch on this controversial issue during brief
remarks on the windswept airport tarmac. Instead he spoke about a
rebirth of religious values, respect for human dignity and Mexico's
special place in the history of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church wants to be closer to Christ and his word, to be a
better server of man and to be a source of unity and not division
among humanity,'' the pope said in a tremulous voice.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the church's future in the Americas will be an
important theme of his six-day visit to Mexico and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago when John Paul came to Mexico on his first trip
as leader of the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics, fewer than 1
million Mexicans were Protestants. Today, scholars estimate that
there are more than 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 to 10,000 Latin Americans convert to evangelical
Protestantism every day and by early in the next century as many as
one out of three Latin Americans may be Protestant, religious
scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing perhaps the Catholic church's best weapon in this
fierce religious struggle, the pope will pay homage Saturday to the
Virgin of Guadalupe, where a miraculous appearance by the virgin is
said to have occurred and paved the way for the spread of
Catholicism throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to overstate the symbolic and spiritual
importance of the Virgin of Guadalupe to Mexico, the patron saint
of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Every December, on her feast day, hundreds of thousands of
followers march _ or crawl on their knees _ to the basilica in
Mexico City. Families often create small, candlelit shrines in
their homes in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   Her story has been passed down from generation to generation for
four centuries. In it, the dark-skinned, black-haired virgin is
said to have appeared to an Indian peasant, Juan Diego, on a
hillside known as Tepeyac in 1531 asking that a church be built on
that site.
</P>
<P>
   The virgin became a key figure in the church's conversion of
millions of Aztecs and other indigenous people. She has long been
called the Mother of Mexico, and her image is reproduced on
everything from gold jewelry to calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Tepeyac, now an area north of downtown Mexico City, is the home
of the basilica, which after St. Peter's in Rome is the most
frequently visited Catholic sanctuary in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico is no longer a Catholic fortress. Even some of those
who waited on the streets of the city for the pope to pass by
described the transformation of Mexico's religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many Protestants and I can see thay they are very
passionate about their devotion,'' said Nora Chavez, 38, a dentist
and lifelong Catholic. ``Sometimes they even border on being
fanatics. But they study the Bible, they're well educated and they
know their beliefs very well. That's why everyday more people join
those churches while the Catholic church loses people.''
</P>
<P>
   The inroads Protestants have achieved in the region have created
tense relations with the Catholic church. In a 1992 speech John
Paul characterized evangelizing Protestants as ``hungry wolves''
preying upon the poor and the ill-educated.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip in which the 78-year-old pontiff is expected to
outline the church's future strategy for the Americas, John Paul
has called for a ``new evangelization,'' a campaign of spiritual
renewal among the many faithful who are Catholic in name only.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Catholics who are baptized, married and
buried in the church and that is the only contact they'll ever have
with the church,'' said Brian Smith, a professor of religion at
Ripon College in Wisconsin and author of ``Religious Politics in
Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Protestant churches in Latin America is also
mirrored in the United States, where Hispanics represent the
fastest growing segment of the US Catholic Church. But an estimated
60,000 Latinos convert to Protestantism every year in the United
States, most becoming Pentecostals.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul believes the church in Latin America has over the past
30 years lost its spiritual moorings and become too involved in
political and economic issues providing an opening to evangelical
churches with their heavy emphasis on the Holy Spirit and a
personal relationship with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, battles over liberation theology _ the belief that the
gospel should be used as a weapon to challenge capitalist
exploitation and oppressive regimes _ tore apart the Catholic
church in the 1970s and 1980s and, some scholars say, distracted
church leaders from tending to their flocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle with Protestantism, the church is crippled by a
lack of foot soldiers. Because of the severe shortage of priests,
Sunday Mass can only be offered once a month in some rural areas of
Latin America. Many baptized Catholics have little knowledge in
their faithful.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, evangelical Protestant churches have mounted
aggressive campaigns to win members, setting up churches in
abandoned stores, warehouses and office buildings across this huge
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was baptized a Catholic, but I decided to come here because
I feel a stronger connection to Jesus,'' said Rosario Morelos as
she cracked open her Bible at the start of a prayer service inside
the Interdenominational Christian Church, an evangelical Protestant
congregation housed in a non-descript office building in a working
class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Masses at the church I used to go to did nothing
for me,'' added Morelos, 32, who is a factory worker. ``It was
spiritually dead. But here you feel the power of Jesus, of the
Bible.''

STABLE NAACP LOOKS TO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard Alkins has just begun his second term as president of
the Boston branch of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   In many organizations that would not qualify as much of a
distinction. But for the long-troubled chapter of the nation's most
storied civil rights organization, it is symbolic of a restored
stability. As recently as 1994, the local branch was in
receivership, a certified problem child of the national
organization. Now, just a few years later, the local group boasts
an enlarged membership and a renewed sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   When he was first elected in 1995 to serve out the unexpired
term of Jack E. Robinson, Alkins was a surprise choice, a State
House veteran with little profile. Now 54, he has worked at the
State House for 34 years, the past 20 as clerk of the Joint
Committee on Rules.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited a chapter in chaos. Its finances were in disarray,
with a large assessment due to the national organization. Its
membership was an unsolved mystery because shoddy record keeping
had been the norm for years. Its building had been lost to
foreclosure. Worst of all, the chapter had virtually disappeared as
a force in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now local membership is up to about 700, and the NAACP is again
visible on local issues. Most of all, it has shed the stigma of
chronic disorganization that haunted it in the early 1990s, an ugly
period whose nadir was symbolized by the loss of the chapter's
headquarters building on Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Alkins points to the successful end of the chapter's lengthy
battle to integrate public housing in Boston as his proudest
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, Alkins noted, the goal of the NAACP
lawsuit, the integration of long-segregated public housing, has
largely been achieved. ``I would say that's a major accomplishment,
seeing that case has been around for a zillion years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he enters his new two-year term at a time when, many
believe, the group is grasping for a direction. The NAACP played a
major role in pushing the city to file a US Supreme Court appeal of
a federal court decision to strike down Boston Latin School's
race-based admissions policy. But it has been frustrated in finding
a role in other local issues _ especially crime prevention and
affordable housing _ while other advocacy groups have been
successful in influencing City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrating case in point has been the NAACP's inability to
influence Mayor Thomas M. Menino's determination to end busing for
racial balance, a move the group opposes. Alkins insists that
busing has been a positive force for education, that to abandon it
would be to condemn black students to mediocre schools.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, their opposition hasn't created a ripple so far; Menino
has declined to meet with them, and often cites such advocates as
the Revs. Raymond A. Hammond and Eugene F. Rivers III as his
barometers for political sentiment in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Menino insists that the NAACP is not representative of black
community thinking on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a quality neighborhood school,'' Menino said
Friday. ``I have to prove to people that I will give them the same
quality neighborhood schools that people have in other
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest challenge to the NAACP's future may be its
ability to attract younger members. The NAACP's long-standing image
as a bastion of middle-class moderation is part of the problem.
Hampering Alkins is the perception in some quarters that he is a
caretaker, not a forceful advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some members had hoped to draft outgoing state
Representative Charlotte Golar Richie to oppose Alkins this time
around, but were unable to persuade her to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a way to go in terms of attracting the
younger, more vibrant wing of community activists,'' said the Rev.
Alexander Hurt, a 29-year-old community activist. ``In his next
term, that's where he should set his sights.''
</P>
<P>
   Alkins, in fact, nearly stepped down last November after the
death of his father. But he said he endured the tragedy convinced
that work remained to be done, and that his father would have
wanted him to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he would not have wanted me to step down from
doing something that he would be proud of me for doing,'' Alkins
said. ``He never quit, so I would never quit. Even if I choose not
to run next time around, if I step down it will be because I feel
there is a need for new blood.''

HIP-HOP'S TIP-TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending complete file)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with rock 'n' roll, jazz, and salsa, hip-hop is a baby,
just a tad over 20 years old. But a look at the Billboard charts
makes it clear that hip-hop reigns. On any given week, it
dominates, with at least four albums in the Top 10. It's no longer
music of the underground.
</P>
<P>
   Rap was born in the South Bronx, where teenage boys picked up
microphones and started speaking along to records being mixed by a
DJ. It was raw, straight from the street. People called it hip-hop,
a culture that embraced the music, lingo, and fashion of the time.
Since then, hip-hop has grown, capturing the fascination of
suburban America.
</P>
<P>
   Many predict 1999 will be the year rap and hip-hop explode,
snatching the music industry's limelight, as it expands with more
artists, more producers, and more fans.
</P>
<P>
   You see, unlike other genres of music, the Hip-Hop Nation takes
care of its own, giving cameo appearances to burgeoning artists,
launching many rappers into stardom on their first album.
</P>
<P>
   As artists have caught on to where the real money is _ producing
and writing _ rappers are building their own empires, not allowing
out-of-touch record company producers to have creative control. So
funksters like Master P and Jermaine Dupri keep rolling out the
hits _ on their own labels _ creatively expanding the definition of
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The list of successful hip-hoppers would fill pages, so we've
narrowed it down for you to just the most talked-about
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
JAY-Z His latest album, ``In My Lifetime, Vol. II . . . Hard Knock
Life,'' debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart several
months ago and it remains there for one reason: Jay-Z's flowing
lyrical style. He takes chances with his music. For example, the
title song from his latest album samples a chorus of high-pitched
girls taken from the Broadway musical ``Annie'' set to a thumping
bass line. He's known to lend rappers a hand, rewriting their stuff
to make it tighter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MASTER P. Rapper and producer extraordinaire. An accomplished
rapper in his own right, he started his own label, No Limit
Records, and counts among his artists heavyweights Snoop Dogg, Mia
X, and his younger brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder. In a
world where corporations are careful to diversify their holdings,
Master P's done the same, starting his own sportswear line and an
independent movie company. His movies are reminiscent of low-budget
flicks like ``Krush Groove,'' but, on videotape, he's making mad
cheddar (major money). &QL; 
 &QL; 
LAURYN HILL She's the queen of hip-hop trio the Fugees, a woman who
can rap and sing with equal finesse. A woman of soul and substance.
An artist who speaks with rare frankness about problems she sees in
the black community. The Fugees have temporarily disbanded so that
Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Pras Michel could do their own thing.
Wyclef's solo album stretched Caribbean-style hip-hop beyond its
dancehall rhythms, incorporating merengue beats and salsa riffs.
Pras's solo effort fell short but gave us one of the best singles
of '98, ``Ghetto Supastar.'' But Hill's solo debut, the ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' is so vibrant and unique it didn't
surprise too many people when she was nominated for 10 Grammys. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOXY BROWN She's the Madonna of rap. Indeed, Foxy manages to flash
even more flesh than the old Madonna, before she got spiritual. On
the mike, Foxy spits out fast-witted rhymes, most of which get
bleeped when played on the radio. To the uninitiated, Foxy is
superficial and slutty; to those who understand her game, Foxy's a
smart business woman who knows she can make crazy dollars by
self-blaxploitation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NAS One of the best rappers in the biz, Nas has gotten a bit softer
over the years, easing up on street-beats for a more palatable
(read: commercial) sound, but his raps are still tight, exploring
social issues and creating dramatic fictional tales of mobster
life. A new album, ``I Am,'' is set for a February release. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DMX Last summer, he released his first solo album, ``It's Dark and
Hell Is Hot,'' and it tore up the charts. Now, he's got another one
out, ``Blood of My Blood. Flesh of My Flesh,'' and it's smoking.
He's a rapper with a scratchy voice, one that can bark like a
Rottweiler. He made headlines when he was arrested on rape charges
in New York, but when DNA testing cleared him, few papers reported
it. But the charge might have given him the kind of street
reputation that makes young people think a person is cool. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MA(dollar sign)E. Since being discovered by Sean ``Puffy'' Combs,
Ma(dollar sign)e has been his biggest star. Like most new artists,
he was known before he made his debut album, ``Harlem World,''
doing cameos for the late Notorious BIG. With his drawling voice
and sometimes romantic lines, he's become rap's biggest hearthrob.
But he's not relying just on rap, an industry with a revolving
door. Ma(dollar sign)e started his own talent company, named after
his first album. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BIG PUN People often take potshots at Pun (that's short for
Punisher), who tips the scales at more than 400 pounds. But make no
mistake, this Puerto Rican from the South Bronx has jazzed hip-hop
by layering salsa-style piano riffs on thumping beats. Unlike many
rappers who play down their Latino roots because they believe it
won't play well to white consumers, Pun spices his rhymes with
Spanish. Now, lots of other rappers are biting off him, flowing
with words like ``Mamacita'' (literally ``little mommy,'' a term of
endearment) and ``chula'' (a sweet, sexy girl). &QL; 
 &QL; 
PUFF DADDY He got his nickname from wearing puffy goose-down coats,
but now Sean Combs has a closet full of gear including his own
line, Sean John. He's one of tbe biggest names in hip-hop,
producing a string of sample-happy hits for the Lox, Lil' Kim,
Ma(dollar sign)e, and the late Biggie Smalls. Still, he can't help
but make a fool of himself by rapping alongside his proteges, which
only shows how weak a rapper he really is. Puff learned he can make
millions remaking songs that were hits in the '70s, long before
many of his fans were alive to hear them the first time around.
Hip-hop diehards despise him; industry leaders say he's helped
hip-hop become more pop. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MISSY ``MISDEMEANOR'' ELLIOTT For years, she stayed behind the
scenes, producing R&AMP;B hits for others. But in '97 she went solo,
proving that you don't have to be seductive like Foxy Brown or
philosophical like Lauryn Hill to make it as a female rapper. Like
Will Smith, she's devoid of any angst, which makes for
happy-go-lucky songs with pop appeal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WU-TANG CLAN It's hard to keep up with the nine MCs who make up Wu.
With a love for martial arts, gold teeth, cosmology, and funky
rhythms, they've defined their own culture _ with their own line of
clothing, Wu-Wear, to boot. Among the members who spun out to do
their own thing are Method Man, Ghostface Killah, the RZA, Raekwon,
and Ol' Dirty Bastard. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KRS-ONE This old-school rapper has never traded in his political,
consciousness-raising raps for lyrics about flowing Cristal Rose
champagne and Bentleys. And it's a good thing, because there are
too few rappers talking about elevating the black and Latino
communities. His latest album, ``Maximum Strength,'' will be out
sometime this year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BEASTIE BOYS Who would've thought that three white boys from
Manhattan would transform hip-hop? Their 1986 album, ``Licensed to
Ill'' _ a hybrid of punk and rap, with heavy doses of sophomoric
humor _ introduced a generation of white kids to hip-hop. From
there, these fans started flipping through tapes in the rap
category at music stores, discovering music with a more rebellious
edge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MIA X The only female ``soldier'' signed to Master P's No Limit
Records, she goes off on promiscuous women and sleazy men alike.
But unlike Lauryn Hill, she comes across as insecure, changing her
point of view from one song to the next. That might have a lot to
do with the peeps she hangs with, among them, Snoop Dogg. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LL COOL J Like the Energizer bunny, he keeps going, outliving
Run-DMC, Doug E. Fresh, and a slew of other late-'80s rappers by
updating his style. He adopted his stage name in the early '80s,
years before his 1985 solo album, ``Radio,'' made him a household
name among hip-hop heads. Fourteen years later, married with
children, he still holds his own in the studio and onstage. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUSTA RHYMES He raps faster than light-speed, making his body
tremble with every syllable. Onstage, his energy bubbling, it
almost seems like he's going to self-combust. He's a genuine
performer, giving all he can when he sings. So what if you can't
understand some of his verses? The choruses are catchy, inspired by
the dancehall and hip-soul grooves he raps to.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JARSOL, India _ In this hamlet nestled in the teak forests of
western India, on a recent starry night, Sitaram Devjija says he
saw something that froze him in terror. A mob of raging
machete-wielding Hindu fundamentalists crested the hill above his
mud hut and swarmed over the rustic Christian prayer hall where he
worships.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ``Awaken, Hindus; run away Christians,'' they smashed
the red-tiled roof, pulled down the dung-caked walls of bamboo
matting, set fire to a plain wooden table bearing the Bible and a
trumpet, then rushed down the hill and beat him and four others
with sticks and their fists.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of the prayer hall was one of dozens of attacks
on Christian churches, schools and individuals that have taken
place across the country in the past year, more than half of them
here in the state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
   India has a long history of deadly clashes between its dominant
Hindu majority and its sizable Muslim minority, but in the past
year there have been more attacks on Christians _ who make up only
2.3 percent of the nation's 960 million people and less than 1
percent of Gujarat's more than 40 million _ than at any other time
in India's half century of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The number of attacks on Christians reported to police rose to
86 last year from 24 in 1997 and seven in 1996, according to the
Indian Home Ministry. Researchers for a Christian group put the
number of attacks last year at more than 120.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has been killed, the aggressive hostility to
Christians has highlighted the way religion and politics can become
dangerously entangled here.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the United Christian Forum for Human Rights, an
alliance of churches that banded together in response to the
violence, say it is no coincidence that the rise in attacks on
Christians has occurred at a time when Hindu nationalists _ long
suspicious of Christianity as a religion of foreign origin _ have
come to power.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party now governs alone
or as part of a coalition at both the national level and in the
states where, according to the Christians' research, most of the
attacks have occurred: Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Maharastra.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders deny any role in the attacks and say they
have acted to restore harmony. After his visit to the district
earlier this month, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said
attacks on minorities should stop, but he also called for a
national debate about religious conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Other more-militant Hindu nationalists are calling for a legal
ban on all religious conversions in India. They have accused
Christians of using foreign financial backing to undermine the
country's Hindu civilization and to lure people to convert from
Hinduism with bribes and free education.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that missionaries have stepped up efforts to
covert Hindus in the year since Sonia Gandhi, an Italian-born
Catholic, became head of the opposition Congress Party _ a charge
that both the party and the Christians say is false and meant to
sow religious discord in a bid to win Hindu votes for the Hindu
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, which trounced the Hindu nationalists in
recent state elections _ largely over the soaring price of onions
and other vegetables _ says that it is the Hindu nationalists who
are betraying Hinduism. India's majority religion is an eclectic,
all-embracing faith that tolerates all believers, Congress leaders
say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest outburst of hatred has occurred in the isolated
wilderness of the scantly populated Dangs district of Gujarat, a
place of pristine, mountainous beauty traced by crystalline rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the 170,000 inhabitants of Dangs are from the
indigenous Adivasis people. Many still worship their traditional
deities, the cobra and the tiger, in remote villages often lacking
electricity, running water and telephones. Large numbers have added
the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman, to their pantheon. Perhaps 15
percent of these people have become followers of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   John and Florence Pittenger, American Protestant missionaries
with the Church of the Brethren, were the first outsiders to come
to Dangs. They arrived in Ahwa, capital of Dangs, in 1904. The
church history describes Mrs. Pittenger confronting a tiger at the
edge of the forest and the couple crossing monsoon-swollen rivers
to reach villages.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding generations of missionaries have brought schools and
medical clinics to the area. It is health care above all that has
drawn local people to Christianity. The missionaries now are no
longer foreigners, but Indians, mostly from the southern states of
Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   Govind Sindhu said three of her children died of illnesses in
infancy and four others have survived with the prayers of a
Christian pastor and the medical care they have received at a
Christian clinic. It was this aid to her children that brought her
into the Christian fold, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sindhu said she was among those who helped douse a fire set
to a prayer hall in her village of Dudha on the night of Jan. 10,
just hours after Prime Minister Vajpayee had completed his visit to
Dangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the flames,'' said Mrs. Sindhu, who lives behind the
small church. ``Immediately we came and threw water on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, the moderate face of the Hindu nationalist cause and a
man who has stood up for secularism within his party, sent out more
ambiguous signals in Dangs. While here, he called for a national
debate on conversions _ a call that made Christians feel even more
insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in his government have since said that the prime
minister meant only that Hindus and Christians should have a
``dialogue'' about the contentious issue and never contemplated
introducing any new legal restrictions on conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, there have been scattered attacks on
Christians in Dangs, as well as two or three cases of Christians
disturbing Hindu places of worship, one of them last June in
Jarsol, the village where Devjija's prayer hall was recently
attacked. In the Jarsol case, police charged several Christians
with removing statues of tribal deities from a small makeshift
place of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, between Dec. 25 and Jan. 11, there was a concentrated
series of attacks in Dangs. Police registered 25 complaints of
attacks on Christians and three of attacks on Hindus. Police
arrested 43 Hindus and 125 Christians. There are now state police
officers guarding all 168 Christian places of worship in the
district.

AMA CHIEF DEFENDS FIRING OF EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The chairman of the American Medical Association
defended Friday the firing of the editor of its prestigious
journal, saying the group has not abandoned its commitment to
editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has been sharply criticized since the firing last week
of Dr. George Lundberg, the longtime editor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA dismissed Lundberg, saying that he published a report
showing that a majority of college students did not consider oral
sex as ``having sex'' to coincide with the Senate impeachment trial
of President Clinton. The definition of what constitutes sexual
relations is a key issue in the charges against Clinton stemming
from his efforts to conceal an affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randolph Smoak, chairman of the AMA board of trustees, said
during an interview that the survey inappropriately placed the
respected medical journal in the middle of a political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of it was, so far as one could tell, purposeful,''
he said. ``There is no reason the most prestigious of journals
should be placed in the political arena ... when we have a hearing
like this going on in our U.S. Senate for the first time in about
130 years. The journal should not in any way be injected into that
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg, who was a resident pathologist at Brooke Army Medical
Center in San Antonio from 1958 through 1962, had been editor of
JAMA for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoak said Lundberg had ``made great contributions on behalf of
the journal.'' But a series of recent ``management decisions'' had
put him at odds with AMA Executive Vice President E. Ratcliffe
Anderson, Smoak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editorial independence was never a question,'' he said.
``We've always ascribed to editorial independence and we will
continue to do so in a very precise way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoak declined to specify what the management decisions were,
saying only that the ``what is sex'' article was not an isolated
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg's dismissal has unleashed a firestorm of controversy
within the medical community worldwide. Critics of the decision say
academic freedom was sacrificed by ousting Lundberg and that the
study was sound.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the San Antonio Hospital Council on Friday,
Smoak said that Congress should pass a ``bill of rights'' for
patients and that more must be done to give doctors, rather than
health insurance companies, the authority to determine what is
medically necessary for their patients.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the government must be active in stopping tobacco
companies from targeting teen-agers. Lawsuits against the industry
are only ``a first step'' toward that goal, he said.

 JARSOL, India: the district. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real trouble began on Christmas Day. The district
administration allowed a militant Hindu group, the Hindu Awakening
Front, to hold a rally near a Christian church in Ahwa _ permission
that the prime minister later described as a serious mistake.
Leaflets distributed before the rally called on Hindus to attend
with the aim of halting further conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conspiracy of converting gullible tribals by giving money,
goods and black magic and also through threats is unearthed now,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
   As the protesters marched through town on Christmas, Christians
say they heard them chanting, ``Christians are thieves; Christians
get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side accuses the other of casting the first stone. The
rally turned into a riot. Police say it is not clear who started
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual in India, nothing is exactly the truth,'' said Manoj
Sashidhar, the superintendent of state police in Dangs. ``There are
shades of gray. You don't have all angels on one side.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, four Christian prayer halls and two Christian
schools were attacked. Sister Carmen Borges, a Roman Catholic nun
from Goa, said she watched a mob of more than 100 young men,
wearing scarves of saffron, the color of Hinduism, heave rocks
through the windows of a study hall in the Catholic school she runs
in Ahwa. It is attended by 840 children, most of them
non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Till today, no Hindus bothered about the Adivasis,'' Sister
Borges said. ``It is we missionaries who came here to bring them up
through education.''
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Fathers Ozie Ferrao and M.V. Anthony were
eating dinner at the Jesuit school they manage when they heard a
whistle blow and then the sound of stones breaking the tiles on the
roof. The school educates 225 children, 30 of them Christian. The
priests went outside to talk to the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you doing this?'' Ferrao asked. ``This school is for
the local children.''
</P>
<P>
   But the young men responded with rocks. After Ferrao was hit in
the foot and Anthony in the chest, the priests said, they fled for
help. The vandals then set the school jeep and motorcycle aflame
and smashed the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a calculated, unprovoked plan,'' said Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party has historically been dominant in Dangs, as
it has been all over the country among tribal Indians, who make up
about 8 percent of the country's population. But recently the Hindu
nationalists have begun seeking to make political inroads here.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the World Hindu
Council, part of the same family of Hindu nationalist
organizations, have been trying to win over tribal peoples by
telling them that Christians in the district are taking government
benefits that should be theirs _ though the law says the
disadvantaged tribal people, regardless of their religion, are
entitled to special help.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a small, darkened room lined with portraits of Hindu
gods and swatting at fat mosquitoes lazily circling at dusk,
Dashrath Pawar, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party in
Dangs, and Pradeep Patel, president of the World Hindu Council
here, said that Christians are destroying the cultural unity of the
villages of Dangs and dividing families by converting some members.
If conversions to Christianity are not banned, Patel said,
Christians will take over Dangs and drive out the Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at the idea that Hindus are attacking Christian
churches. ``The Christians themselves burned their own churches,''
he said, accusing them of doing it to get government compensation
for property damaged in such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   While churches in Dangs were burning in the days after
Christmas, the national leaders of the World Hindu Council, the
same group Patel heads in Dangs, were meeting in Jaipur.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters, Ashok Singhal, the council's
international executive president, said that the late Mother Teresa
had given injections to people who refused to convert to
Christianity to make them go insane. He also accused her of
supporting Albanian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In India, his remarks were not dismissed as the rantings of the
Hindu fringe. It was the World Hindu Council that led a campaign
that ended in 1992 with a Hindu mob destroying a 16th century
Muslim mosque at Ayodhya, an event that unleashed bloody
Hindu-Muslim riots and resulted in more than 1,000 deaths, mostly
of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conflict has periodically cursed India, and its
arrival in the tranquil hamlets of Dangs seems particularly
dissonant. Far from the main roads, they are places out of another
time, living to their own ancient rhythms and absorbing news faiths
that the present has brought them.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Jarsol, small barefoot children tend to the cows, while
their mothers, balancing tin pots on their heads, walk to market
with magisterial grace, and their fathers, wrapped in shawls
against the chill, drive the ox carts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the night of Dec. 30, when the Christian prayer hall on
the hill was attacked, order has returned. Children wander
curiously in the rubble. The partially burned wooden cross nailed
to the gable dangles upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Older Hindu villagers shook their heads at the trouble that they
say outsiders have brought to Jarsol. Jivanbha Sindhe said Hindus
and Christians have long lived together in brotherhood here. ``Some
people oppose the Christian religion, and some oppose the Hindu
religion,'' he said. ``That is the root cause of the problem. We
are all poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandrya Soma, tall, gaunt and barefooted, stood nearby in a
loin cloth and turban. The Christians join us in the Hindu
festivals of Holi and Diwali, he said, and we respect their
religion, too. A man of few words who did not know his age, Soma
offered his own simple wisdom: ``We all live in one village. What
will we gain from fighting?''

TAWDRY TEDIUM OVERSHADOWED BY BYRD'S CALL TO DISMISS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It came sharp as a cry from the heart. Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., issued a terse statement declaring he had heard
enough of the impeachment case against President Clinton midway
through another ping-pong-like revisitation by the Senate of the
trial's familiar details.
</P>
<P>
   ``End this sorry and sad time for our country,'' said Byrd in a
printed announcement, issued outside the Senate, that he would take
the lead next week in moving to dismiss the charges against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the chamber, a great buzz of surprise swept the Capitol,
for the Byrd is one of the constitutional deans of the Senate and
the motion took on extra heft as he announced how thoroughly he was
surfeited with the scandal. The day's real debating point instantly
became the Byrd initiative, not the retelling of the tale of the
intern and the president.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the chamber, the senators could show no outward
notice of Byrd's readiness to attempt a quick way out of their
often droning servitude. The senators had to keep to the 19th
century trial ritual of sending up hand-written questions and
silently listening to the answers, thereby inviting fresh gloss on
the oft-told tale of the president and the intern.
</P>
<P>
   One cautionary answer from Clinton's team predicted ``many
months'' more of the trial if the Republican majority opts to
summon witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning lent another layer of re-argument of well-known
points as each side took turns responding to largely unsurprising
softball queries lobbed up alternately by the president's partisans
and his foes. Lawyerly chipperness was clear as the contesting
counsels polished and demolished familiar positions.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the one-upmanship and skirmish points sporadically
scored in the re-debate, the exercise seemed to threaten the trial
with a lethal dose of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, with the circularity
of Dickens' interminable lawsuit in ``Bleak House.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fencing proceeded, the buzz from the Byrd initiative off
the floor grew to the point where Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, left
the trial to go out to the news media and insist the trial process
must go forward to completion, not be short-circuited in dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having 100 senators sit there hour after hour is burdensome,''
he conceded, looking weary as he headed back to heft that burden
once more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Laughter eased the day at times, as when a needling question
came from Republicans about early scandal strategizing by Dick
Morris, the president's chronic eminence grise. The defense team
lawyers looked at one another in obvious hesitation. ``I couldn't
find any volunteers,'' said White House counsel Charles Ruff, who
finally fielded the question as if it were a penance for someone
else's sin.
</P>
<P>
   Gamesmanship laced the proceedings. Some questions could be seen
arriving from Senate aides watching elsewhere. More often,
individual senators suddenly became inspired or agitated enough to
jot down a fresh question and pass it on to their party leader.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, whose Supreme Court allots an
hour in total for most landmark oral argumentation, patiently
recited about 50 questions that revisited the gifts, the phone
calls and all the rest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the outset of the day, the ultimate in barn-door closing
measures was announced, considering the grueling scandal year the
nation has endured by way of torrential leaks of supposedly secret
information. To protect the secret closed sessions of the trial,
staff members in attendance are being sworn to an iron-clad oath of
secrecy designed to strike dumb the likes of Linda Tripp and
cripple the kiss-and-tell publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The staffers who will attend the crucial closed-door court
sessions expected to begin next week must solemnly swear in writing
to ``never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct or
otherwise, for any purpose, at any time during or after my
employment or other association with the United States Senate, the
proceedings of any closed session of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that allows wiggle or tattle room only time and perhaps
fresh braces of lawyers will tell. But the Senate is making the
attempt and, coincidentally, the chaplain's opening prayer Friday
was for Artesian wells for the lawmakers as their trial reserves
run dry.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial's most charming moment of relief, senators
restricted from speaking suddenly beamed and squirmed approvingly
at their desks like grade-school students informed that cookies and
milk were in the offing. Their bipartisan round of joy was offered
to Rehnquist at his decision to apply a five-minute rule on the
answers to the questions.
</P>
<P>
   As the day proceeded, however, the five-minute rule proved
loose. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., appeared to be snoozing briefly
once more, which hardly seemed an excess under the hours of forced
passivity. Far greater excitement was growing outside the trial at
the news of Byrd's appetite to end it.

ACT LIKE A CAPTAIN, AUERBACH TELLS WALKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Auerbach leaned against a gymnasium wall Friday and
smoked a cigar. Of course. Some people choose visual logos to
represent them. Not Auerbach. His logo is the scent of cigar smoke,
hanging over a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years ago, Auerbach helped deliver an infant known
as the NBA. He is 81 now, so you can imagine he has spent plenty of
time watching basketball. And smoking. His former players tell
stories of the ultimate Red tribute: a flick of ashes in your
direction after a good game. Auerbach was in the mood for tributes
Friday, too. But since there were no games to play _ only the
second day of the Celtics' double-sessions training camp at
Brandeis University in Waltham _ he had to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach decided to walk over to a 6-foot-9-inch Celtic and hand
him a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a cigar,'' Antoine Walker said of the legendary
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Walker had signed a six-year contract extension worth
$71 million. Auerbach has seen many things in his career, but he
has never seen a contract like that in Boston. You could take the
highest salaries of Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Larry Bird, Bob
Cousy, and Sam Jones. You could combine those numbers and then
multiply by three. They still wouldn't come close to $71 million.
That's $21 million more than the contract Rick Pitino signed in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Auerbach didn't want to talk to Walker about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the captain,'' he said to the third-year forward. ``Act
like one. Be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after saying that, Auerbach said he has no doubts that
Walker will cut down on the technical fouls called against him
during his first two NBA seasons. He also told Walker that he can
be as good as he wants, weighty words from a man who coached nine
championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen him?'' Auerbach said of Walker. ``He's been
great.'' Auerbach has been a fan of Walker's since the Celtics
drafted the 22-year-old forward in 1996. The next year, Auerbach
became a Ron Mercer fan, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the Celtics ended a three-hour morning workout Auerbach
spotted Mercer and rookie Paul Pierce near center court of the
practice floor. He walked up to Mercer and told him a few things.
</P>
<P>
   What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he just told me what some of my goals should be now and
what they should be long-term,'' Mercer said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was a little more specific than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Winning is the thing, baby,' '' Auerbach said. He
began to chuckle. He knew he was caught; he didn't exactly say it
like that. What he really said was simple: Shoot, kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a scorer,'' Auerbach said of the 6-7 guard. ``He's got to
look to score more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the same message Russell gave Jones more than 30 years
ago when Jones, his shot temporarily ailing, began to hesitate
before shooting. In that case, the hesitation stopped and Jones's
No. 24 eventually was retired. Auerbach isn't saying Walker,
Mercer, Pierce, and Kenny Anderson are headed for the Hall of Fame.
Yet. But he is not afraid to label the four untouchable. He looked
at Mercer and said, ``I like that kid. He's got a great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach also looked at a trim Dana Barros and commented that he
couldn't remember the point guard running so fast. He said he liked
Bruce Bowen, Tony Battie, and Walter McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Red was raving.
</P>
<P>
   Someone stopped his flow by asking about the state of pro
basketball. It is a sport that will have to ask the public's
forgiveness following a 204-day lockout. Can basketball recover?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have missed the sport,'' Auerbach said.
``You'll find a few disgruntled people because that's the nature of
the beast; you'll find that all the time. I don't think the fans
are going to stay away. I honestly don't. I'd be shocked if they
do. I think both sides are sorry that (a new collective bargaining
agreement) wasn't done sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Auerbach insisted, the game has not changed. He
mentioned a book he wrote in 1952 (he's still sharp enough to give
himself a plug) and said that 47 years later, the basics in that
book still apply to today's game and today's players.
</P>
<P>
   One thing has changed, according to Auerbach. He looked around
the gym at a number of Celtics coaches and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran practices, and you could shoot pigeons in there because
no one was around,'' he said with a laugh. He was a coach and
assistant coach and general manager and public relations man all at
once. But he likes the way Pitino runs his practices, never letting
lulls set in.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Auerbach headed for the door. The man who earlier
leaned against the gym wall was leaving the building. But the
lingering smoke was a reminder of his visit.

IMPEACHMENT NOT INTENDED TO BE PUNISHMENT, SCHOLARS AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Colin Diver, dean of the University of Pennsylvania
Law School, thinks some members of Congress need to reread the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   They keep talking, said Diver, about evicting President Clinton
from the Oval Office as the only appropriate punishment for the
crimes he allegedly committed: perjury and obstruction of justice.
And they glide over the fact that the president, when out of
office, remains vulnerable to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them seem to want to teach him the lesson of the
century for his behavior by punishing him in this way,'' Diver
continued. ``But I really don't believe the impeachment process was
intended to be punishment in the sense that they mean and that we
ordinarily think about it legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, essentially, a personnel action, a means of removing
the CEO,'' he said. ``This is the system the founding fathers
created for firing the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other legal scholars, political scientists, and historians
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed that the person being impeached does indeed suffer
the broad ``punishment'' of personal and historical humiliation,
and perhaps of losing his job _ a point former senator Dale Bumpers
also underscored during his closing arguments for the White House
defense team Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the analysts added that the impeachment process was devised
to protect the nation and its people from abuse by someone in
office, not to impose a legal penalty on the person charged with
committing the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, they explained, the Constitution explicitly permits
the criminal prosecution of an impeached official after he or she
leaves office. If the removal itself were a punishment for the
purported misdeeds, then any subsequent prosecution would be
prohibited because it would constitute double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of impeachment is not to punish the individual;
that's what criminal law is for,'' said Alan Baron, who served as
special House counsel for the impeachments of two federal judges.
``It is to preserve the institutions of government from being
undermined or damaged in some fundamental way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said that lawmakers who perceive impeachment as a way
to punish Clinton ``are not seeking the right means for doing so''
because ``that's not what the constitutional provision is for. It's
supposed to be a means for protecting the country from a leader who
poses a severe threat to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, all the Republicans calling for Clinton's removal
believe Clinton's misdeeds rise to the level of impeachable
offenses. Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, for example, recently
predicted ``grave, damaging consequences for our system of
government'' if Clinton, like others who commit perjury, was not
subject to a ``severe punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum sought to bolster his point by explaining the severity
of punishments for convicted perjurors under the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely such direct linkage between allegedly
wrongful conduct in office and legal sanctions that some historians
and legal observers deem off-the-mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's supposed to be a gap between crime and
impeachability,'' said Akhil Amar, a professor of constitutional
law at Yale University. ``I wouldn't say that impeachment isn't
penal at all, since you could lose your job and be shamed and so
forth. But there's another place that's all about punishment, and
that's the court system that can be used after removal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers echoed those arguments during his much-praised
presentation two days ago. Asserting that Clinton had already
suffered embarrassment with his wife and daughter, among others,
the former senator from Arkansas added:
</P>
<P>
   ``These proceedings go right to the heart of our Constitution
where it deals with impeachment, the part that provides the gravest
punishment for just about anybody, the president, even though the
framers said we're putting this in to protect the public, not to
punish the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert, an expert on the presidency and impeachment at
Northeastern University, agreed that impeachment was intended ``to
safeguard the public, not to punish personal wrongdoing.'' Still,
he argued that the process was not meant only to be an
administrative action for firing a senior-level employee, but was
intended to have a punitive component, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, he and others said, the Constitution allows for
articles of impeachment to call for the president to be barred from
holding future office if convicted. President Andrew Johnson's
Republican accusers did not seek that sanction against him during
his impeachment trial in 1867, but the charges against Clinton do.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars said that during Johnson's trial, the word punishment
was hardly used by the House managers. Instead, they focused on how
his alleged offenses had undermined the workings of government and
on the need to remove him so that the rule of law could be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about punishing him in the same way as the
Republicans now say they want to punish Clinton,'' said Michael Les
Benedict, a historian at Ohio State University and author of a book
about Johnson's impeachment trial. ``They talked about the effects
of his political wrongs, of his winking at treason, of subverting
the laws. . .so that there was a need to protect the nation and its
people, rather than punishment.''

   &QL;  SHUSTER LOSES APPOINTMENT TO SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine States News Service WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- It's
been a rocky road lately for Rep. Bud Shuster, chair of the
powerful transportation committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., denied Shuster's request
to be reappointed to a specially-selected committee that oversees
the nation's intelligence operations. Meanwhile, the House Ethics
Committee met for the first time and voted officially to reopen an
expanded investigation into Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a Hastert spokesman, said the speaker made the
decision because Shuster, R-Everett, had served the maximum
allowable number of years on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just simply that he had served all the time allowed
under House rules,'' Feehery said. ``The investigation had
absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's spokesman Scott Brenner said Shuster was disappointed
because he wanted to serve on the committee again, but understood
that ``rules are rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert's decision puts a roadblock up against Shuster's
chances of chairing the Select Committee on Intelligence in the
next Congress. At that point, he will have to step down as chair of
the transportation committee, having served the full term.
</P>
<P>
   He will need to have at least a one-year hiatus before becoming
eligible to chair the transportation committee again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich had decided to grant Shuster a waiver, but Hastert
just didn't want to go against the rules,'' Brenner said. ``I think
he just wanted to give new people a chance to serve on the
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Select Committee On Intelligence are not allowed
to serve for more than four of the last six Congresses. But former
House Speaker New Gingrich, R-Ga., waived the requirement for
Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster served on the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again
from 1995 to 1999, Brenner said. He worked on the Subcommittee on
Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, and the
subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence.

   The House Ethics Committee reopened its probe into Shuster's
relationship with his former chief of staff Ann Eppard, who became

FOOD-BORNE INFECTION HOSPITALIZES THREE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At least three people who have been hospitalized in
Massachusetts with a serious bacterial infection, including a
pregnant woman who miscarried, have been linked to a nationwide
outbreak involving contaminated hot dogs and cold cuts.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man is now in a rehabilitation facility, while an
elderly woman has recovered, according to Dr. Alfred DeMaria,
director of the bureau of communicable disease control for the
state Department of Public Health. The third person was the woman
who miscarried, in her second trimester.
</P>
<P>
   While lab results have confirmed that these three people, all
from Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts, were infected since
November with the same unusual strain of listeria in the
contaminated products, DeMaria stopped short of saying the meats
caused these cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is they're linked. One would presume it's a
result of the meat product. It's the same organism. But we don't
have a definite food product and can't say this is what they ate,''
DeMaria said. The woman who miscarried said she had not eaten any
hot dogs before becoming ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Massachusetts cases, including three people who have
died since December, are still under investigation, and the lab
results identifying the listeria strain are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths involved an elderly woman from Norfolk County, an
elderly man from Western Massachusetts, and an elderly man from the
central part of the state, according to DeMaria. The fourth person,
an elderly man from Norfolk County, has recovered.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the nationwide outbreak has involved at least 67 cases
in 13 states, including the death of 11 adults and three
miscarriages, according to the latest statistics from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The illnesses, dating as far back as August, have been linked to
an unusual strain of listeria that has contaminated certain hot
dogs and deli meats made under such brand names as Ball Park,
Hygrade, Sara Lee, and Mr. Turkey. On Dec. 22, the manufacturer,
Bil Mar Foods, voluntarily recalled specific lots of the products
that might be affected, with the code EST P261 or EST 6911 on the
outer edge of all packages.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, about 20 to 30 cases of listeriosis, as the bacterial
infection is called, are reported in Massachusetts each year, with
about 30 to 50 percent of them resulting in death, since those who
are most likely to get sick from the bacteria are people who have
weakened immune systems, according to DeMaria.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria can lead to meningitis, high fever, and a widespread
blood infection known as sepsis, DeMaria said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of listeriosis, public health officials
recommend that people thoroughly cook raw meat, wash raw
vegetables, avoid unpasteurized milk, and thoroughly wash hands,
knives and cutting boards after each handling of uncooked foods.
People at risk, such as pregnant women and people with compromised
immune systems, should avoid soft cheeses like brie and thoroughly
cook leftovers and ready-to-eat foods like hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   While packaged hot dogs are cooked, not raw, contamination
during processing could still lead to problems if they are not
thoroughly reheated until steaming hot, according to public health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cook everything well, there's no listeria problem,''
DeMaria said.

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- It's been a rocky road lately for Rep.

Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, and the
subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ethics Committee reopened its probe into Shuster's
relationship with his former chief of staff Ann Eppard, who became
a lobbyist for the transportation industry. The committee expanded
its probe to determine whether Shuster's campaign activities
violated House rules.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Common Cause, a non-partisan group which
focuses on campaign finance reform and government ethics, urged the
committee to investigate Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's investigation of Shuster had been suspended
because of a pending criminal investigation in Boston, including a
federal grand jury's indictment of Eppard for her role in that
city's $10 billion ``Big Dig'' highway project.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause officials recently asked the committee to look at
documents filed in Boston outlining charges that two businessmen
and a lobbyist working for them provided Shuster and Eppard lodging
and dinners that violated a House gift ban. The contents of the
documents were reported last week by Roll Call -- a Capitol Hill
publication. The documents also say that Shuster failed to report
the gifts on his financial disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said Shuster was confident he would be completely
exonerated on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will cooperate with the investigation in any way he can,''
Brenner said.

DOUBLE THE IMPACT, HALF THE LAUGHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I pray. I pray every night,'' says Joey in the
first act of David Mamet's play ``The Old Neighborhood.'' ``I pray
that I can get through life without murdering someone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment that could sound right coming from any of the
characters in the two Mamet plays _ ``The Old Neighborhood'' and
``The Cryptogram'' _ playing in repertory at the Geffen Playhouse.
Actually, the line could read ``murdering someone or killing
myself,'' which Joey talks about later and it's another thought
that seems to be expressed, overtly or tacitly, by other
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds deadly serious, huh? But the Mamet plays are punctuated
generously with humor, albeit very dark humor, and Joey's lines can
as easily generate a laugh as a gasp, which is part of the genius
of Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to overpraise the playwright, though. He, in the words
of critic John Lahr, dissects ``the follies of American life.'' He
wields the knife expertly, to reveal the inner turmoils and tumors
but does not neatly sew things up, thus making the audience work
for the meaning of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing tidy about Mamet's dialogue, either, which
often is rapid, staccato, repetitive. Note Joey's lines: ``I pray.
I pray ... I pray.'' You won't hear long cohesive speeches in works
from Mamet, who draws from his Chicago background. The rhythm of
dialogue and clues within it often substitute for traditional
narrative to move the story forward.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Mamet is reminiscent of composer of Philip Glass,
another late-20th-century American artist who has had a major
effect on his field. Both are incredibly prolific _ Glass writing
film scores and operas, Mamet writing for movies and television.
Glass is called a minimalist, but that's misleading. He, too, uses
repetition, but with arpeggios.
</P>
<P>
   They both have distinctive styles. You see a scene from a Mamet
play and you know it's Mamet. You hear a Glass composition, you
know it's Glass. But their works, at times, seem less fully
realized complete works than signature pieces, to be considered
within their oeuvre. Which raises the questions: How valuable are
these works? Are they worth the time and effort to see them or hear
them?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``The Old Neighborhood'' and ``The Crytogram,''
the answer is yes, but not unequivocally. Both plays contain
brilliant moments, razor-sharp dialogue and fine acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neighborhood'' is three related one-acts plays. (Mamet wrote
the first in 1982 and picked up the thread years later.) On the
heels of the breakup of his marriage, Bobby (Dennis Boutsikaris)
returns in a midlife crisis to Chicago to confront his past.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1, ``The Disappearance of the Jews,'' is set in Bobby's
Chicago hotel room where he is visited by his boyhood friend Joey
(David Warshofsky). They reminisce about the past, second guess
themselves and lament their choices (``I should never have married
a shiksa,'' Bobby says. How did I end up running a restaurant?
wonders Joey.).
</P>
<P>
   Warshofsky gives a wonderfully lively performance. Boutsikaris
shows just enough of his nervous energy from the uncertainty in his
life to make him interesting. It a difficult role because, for the
most part, his character is a sounding board for the others, and
rarely reacts strongly or expresses an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the second act, ``Jolly,'' he visits his sister, where the
two have spent the night confronting the terrors of their family.
The scene begins with Jolly (Robin Bartlett) telling Bobby about
someone who doesn't like the way she and her husband, Carl (Ed
Begley Jr.), raise their kids. The person she's referring to is
Bobby and Jolly's stepfather, a non-Jew. That sets her off, and in
a short time all the past ghosts come forth. It's a difficult role
for Barlett, kind of like a Paganini cadenza with its emotional ups
and downs, but she's up for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman poet Horace said, ``Undeservedly you will atone for
the sins of your fathers.'' This is the theme that runs through
this scene and throughout ``The Cryptogram.'' When Jolly says she
thinks her kids will turn out OK, Bobby replies, ``Of course they
won't. We're not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final act, ``Deeny,'' Bobby meets an old girlfriend whose
whereabouts he learned from his conversation with Joey. He meets
her in a restaurant. Deeny (Christine Dunford) is not the woman
Bobby remembers. She, like Joey, thinks about the things she'll
never do. She has lost the feeling that things ever will be right
again and babbles as she tries to understand herself. Dunford
brings poignancy to the role, which depends so much on Bobby's lack
of reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cryptogram'' takes place in 1959, with Donny (Dunford);
her friend Del (Begley); and her son, John (Will Rothhaar) awaiting
the return of the boy's father, who is taking him on a camping
trip. John can't go to sleep for the excitement, and after a couple
of accidents he worries what the third one will be, wondering if it
could have happened earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's a provocative play full of clues and symbols. Early on,
Mamet introduces a knife that once belonged to a German paratrooper
in World War II, and it shows up in a haunting final image. Some
critics have seen this play as being about child abuse, but I think
it's more about the psychological scars left from living in an
unhappy family.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with ``Crytogram'' is having a child speak in Mamet
rhythms. True, the play isn't supposed to be entirely realistic,
but, somehow, the lines sound unnatural coming from a young boy,
especially early on before the story is established. Dunford and
Begley do commendable work in overcoming this, and ultimately turn
in strong performances.
</P>
<P>
   Neither play is very long _ ``The Old Neighborhood'' is about 75
minutes, ``The Cryptogram'' about 65 minutes. That adds to the
feeling that they aren't complete. Neither is a great work, but
both contain all the elements that make Mamet, at his best, great.
And that's good. &QL;

CALDOR THROWS IN THE TOWEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caldor Corp., which grew from a mom-and-pop store in 1951 to a
region-wide retail institution, said Friday it plans to go out of
business, a move that would throw 20,000 employees out of work and
close all of its 145 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Operating discount department stores in nine Northeastern
states, including 22 stores in Massachusetts, Caldor said it
expects to conclude its going-out-of-business sale by mid May.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, it has struggled in a crowded market
where there are far too many stores and not enough consumers to
keep them all prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   An abundance of stores hasn't stopped giant national discounters
from invading New England _ Target will soon join Wal-Mart and
Kmart in the Boston market. In the Darwinian world of retail, where
size matters and the weak often wither, national giants are
inexorably displacing homegrown small-fry. Such was fate of
Lechmere, another retailing mainstay that was forced to close its
doors in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With so many choices available, the lower- and middle-income
consumers who once flocked to a Caldor now tend to go elsewhere
when they shop for bargains in family clothing and home
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed by behemoth outsiders and fighting to defend an
ever-narrowing niche, the beleagured Caldor has been operating
under bankruptcy protection since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month it stopped paying some vendors and it was
under increasing pressure from creditors to shut its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Its troubles in the '90s were a far cry from Caldor's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, Caldor was ``a genuine New England
discount institution,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's
Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, the institution decided to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with great sadness and disappointment that we announce
the decision to close down Caldor's business,'' said Caldor
chairman and chief executive Warren D. Feldberg in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the nature of our capital structure and the shortfall of
our performance goals, the board (of directors) had no alternative
but to conclude that this was the most appropriate course of action
under these circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Norwalk, Conn., Caldor reports annual sales of nearly
$2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision to go out of business follows Caldor's
unsuccessful attempts in bankruptcy court to win approval for a
business reorganization plan from its creditors, which are owed
about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Caldor's plan to liquidate its merchandise and sell its real
estate is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper accounts have identified Kohl's and Target as possible
buyers of some Caldor's prized real estate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's and Target are two Midwestern-based chains looking to
gain a foothold in the Northeast market.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Target's parent company declined to comment,
but a spokesman for Bradlees Inc., the Braintree, Mass. discount
chain also operating under bankruptcy protection, said it might
consider acquiring some of Caldor's sites and hiring some of its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Caldor traces its origins to the early 1950s when Carl and
Dorothy Bennett opened a small camera-and-gift store in Port
Chester, N.Y. Deriving its name from its founders' first names, the
chain quickly put down roots in southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, the chain grew and prospered until the Bennetts
sold Caldor in 1981 to the first of several new owners.
</P>
<P>
   In those heady days, regional discount chains such as Caldor and
Bradlees flourished. But gradually giant national retailers began
to invade regional markets and steal away customers with better
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   With about $32 billion in annual sales, a big chain such as
Kmart Corp. can use its size to buy in volume and offer lower
prices to customers than small regional chains such as Caldor.
</P>
<P>
   And with more giants such as Wal-Mart and Target crowding into
the local market, it seemed Caldor's best days had passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of competition out there,'' said David Schmitt,
a senior vice president at Bradlees, a regional chain similar to
Caldor. ``And more and more, the competition is coming from the big
national players.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail
Trend Report, competitors narrowed Caldor's niche to the point
where it vanished. It wasn't just one rival, but a host of
competitors besieging Caldor from all sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caldor lost its ability to give customers a clear-cut reason
to shop at its stores,'' he said. ``Everybody from Kmart to Ames
was taking business away from Caldor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bennetts were ``wonderful'' merchants, he said, but
subsequent owners weren't so astute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each new management team added another nail to the coffin,''
Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Other regional discounters looked at mergers as a way to survive
competition from national giants.
</P>
<P>
   In November, for example, Ames Department Stores Inc. of Rocky
Hill, Conn., announced plans to acquire Hills Stores Co. of Canton,
Mass. as a way to increase its purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   But though rumors periodically swirled that Caldor might employ
a similar strategy and possibly merge with Bradlees, no deal was
ever forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there were some signs in the spring that Caldor
could still turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   Losses narrowed and, in May, the retail finance division of
BankBoston Corp. extended to Caldor what it described as ``a $450
million replacement (debtor-in-possession) facility and
emergency-credit facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday a BankBoston spokeswoman said the bank would have no
comment on Caldor.
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees faces some of the same challenges as Caldor. But,
according to Schmitt, Bradlees' creditors are close to approving a
reorganization plan that would let the chain shortly exit from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're meeting our business plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What impact will Caldor's closing have on Bradlees?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take pleasure in the difficulties of our
competitors,'' Schmitt said. But if Caldor customers start shopping
at Bradlees, ``we will welcome them with open arms.''

 &HT;    AirTran settles suit surrounding Flight 592 crash for $5 million
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways has agreed to pay $5 million in cash
and stock to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit stemming
from the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in the Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged ValuJet executives made misleading
statements about the company's safety and prospects both before and
after the May 1996 crash.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed 110 people, led to a three-month safety
shutdown for ValuJet and tanked its stock. ValuJet later merged
with Orlando, Fla.-based AirTran and adopted its name.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement, disclosed in an AirTran financial
filing, would apply to buyers of ValuJet stock from June 9, 1995,
through June 17, 1996. Previous legal filings in the case said the
class consists of ``thousands of individuals and institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement fund would consist of $2.5 million in cash and
$2.5 million in shares of AirTran Holdings Inc. stock. How and when
the money and shares would be distributed isn't yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   All claims in the lawsuit would be dismissed, and AirTran would
admit no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A plaintiff's attorney said the settlement is preliminary and
details will be filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by spring.
If the judge in the case approves the plan, shareholders will then
be asked to submit claim information.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs claimed the class lost ``tens of millions'' on
ValuJet stock, which traded as high as $34.75 during the period but
was at $6.50 when it ended. The seven lead plaintiffs suffered
losses ranging from $42,000 to $484,000, according to prior
filings.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Holdings stock closed Friday at $3.03 1/8, down 6 1/4
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs claimed ValuJet executives made misleadingly rosy
public statements about the airline's safety and expansion plans in
the months before the crash, even though it was already under
government scrutiny and had been forced to curtail growth.
</P>
<P>
   The airline denied the claims and initially sought to have the
lawsuit dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, Atlanta's second-largest carrier, said in the financial
filing the settlement ``will not have any material effect'' on its
business. It operates under mostly new management.
</P>
<P>
   Most survivor suits stemming from the crash have been settled,
although about a dozen claims remain in state and federal court in
Miami. Earlier this month a judge in that case ruled the plaintiffs
could seek punitive damages.

 &HT;    Cost-saving moves help Georgia Gulf
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gulf posted fourth-quarter net income of $12.6
million, or 41 cents per share, compared to $20.8 million, or 63
cents per share in the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were surprised. An unexpected pair of cost-saving moves
by the Atlanta-based chemicals manufacturer added 14 cents per
share to the results reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts' consensus for the fourth quarter was earnings of
28 cents a share, with a range of 20 cents to 30 cents, according
to First Call. Without the cost savings, the company would have
reported a profit of 27 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was very open about it,'' said Graham Copley of
Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. ``The real number was 27 cents.''
Copley expressed approval that Georgia Gulf had come up with the
savings.
</P>
<P>
   The company deferred fourth-quarter maintenance in its
chlorine/caustic and methanol plants, saving $3.2 million after
taxes. ``Basically they moved 10 cents from one quarter to the
next. The ideal time to take a shutdown is when the part they're
shutting down isn't doing as much business,'' Copley said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also saved $1.3 million after taxes, or 4 cents per
share, by restructuring its executive benefit plan to reduce
pension expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in a period of declining earnings in the commodity
chemical industry, and we're trying to save wherever we can,'' said
Georgia Gulf spokeswoman Nancy O'Donnell. ``I don't think that
deferring a maintenance turnaround is particularly unusual for our
industry, but, given that we were in a quarter of cyclically low
earnings, the adjustment became material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the cost savings (in pension expense) is
(also) a one-time savings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gulf reported revenue of $196.3 million in the fourth
quarter compared to $232.3 million ia year earlier. The company
said that overcapacity and Asian financial troubles hurt operating
results both at Georgia Gulf and in most of the industry.

 &HT;    Limited buying power will stall poultry exports in near future,
official says
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Poultry exports will pick up, but not in the near
future, former Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in
Atlanta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bump along for a awhile, simply because
purchasing power around the world has diminished,'' Yeutter told
attendees on the last day of the International Poultry Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted that some currently troubled areas of the world
could become significant poultry buyers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yeutter concurred with earlier predictions that agricultural
exports will continue their decline this year. Broiler exports
totalled 4.5 billion pounds in 1998, down from 4.7 billion pounds a
year earlier. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that
exports will dip to 4.3 billion pounds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   New markets have opened up in recent decades, but turmoil in
Asia and Russia have hurt the industry, he said. ``We've got to
hope we'll get some leadership in many countries that will generate
economic growth and put money in peoples' pockets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeutter offered these predictions for future trade:
</P>
<P>
   _ Russia is likely to return to some form of totalitarian
government and offers little promise. ``The good news may be that
it can't be much worse,'' Yeutter said. ``The Russian market can
come back, but don't expect it to be a booming market.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Latin America is a bright spot. Even Brazil ``is going through
some tough times, but is fundamentally sound,'' he said. ``There's
cause for substantial optimism (across the region) as long as we
can maintain the tradition of democratic capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Asian economies ``are in trouble now but are going to come
back,'' Yeutter said. Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and other countries
have plenty of potential buying power and will offer ``some
excellent marketing opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Western Europe offers long-term promise. ``In time there will
be a free trade agreement involving the U.S.,'' he predicted.

NURSING CHIEF SAYS PROPOSED RULES WILL BE REVAMPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Responding to an uproar among Massachusetts nurses, the
state nursing board's chairwoman Friday promised to recast proposed
new rules to respond to critics who say the draft language would
undercut nurses feeling pressured to provide more care with less
support from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman Marie McCarthy said it was ``absurd'' to think
the panel intends to discipline nurses for providing ``too much
care,'' as many feared one proposed regulation might portend.
</P>
<P>
   That regulation, she said, was only intended to get at fraud _
nurses who bill for home visits they didn't provide, for instance _
although the draft regulation nowhere mentioned fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism of another draft regulation, McCarthy
said in an interview that the nursing board won't require nurses to
follow their employers' policies right-or-wrong.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy also said the board will probably rethink a proposed
regulation saying nurses could be disciplined for behavior that
``reflects adversely on the profession.'' Some worry such a
provision could jeopardize a nurse who protested against
deterioriating working conditions, but McCarthy insisted the board
never meant it as a catch-all trap for any behavior some might see
as ``unbecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed of McCarthy's remarks, critics of the proposed
regulations said they were glad to hear the board would clarify its
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely accept there was no malicious intent,'' said
Karen Daley, president of the 20,000-member Massachusetts Nurses
Association. ``But their language didn't allow that to come
through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to change the language to reflect nurses'
concerns, that's great,'' added Suzanne Gordon, a journalist who
writes about nursing issues. ``But if they really want to be
helpful in this era, they have to say what they mean. Licensure
regulations are not supposed to require some sort of Talmudic
exercise in potential interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Following two ``town meetings'' with hundreds of nurses this
week and media coverage that upstaged a presidential impeachment
trial on some Boston newscasts, state officials reconsidered their
earlier refusal to respond to specific criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premature fearmongering'' is how one state official
characterized nursing groups' cries of alarm about draft
regulations that have been under review. McCarthy said many
interpretations were ``way off-base.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCarthy acknowledged that some of the board's
proposed language was open to misinterpretation. ``It's very
difficult in health care these days,'' she said. ``I imagine that
somehow we were perceived as making things even more difficult at a
time when it's already hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy, vice-president for education at Lawrence Memorial
Regis College, also criticized the board's critics, charging that
some of their scenarios were ``outrageous.'' She was particularly
upset about opposition to a proposed regulation that would allow
the nursing board to suspend a nurse's license summarily if she or
he posed a public threat.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy made clear the board will not drop its summary
suspension proposal, saying it is necessary to protect the public.
She said it is based on a 1994 statute that amended the board's
powers, but that interpretation is disputed by some.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature needs to examine that,'' said Marie Snyder, a
nurse-attorney who often represents nurses in board disciplinary
proceedings. ``For one thing, the board's resources are so limited
that it's almost impossible they could hold a hearing in the
required seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Registration in Nursing licenses 120,000 nurses. It
accounts for more than half of all disciplinary cases handled by
the state's 33 licensure boards, according to Anne Collins of the
Division of Registration, which oversees the boards.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing board's $1 million annual budget gives it $8.33 for
each licensee, while the state medical licensure board has $59.26
for each licensed physician.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the summary suspension power would be used only in
``extreme'' cases, such as one nurse who lost his license after the
board determined, in a two-year disciplinary process, that he
repeatedly threatened patients at knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a nurse eventually lost her license after the
board found the nurse had stripped an incontinent nursing home
patient of her clothing, threw her in a laundry cart, and paraded
her through the facility's hallways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should that nurse be allowed to stay in practice?'' McCarthy
said heatedly. ``Not all nurses are wonderful people, sad to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be very few cases that will rise to that level''
requiring immediate license suspension, McCarthy added. ``But for
the life of me, I cannot understand why any professional
organization would support allowing a nurse whose behavior has been
so egregious to continue practicing with a valid license for one,
two, or three years. I'll never understand that, never.''

 &HT;    Hawks' Kasten crying foul in Sprewell signing
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten angrily charged Friday that the New
York Knicks were given special treatment by the NBA that
facilitated their dealing for Latrell Sprewell, the controversial
guard suspended last season for his attack on Golden State coach
P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Three Knicks executives and coach Jeff Van Gundy were allowed to
interview Sprewell in secret in Milwaukee on Sunday, four days
before the NBA lockout ended officially with the signing of the new
labor agreement. The Knicks then dealt for Sprewell when they were
satisfied with his responses, and the league restored him to active
duty Friday morning after a meeting with commissioner David Stern
and union executive director Billy Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said any team interested in Sprewell
was granted a one-time exemption from lockout rules to interview
him. He did not name other teams involved, but it is believed that
there were at least two.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten cried foul on that score, saying neither he nor Hawks
general manager Pete Babcock were aware that Sprewell was available
for private interviews. ``Other teams were in the same position.
Why weren't we given that opportunity?'' Kasten asked. However, he
did not say that the Hawks were interested in Sprewell. Last
winter, Babcock said flatly that Sprewell would never play for the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another case in which teams are allowed to break the
rules with impunity,'' Kasten said. ``It's been going on for some
time. Teams have worked out players in secret, talked to players in
clear violation of the rules. We know it goes on, but the league
does nothing about it. I say this stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knows of clear evidence that teams administered
physicals and had other illegal contact with players, while the
Hawks, among others, waited until the agreement was signed
Wednesday before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my players furious with me because they know other
teams are breaking the rules and we won't do it,'' Kasten said.
``They don't understand why we're losing players to teams that
don't abide by the rules. They don't understand why being honest
should put us at a competitive disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a deep breath, Kasten repeated himself. ``It stinks.
It's wrong. It's wrong. It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Hawks did not make contact with a single player
outside the rules, no matter how much they might have coveted him.
Now, they are working from a distinct disadvantage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they were trying to land a formidable free-agent forward
to round out their lineup, but the pool appeared to be dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, LaPhonso Ellis became available when he was
renounced in Denver to permit the free-agent signing of Antonio
McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it appeared that Corliss Williamson, rather
than be renounced so the Kings can sign Vlade Divac, had agreed to
play for only $500,000 after averaging 17.7 points while earning
$1.2 million last season. Williamson then would be expected to sign
a lucrative contract in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' plan to sign Williamson that way still has to be
approved by the NBA, and Kings vice president Geoff Petrie hinted
that it might be an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hawks were working double sessions and preparing
for public practice at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum
at 5:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks still have not resolved problems with their own free
agents, Alan Henderson and Tyrone Corbin. Kasten said he was trying
to deal with what he considers Henderson's high salary
expectations, although the two sides are no closer to resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is that Alan wants to be here, and we want
him to be here,'' Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks' roster was enhanced when guard Anthony Johnson,
center Mark West and forwards Chris Crawford and Jason Lawson came
to work. Crawford is a holdover from last season.
</P>
<P>
   And they completed the Christian Laettner trade to Detroit by
obtaining second-year center Scot Pollard and a first-round draft
choice. Guard Charles O'Bannon fell out of the deal for salary cap
reasons.

 &HT;    Unkind cuts have turned out `Super'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a way, Falcons defensive tackle Shane Dronett and cornerback
Ronnie Bradford have traded places with Broncos wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett and Bradford began their careers with Denver and played
under current coach Mike Shanahan. McCaffrey began his career with
the New York York Giants and played one year under current Falcons
coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves cut McCaffrey before the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan cut Bradford in Denver before the '96 season and didn't
re-sign Dronett the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami on Jan. 31, Bradford, playing
for Reeves, at times will guard McCaffrey, playing for Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 215-pound McCaffrey caught 49 passes for the
Giants in '92, the year before Reeves was hired as coach. In '93,
he caught 27 passes.
</P>
<P>
   He was cut before the next season. After playing for San
Francisco, where Shanahan was offensive coordinator in '94, he
followed Shanahan to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His next stop after the Super Bowl will be the Pro Bowl after
career-highs of 64 catches, 1,053 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really never even saw (the cut) coming,'' McCaffrey said
earlier this season. ``I pretty much had to just pack the bags and
start flying around the country trying to find a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves regrets the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever made a mistake that bad,'' he said.
``I've had guys go play somewhere else, but not go on to the level
where they could be...a major contributor on a Super Bowl team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford played in just four games for the Broncos in '95,
Shanahan's first year there, after playing 12 in '94.
</P>
<P>
   He was cut during training camp in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me to move to safety, which I did without
hesitation,'' he said. ``I thought I played well in the preseason,
and was going to be a part of the team. It bothered me, but I think
it made me a better man. I wanted to get back to the point to prove
to myself, and to them, that I could play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting 11 games for Arizona in '96, Bradford signed a
two-year contract with the Falcons. The Super Bowl will be his 25th
start in 35 games for Atlanta; injuries have kept him out of 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett has had the best year of his seven-year career,
registering 82 totals tackles, 6.5 sacks, three fumbles forced, and
two recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he can thank Broncos defensive-line coach George Dyer
and defensive coordinator Greg Robinson for moving him from end to
tackle before the '95 season, although it was a disaster at first.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and inexperience were factors as Dronett's starts
dropped from 15 in 1994 to two in '95; his total tackles dropped
from 63 to eight and his sacks from six to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Denver made no attempt to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching TV a month after the season, and I saw they
signed (defensive tackles) Michael Dean Perry and James Jones for
big (money), so _ I was done,'' Dronett said.
</P>
<P>
   He split 1996 with the Falcons and Lions before signing a
two-year contract before this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all worked out,'' Dronett said. ``Not there, but it worked
out.''

 &HT;    OLYMPIC SCANDAL ESCALATES AS SYDNEY OFFICIAL ADMITS OFFERING
MEMBERS MONEY, SECOND IOC MEMBER RESIGNS

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ As top Olympic officials gather here to
cope with the still-growing Salt Lake City bidding scandal, a new
and potentially more perilous controversy surfaced Friday over
allegations of vote-buying in Sydney's campaign for the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian International Olympic Committee member on Friday
admitted to a Sydney newspaper that he offered $70,000 in
inducements to two African IOC members the night before Sydney won
the 2000 Games by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee,
told The Sydney Herald that he offered $35,000 each to the National
Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC
members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, one of the leaders of the Sydney bid, said he offered
the money in the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members
to vote for Sydney. ``I thought it was necessary for us to show our
commitment to those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,''
Coates said. ``My view was that it might encourage them to consider
their votes for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper(CQ), Australia's senior IOC member, acknowledged in
Lausanne that the offer could be seen as a bribe and bring demands
for Sydney to be stripped of the Games. ``I think that's possible
given the narrowness of the margin,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney won the Games in 1993 by narrowly defeating closest rival
Beijing by 45-43 on the final ballot the day after Coates made the
offer. Because the vote is taken in a secret ballot, it is
impossible to determine how the members actually voted.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, an IOC executive board member, said Coates's statements
``lead to the conclusion that he was trying to influence an outcome
even if he didn't put money into the pockets of IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sydney newspaper account, Coates denied the money was a
bribe and said it would go toward helping sport in Kenya and
Uganda. ``You have these developing countries which don't have
sponsors or fund-raising potential,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity to leverage the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the matter would be reviewed by the executive board
this weekend and probably would prompt an IOC investigation.
However, Gosper said he would ask the executive board to first
confirm that Sydney and Salt Lake City -- which is hosting the 2002
Winter Olympics -- would not be stripped of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would bring some stability at a very difficult time,'' he
said. ``Time has moved on, huge investments have been made, people
have certain expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no precedent for the IOC's taking the Games away from a
city once they have been awarded. Such a move could be legally
complicated because of a host of contracts not only between the
Sydney organizing committee and IOC, but between broadcasters and
sponsors of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, as Olympic officials were becoming aware of the
new allegations from Australia, a second IOC member resigned over
allegations related to the Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya delivered his resignation to
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch in person Friday, one day
before a special IOC commission is to conclude its inquiry into the
Salt Lake scandal. More resignations were expected, perhaps before
Saturday morning when the IOC executive board is scheduled to hear
accused IOC members make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gosper and other IOC members were meeting with
Samaranch in his private suite at the Lausanne Palace Hotel. There
was a sense of heightened gravity over the new allegations, which
come as the IOC was trying to get beyond the Salt Lake City crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Sydney's offer were contained in a package of
previously confidential Sydney bid documents released to Australian
news media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The files contained letters outlining the offers dated Sept. 23
, 1993, the date the IOC selected Sydney. The letter to Uganda's
Nyangweso said that ``if Sydney is successful'' the Australian
Olympic Committee would pay $5,000 a year to Uganda's National
Olympic Committee up to and including 2000 to help support the
Uganda National Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney newspaper said the two committees have been receiving
their $5,000 checks yearly as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also disclosed that Coates had written to Mukora
and Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their
way to Monaco for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Salt Lake City scandal, Attarabulsi, an IOC member since
1977, stepped down because of revelations that his son, Suhel,
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham
Young University and a community college, plus $700 a month for
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years
as a member of the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and
for us,'' Samaranch told the Associated Press Friday. ``He's a good
man. He did (make) a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her
ex-husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from Salt
Lake City and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   IOC Director General Francois Carrard told reporters that both
resignations were ``in the higher interest of the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to
Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old IOC president has called a special IOC assembly
here for March 17-18 to vote on expulsions and ratify new
site-selection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his priority is to restore ``the prestige'' of
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has
no intention of
</P>
<P>
   resigning.

   Sydney's campaign questioned
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ As top Olympic officials gather here to
cope with the Salt Lake City bidding scandal, a new and potentially
more perilous controversy is surfacing over allegations of
vote-buying in Sydney's campaign for the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   An Australia IOC member on Friday admitted to a Sydney newspaper
that he offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members
the night before Sydney won the next Olympics by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee, told
The Sydney Herald that he offered $35,000 each to the National
Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC
members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, a leader of the Sydney bid, said he offered the money in
the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members to vote for
Syndey. ``I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment
to those NOCs with a view to winning those votes,'' Coates said.
``My view was that it might encourage them to consider their votes
for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevan Gosper, Australia's senior IOC member, acknowledged in
Lausanne that the offer could be seen as a bribe and bring demands
for Sydney to be stripped of the Games. ``I think that's possible
given the narrowness of the margin,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney won the Games in 1993 by defeating closest rival Beijing
45-43 on the final ballot the day after Coates' offers. Because the
vote is taken in a secret ballot, it is unknown how the members
voted.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, an IOC executive board member, said Coates' statements
``lead to the conclusion that he was trying to influence an outcome
even if didn't put money into the pockets of IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sydney newspaper account, Coates denied the money was a
bribe and said it would go toward helping sport in Kenya and
Uganda. ``You have these developing countries which don't have
sponsors or fund-raising potential,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity to leverage the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the matter would be reviewed by the executive board
this weekend and probably would prompt an IOC investigaion.
However, Gosper said he would ask the executive board to first
confirm thatSydney and Salt Lake City would not be stripped of the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would bring some stability at a very difficult time,'' he
said. ``Time has moved on, huge investments have been made, people
have certain expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no precedent for the IOC taking the Games away from a
city once they have been awarded. Such a move could be legally
complicated because of a host of contracts not only between the
Sydney organizing committee and IOC but between broadcasters and
sponsors of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   As Olympic officials were becoming aware of the new allegations
from Australia, a second IOC member resigned over allegations
related to the Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya delivered his resignation to
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch in person Friday, one day
before a special IOC commission is to conclude its inquiry into the
Salt Lake scandal. More resignations were expected, perhaps before
this morning when the IOC executive board is scheduled to hear
accused IOC members make their case. One of those is Mukora,
implicated in the Austrlian case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gosper and other IOC members met with Samaranch in
his private suite at the Lausanne Palace Hotel. There was a sense
of heightened gravity over the new allegations, which come as the
IOC was trying to get beyond the Salt Lake City crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Sydney's offer were contained in a package of
previously confidential bid documents released to Australian news
media by Coates, who was in Australia and not immediately available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The files contained letters outlining the offers dated Sept. 23
, 1993, the day the IOC selected Sydney. The letter to Nyangweso
said that ``if Sydney is successful'' the Australian Olympic
Committee would pay $5,000 a year to Uganda's National Olympic
Committee up to and including 2000 to help support the Uganda
National Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney newspaper said the two committees have been receiving
their $5,000 checks yearly as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also disclosed that Coates had written to Mukora
and Nyangweso a month before the vote, offering to put them up at
Sydney's expense at the luxury Dorchester Hotel in London on their
way to Monaco for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Salt Lake City scandal, Attarabulsi, an IOC member since
1977, stepped down because of revelations that his son, Suhel,
received tuition to attend an English language center at Brigham
Young University and a community college, plus $700 a month for
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted his resignation and I thanked him for his 22 years
as a member of
</P>
<P>
   the IOC, what he did for sport in his country and for us,''
Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man. He did (make) a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Finland's Pirjo Haeggman became the first IOC casualty of the
scandal when she resigned Tuesday. She was implicated because her
ex-husband got jobs through Olympic bidding committees from Salt
Lake City and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   IOC director general Francois Carrard told reporters that both
resignations were ``in the higher interest of the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said 13 members were implicated in the IOC's
investigation into cash payments, college scholarships, free
medical treatment, lavish gifts and other inducements related to
Salt Lake's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   He has called a special IOC assembly for March 17-18 to vote on
expulsions and ratify new site-selection procedures based on an IOC
investigative report on the Salt Lake situation scheduled to be
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said his priority is to ``restore the prestige'' of
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who has been president since 1980, reiterated he has
no intention of resigning, though U.S. Olympic Committee executive
director Dick Schultz said Friday in New York he senses a ``palace
revolt'' to oust the 78-year-old Spaniard.

 &HT;    Operating in Olympic grey area
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an IOC investigative panel completes its report this
weekend on the Salt Lake City influence-peddling scandal, a portion
will deal with agents, or middlemen, offering to secure votes for
bid cities in exchange for cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   That is outright corruption. But not everyone playing the game
is blatantly soliciting a bribe. Some of the cadre of
well-connected consultants operate in a gray area, selling their
access to the IOC and its influential members in exchange for a
lucrative job with a bid city.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials say they were approached during the
bid process for the 1996 Games by people claiming to be close to
the IOC, including one who sought a $250,000 payment. But none of
the individuals directly suggested an ability to deliver votes. Nor
did Atlanta hire any of the individuals, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   On the $250,000 offer, Andrew Young, who was chairman of the
Atlanta Olympic bid committee, recalled, ``What he said is, 'I'll
answer your phone calls, answer your questions.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Young declined to indentify the person.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gatlin, executive director of the Atlanta bid committee,
confirmed the contact and said it wasn't uncommon to be approached
by ``insiders'' after the group opened an office following the 1988
Seoul Olympics. Atlanta officials never were interested in their
services, Gatlin said, and rarely did it even get to the point
where a fee was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started drifting in, (saying) 'I can do this or that
for you,' `` said Gatlin, later a senior vice president with the
Atlanta organizing committee. ``It wasn't like, 'I will deliver
this item.' It wasn't a clear-cut thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, 'I know what is going on. I've been around this a long
time. I know the individual members and what their interests are.
The things they like. Where they live.' ``
</P>
<P>
   People connected to the Atlanta bid say they also heard from
Goran Takac, son of Artur Takac, an IOC adviser and longtime friend
of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Goran Takac operates
Studio Six, a business near the IOC headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, that has contracted to produce films and books for bid
cities. He also has served as a consultant to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   The books often contain an endorsement from Samaranch, according
to those who have seen them.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Lausanne with the Atlanta bid group in early
1990, Goran Takac approached them about a consulting position,
according to former U.S. Olympic Committee executive director
Harvey Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wanted, like, 18 or 20 grand a month,'' Schiller
said. ``Now, he never made an offer of buying votes or anything. He
just wanted to be a consultant, and we made a decision not to hire
any outside consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Henderson, head of the Toronto bid for the 1996 Games, said
Takac called on his group about putting a ``European flavor'' to
its brochures. He, too, rejected the overture.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC report to be released this weekend makes clear that the
influence-peddling didn't begin with the Salt Lake City bid, but
instead dates back to the early 1980s, involving some bid cities
and IOC members. The report highlights activities of at least two
agents attempting to sell votes to bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official who helped expose the
scandal, has identified Mahmoud El Farnawani as an agent who
offered to sell blocs of votes for money.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani denies Hodler's charge and says that bid cities
hire him to make introductions and help forge relationships with
IOC members from North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake officials acknowledge paying El Farnawani, a former
national volleyball coach in Egypt who now lives outside Toronto,
$58,000 in 1994 for his help in providing access to IOC members. El
Farnawani said he was paid ``about as much'' by Sydney officials in
1992 and 1993 to assist in their successful bid for the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was to introduce those people that I know for a long
time, because of my involvement in sports in Africa before leaving
Egypt in '67 after the six-day war,'' El Farnawani said. ``I was
only introducing the IOC to the bid committee and vice versa -- to
get to see and talk, to know what kind of costumes and habits they
should observe. This way, the IOC is not a complete stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some IOC (members) like me like a brother. So (bid groups)
capitalize on that and ask me to be their (adviser).''
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani, 66, denies any knowledge of tuition payments by
the Salt Lake group for the son of his good friend, Bashir Mohamed
Attarabulsi, the IOC member from Libya who resigned Friday. Suhel
Attarabulsi reportedly attended Brigham Young University for free
and received $700 a month for expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not an agent,'' El Farnawani said, bristling. ``I am an
adviser, a consultant, but I am not selling goods. I am not selling
anybody. I am selling access.''
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani was a volunteer with the unsuccessful Toronto bid
group that missed out on the '96 Games to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was against Atlanta and hated Atlanta,'' said El Farnawani,
who claims that he would have received licensing rights to pins
sold at the Games if Toronto secured the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, a key member of the Atlanta bid committee, said,
``We never ran up against any of these so-called agents,'' but he
acknowleged being aware of El Farnawani's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always assumed he was a guy who was close to these Arab
members. If you've got somebody who could introduce you to
somebody, that is helpful. I never assumed he was delivering
money.''

 &HT;    ScandaBy Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She shopped for kitchen utensils with the Russian Vitaly
Smirnov's wife. She took Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya and
his spouse to Chastain for a Peter, Paul and Mary concert. She
stayed in Agustin Arroyo's house in Ecuador as a guest and welcomed
several others into her own Buckhead home for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As much as anyone who worked to bring the 1996 Summer Games to
Atlanta, Ginger Watkins personally knew many of the 13
International Olympic Committee members known to be under fire for
their alleged involvement in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
Two, including Attarabulsi, have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Watkins, an original member of Atlanta's big group and
later a managing director for ACOG, nor any others associated with
the city's Olympic efforts who were interviewed this week cited any
unethical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said she considered many of them ``above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did they not come to Atlanta with their hands out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there was a naivete about all of us that made us less
approachable,'' she said. ``Sometimes that works in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant media reports about the accused 13 have rekindled
memories within Atlanta's inner Olympic circle.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins remembered Pirjo Haeggman of Finland, the first IOC
member to step down this week, as ``easy to relate to. She was a
mother, an athlete, and so you could talk to her about her
children.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled Attarabulsi's wife wearing to Chastain ``the
cultural costume (of Libya) the whole time. It was 110 degrees and
she's completely covered.''
</P>
<P>
   And Watkins reminisced about Raquel Arroyo's love of singing.
``Any time music was played anywhere, she would get up and sing,''
she said. ``She did it in restaurants in Atlanta; she did it
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gatlin, the bid commitee's paid executive director, said of
Arroyo, ``If you were ever at a party or you ever had a party, he
was there.'' He described Attarabulsi as ``one of the nicest guys
on the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Guirandoun'Diaye of the Ivory Coast was a natty dresser
(who smoked) big cigars,'' said Gatlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed those people,'' recalled Charlie Battle, a former
attorney who was the Atlanta bid committee's primary international
emissary. ``I sort of characterize some of them as rogues. They are
colorful characters.''
</P>
<P>
   But not crooks, Battle added. Not even corrupt opportunists. He
described Attarabulsi as ``the nicest man in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne, a former attorney who headed the bid effort and the
Atlanta Games, said he's ``wracked my brain'' trying to think of
inappropriate requests from any IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get 100 people from 70 different cultures of the
world who are coming here to make a decision on whether they like
you and are going to vote for you,'' he said, ``you have a
predictable percentage that don't like their hotel room, there's
too much noise on the floor, they don't like the person who drove
them around.''
</P>
<P>
   But did any want scholarships? A free liposuction? Cash in a
brown paper bag?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember people saying I want muslin sheets and
the following liquors in my hotel room,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta did engage in gift-giving, though perhaps not to the
extent as the Dutch when Amsterdam was trying to win the 1992
Summer Games. They
</P>
<P>
   gave various IOC members diamonds, expensive porcelain,
paintings and exclusive art books, along with trips to exclusive
(and legal) brothels in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's gifts tended toward the personal. A copy of the movie
``Gone With the Wind'' for one. A carved walking stick for another.
A print of a building at Amherst, the alma mater of Prince Albert
of Monaco. ``That was a lot more important than a diamond necklace
or a leather suitcase,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Battle mentioned the day his wife, Lola, took one IOC member's
wife shopping for linens. They were billed to Mrs. Battle's credit
card. ``But that night, the guy gave me $400 in cash or whatever it
was,'' Battle recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you do get in an awkward position vis-a-vis
hospitality,'' he said. ``But that's just a question of trying to
be nice and how far do you extend it. We certainly never felt any
pressure to give anyone any money.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sibandze of Swaziland was treated for heart problems at
Piedmont Hospital, a courtesy that is similar to some accusations
against the Salt Lake group for offering medical care. But the
Atlantans take the position that if a guest gets sick during a
visit, you take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin remembered Sibandze as traveling with a large entourage
of family and friends. ``He probably cost more in airplane tickets
than anybody,'' Gatlin said. ``If people wanted to dig, he was less
of a noble-seeming chartacter than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne placed a few phone calls to his alma mater, the University
of Georgia, to help get Smirnov's stepson into school but said no
one with the Atlanta group paid his way.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin said he can understand why some IOC members accepted
scholarships from Salt Lake officials for their relatives. ``They
want their kids to get an education,'' he said, adding that he
knows of no IOC members asking Atlanta for free schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking IOC member linked to the Salt Lake scandal
is Kim Un-Yong, a member of the executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that he's on the list,'' Battle said. ``He
was very nice and helpful to us during the Seoul Games. I always
felt good about him supporting us. He knew a lot about Georgia. He
trained at Fort Benning.''

SICILIAN PROBER OF STOLEN ART FACES INQUIRY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Sicilian magistrate, who has spent the last two decades
vigorously prosecuting grave-robbers who excavate antiquities for
illcit smuggling abroad, now faces an inquiry that he himself has
been involved in the illegal antiquities trade.
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Raffiotta, the magistrate in the province of Enna in
central Sicily, is under investigation by a magistrate in the
Catania province, according to Saturday's Italy Today section in
the Italian edition of the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Raffiotta said they were dumbfounded at the
investigation given his record. They suggested that the numerous
enemies he has made by curbing the illicit trade are now seeking to
embarrass or destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Raffiotta, for nearly a decade, has been preparing a legal case
against the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, collecting
evidence the museum in the early 1980s acquired, for $2.74 million,
a collection of dazzling 3d Century B.C. Hellenistic silver. The
horde, according to an affadavit by graverobber Giusseppe Mascara
and work done by American archeologists, was illegally excavated at
the partially excavated ruins of Morgantina, the last Greek
city-state in Sicily to fall to the Romans in 211 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has rebuffed Italian demands to return the silver.
</P>
<P>
   Raffiotta, an amateur archeologist, has written two books about
the archeological site, which a Princeton team stumbled upon when
Raffiotta was a boy growing up in nearby Aidone.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the magistrate created new adversaries, politically
powerful construction companies that want to build a dam, which
Raffiotta has stopped because its construction would destroy an
archeological site.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the inquiry became public Friday, he blocked a sale
of ancient coins, including the most remarkable coin ever minted at
Morgantina, said Malcolm Bell, a US archeologist who directs the
four-decade-long official dig at Morgantina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe there is anything to this investigation,''
Carla Antonaccio, a classical archeologist at Wesleyan University
who is co-director of the Morgantina excavation. ``Silvio Raffiotta
is a man of total integrity, and totally dedicated to stopping this
sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From Italian press accounts, it was unclear Friday what
Raffiotta is under investigation for. The disclosure, however,
follows the arrest in Catania in December of a collector and two
university professors for illegally selling ancient artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Hoving, a former Metropolitan director who was
involved in the Morgantina dig as a Princeton graduate student in
the 1950s, said Friday: ``Even in Sicily, this investigation
doesn't ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How great an actor he would have to be, to spend his whole
career courageously pursuing the looters, while secretly involved
with them. He is not an actor, but a prosecutor.''

SENATOR OFFERS PROPOSAL TO CHANGE MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Higher-income Medicare beneficiaries would have to
pay higher premiums under proposals outlined Friday by Sen. John
Breaux, the chairman of a bipartisan commission seeking ways to
avert a financial crisis in the health-insurance program for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message on Tuesday, President Clinton
proposed using some of the federal budget surplus for Medicare.
Breaux, D-La., said this would help shore up Medicare but would not
solve its long-term financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission plans to meet on Tuesday and is to
submit final recommendations to the president and Congress by March
1. Breaux's proposals are the text from which the panel will work,
and he said he thought he could get the necessary 11 votes on the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his proposal would transform Medicare into an arena
for competition between the fee-for-service federal program and
dozens of private health plans. Instead of paying separately for
each medical service, the government would offer a fixed amount of
money to each beneficiary to buy insurance, and the original
Medicare program would be one option among many.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said that private health plans would have to offer
benefits at least equivalent to those offered in the government-run
program. A new federal agency, the Medicare Board, would be
established to supervise and negotiate with the private health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Federal payments to health plans would be set through
competitive bidding, Breaux said. Health plans would submit bids to
the Medicare Board, and the government would pay a fixed percentage
of the average premium charged by all plans participating in
Medicare. The government's contribution would have a limit, and
beneficiaries would pay costs above that limit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Breaux said, ``higher-income Medicare beneficiaries
should be required to pay a larger share of their Medicare premiums
than moderate- and low-income beneficiaries.'' The extra revenue
would subsidize the premiums of low-income beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The eligibility age for Medicare would be increased to 67 from
65, over 24 years, from 2003 to 2027.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy at the
American Association of Retired Persons, said of the proposal: ``It
could be positive for beneficiaries, or it could be negative,
depending on how it's structured. We don't have enough details,
enough numbers, to know.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge the impact on consumers, Rother said, it is necessary
to know how much of the average premium they will pay.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux bristled at suggestions that he was proposing a
``voucher'' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A voucher just says to somebody, `Here's X amount of money, go
find yourself a health plan,''' Breaux said. ``My proposal uses the
strength of the federal government to negotiate on behalf of people
so they can get the best deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said that Medicare's financial problems were more urgent
than those of Social Security.

illcit smuggling abroad, now faces an inquiry that he himself has
been involved in the illegal antiquities trade.
</P>
<P>
   Silvio Raffiotta, the magistrate in the province of Enna in
central Sicily, is under investigation by a magistrate in the
Catania province, according to Saturday's Italy Today section in
the Italian edition of the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Raffiotta said they were dumbfounded at the
investigation given his record. They suggested that the numerous
enemies he has made by curbing the illicit trade are now seeking to
embarrass or destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Raffiotta, for nearly a decade, has been preparing a legal case
against the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, collecting
evidence the museum in the early 1980s acquired, for $2.74 million,
a collection of dazzling 3d Century B.C. Hellenistic silver. The
horde, according to an affadavit by graverobber Giusseppe Mascara
and work done by American archeologists, was illegally excavated at
the partially excavated ruins of Morgantina, the last Greek
city-state in Sicily to fall to the Romans in 211 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has rebuffed Italian demands to return the silver.
</P>
<P>
   Raffiotta, an amateur archeologist, has written two books about
the archeological site, which a Princeton team stumbled upon when
Raffiotta was a boy growing up in nearby Aidone.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the magistrate created new adversaries, politically
powerful construction companies that want to build a dam, which
Raffiotta has stopped because its construction would destroy an
archeological site.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the inquiry became public Friday, he blocked a sale
of ancient coins, including the most remarkable coin ever minted at
Morgantina, said Malcolm Bell, a US archeologist who directs the
four-decade-long official dig at Morgantina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe there is anything to this investigation,''
Carla Antonaccio, a classical archeologist at Wesleyan University
who is co-director of the Morgantina excavation. ``Silvio Raffiotta
is a man of total integrity, and totally dedicated to stopping this
sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From Italian press accounts, it was unclear Friday what
Raffiotta is under investigation for. The disclosure, however,
follows the arrest in Catania in December of a collector and two
university professors for illegally selling ancient artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Hoving, a former Metropolitan director who was
involved in the Morgantina dig as a Princeton graduate student in
the 1950s, said Friday: ``Even in Sicily, this investigation
doesn't ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How great an actor he would have to be, to spend his whole
career courageously pursuing the looters, while secretly involved
with them. He is not an actor, but a prosecutor.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)  
 (af)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address and, again, before a roaring
crowd in Buffalo, N.Y., President Clinton last week floated the
idea of Universal Savings Accounts, a new type of subsidized
savings for low- and moderate-income workers akin to a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The government would use 11 percent of the projected budget
surplus to match money the workers would save on their own in the
USAs.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the plan appears designed to appeal to both
political parties. It is intended to help workers at the low end of
the spectrum who now have only Social Security at retirement. That
should appeal to Democrats. For Republicans, there is the draw that
these accounts would be controlled by individuals, not the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the president's plan will get bipartisan support, or any
support at all, is unknown. Right now, the USA proposal is high in
concept and low in details, and the administration says it will not
have more specifics for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, both liberal and conservative economists say
they find such accounts an intriguing way to increase the savings
rate. They also say the proposal is another volley in a larger
debate about investing government retirement funds in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, basic questions remain. Is this the best way to spend
part of the budget surplus? How would the matching formula work?
What can the savings accounts be used for? How may the money be
invested? And will the public support a new government program that
redistributes wealth to lower-income citizens?
</P>
<P>
   ``These accounts are still a very nebulous concept,'' said Steve
Moore, director of fiscal policies at the Cato Institute, a
free-market research group in Washington. ``I like the idea of
setting up savings accounts. We want to create a culture of savings
in this country. But it's bad in the way it's done. It looks more
like a new entitlement program than an IRA. I don't see the
rationale of creating a new income distribution program.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The administration envisions the program, which would cost
nearly $500 billion over 15 years, or $33 billion a year, as
offering $100 grants to workers to start accounts. The government
would then match workers' contributions at a variable rate based on
income. About 100 million Americans who earn less than $80,000 to
$100,000 a year _ the precise cutoff has not been set _ would be
eligible for the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is to get more people to do more saving on
their own,'' said an administration spokesman. ``There are so many
things to help the rich save. We think there is a big hole in
savings at the low end.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 41 percent of all workers earn less than $15,000 a
year; of those, only 8 percent have a retirement program at their
workplaces, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute,
a Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   The match rate for the new accounts would be progressive, with
the lowest-paid getting the most. The investment options would be
modeled closely after the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan,
which offers three government-run investment funds _ a stock index
fund, a bond index fund and a Treasury bill fund.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the administration said a worker earning $40,000 a
year could deposit up to $600 a year. At that income level the
government would match 50 cents on the dollar, providing $300 more
to the account. Counting the $100 starting grant, that comes to
$1,000 in the first year, $400 of it from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Thompson, a Washington representative for Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., the nation's largest broker, praised the plan as ``opening the
door to private investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill and other Wall Street firms would prefer that the
government use a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to
finance the accounts, rather than using the budget surplus, and
would like the program to be open to workers of all income levels.
Thompson said he was concerned about how the accounts would be
financed when the budget surplus ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather see all people given the option of investing a
portion of their payroll taxes, maybe one or two percentage points,
in accounts that would be similar to IRAs, and invest that money
however they see fit,'' Thompson said. This idea is similar to one
proposed by some Republicans as an alternative to Clinton's plan to
strengthen Social Security by allowing the government to invest in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other sellers of investments had little to say, for the moment.
``We don't have enough information to judge yet,'' said John
Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, the
trade association for the mutual fund industry. In general, brokers
and mutual fund companies want the opportunity to sell investment
products to USAs, but worry that a program restricted to
lower-income people would result in many small accounts with low
balances, which are costly for brokers to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, wants to
see the funds less restricted in another way: what savings can be
used for. ``Done right, USA accounts are a very good idea,'' Aaron
said, but the money should be available for more than just
retirement _ education, medical care, down payments on first homes
and and business start-ups, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a device to help make savings fashionable and
educate people on the power of compound interest,'' he said, adding
that USAs are much ``sweeter'' for lower-income people than are
individual retirement accounts, which offer only a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research group, also reacted favorably to the plan,
though with reservations. ``I'm not sure what these accounts offer
that isn't already out there in the market,'' Mitchell said. ``I
like that Clinton recognizes that private investment is the key.
But it will not succeed unless we put a chunk of the payroll taxes
into it, because the poor will not be able to build up a good
balance. They cannot use disposable income for this because they
don't have enough.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ For those who have given up on President
Clinton's question of ``what the definition of is, is,'' the
conflict in Kosovo presents another linguistic and
politically-loaded question: what is a massacre?
</P>
<P>
   The word almost got chief Kosovo Verification Mission monitor
William Walker expelled from Yugoslavia, after the US ambassador
accused the Serbs of massacring 45 ethnic Albanians, who were found
on Jan. 16 dressed in civilian clothes and scattered on a muddy
hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the bodies, which included those of three women and
a 12-year-old boy, were mutilated and shot at close range in the
head or neck, suggesting a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say the Racak villagers were killed in gunfire after
Serb police went to the town to look for members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, an Albanian group bent on independence for the
Serbian province of Kosovo, under suspicion of killing Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   The people were shot dead in the ensuing violence, but this just
makes them a lot of dead people lying in one place _ not victims of
a massacre, the Serbs insist.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish forensics experts set to work Friday on examining the
corpses strewn at the Racak site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what the definition of a massacre is,''
Walker told reporters Friday at the well-guarded Organization for
the Security and Cooperation in Europe's office in Pristina, the
capital of troubled southern Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was celebrating his first day as an unmarked man, hours
after Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
unconditionally freeze the order expelling the diplomat. The U.S.
ambassador had been declared ``persona non grata'' by the Serbs
after accusing them of the Racak carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Walker's comments _ and the negotiations
with Milosevic that followed it _ had the effect of making the
gruesome discovery more about Walker than about the question of
what happened to the people found shot dead in a gully.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, warned that NATO might strike over his failure to
comply with an October cease-fire agreement, was under heightened
threat because of his decision to expel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic agreed early Friday to let Walker stay, the
threat of a NATO strike eased, although world officials said it
remains pending on the Serb leader's cooperation with a cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Western and Russian diplomats approved a peace plan for
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo even as NATO continued to build up
military forces and warned Milosevic he hasn't done enough yet to
remove its threat of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted by US envoy Christopher Hill, was approved by
the six-nation Contact Group for former Yugoslavia, and will be
presented separately next week to Milosevic and ethnic Albanians
fighting for independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers of the Contact Group, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, are expected to meet in London next
Friday to issue formal invitations to peace negotiations.

 &HT;    Paragon to pay Proctor &AMP; Gamble, ending 5-year patent dispute
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Diaper maker Paragon Trade Brands of Norcross ended
its five-year fight Friday against Proctor &AMP; Gamble's claims of
patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement essentially calls for Paragon to pay licensing
fees to Proctor &AMP; Gamble to use the diaper patent in question. It
also means Paragon will have to pay an unspecified amount of a
December 1997 judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon reached an agreement in principle with the
Cincinnati-based consumer products giant as part of its Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization. The lengthy dispute centers around P&AMP;G's
so-called leakproof diapers. Paragon filed for bankruptcy
protection in January 1998, a week after a Delaware judge ordered
the company to pay $178.4 million for infringing on P&AMP;G's patents.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action ``provides the basis for resolution of all of
P&AMP;G's claims,'' Paragon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement are still being worked out and are
expected to be released within a few weeks, the companies said.
Procter &AMP; Gamble said it expects to get millions of dollars from
licensing fees and the December 1997 judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Proctor &AMP; Gamble, maker of Pampers and Luvs, and Kimberly-Clark,
maker of Huggies, together account for 74 percent of the $3.6
billion annual disposable baby diaper market. Paragon, with 1997
sales of about $560 million, has 74 percent of the store brand
market.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, while a costly one for Paragon, clears the way
for the company to try to emerge from bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased we could get to this point,'' said Alan
Cyron, Paragon's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cyron said he hopes the company can emerge from bankruptcy by
the end of the year. The settlement must be approved by the
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$4, up $1.37 1/2, or 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``assures Proctor &AMP; Gamble will receive
compensation for its diaper technologies. Paragon will join
virtually every other competitor of ours in licensing these
technologies,'' Proctor &AMP; Gamble spokesman Scott Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon must still resolve similar infringement claims with
Kimberly-Clark, which had asked for as much as $2.3 billion.
Paragon officials said they believe ``considerable progress'' has
been made in that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in discusions with Paragon,'' Kimberly-Clark
spokesperson Tina Barry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon was spun off from Weyerhauser in January 1993. Its
chairman is Bobby Abraham, a former Weyerhauser executive. The
company has 1,300 employees in the United States and Canada. About
200 of those workers are at the company's headquarters on
Technology Parkway near Jimmy Carter Boulevard. It has plants in
Macon, Waco, Texas, Gaffney, S.C., Harmony, Pa., and Brampton,
Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Paragon makes premium and economy disposable diapers, training
pants, and feminine care and adult incontinence products sold in
the United States in Canada mostly in grocery and food stores, mass
merchandisers, warehouse clubs, toy stores and drug stores under
the stores' brand names. The company also has joint ventures in
Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and China to sell diapers and other
absorbent personal care products.

ANALYSTS QUESTION CLINTON BUDGET SURPLUS FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They called it the Rosy Scenario, the upbeat
economic forecast that President Reagan conjured to show that the
nation could afford to cut taxes while building up the military.
According to Democrats, the Republican president was cooking the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, President Clinton laid out projections of an equally
rosy economy, one that can support massive expenditures on Social
Security, Medicare, defense, and education. The White House said it
is banking on the booming economy to produce budget surpluses over
the next 15 years of $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   That is a huge number, greater than the combined value of the
French, British, and German economies this year. At its current
pace, Ford Motor Co. would need 35 years to sell $4.4 trillion
worth of cars. It is enough money to fund the entire federal
government for 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an unrealistic number, say some budget analysts, who
believe Clinton has brought his own spin to the old rosy scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something of a fantasy number,'' said Cynthia Latta,
chief US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington, Mass.
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleight of hand,'' said Stan Collender, who heads the federal
budget group at Fleishman-Hillard, a consulting firm. ``This is as
close to a budget gimmick as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally notable to some analysts was that, unlike in Reagan's
days, no lawmakers challenged the president on his forecast.
Republicans are promoting an income-tax cut as well as more
spending for Social Security, and they pretty much signed onto
Clinton's numbers, which he released as part of his State of the
Union address Tuesday. ``What's really been astounding is how
quickly everyone bought into that $4.4 trillion _ both sides,
Republican and Democrat,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director for
the Concord Coalition, the balanced-budget advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that the budget battle this year will focus less
on whether big surpluses will actually materialize than on how to
spend them. With both parties agreeing to devote most of the
surplus to Social Security, their major difference is whether the
remainder should go to tax cuts, as Republicans want, or to fixing
financial problems in the Medicare health insurance program, a top
Clinton priority.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all economists agree that a season of surpluses is at
hand, but not all are ready to say the good times will last for 15
years. So far, the White House has not revealed the economic
assumptions behind its own predictions. A test of their validity
will come Jan. 29, when economists who work for Congress release
their next forecast, which could either support or contradict the
president's figures.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said that it assumes the economy will grow
by slightly more than 2 percent each year, which is well in line
with forecasts by private-sector economists. In past years, Clinton
has assumed about 2 percent growth while the economy actually grew
by better than 3 percent, ``but we continue to use 2 percent to
allow for ups and downs in the economy,'' a White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a mainstream view of economic growth, at least,
Clinton's forecast stands in contrast to Reagan's, which were
criticized for predicting an outright economic boom. In the most
famous ``rosy scenario'' of 1981, for example, Reagan held that his
tax cuts would jolt the economy into growth above 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts said that Clinton's numbers were still
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, they said, Clinton is likely assuming that he and
Congress will resist the temptation to spend most of the surplus,
retaining the current caps that limit how much they can spend on
various government programs. ``With a budget, it's hard to predict
what will happen more than three or four years out,'' Latta said.
``You're going to have a new president, a new Congress, and you
don't know what they'll do about taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, relatively little of the surplus will turn up in the
early years of the forecast. According to a White House aide, more
than half of the total surplus, or $2.3 trillion, would come in the
last five years of the 15-year forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Budget hawks complain that framing the numbers this way gives
Congress license to spend money now that will not arrive until well
in the future -- if at all. ``Why don't they use a five-year
forecast? Because that doesn't get them the money that they need,''
said Collender. ``Using a 15-year forecast is political
accommodation, not economic fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, critics of the Clinton forecast say that long-term
projections are unreliable. Until the last few years, Congress most
often produced five-year forecasts, Collender said. Even now it
usually does not try to look beyond a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough trouble projecting budget numbers one or two
years in advance,'' said Bixby. ``By 15 years out, you're just in
fantasy-land.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution,
illustrated the uncertainties of long-term budget projections by
citing a forecast that congressional economists issued in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead one decade, the Congressional Budget Office that
year foresaw a federal budget deficit for the year 2005 of over
$400 billion. By 1998, the office was predicting a surplus for 2005
of $100 billion -- a swing of a half-trillion dollars for one year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone takes an uncharitable view of Clinton's attempt to
draw a long-term view of the economy. After all, the president made
his forecast as part of an attempt to shore up Social Security,
which faces serious financial problems in 14 years and could become
insolvent in 33 years. Social Security's own managers try to plan
75 years into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things to say these numbers,'' Gary Bass,
executive director of the budget watchdog group OMB Watch, said of
Clinton's forecast. ``One is, they're never right. The second is,
these numbers are as good as any.'' The lack of outcry from
Repubicans, he said, shows that Clinton's forecast has more
credibility than did Reagan's ``rosy scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Bixby of the Concord Coalition called Clinton's
numbers ``overly cheerful,'' he found something in them that even a
budget-hawk could love.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would use more than half of the surplus to pay off what
the nation owes to future Social Security retirees, reducing
federal debt held by the public. ``That part is very fiscally
responsible,'' Bixby said.

CLINTON OUTLINES PLANS TO FIGHT UNCONVENTIONAL TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to muster public support for a large
increase in federal spending to defend against unconventional
terrorist attack, President Clinton appeared Friday with top
government health and law enforcement officials to announce steps
to strengthen domestic defenses against biological, chemical and
computer warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at the National Academy of Sciences, Clinton said
that terrorists with computer skills and access to chemical and
biological agents had extended the field of battle from physical
space to cyberspace and from land, sea and air to the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Department of Health and Human Services was
being enlisted in the battle against domestic terrorism, expanding
its disease-fighting role into a national security mission. The
agency will be charged with developing and stockpiling vaccines and
treatments against chemical and germ weapons and with mobilizing
public health agencies to respond to any suspected attack of
infectious agents.
</P>
<P>
   The president's actions mark a significant expansion of federal
involvement in efforts to respond to threats that officials say are
quickly moving from the realm of science fiction to reality.
Clinton said that defenses against unconventional threats had
failed to keep pace with the speed of development of new kinds of
weapons of terror, weapons that can be developed in a clandestine
laboratory and transported in a briefcase or sent through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The president also warned that a talented hacker with a desktop
computer and a modem could now threaten the nation's military,
banking, communications, power, transportation and water networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know the fight against terrorism is far from over,
and now terrorists seek new tools of destruction,'' Clinton told an
audience of government officials and scientists Friday. ``The
enemies of peace realize they cannot defeat us with traditional
military means, so they are working on two new forms of assault
which you've heard about today: cyberattacks on our critical
computer systems, and attacks with weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological, potentially even nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The president sought to increase awareness of emerging threats
without raising undue alarm about events that have yet to
materialize on American soil. He said the government would assure
civil liberties even as it organizes its military, intelligence,
criminal justice and public health agencies to respond to the
threat of biological or computer terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cause for panic,'' Clinton said Friday. ``It is
essential that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty.
We can prevail over terrorism by drawing on the very best in our
free society: the skill and courage of our troops, the genius of
our scientists and engineers, the strength of our factory workers,
the determination and talents of our public servants, the vision of
leaders in every vital sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan devotes $2.8 billion to prepare for attacks
with exotic weapons and to combat computer warfare threats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the administration has virtually
doubled the funds devoted to protecting Americans against attacks
with unconventional weapons. The president's 2000 budget proposal
allocates $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the total are $683 million to train emergency
workers in U.S. cities to cope with a chemical attack or an
outbreak of bioterrorism; $206 million to protect government
facilities; $381 million for research on pathogens, development of
vaccines and therapies, technology to detect and diagnosis rare
illnesses, and decontamination of affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also requesting $87 million, a 23 percent
increase over current spending, to improve the nation's public
health surveillance system to better detect the outbreak of an
epidemic and determine if it is an act of nature or of deliberate
terror.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes $52 million to continue to build a
national stockpile of specialized medicines to protect civilians
against attack by germ agents such as anthrax, smallpox or
pneumonic plague. The administration also is seeking to triple
spending, to $24 million, to create 25 new urban medical response
teams in major U.S. cities. At present, only four cities _ Miami,
Denver, Washington and Charlotte _ have teams prepared to respond
to a biological or chemical weapons emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all here talking about a kind of scenario that we hope
that our citizens never have to confront, but the point is to be
prepared,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services, who appeared with Clinton Friday. ``This is the first
time in American history in which the public health system has been
integrated directly into the national security system.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the president's proposal is an intensified
effort to protect the nation's critical, computer-based
infrastructure _ from power grids to firefighting networks. Such
defenses have seen a 40 percent spending increase in the past two
years, from slightly less than $1 billion in 1998 to the more than
$1.46 being sought for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money will go to the Pentagon for development of
systems that detect unauthorized intrusion into sensitive computer
networks. The administration also proposes to spend $500 million
for research on preventing efforts by computer hackers to disrupt
and damage government and private information networks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration budget proposal also includes money to create
a ``cyber corps,'' a cadre of computer security experts who can
respond to a computer crisis. The White House said it would spend
several million dollars next year to begin to design a program to
train and recruit computer science students as a counter-hacker
squad.
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers appear small given the government's huge
budget, administration officials noted Friday that the money would
significantly accelerate research on biological weapons agents and
the means to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the initiatives unveiled Friday do not include the
$4.5 billion over the next five years that the administration will
soon request for converting Russian defense industries,
safeguarding its nuclear stockpiles, and dismantling its chemical
and germ facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said he was pleased that Clinton was
devoting attention and money to a problem he has sought to
publicize for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has been the one to take the initiative on the issue,
while the Clinton administration has largely ignored these
threats,'' said Weldon, chairman of the research and development
subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. ``It's good to
see that the president has finally come around; better late than
never.''

WEST VIRGINIAN SENATOR, ROBERT BYRD, TO LEAD EFFORT FOR DISMISSAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton picked up a key ally in his
effort to end the Senate impeachment trial Friday as lawyers
sparred over the evidence in an unusual question-and-answer
session.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., announced that he would lead the
effort to dismiss the case Monday. Byrd, a stickler for Senate
rules and procedure, said he is convinced that Clinton's critics
will never get the two-thirds majority to force the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have also become convinced that lengthening this trial will
only prolong and deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect
that this sorry affair has visited upon our nation,'' he said in
disclosing his intention to offer a dismissal motion.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's decision was significant because the conservative
lawmaker had been considered a possible vote for impeachment. The
81-year-old senator, a former Ku Klux Klan member who loves to
quote leaders from ancient history, has little in common with the
baby-boomer president whose affair with a 22-year-old White House
intern led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd distanced himself from Clinton before the trial started by
sternly warning White House officials to avoid lobbying lawmakers.
When Clinton invited loyal Democrats to the White House after the
Dec. 19 House impeachment vote, Byrd called the pep rally ``an
egregious display of shameless arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans moved quickly Friday to try to blunt the impact of
Byrd's announcement, dispatching Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas to make
the case against dismissal at a hastily arranged news conference.
The other Texas senator, Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, also
opposes Byrd's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a system of justice where we render a verdict
first and then we get the facts,'' Gramm said, predicting that the
Senate will defeat Byrd's motion. ``We shouldn't judge whether or
not to follow a constitutional process based on how people are
likely to vote at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead House prosecutor, used a
similar argument in pleading with senators to reject the dismissal
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know _ oh do I know _ what an annoyance we are in the bosom
of this great body,'' he said. ``But we're a constitutional
annoyance, and I would remind you of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also asserted that dismissal would send ``a terrible
message.'' The impeachment articles accuse Clinton of perjury and
obstruction of justice in his efforts to hide his illicit affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying, I guess, perjury is OK if it's about sex.
Obstruction is OK. ...,'' Hyde said, noting that judges have been
impeached for perjury. ``This country can survive with a few bad
judges, a few corrupt judges. We can make it. But a corrupt
president? Survival is a little tougher there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the dismissal motion Monday, along with
a Republican alternative that would permit prosecutors to call
witnesses before the Senate renders a verdict in the case. The
deciding votes may not come until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in flux right now,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. Although Hatch said he has ``heard an occasional Republican
say that they might consider'' dismissal, no GOP senator publicly
endorsed Byrd's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate, meaning that
Democrats need at least six Republican votes to throw out the
impeachment case. Clinton's critics expressed confidence that they
have the votes to block dismissal, while conceding that they remain
short of the two-thirds majority _ 67 votes _ to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Hutchison said she will lead a
bipartisan effort to open the Senate's deliberations to the public
when and if lawmakers debate the two impeachment articles. Senate
rules require all impeachment deliberations to be held privately,
but lawmakers can vote to waive the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-week-old trial moved into a new phase Friday as senators
got a chance to submit written inquiries to lawyers for both sides.
In a proceeding that had some of the trappings of a deadly serious
game show, Democrats and Republicans took turns lobbing softball
questions to whichever legal team echoed their views.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a group of Republican senators asked prosecutors
if a White House argument was ``just a red herring.'' Prosecutors
agreed that it was.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a few unscripted exchanges. White House lawyer
Charles Ruff looked in vain for someone on Clinton's team to
explain why the president sought advice from pollster Dick Morris
when the sex scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find any volunteers,'' Ruff said to bipartisan
laughter. ``I think the honest answer has two pieces to it: I don't
have a clue, and ... it seems to me of absolutely no relevance
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the combatants adopted the time-honored tactic of
answering questions that had not been asked to drive home their
points.
</P>
<P>
   When a Democrat asked if prosecutors would impeach Clinton for
any criminal act, including driving while intoxicated, Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., delivered an impassioned plea for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know what he was up to. His political and legal
interests are so paramount in his mind, the law be damned. And
anybody that got in his way be damned,'' Graham said, comparing
Clinton's actions to the Watergate scandal that led to Richard
Nixon's resignation in 1974. ``We need to try this case, ladies and
gentlemen, because you need to know who your president is.''

INVESTORS WITH INTERNET FEVER MAY SOON HAVE COLD SWEATS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Nichols, a 22-year-old management major at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, put more than $1,500 of his student loan
money in a mutual fund investing exclusively in high-flying
Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shalin Madan, 23, left his job as an accountant at State Street
Bank in San Francisco to become a full-time ``day trader,'' moving
his money frantically in and out of stocks like America Online,
Amazon.com and Yahoo, often every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jill McKinney, a 27-year-old employee of Silicon Investor, an
Internet site devoted to technology stocks, recently got an excited
recommendation from a taxi driver in Seattle to invest in
Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   As such delirium has spread, Internet stocks have soared. Shares
of newly public companies like Marketwatch.com and Theglobe.com
have risen threefold or fourfold in a day; more established
companies like Yahoo or Amazon.com have more than doubled in the
last three months. Marketwatch.com now sports a market value of
nearly $950 million _ bigger than such established companies as
Reebok, Polaroid and Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, a bit of the air leaked out of what many Wall
Street pros call the Internet bubble, with some high fliers, like
Amazon and America Online, falling sharply from recent highs. And
while most of the stocks are still ahead for the year, many
analysts are warning of a steep decline that could rattle the wider
market.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Internet fever has spread in recent months to
technology companies and an even broader swath of the market. And
it leaves investors in 401(k) plans and mutual funds who have not
bought into companies with dot.com after their names increasingly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The latest warning about an Internet selloff comes from Barton
Biggs, a Morgan Stanley strategist, who has been bearish on the
market for some time. ``I promise you, like all bubbles, this
bubble will come to a very bad end,'' he said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, it is not just Amazon and Broadcast that will
suffer. Pension and fund managers who are worried about the high
prices of Internet stocks or who are having trouble buying large
stakes in these small companies have driven up the stock prices of
companies like Cisco Systems, which builds equipment that connects
computers to the Internet, and Oracle, whose database software is
used by many online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Even more cautious fund managers have turned to companies like
Walt Disney, CBS and Sotheby's that have only the most tangential
connections to the Internet. When Disney unveiled its Internet
joint venture, Go Network, earlier this month, investors bid up
Disney's market value by $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While valuations of Internet stocks remain in the stratosphere,
those of technology stocks have doubled in the last three months.
And those of broad market indicators like the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index have leapt by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The prices of Internet stocks have risen so high so fast that
even analysts enthusiastic about the Internet's long-term effect on
the economy have warned that prices in the entire sector are likely
to fall more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp, widespread decline would cause headaches for regulators
and could cause problems for many on-line investors, who dominate
the trading in many Internet stocks. Already, a group of senior
officials from several big Nasdaq trading firms has met to discuss
recent volatility among the Internet stocks, virtually all of which
trade on the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Several brokerage firms have acted to squelch speculative
trading by restricting online transactions. Among other things,
they have made it more difficult to borrow to buy Internet stocks
and put certain limitations on initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But all this has done little to damp the enthusiasm of investors
like Madan, whose passion is simply an extension of a love of all
things digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gold mine,'' Madan said. ``The Internet stocks are the
epitome of the `90s. They're a reflection of what is going on in
the stock market. It's just more extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's initial public offering of Marketwatch.com, which
provides financial data to Internet sites, was one of the hottest
ever. The shares were initially offered to select investors at $17,
but public trading opened on Jan. 15 at $90. The stock finished the
first day at $97.50 but has since fallen to $80.50. That means most
investors who bought after trading began have suffered losses, as
have recent arrivals to most Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marketwatch, nearly every Internet company sports an
outsized valuation. America Online is worth more than half the
companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. Yahoo is valued
higher than Eastman Kodak. And the market value of Amazon.com
exceeds the combined value of Barnes &AMP; Noble, Nordstrom and
Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hoey, chief economist at Dreyfus Corp., recalls that a
similar frenzy for computer stocks emerged in the summer of 1983,
about the time the personal computer was introduced. But few of the
favorites then _ like Prime Computer and Coleco _ are around today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm over the growth of technology as an industry
was very well founded,'' Hoey said. ``But we learned that today's
hot stock is not necessarily a long-term winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by market values, though, few Internet stock prices
reflect the possibility of failure. Consider Broadcast.com, which
offers audio and video from 345 radio stations and 17 television
stations, as well as its own coverage, over the Internet. The
company has a market value of $2.33 billion. That amounts to $9.3
million for each of its 250 employees _ a Wall Street benchmark for
valuing Internet companies, which rarely have earnings and
sometimes not even revenues. By that measure, Broadcast.com's value
is more than 15 times the $600,000 per employee at Infinity
Broadcasting, which operates 160 radio stations in the United
States and sells billboard space here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet companies have the same huge multiples. Yahoo is
worth $35 million per employee, and eBay, an Internet auction site,
$61 million. That compares with $14 million at Microsoft and $5
million at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   And while companies like Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Infinity earn
millions of dollars each quarter, most Internet companies are years
away from profits. Broadcast.com, for example, lost $10.5 million
on revenues of just $11.4 million in the first nine months of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who are certain the Internet will bring about
fundamental changes in the economy say there is no sense to the
huge valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is making huge changes in how we live our daily
lives,'' said Lise Buyer, an analyst who follows Internet companies
at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``But there is no way to correlate
what is happening with these stocks to the underlying businesses.
What we have is a mania.''

GOP MOVES SWIFTLY TO COUNTER BYRD ATTACK ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The news spread instantly among Democrats in the
Senate chamber: Senator Robert C. Byrd would file a motion to
dismiss the impeachment trial. The respected West Virginia Democrat
had finally staked out a position. The end was perhaps in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, however, Republican leaders were scrambling to
diminish the significance of the announcement _ and prove that
Byrd's stature did not automatically grant him power to proclaim
the end of ``this sad and sorry time.'' And so, as with so many
other announcements during the impeachment process, the battle
lines remained drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas, quickly convened a
press conference after hearing the news, at the urging of Majority
Leader Trent Lott. Afterward, Gramm admitted Byrd posed a serious
threat to the lifespan of the trial, saying he ``carries a lot of
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the weight he carries is as a defendant of the process and
precedent,'' Gramm continued. ``And I think Senator Byrd, in this
case, is on the opposite side of both the process and the
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 41-year veteran of the Senate, issued a page-long
statement Friday afternoon announcing his intent to file the
motion, a routine legal formula that would prompt a Senate vote.
With 51 votes in favor of the motion, the case would then be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Although few Democrats expected to prevail in such a vote,
several said the division between the parties appeared to be
growing smaller Friday, and one Republican aide said the vote
``might be closer than everyone is expecting.'' Byrd's decision to
play a leading role _ particularly coming after his earlier
warnings that he would not be easily swayed by White House
influence _ bolstered that view even more.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has long encouraged a swift
dismissal of the impeachment case, described Byrd's statement as
``very important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's rather interesting that a few weeks ago, there
was considerable speculation whether Byrd would be the one
Democratic holdout for impeachment here,'' Kennedy said. ``I think
he has the respect of Republicans and Democrats for his loyalty to
the institution of the Senate and to the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a strict interpreter of Senate rules who has gone as far
as banning a seeing-eye dog in the chamber, began discussing the
move with the Senate minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle of South
Dakota, on Thursday, an aide said. After Byrd issued his news
release Friday afternoon, he left the Senate floor and retreated to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can obviously follow the floor action from his office,''
said a Byrd spokesman, Tom Gavin.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing the statement, Byrd not only set in motion the next
phase of the proceedings but also shed light on his own views of
the trial _ views that he has kept mostly to himself over the last
few weeks, even as other senators have held dueling news
conferences in the Capitol halls.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying out a longer trial, Byrd said, ``will only prolong and
deepen the divisive, bitter, and polarizing effect that this sorry
affair has visited upon our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to make this motion not because I believe that the
president did no wrong,'' he wrote. ``In fact, I think he has
caused his family, his friends, and this nation great pain. I
believe he has weakened the already fragile public trust that has
been placed in his care. But I am convinced that the necessary
two-thirds for conviction are not there and that they are not
likely develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Revealing his own passion for public decorum, Byrd added that he
saw no need for witnesses, saying they would only ``foster more of
the same hallway press conferences and battle of press releases
that are contributing to the division of our parties and our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard the public, and while it is clear that there is a
great rift of public opinion on this matter, there is also a
consensus that the nation is sorely in need of leadership and
healing,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Byrd's colleagues learned about the motion to dismiss
from one another. Minutes after the news reached the Senate floor,
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, said he
was ``surprised.'' Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont,
called it ``an interesting thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's 51 votes, that's the end of it,'' Leahy said.
``Certainly, he's well-respected on both sides, but ultimately,
everybody has to decide whether we've had enough and it's time to
bring this to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd spent the rest of the day in his office working on the
motion, Gavin said, and was expected to work with leaders in the
Democratic Party over the weekend to add the finishing touches
before filing the motion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans continued to craft their response to the motion,
too. Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, said he did not
think Byrd is in a position to end the trial. And Representative
Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, issued his own statement urging
the Senate to ``reject this motion and continue an expeditious
search for the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew that there would be a motion to dismiss in this
process,'' Hyde said. ``Now we know who will offer that motion.''

 UNDATED: a mania.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent Internet frenzy has come in two phases. The first
began on Oct. 8, after stock prices had fallen sharply on worries
about the turmoil in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in a
matter of weeks, investors began to believe the U.S. economy could
withstand any pressure. At about the same time, technology
bellwethers Intel and Microsoft reported robust earnings and said
they expected profits to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that got technology stocks going, and they kept going,''
said Charles Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and
Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he has little doubt that the madness swept up stocks
like Cisco and Oracle. ``Everyone got caught up in the Internet
excitement, and that has dragged along all of the technology stocks
associated with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks shifted into overdrive on Dec. 16, when a
little-known Wall Street analyst, Henry Blodget, stirred investors'
speculative juices with a seemingly outrageous prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, a 32-year-old financial analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer,
forecast that Amazon.com, whose shares were then trading for $242,
would reach $400 in 12 months. They surpassed that level in early
January, and the stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Amazon shares have since fallen, they are up 52
percent since Blodget's report when adjusted for the split. But he,
too, says Internet stocks are ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a sector in history that's been valued
at these heights,'' he said. ``It's totally frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Blodget said part of the reason for the rapid climb is that
there are only about four dozen ``pure play'' Internet stocks, and
fewer than 10 of those have moved much beyond the planning stage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most promising are those like Yahoo, which operates an
entry site, or ``portal,'' to the Internet. Investors hope that the
services offered by portal companies, like free e-mail and
connections to shopping sites, inspire loyalty among users, which
the companies can capitalize on by selling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Other big favorites are online shopping sites like Amazon.com,
which, although unprofitable so far, hopes to capture customer
loyalty as it expands.
</P>
<P>
   Because many young companies have relatively few shares
outstanding, big investors like pension and mutual funds have found
it hard to buy large stakes without significantly moving share
prices. Broadcast.com, for example, has 17 million shares
outstanding, but until this month only 2.5 million of those were
available to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   With an average of 900,000 of its shares trading each day, the
price rose exponentially, from less than $40 three months ago to
$289.50 this month, before falling back to $136.25 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So limited is the supply of pure Internet investments, in fact,
that many institutional investors have tried to ferret out Internet
opportunities among elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That is what caused people to bid up shares of CBS, which owned
50 percent of Marketwatch _ a stake reduced to 38 percent in the
recent public offering. In addition, CBS owns 10 percent of
Sportsline USA, which operates sports-related Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a brokerage firm, rose
last week after it said it would make a public offering of shares
of its online brokerage unit. And since December, when Sotheby's
made clear its intention to use the Internet for some auctions, its
shares have risen 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy trading in stocks like Broadcast.com appears to be
driven by individual investors: the average size of Internet trades
is in the hundreds of shares, far smaller than the thousands
typical for companies like Microsoft or Intel, according to Birinyi
Associates, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   And those individual investors are starting to feel a bit of
pain as some of the frenzy has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried, but I was kind of expecting this,'' said Nichols,
who recently graduated from Georgia Tech and took an accounting
job. ``But I'm in for the long term.''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON BEATS DOLE II  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Draft-dodging Bill Clinton beats World
War II hero Bob Dole at the polls. Philandering Bill Clinton
vanquishes Republican Puritans in the Senate. What's next? As our
marathon culture war reaches its catharsis in Washington, it may be
Hollywood's turn to provide the farcical coup de grace. The talk
here _ not for attribution, since no one wants to offend Steven
Spielberg _ is that ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the patriotic shoo-in
of the summer, might lose the Best Picture Oscar come spring to a
movie drenched in sex (and lies about sex) whose lovable hero
shamelessly cheats on the wife and kids he's left at home.
</P>
<P>
   The dark horse, of course, is ``Shakespeare in Love,'' in which
young Will forsakes Anne Hathaway for a young woman betrothed to
another man. In my unscientific survey of Academy voters on Golden
Globes Eve, there remains a minority that feels this little ``art''
movie has no chance because: (a) comedies rarely win Best Picture;
(b) Spielberg-Hanks is a local combination to rival Mother Teresa;
(c) the Academy's old guard loves the likes of ``Braveheart,'' and
(d) both New York and L.A. critics have given ``Ryan'' their top
award. But ever since New Year's, when Variety's front page
questioned the front-runner's invincibility, ``Shakespeare'' has
been gaining ground as the anti-``Ryan'' alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare's'' proponents argue that ``Ryan'' is ``20 great
minutes followed by disappointment,'' that the literary pedigree of
``Shakespeare'' appeals to Hollywood's grandiose cultural
self-image (``We like to impress the world with our aspirations and
loftiness''), and that the mogul behind ``Shakespeare,'' Harvey
Weinstein of Miramax, is ``like the Wehrmacht'' when staging an
Oscar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But one likely Oscar nominee who is not connected with either of
these two movies _ and who is no fan of either Spielberg or
Weinstein _ feels that ``Shakespeare'' will win for cultural
reasons that transcend industry politics. ``I think people are a
little weary of the deadly earnest after this year in particular,''
he says. `` `Shakespeare' is fun, clever and has pretty people. It
says something uplifting about art and the human spirit. It
sparkles and bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if he's right about how his peers may finally
vote. But I do think he's right about why this movie is proving a
surprise hit with audiences throughout the country. Though
``Shakespeare in Love'' may not be built for the ages as its
namesake's plays are, it's hard to imagine a more fitting balm for
America at this moment. After a full year of listening to
politicians and the media wallow maliciously in a sex scandal,
there's something cleansing, even exhilarating, about watching a
movie that celebrates eroticism by reconnecting it to poetry (not
Walt Whitman's), humor and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' comes down against both camps in our yearlong
battle over Monicagate. Yes, it celebrates an extramarital affair
facilitated by a Betty Currie-like Nurse, but it's the linking of
two romantic souls in bed in a fairyland 16th-century London, not
the tawdry gratifying of furtive body parts in the Oval Office. Yet
a villain of the piece is a purse-mouthed Elizabethan censor and
busybody who seems to combine equal parts of Kenneth Starr, Linda
Tripp and all the Sunday TV sermonizers.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the standard cultural take on the past year has
been the rise of what the writer John Gregory Dunne has aptly
labeled ``virtual patriotism.'' The nation's psychic antidote to
Clintonian sordidness, we've been told and told, is nostalgia for
World War II and the selfless (i.e., non-boomer) generation that
fought it, as captured in ``Ryan'' and best-selling books by
Stephen Ambrose and Tom Brokaw. But now, thanks to Henry Hyde's
cheesy exploitation of the war dead in his impeachment-trial
summation _ and the rhetorical counter-fire it prompted from
Charles Ruff and Dale Bumpers _ Omaha Beach has become another
tainted pawn in the capital's odious political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan, sex-life-and-art-affirming ``Shakespeare in
Love'' arrived at just the right moment to capture ``Private
Ryan's'' fallen flag and take us about as far away from that soiled
Washington as a movie possibly can. Here in the capital of show
business, whose leaders cannot afford to ignore the public will as
politicians do, there is little doubt that that's where the country
wants to go.

THE RED FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 24, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was the significance of the single most headline-making
proposal in Bill Clinton's State of the Union address last week? I
refer, of course, to his recommendation that the government put
$700 billion into the stock market over the next 15 years as part
of a plan to put the Social Security system back on sound footing.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that this was a president whose proposal to
reorganize the health care system along somewhat similar lines _
with an expanded governmental role at its center _ produced the
1994 Republican landslide, it seemed like an incautious thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little like waving a red flag at a herd of bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, who
had already warned against the proposal when trial balloons were
floated, went boldly on the record in congressional testimony the
next day. ``I do not believe that it is politically feasible to
insulate such huge funds from government direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Malkiel, Princeton professor and author of ``A Random
Walk Down Wall Street,'' chimed in a couple of days later with a
summary judgment: ``A bad idea with unpredictable and probably
damaging consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   And Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, issued an immediate press release: ``No.
No. A thousand times no. If you thought a government takeover of
health care was bad, just wait until the government becomes an
owner of the nation's private companies.'' But the little red flag
may have been something quite other than it seemed. For one thing,
the president quickly glossed over it.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal to invest ``a small portion'' of the budget surplus
for the next 15 years in the private sector ``just as any private
or state government pension would do'' took up exactly one sentence
in the address.
</P>
<P>
   For another, moments later he spent two full paragraphs on a new
and little-noted suggestion: ``In addition to saving Social
Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for
retirement security in the 21st century. I propose that we use 11
percent of the surplus to establish Universal Savings Accounts _
USA accounts _ to give all Americans the means to save.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new accounts, Americans can invest as much as they
choose, and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with
extra help for those least able to save. USA accounts will help all
Americans to share in our nation's wealth, and enjoy a more secure
retirement,'' Clinton continued.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for the pitch for a vastly expanded savings
system is Clinton's determination to head off a long-standing
Republican attempt to dismantle the 60-year-old Social Security
system in favor of individual accounts. His strategy appears aimed
at compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The deep political question at the heart of the dispute is
summed up perfectly in the names given to these competing visions
by their sponsors: Social Security vs. personal security. The
outcome envisaged by Clinton's address is both. Instead of
dismantling the famous ``three-legged stool'' of retirment benefits
_ Social Security, company plans, and private savings _ Clinton
wants to reinforce one leg to full strength and begin to beef up
the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was in January 1996 in San Francisco that Martin Feldstein
formally proposed privatizing Social Security from the pulpit of a
prestigious lecture series. A Harvard professor, Feldstein had
served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald
Reagan; he was a frequent adviser to George Bush. His was the voice
of serious conservative economic thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system had a problem, Feldstein said: people
were living longer, there were more of them, and taxes would have
to rise significantly if benefits remained at current levels well
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, however, Feldstein said, was ``the low
implicit return'' that individuals received on the dollars that
they paid into the system. That could only be changed, he argued,
by changing the fiscal underpinnings of the system from a
pay-as-you-go system, in which taxes collected from workers went
directly to retirees, into funded program in which individual
accounts were invested in stocks and bonds, like any private
retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   It was an election year. Republicans of all sorts were
maneuvering for advantage in the race against Clinton. Primary
challengers Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander were jockeying to
force Bob Dole to abandon his promise to balance the budget and,
instead, embrace a tax cut. Feldstein's proposal became a stock
promise in the Republicans' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential and one congressional election later, with the
political winds having moderated (and now threatening to shift
altogether), Feldstein recently offered a modified version of his
earlier plan. Speaking to what must be presumed to be the
mainstream of the Republican Party, Feldstein said he still urged
the creation of Personal Retirement Accounts in which the
government would park some portion of the Social Security taxes it
collects.
</P>
<P>
   But he reckoned such a start-up would serve only as a supplement
to the current system, frozen at current levels. Projected
surpluses could be used after all to beef up the Social Security
Trust Fund, as Clinton wished.
</P>
<P>
   And the proceeds of investments of the new retirement accounts
could be used to meet whatever shortfall might occur in order to
maintain total retirement benefits at their current levels for the
next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   That was the political background to Clinton's proposal
Wednesday night to create a system of ``universal savings
accounts.'' Among defenders of Social Security, the fear all along
has been that individual accounts, were they to be established,
might quickly become rival contenders for resources. So a good deal
of thought went into making the new program sound as different as
possible from the existing one.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen now? It's anybody's guess whether the
Republicans will fold their hand on the Social Security issue and
go along with Clinton's proposal _ after all, their numbers are not
likely to grow in the next Congress _ or engage in the bitter
competition among themselves that has been the hallmark of the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   But in either event, you can bet that the idea that the
government should invest in stocks will go nowhere. The red flag is
a bargaining chip, designed to be traded away.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion by wires as the lede at about 70.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As an estimated 100,000 abortion opponents paraded
past the White House Friday calling President and Mrs. Clinton
murderers, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton denounced violence
against abortion practitioners as ``domestic terrorism'' and said
the Clinton administration would propose spending $4.5 million in
next year's federal budget to improve safety at abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years there have been 7 murders, 38 bombings,
146 cases of arson and 733 cases of vandalism,'' she said in a
speech marking the 26th anniversary of the legalization of
abortion. ``Wherever one stands on the issue of abortion, surely we
should all agree that when doctors are murdered, clinics are
bombed, splattered with acid or set on fire, this is not free
expression. This is domestic terrorism and it's got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the federal money would be given to vulnerable
clinics for extra security measures, including proper lighting,
motion detectors, closed-circuit cameras, security systems and
bullet-resistant windows. Under the proposal, the Justice
Department would make security assessments and make the upgrades
available to clinics deemed to be at high risk of violence.
</P>
<P>
   As the first lady spoke, abortion opponents swarmed across
Washington in their annual demonstration against Roe versus Wade,
the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal. About
7,000 attended a ``Mass for Life'' Thursday night and camped out at
local churches and at Catholic University. They joined tens of
thousands of others for the annual March for Life rally Friday on
the Ellipse behind the White House, then marched to the Supreme
Court and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the trip to be with the others _ hoping, praying,
expressing together,'' said Saundara Innhoff, 42, of Logan, Ohio,
on her way from St. Matthew's Cathedral to the Elipse.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Mrs. Clinton's remarks on the need for extra
security at clinics, Richard Doerflinger, a spokesman for pro-life
activities at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said:
``There have been far more women killed in abortionist clinics than
abortionists shot.'' He cited a recent article in the Arizona
Republic that said six women had died in a cross-country chain of
abortion clinics, including one in Phoenix, owned by a New York
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Doerflinger said, violence against abortion workers
was relatively rare compared with assaults on other health-care
workers, particularly in emergency rooms. ``There are a couple of
senseless and tragic killings that happened at abortion clinics,
but this is a very tiny part of the problem that all medical people
face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Clinton administration's budget proposal was
not a proper use of federal money. ``Giving $4.5 million to an
already lucrative industry to do what it will no doubt do anyway
with its own funds is a strange budget priority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who is a leading abortion
opponent in Congress, said to those gathered on the Ellipse:
``Those who fashion themselves as advocates of children and
pro-women while promoting or even acquiescing to abortion are
either hypocrites or are living in an unhealthy state of denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who every year tries to block federal money for family
planning programs overseas, referred to the Clintons by name,
adding: ``The scandals that have rocked the White House pale to
near insignificance when compared to the anti-child policies so
methodically pursued by our abortion president and his
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who support abortion rights have been among Clinton's most
loyal political allies throughout the year-long Lewinsky scandal.
And they made up a good part of the audience of more than 2,000
people whom Mrs. Clinton addressed Friday at a luncheon sponsored
by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   With constant references to clinic violence setting the tone for
the event, Mrs. Clinton spoke gravely and at length, with none of
the cheerleader spirit that has marked so many of her recent
political outings.
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration was doing everything it could think
of, including promoting abstinence programs, to reduce teen
pregnancy and the need for abortion. And she said that boys and men
needed to learn to be responsible for their acts, saying they
should look in the mirror before imagining their ``sexual prowess''
and understand what it means to take care of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said that clinic violence, including the October
killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion doctor in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y., should inspire abortion-rights advocates to stand
firm ``in our efforts to make sure that doctors are trained and
available to provide safe and comprehensive health care to women
all over our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the federal money would be given to vulnerable clinics
for extra security measures, including proper lighting, motion
detectors, closed-circuit cameras, security systems and
bullet-resistant windows.

   TOKYO _ A much-anticipated news conference here Friday by
DaimlerChrysler AG failed to clarify the future of the debt-laden
Nissan Motor Co. or its more-troubled truck-making affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, DaimlerChrysler said only that its two
chairmen, Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton, met with Nissan Motor
President Yoshikazu Hanawa on Thursday and that they had
``constructive discussions'' regarding the truck affiliate, Nissan
Diesel Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker, with $20 billion in debt, has embarked
this month on an unusual campaign to sell itself. DaimlerChrysler
had already been holding talks with Nissan Motor about the
disposition of Nissan Diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's DaimlerChrysler statement said only that the executives
had ``explored possible cooperation projects,'' a wording that
suggested DaimlerChrysler might be seeking a relationship with
Nissan Motor that was somewhat less involved than taking an equity
stake in the company or buying it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify the phrase, Schrempp said, ``I guess it leaves
everything open.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nissan Diesel, its fate lies as much in the hands of its
banks, which are considering a proposal to forgive some of the
truck maker's debt, as in Nissan Motor's.
</P>
<P>
   The DaimlerChrysler statement was issued shortly before trading
on Tokyo's stock market ended for the day. Nissan's shares closed
with a gain of 15 yen, at 430 yen, or $3.77. They have increased 24
percent this year. Nissan Diesel's shares gained 4 yen Friday, to
229 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, DaimlerChrysler fell
$1.6875, to $103.9375.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schrempp and Eaton spent much of the news conference avoiding
questions about Nissan and being cryptic. One Japanese reporter
even suggested that the Tokyo stock market would plummet if they
persisted in being so cagey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two of us are playing chess and I tell you about my
next two or three moves,'' Schrempp replied in answer to one of the
questions, ``I'd never have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Eaton, he stuck to the script, saying, ``Once again, we
will have no further comment on Nissan and Nissan Diesel other than
what is in the press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp also tartly noted that if there had been leaks about
the Daimler-Chrysler merger before it was announced last May, there
might not have been a merger. Rumors about Nissan Motor have been
rampant for months.
</P>
<P>
   But the two executives did make clear their designs on Asia,
which is the Achilles' heel of the global vehicle empire they are
trying to build. DaimlerChrysler aims to derive 20 percent to 25
percent of its revenue from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp said there were two necessary elements to being a
successful transportation company now: covering a range of
automotive products and having exports to and manufacturing in all
markets. He outlined three possible avenues of expansion in Asia:
through organic growth, purchase of an equity stake in another
company or an outright acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the difference is in the timing,'' he said. ``Our only
problem is that we are very impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that DaimlerChrysler will continue to be
aggressive here, whether its intended prey is ultimately Nissan or
not. Eaton also met with Katsuhiko Kawasoe, the president of
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., although he sought to portray the meeting
as a courtesy he would extend to any partner of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors and Chrysler have had a long relationship:
Chrysler sells engines to the Japanese car company and Mitsubishi
makes Chrysler cars at a plant in Normal, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and investors have wondered why DaimlerChrysler
has not shown more apparent interest in Mitsubishi, whose truck
making unit is considered superior to Nissan Diesel. Although
Mitsubishi's debt levels are higher than Nissan's, outweighing
equity by more than five times, its condition is considered less
critical because it enjoys the support of the Mitsubishi keiretsu,
the cluster of Mitsubishi companies and affiliates that includes
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Japan's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi thus does not have to sell in a fire sale, which may
be one reason why DaimlerChrysler prefers to flirt with Nissan
Diesel. But Nissan Diesel's banks will be hard pressed to forgive
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Bank of Japan, one of its main lenders, suffered
a ratings downgrade Friday. Moody's Investors Service lowered the
Industrial Bank's long-term deposit rating and its financial
strength rating, reflecting a deterioration of asset quality and
capital. Fuji Bank, Nissan Diesel's other bank, is also weak. In
fact, Nissan Motor, which is part of the keiretsu clustered around
Industrial Bank and Fuji, is providing a 100 million yen cash
infusion to Fuji to shore up the bank's capital base.
</P>
<P>
   The car company, meanwhile, is grappling with $24 billion in
debt. If Nissan sold all of its shares at current market prices, it
could repay less than half of its outstanding debt, which makes
debt forgiveness of some sort a necessity.

LUMET'S REMAKE OF `GLORIA' REVIVES A STRONG PREMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though it came out as recently as 1980, John Cassavetes'
``Gloria'' is actually a prime candidate for a remake. Generally
regarded as one of the maverick director's low points, it's a movie
that failed both at the box office and with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, everyone seemed to love its premise _ an
ex-gang moll and a child marked for gangland execution on the run
together _ and it worked as a vehicle for the director's wife, Gena
Rowlands, who earned a best actress Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   So why not try it again? This time with a more reliable genre
director _ Sidney Lumet, say? _ and with a star like Sharon Stone,
who, though six years younger than Rowlands when she played the
part, is no stranger to playing aging gun molls, witness her best
actress Oscar nomination for `Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   And, happily, the mix of Stone, Lumet and ``Gloria'' gels. It
definitely has its weak moments, but ``Gloria'' powers along rather
nicely as a thriller, and Stone _ complete with Brooklyn accent _
is surprisingly believable in the (heavily reworked) role.
</P>
<P>
   This Gloria is not a grandmotherly ex-moll who lives next door
to the endangered child, but a fairly smashing looking younger
woman just released from three years in a Florida prison _ having
taken the rap for her Irish gangster boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   When she confronts the boyfriend (Jeremy Northam) in his
Manhattan digs, she discovers his men have just killed the entire
family of a turncoat gang bookkeeper, except for a seven-year-old
boy (Jean-Luke Figueroa) they hold prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Furious with her ex-beau for never visiting her and sure the boy
is about to be murdered, she steals him (and an incriminating
computer disk his father gave him) and takes off. The rest of the
movie has the gangsters trying to track the fugitives down, as they
bond as surrogate mother-and-son.
</P>
<P>
   If the film has any real problem, it's that it comes off as
being too calculated a star vehicle, with too many ``big'' scenes
designed to showcase Stone's talent _ to the point that she
frequently seems to be overacting. The film would benefit from a
few more low-voltage moments.
</P>
<P>
   The script also suffers from a strange schizophrenia, in that
Stone looks like a million dollars, but people _ a hotel clerk, a
pawnbroker, everyone she encounters, in fact _ constantly react to
her with instant contempt, as if she's a frumped-up Rowlands, a
complete nonentity.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she gets on a bus but is short two quarters of the
fare. Turning to a bus-load of New York men, she asks for help. All
eyes look at her, then blankly out the window. Since she could have
just stepped out of a Victoria's Secret catalog, the scene is
absurd: the woman would be drowning in quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she gives a solid, watchable performance. She may not
have the instant sympathy of a Meg Ryan or Gwyneth Paltrow, but she
projects a street-smart intelligence and tough-cookie determination
as charismatically as any actress in films today. Her scenes with
her young co-star are warm and credible, without ever being
maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not in the league with his classics (a long list that
includes ``12 Angry Men,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon'' and ``Network''),
director Lumet gives the film zip, style and uniformly good
performances _ not just Stone but Northam and (especially) George
C. Scott as an aging Irish Godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite these obvious selling points, Columbia has
apparently decided to throw this movie away. Indeed, it must be the
first major studio star vehicle since ``The Avengers'' to open
without a press screening. (Why? Columbia's official response is a
damning: ``No comment'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria'' may be no masterpiece, but it's a lot better than
half the junk that studio has released with both a press screening
and a mouthful of superlatives. Whatever Columbia's reasons for
dumping the movie, a director with the track record of a Lumet
certainly deserves a little more respect.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria. Directed by Sidney Lumet. Screenplay by Steven Antin.
Cast: Sharon Stone, Jean-Luke Figueroa, Jeremy Northam, Cathy
Moriarty, George C. Scott. Columbia Pictures. 108 minutes. Rated R
for violence and language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

 &HT;    Jones a shooting star with a bright future
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It was a bright, clear and stifling Sunday, like
most summer days in the south Georgia town of Camilla, and Rebecca
Clayton showed up early for church. She was eager to introduce a
new addition to her family, her ``baby,'' to the close-knit
congregation of Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Jumaine Lanard Jones was 13 years old then and
already stood 6 feet 3. He was still a baby to his ``Auntie,'' and
she was going to make sure his first days in Camilla started out
the right way.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a worship ritual that would repeat
itself every weekend for the next five years. It was there at
church that Rufus McDuffie, basketball coach at Mitchell-Baker High
School, first met Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``His aunt brought him over and introduced him to me,'' McDuffie
recalled. ``She said, `I've got you a basketball player, coach.' I
looked and saw this tall, skinny kid, skinny as a rail. I said, `I
don't know about that, but we'll see what we can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, people are still seeing what they can do with
Jones. Only now, as Jones is a star power forward for the
University of Georgia, it's the Bulldogs' opponents that are at a
loss for what to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   Still just a sophomore, Jones will start his 53rd game for the
Bulldogs when they play Mississippi this afternoon in Oxford, Miss.
Now 6-7, the 210-pound Jones enters today's game as the SEC's
leading scorer (19.7 per game), third-leading rebounder (9.3) and
No. 1 threat to make the jump to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumaine Jones is a problem for anybody in the country (to
defend),'' said Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson, whose team was
victimized for 25 points by Jones last weekend. ``He's going to be
a first-rounder one day. ... He's on a different plateau.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' ability to score has a lot to do with what McDuffie did
in the months and years that followed that Sunday-morning
introduction. When he arrived in Camilla, Jones already possessed a
deadly arsenal of post moves and could dunk the ball with ease. But
taking note of Jones' wiriness and being unsure of his eventual
height, McDuffie encouraged Jones to take his game outside the
paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him as a ninth-grader, I never dreamed he'd turn
into the player he has,'' McDuffie said. ``He didn't impress me
that much. He was real skinny and he couldn't shoot. I told him,
'If you're going to go to college, you're going to have to be able
to play outside,' so we worked on his outside shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach McDuffie used to make me shoot for hours in the gym,''
Jones said. ``I'd be like, 'Come on, not today, coach.' But he'd
say, 'Get out there and start shooting.' ``
</P>
<P>
   That Jones eventually grew four more inches was a bonus. It
wasn't long before his outside game caught up with his inside game
and, soon, he was an offensive force. As a junior, Jones began to
produce gaudy numbers _ 28.5 points, 14 rebounds a game _ and
back-to-back trips to the state Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie's stern guidance was a welcomed addition in Jones'
life. He never knew his real father, who left when Jones was 3, and
Clayton's husband had died before Jones came to live with her in
Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach McDuffie was definitely a father figure to me,'' Jones
said. ``I spent a lot of weekends with him. His daughters are like
sisters to me, and I hung out with his son, Kevin. He was always
concerned about what I did in school, although I didn't always
appreciate it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact that McDuffie had Jones to work with was somewhat
of a miracle. Jones was in Camilla living with his aunt only
because his mother, Mae Jones, wanted him to escape his Cocoa,
Fla., neighborhood. Although Jumaine was still in middle school,
his mother recognized the signs that her son could be heading down
the wrong path if his life didn't undergo radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crime in my neighborhood, and a lot of my
friends in middle school were getting into a lot of trouble,''
Jones explained. ``My mother didn't want me to be around that. She
figured if you hang around people, sooner or later you were going
to get into trouble, too. I always knew right from wrong, but she
was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones didn't go kicking and screaming to Camilla, a small
farming town located in South Georgia. In fact, he was all for the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Camilla because I used to come stay with my Auntie
every summer,'' Jones said. ``She was one of my favorite aunts, and
I always loved staying with her and playing with all my cousins.
When I was young, I was always asking my mom if I could stay the
whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' basketball abilities soon had college recruiters calling.
And while he had his choice of high-profile programs to join _
Kentucky, Connecticut and N.C. State, to name a few _ he said he
always wanted to go to Georgia. That Tubby Smith had the Bulldogs
in the national limelight didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones signed with the Bulldogs in the early period, December
of his senior year. He briefly reconsidered his decision when Smith
left for Kentucky. But with McDuffie's encouragement, he honored
his original commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Tubby left, a lot of people were mad at him,'' Jones
said. ``I figured he got recruited just like I got recruited, and I
couldn't be upset with him because of that. Coach (Ron) Jirsa had
been recruiting me all along, and we had a close relationship. So I
figured I couldn't go wrong sticking with Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   After a promising beginning his freshman year, Jones ground
through a bumpy period in SEC play before asserting himself as one
of the league's best young players the latter half of the season.
He averaged 14.7 points and 8.5 rebounds a game and was named
co-freshman of the year with Tennessee guard Tony Harris.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jones has been even better. He's been limited to
single-digit scoring just three times all season and has recorded
``double-doubles'' in points and rebounds 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers think that Jones' best basketball is ahead of
him. And many of them say he's not ready to make an early leap to
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still developing,'' Kentucky's Smith said. ``He needs to
learn a lot about the game. He's got the work ethic and attitude,
so it's just a matter of time....I think he's a player who will be
able to play at the next level. When? I don't know. That's a big,
big step from college to (the) professional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa also says that Jones is ``a year or two'' away from being
ready for the pros and cites his star's need to improve his
ball-handling skills and perimeter defense. But he also warns that
the NBA might not wait that long to come calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to draft on potential rather than where a player is
at any given moment,'' Jirsa said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones does not disguise his desire to play in the NBA but says
he is concerned only about the Bulldogs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just worried about my team right now,'' Jones said. ``I'll
talk to coach Jirsa and my family about it after the season....
Making it to the NBA is one of my dreams. You can never pay back
your family, but I'd like to help take care of them after all the
years they've taken care of me.''

 &HT;    Olympic play main topic of governors' meeting
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ One year ago, the NHL devised a ``North America
vs. World'' format for its All-Star Game in an attempt to tease
fans' interest before the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. As it
turned out, a rebroadcast of ``Animal House'' would have been a
more appropriate prelude to the U.S. team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend in Tampa, the NHL will try again with its
us-against-them format. The next Olympics is three years away.
Whether there will be a next Olympics for NHL players will be
discussed today, when the league's Board of Governors meet in a
Tampa hotel.
</P>
<P>
   While the NHL's global-marketing heads want the league to give
the Olympics one more try in 2002, given the prime-time stage in
Salt Lake City, team executives are less enthusiastic, because NBC
has not guaranteed how much television coverage hockey will get.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was expected to speak with network
chairman Dick Ebersol before addressing the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings are mixed on the subject,'' Florida Panthers
president Bill Torrey said. ``The whole Olympic thing has taken on
another color with recent developments (of corruption within the
IOC). Do we want to get involved right now? And the whole reason
we'd be doing this would be for more exposure. But (if) we're not
going to get it, maybe we need to move on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrey prefers sending amateurs to the Games, saying, ``In 1980
when the U.S. upset the Russians, it did so much to increase
interest in the game. Kids wanted to learn the game. But if we go
on using pros, all of that gets removed. It's not the same feeling
with pro players.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said, ``If the next
Olympics were anywhere else, they probably would have gassed it by
now. But because they're in the U.S., this could be the last chance
to get it major exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials are not expected to make a final decision
today, but the situation could be clarified. It will be the last
time the owners will be together until June. When they last met, in
early December, Bettman said a decision would be made in ``60 to 90
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's meeting is ``just another step in the decision-making
process,'' NHL spokesman Frank Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend will include a skills competition and Heroes of
Hockey game Saturday night at the Ice Palace, with the All-Star
Game Sunday. Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock will coach the North
American team and Buffalo's Lindy Ruff will be behind the World's
bench.
</P>
<P>
   While the league prefers to market its star forwards _ Wayne
Gretzky, Eric Lindros, Paul Kariya, et al. _ goalies continue to be
the story this season, with only 5.3 goals per game being scored.
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, who starts for the World, already has
eight shutouts, a goals-against average of 1.86 and a saves
percentage of .939.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a team that has a weak goaltender
anymore,'' Ruff said. ``There used to be games you could go in and
say, `This is a game we can win.' But now you can go into any
building, and there's a chance you're going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's spectacular play aside, the NHL would prefer Sunday's
game have a 9-8 score than 2-1. Better for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman out
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a broken nose and a cut when he was hit in the
face by a puck Thursday night, Detroit forward Steve Yzerman was
dropped from Sunday's North American team and replaced by Los
Angeles left wing Luc Robitaille. Robitaille is third in the league
in goals with 25 and recently passed 500 goals in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ground zero
</P>
<P>
   North Americans coach Hitchcock will be trying to break a career
slump in All-Star games. Hitchcock is 0-11 as a coach in All-Star
games at the amateur and pro level. Last year, he coached the World
team in a 8-7 loss. ``Last year was the closest I've come,'' he
said. ``If I don't coach this team to a win, I think I'll coach the
media team next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Heroes of Hockey'' old-timers game does not include
any former Atlanta Flames. But the ``NHL Heroes'' team has the
father-sons trio of Gordie, Mark and Marty Howe. ... It shouldn't
come as a surprise that Phil Esposito is not in the old-timers
game. Esposito was fired as Tampa Bay's general manager this
season, and his presence would have been awkward, to say the least.
... John Cullen, who made a comeback from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
this season, only to be demoted to the minors by the Lightning,
will play in the old-timers game. After a stint in the minors, he
returned to Tampa Bay as an assistant coach. ... In an attempt to
improve coverage, the league's broadcasting department is freezing
13 microphones just under the ice surface at the Ice Palace for
ESPN and Fox.

AVAILABILITY OF DONOR ORGANS MYSTERIOUSLY PLUNGES IN NEW YORK AREA

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of vital organs being donated in the New
York area has fallen so precipitously in recent weeks that
transplant programs across the region have virtually ground to a
halt, hospital officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of livers, hearts, kidneys and other organs has
been a growing national problem in recent years, in part because of
falling murder rates and improved auto safety. But officials said
Friday that since the beginning of the year, the supply in New York
had taken a severe, and still unexplained, downward turn.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between supply and demand tends to be greater in New
York than in the nation as a whole. But since the start of the
year, there have been just nine organs donated in the New York
region; last year at this time, there had been 22 donors, which is
about average, said Denise Payne, executive director of the New
York Organ Donor Network, which procures and distributes organs in
New York, Long Island and five counties in the north. ``If it keeps
on like this for months, we would be concerned,'' she said, adding
that she knew of no similar sudden problems in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York doctors said Friday that there had already been
a great deal of suffering as a result of this shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 5 or 10 years, I cannot remember such a dearth of
organs,'' said Dr. Lewis Teperman, the director of transplantation
of New York University Hospital, which has done no liver
transplants this month. In the last few days, he said, two patients
have died at New York University Hospital alone, and another woman
is beyond hope, he said, as others await donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so frustrating is that we have here one of the best
survival rates in country with transplants,'' Teperman said. ``But
I can't help them if I don't get an organ. This should be a time of
good news, and instead I am pronouncing people dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Among heart specialists, there are similar worries. ``Clearly
hearttransplantation at this point in time is the pinnacle of
treatment,'' said Dr. Nillo Edwards, who heads the heart transplant
program at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``However, having more
organs available is clearly what we need today.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the nation's supply of donated organs
has gone up a few hundred each year. At the same time, demand has
risen twelvefold, said Dr. Ronald Busuttil, chief of liver
transplantation at the University of California at Los Angeles
School of Medicine and president-elect of the American Society of
Transplant Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   The rising demand is primarily the result of two factors: the
aging of the population and improved technology that has made many
more people candidates for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   With livers, for instance, the types of people who just a few
years ago were not usually transplant candidates _ alcoholics,
people with tumors, those with hepatitis B _ now are strong
candidates. Further, a national epidemic of hepatitis C has
increased the need for liver donations by more than 500 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vastly improved transplant capability is the same for all
other organs. Further, while people over 50 were rarely candidates
a few years ago, now people well into their 60s are getting donated
organs, and as the population ages, there will be even more need.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this rising demand, though, supply has barely increased.
The reasons are many _ a decrease in the number of deaths in car
crashes because of air bags, lower rates of violent crime and a
distinct lack of public awareness efforts. Further, as the
population ages, there are fewer young people, who tend to make the
best donor candidates, to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't consider making a donation,'' said Busuttil.
``And consent rates are low, which may be due to the way families
are approached. Also, people who would be potential donors are not
identified.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in areas where donations are extremely low,
procurement centers may not be working effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In response, federal officials, led by Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala, want to change the current system of organ
matching, in which people needing organs draw from their region.
They want to replace it with a national system in which those who
are most needy get organs first.
</P>
<P>
   This effort, which is controversial among donor expertise
groups, would be made in large part to correct a wide disparity
among states. Indeed, the United Network of Organ Sharing released
a report this week that found that waits varied wildly between
states, saying that in New York City, patients wait 10 times as
long as in other urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Donations are lower in New York for a variety of factors as
well, said Ms. Payne. Among them are a higher number of people with
transmittable diseases like AIDS, a dramatic decrease in violent
crime and rise in emergency room technology and success rates.
``The decrease in violent crime is wonderful for society,'' said
Ms. Payne. ``But it has impacted our donor pools.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Giovanna Frontino waited at the bedside of her niece,
Antonia Verde, at New York University Hospital, praying for a liver
to arrive. Ms. Verde, 25, has a blood illness diagnosed when she
was three months old that has required almost monthly transfusions
throughout her life. As a result, doctors say, iron overload has
destroyed her liver, and she has been in the intensive-care unit of
the hospital for two weeks awaiting a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard,'' said Ms. Frontino. ``Her mother never leaves
the hospital. This has made me so much more aware of the problem
with organ donors. So we are waiting and waiting. But we are
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was less optimism a few beds away, where Gerard Jean-Louis
sat at the bedside of his wife, Antoine, 63, whose liver has been
destroyed by hepatitis. ``They say it is too late for her now,''
said Jean-Louis. ``The doctor said there is nothing they can do
because they keep on looking for the organ.''

STOCK MARKET LOWER AS IBM FALLS SHARPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market finished lower Friday as IBM fell
sharply after mainframe sales in the fourth quarter disappointed
some investors. The economic crisis in Brazil also was bothersome,
helping send bank and financial stocks lower.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the selling, investors did not seem to extrapolate the
problems at IBM to the expectation of poor results elsewhere. And
that is why although the Dow Jones industrial average, which
includes IBM, dropped 1.6 percent, the rest of the major stock
indexes were down far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of tech companies have already reported good
earnings,'' said Douglas Cliggott, a U.S. equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities. ``So the market said tech was strong and a
couple of disappointing revenue or earnings numbers have not led to
widespread selling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a volatile day of trading, however. The market opened
down across the board, with the Dow 175 points, or 1.9 percent,
lower by 10:30 a.m., while the Nasdaq index dropped 40 points, or
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the fall in IBM, market-opening declines in
Amazon.com, Yahoo, Excite and other Internet stocks set a gloomy
tone early. The selling came on top of sharp losses Thursday and a
general Internet selloff for the last week and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At their intraday lows Friday, Yahoo was 43 percent below its
intraday high of 445 on Jan. 11 and Amazon.com was 50 percent below
its high of 199 1/8 on Jan. 8. But the concerted selling recently
seemed to get prices back down to levels that attracted investors
again, and these and other Internet stocks turned around to end the
day higher.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which fell 12 at the opening, rallied to close up 21 at
286, and Amazon.com rose 17, to 123, after beginning the day down 7
5/8. This Internet turnaround helped the Nasdaq rebound. It was up
20 points at one moment but finished the day down just 5.84 points,
or one-quarter of a percentage point, at 2,338.88.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.97 points, to
1,225.19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished down 143.41 points at 9,120.67. It had rallied
in the early afternoon but then fell the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which is the heaviest-weighted stock in the Dow, accounted
for almost half of the day's decline as it plunged 17\, or 8.76
percent, to 179}. Although IBM's fourth-quarter earnings, which
were released after the market closed Thursday, beat expectations,
analysts said that they were disappointed that both mainframe and
server sales were down because IBM cut prices to compete with
Hitachi and Fujitsu.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks leading the Dow lower were American Express and
J.P. Morgan, which weaken when the crisis in Brazil looks worse,
and the Dow's two drug stocks, Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, concerns about Brazil helped push prices
higher as some investors sought the safety of Treasury securities.
Brazil's Bovespa index dropped 1.8 percent, and the country's
currency, the real, continued to decline in value. It is now down
29.4 percent since it was allowed to trade freely last week.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 28/32, to 102 22/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
fell to 5.07 percent, from 5.13 percent.

CLINTON U.N. NOMINEE DENIES HE VIOLATED LOBBYING LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be
the top American diplomat at the United Nations, denied Friday that
he had violated federal lobbying laws, the issue that has held up
his nomination since the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments since the disclosure that he was
negotiating with the Justice Department over its investigation of
an alleged ethics violation, Holbrooke did not describe the terms
of a possible settlement, but said he was confident that the
inquiry would end soon.
</P>
<P>
   He said his lawyers were involved in ``intense discussion'' with
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said a settlement with Holbrooke, the
architect of the Dayton peace settlement of 1995 that ended the war
in Bosnia, would probably be reached within days. The officials
said he had been asked to pay a civil penalty, but they would not
discuss the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and former American diplomats say the
investigation has centered on allegations that Holbrooke violated
lobbying laws in his contacts with the U.S. ambassador in South
Korea in early 1996. That was soon after he had resigned from the
State Department to become an investment banker in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to going before the Senate for what I'm sure
will be a tough but fair confirmation process, and I hope to serve
soon at the U.N.,'' he said in an interview on the ABC News program
``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from the State Department in 1996 to join the
investment banking company Credit Suisse First Boston, Holbrooke
was named a part-time Clinton administration envoy to the Balkans
and to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called contacts that I had in the three years since I
left the State Department with government officials have all been
in my capacity as a senior adviser, official, to the secretary of
state,'' he said. ``So any contacts I had _ any contacts I had _
were under that hat and did not violate any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Holbrooke said the veteran diplomat was not
available for an interview and had no comment beyond his remarks on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say Holbrooke has been accused by Justice
Department prosecutors of having committed a civil violation of
lobbying laws when he contacted Ambassador James Laney in South
Korea soon after resigning as assistant secretary of state for
European and Canadian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, who has since left the post, said in an interview this
week that Holbrooke had contacted him in a letter on the banking
company's stationery, seeking his help in obtaining an appointment
with president Kim Young-sam during a South Korean trip that
Holbrooke planned to take that spring.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting never took place, although Laney did sponsor a
luncheon for Holbrooke and a handful of senior South Korean
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said prosecutors in the Justice Department's public
integrity division believed the contacts with the ambassador
amounted to a violation of laws limiting lobbying contacts by
former government officials with their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Laney and another senior American diplomat, Winston Lord, the
former assistant secretary of state for East Asia, have insisted
that Holbrooke did nothing wrong in contacting the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Lord has said that when Holbrooke resigned from the State
Department in 1996, he asked Holbrooke to remain in contact with
State Department officials as he traveled through Asia and to meet
with Asian leaders to discuss diplomatic developments in the
Balkans and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Lord and Laney, who have both been interviewed by the Justice
Department, agreed that Holbrooke could have easily set up his own
meetings with senior officials in South Korea without the embassy's
help, especially after he gained worldwide celebrity in 1995 as a
result of the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   They said his contacts with Laney had been a simple courtesy to
the ambassador and to the embassy. ``Given his stature, Dick didn't
need Laney's help to see anyone,'' Lord said.

 &HT;

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nibbling on fried chicken in the holding room of a
Buffalo hockey arena in winter isn't everyone's idea of a party.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton celebrated the sixth anniversary of his
presidency last Wednesday, though, it wasn't the setting that
crystallized the moment quite so much as the company.
</P>
<P>
   For there he was, in snow-covered Buffalo, N.Y., basking in the
support of his closest confidants and political soulmates _ First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Gore's
ebullient wife Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   As they stepped into the Marine Midland Arena to the thunderous
cheers of some 21,000 fans, said Gore, ''All four of us just gasped
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   In their singular gasp, Bill and Hillary, Tipper and Al, two
very different couples joined at the political hip, might well have
expressed the astonishment of the nation at the twists and turns of
what has been, by any measure, a breathtaking year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, through long months of a sex and deception scandal that
may finally be nearing an end, the First Foursome has survived the
strains remarkably intact, without a moment's ill-will _ publicly
at least _ expressed or implied.
</P>
<P>
   Seated side by side across the flag-bedecked dais in Buffalo
last week, exchanging compliments at the podium and hugs all
around, the four baby boomers sent a message of reassurance to the
American public as powerful in its own way as the politically
defiant State of the Union address Clinton had delivered the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked great together,'' said Gettysburg College
presidential expert Shirley Anne Warshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows solidarity in the administration, it shows two
families connected,'' she said. ''That's what this president needs
to convey to the American public, that 'I may have strayed in my
marriage, but I'm committed to my family and committed to family
values in general.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lest the symbolism escape notice, Clinton himself drove home the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you could see, you know, that Tipper and Al and
Hillary and I, we are sort of like a big family,'' Clinton gushed.
''We like going places together...We work together. And we have
tried to model what we want America to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A family role model isn't the first thing that comes to mind for
many Americans at the mention of Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   A year-long investigation into his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to deceive the
public about it led the House to impeach him last month on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   And no one would suggest that the backing of his closest allies
has enabled Clinton to erase the stain he's left on his own legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They obviously can't eclipse this whole impeachment thing,''
said Boston University presidential historian Robert Dallek.
''They're certainly not going to eclipse it in the history books.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate prepares to weigh the impeachment charges this
week, however, in the light of Clinton's stunning popularity, it's
clear the reflected stability and fire-tested loyalty of the Gore
family, and the steadfast support of Mrs. Clinton, have stood
Clinton extremely well in his efforts to persuade Americans to put
the matter behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly helpful, Warshaw said, has been the public backing
of Mrs. Gore, an effervescent mother of four who burnished her own
family-values image a decade ago with her crusade against vulgar
pop song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is both politically important and also she's a very
educated, strong woman,'' said Warshaw, who's newest book, ''Keys
to Power: Managing the Presidency,'' is due out this spring.
''She's a soccer mom, she's all of those women the president wants
to cultivate, and she's behind the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the endorsement of the first lady, who gets
sustained ovations wherever she speaks, and in Buffalo was hailed
as a potential U.S. Senate candidate in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love you,'' one man hollered as Mrs. Clinton took the
podium, in a cheer that seemed to echo the sentiments of the 67
percent of Americans whose support she enjoys _ up from an all-time
low of 48 percent in September 1994, following her ill-fated
efforts to reshape the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''That just suggests that what she's been doing, which is
standing by her husband, corresponds with what the public thinks
she should do,'' said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup
Poll, the Princeton, N.J., public opinion firm that provided the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The message to the public, said Warshaw, is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents that, if these people _ people both politically
and personally closest to him _ can forgive him his indiscretions,
then surely the American people can forgive him,'' she said. ''It's
a terrific image.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Mrs. Clinton, moreover, appears to be paying a
political price for helping to prop up Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton credits his wife's advocacy on issues like education,
health care and racial equality for her popularity, and misses no
chance to praise her accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fair to say that at least no one since Eleanor
Roosevelt has done as much with the Office of First Lady as Hillary
has done,'' Clinton told the Buffalo crowd, ''and I am grateful for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, suggest the country's views on Mrs.
Clinton are far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not like Eleanor Roosevelt,'' said Dallek, author of a
two-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson. ''What gives Hillary
Clinton cache at this point is the consequence of backing her
husband in the midst of a private scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Mrs. Clinton's motivations, few would expect Gore to be
anything but supportive in Clinton's hour of need.
</P>
<P>
   Who might have suspected, however, Gore would be helped by it?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a crowded pack of Democratic presidential hopefuls,
Gore leads with a commanding 47 percent of the party's support. His
nearest rival is House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., with
13 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate Gallup poll three weeks ago, 57 percent of
Americans surveyed said they had a favorable view of the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey having a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, that's statistically equivalent to Clinton's own
58 percent showing, suggesting that the public's views of Gore are
closely wedded to Americans' regard for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for both is that in the more widely discussed job
approval rating _ a measure of how Americans feel Clinton is
managing the country's affairs _ the president has held up far
better. In Gallup's most recent poll, conducted Jan. 15-17,
Clinton's job approval rating was 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's down from his 73 percent peak a month ago. Given his
personal predicament, however, Clinton's popularity remains
remarkably high.

ANALYSIS: ALTERNATING Q&AMP;A FORMAT APPEARS TO AID CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What had been designed to be a question-and-answer
time for senators who swore an oath to be impartial jurors in
President Clinton's impeachment trial turned on Friday into
rebuttal time for the opposing legal teams.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this outcome was a last-minute change in the
questioning format that ultimately might have worked to the White
House's advantage, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle had
originally agreed to have Democrats and Republicans use up to eight
hours each to question the White House counsels and the House
impeachment managers. The two sides were to have alternated every
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle suggested that the two parties alternate every
question instead. Lott agreed, telling reporters Thursday that
under the original format, ``It'd all go one way for a while, and
then the other way for a while, and we don't want this to be a
purely partisan procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Lott has tried mightily to avoid the
partisan taint that stained the House impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Republicans and Democrats alternating questions
was to prevent either side from gaining an edge. But overall, it
probably worked in Clinton's favor, senators said, because the
aggressive White House defense this week reversed much of the
momentum that the House managers created in their opening arguments
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and Republicans insisted Friday they did not
coordinate their questions in advance with the White House counsels
and the House prosecutors, respectively, or coach them.
</P>
<P>
   But the way each side was prepared to respond _ armed with
charts and scripted remarks _ it sure seemed like they did.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trial rules, senators submitted written queries,
screened by their party leaders, to Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, who read them aloud, identifying the authors. Senate
leaders had been collecting and culling proposed questions from
senators all week _ 70 were submitted by Republicans, 200 by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But just as legislators often discard prepared texts and speak
off the cuff, senators Friday seemed to improvise and spoon-fed
questions on tan-colored cards to one side or another.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans posed sympathetic questions that the House managers
eagerly seized on to vent frustrations that had built up while they
sat silently during the White House's three-day defense.
</P>
<P>
   Four Senate arch-conservatives _ Wayne Allard of Colorado, Jim
Bunning of Kentucky, Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Larry Craig of
Idaho _ startled Democrats by opening Friday's proceedings with the
first of many leading questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the opinion of the House managers that the president's
defense team in the presentation mischaracterized any factual or
legal issue in this case?''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., quickly scribbled
out a query asking the White House counsels to rebut the House
response. The White House lawyers handled the question with relish.
</P>
<P>
   As the partisanship in the questioning became obvious, senators
did not pretend to veil the motivations behind their queries. ``You
can read some people's thinking by the questions they ask,'' said
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.

 Keep Uncle Sam off Wall Street  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president's plan to get government into the stock market is
fraught with both political and economic peril, because any
nationalization of American industry would be hostile to everything
the United States symbolizes.
</P>
<P>
   There are myriad examples of how excessive government control of
an economy destroys the political, economic and social welfare of
most citizens. The most destructive cases in recent history have
been the Soviet Union, China's Maoist-style communism, Cambodia's
killing fields, North Korea's degradation and Cuba's
impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
   The damage, however, doesn't necessarily have to be linked to
savagery and cruelty. The latest example of what can go wrong is
Indonesia, where government rulers nurtured a system of crony
capitalism directing wealth to a favored few officials and
private-industry insiders while leaving most average citizens to
fight over their table scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would defend a Washington presence on Wall Street say
the proposed numbers would make up only a small part of corporate
America's overall capitalization. As a numbers exercise, this is
true, but it misses the point. In the realm of equity ownership,
control of only a small percentage of corporate stock can allow for
inordinate control of a company's management. When this dynamic is
combined with government's overarching power, the threat of
selective federal control of corporate America is amplified many
times over.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation with a politicoeconomic system as refined as ours,
the danger is not so much totalitarian oppression as it is the
inequitable distribution of capitalism's rewards. The example of
Indonesia, despite its less advanced state, shows how government
power over private enterprise distorts capital allocation when the
process is based on political rather than economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting too fine a point on it, the private sector hews
to much higher standards of fiduciary responsibility than the
public sector when it comes to the stewardship of other people's
money.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for this. First, the success of the
enterprise often depends on honorable conduct because a reputation
for dishonesty reduces access to always-scarce capital. Meantime,
there are laws and government regulations to encourage honesty
among those who otherwise might have difficulty curbing their
larcenous instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The result, to be sure, isn't always a perfect world, but it is
one a good deal more worthy of trust in fiduciary affairs than
government. If, for instance, any U.S. corporation tried to operate
a pension fund like the federal government runs Social Security,
the executives responsible would have long ago been jailed for
fraud and grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone imagine a Congress, an administration or a federal
bureaucracy that wouldn't exert influence on a corporate enterprise
partly owned by Washington when it suited the vested interests of
those in power? Given the insatiable need for campaign funding,
government ownership of companies would make political extortion
more endemic than is already the case.
</P>
<P>
   Government ownership of stocks, in short, would make government
officials the robber barons of the 21st century.

SHORT ITEMS ON INVESTING AND FUNDS WATCH

   Why Companies Were Stingy with Payouts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many investors who live off their dividend checks didn't have a
heck of a lot to cheer about in 1998. Despite the overall upbeat
performance of United States stocks, the total number of dividend
increases actually fell in 1998, to 2,047, from 2,139 the year
before, according to Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the total number of unfavorable payout actions _
either reductions in dividends or outright omissions _ increased to
145 in 1998 from 98 in 1997. That is the highest number of such
negative dividend actions since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a very generous dividend environment for
quite awhile,'' said Arnold Kaufman, editor of The Outlook, a
Standard &AMP; Poor's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   On one count, dividend-minded investors did make out a mite
better: The actual total amount of dividends paid on the S&AMP;P 500
index of large-capitalization stocks rose 4.5 percent in 1998,
compared with a 4.1 percent rise the year before. Still, that's far
below the average increase of 5.3 percent in the postwar period.
</P>
<P>
   So why the corporate stinginess when it comes to payouts? One
reason is that companies know many investors simply aren't
interested in dividends, because they are well aware of the taxes
they must pay when dividends are paid. Generally speaking, such
investors would rather see companies reinvest excess cash in their
businesses or use it to repurchase shares.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that the corporate earnings picture would darken in 1999
probably also played a part. Economists are expecting earnings
growth of just 5 percent or less in 1999, Kaufman said, so it made
plenty of sense for companies to hoard their cash instead of
showering it on shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   All this could change. If the markets turn in a tame performance
this year, investors may begin to clamor for higher dividends to
compensate. ``We see the market gains as being very much more
moderate than in the past four years, perhaps even single digits,''
Kaufman said. ``If investors see that, they may put more pressure
on companies to raise dividends.''
</P>

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QFRs to the Rescue &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of funds from Fidelity Investments managed
to turn in impressive performances in 1998, with 10 of the fund
giant's United States diversified offerings managing to beat the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index for the year.
</P>
<P>
   While there are probably a number of contributing factors, some
fund managers credit the firm's increased emphasis on a kind of
audit that has been pushed by Robert C. Pozen, who took over the
post of president in 1997. Every three months, each of the fund
company's managers sits down with Pozen to discuss each fund's
quarterly fund review, or QFR.
</P>
<P>
   The QFR's show not only by how much managers beat or
underperformed rival managers and their benchmark indexes, but why.
If similar funds topped them, did they ignore sectors or countries
that did well and that others had in their portfolios?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps in, say, the third quarter of 1998, a fund manager
lagged behind the S&AMP;P but did about the same as rival managers
because all of them underweighted utility stocks, which sharply
outperformed the broad market that quarter. The QFRs ``make you
think about places you may be missing'' in stock selection, said
Stephen DuFour, the Fidelity Balanced fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity officials, who bristle at any suggestion that they
are ``closet indexers,'' say the QFRs aren't intended to encourage
actively managed funds to have closer correlation with their
benchmark indexes. To say the QFRs push managers ``to avoid great
disparity'' within indexes ``is not true,'' said Karen Firestone,
who runs the Fidelity Large Cap Stock fund, one of the 10 that beat
the S&AMP;P.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming a more active role, senators posed
questions to defense and prosecution teams for the first time on
Friday, producing the semblance of debate in the impeachment trial
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors sought to repair the damage done by
White House lawyers to their carefully constructed chronologies
about the search for a job for Monica S. Lewinsky, whose sexual
relationship with Clinton led to the two articles of impeachment,
and the concealment of presents given to Ms. Lewinsky by the
president. They denied that their charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice had been loosely drawn or constitutionally
defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial
without bearing any of its burdens,'' Rep. Charles T. Canaday, a
prosecutor from Florida, asserted, as Charles F.C. Ruff, the White
House counsel, argued again that the impeachment articles were so
vague they would be thrown out of court but continued to resist all
Republican demands that witnesses be summoned.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the chief prosecutor, pressed
his case for witnesses, arguing that only witnesses could resolve
conflicts in testimony on several key points, even after Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., issued a statement promising to move on
Monday to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde wanted none of that and even proposed that senators ask
the president to testify, an idea the White House has dismissed out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by dismissing the articles of impeachment before you
have a complete trial, you are sending a terrible message to the
people of the country,'' he said. ``You're saying, I guess, perjury
is OK if it's about sex. Obstruction is OK, even though it is an
effort to deny a citizen a right to a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde continued: ``I know _ oh, do I know _ what an annoyance we
are in the bosom of this great body. But we're a constitutional
annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, said it was
inconceivable that anything could be gained by questioning Ms.
Lewinsky or Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the presidential confidant who
sought a job for her, or Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary, who hid
the presents under her bed. The Senate already has before it five
volumes of testimony, he said _ thousands of pages.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, `` called many, many,
many witnesses many, many, many times,'' Kendall reminded the
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, almost always gentlemanly and composed, came close to
losing his temper on the witness issue at one point. If the
Republicans so badly needed witnesses to nail down their case and
clear up inconsistencies, he demanded, how could they have called
for Clinton's removal from office without summoning witnesses of
their own before the House Judiciary Committee?
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives,'' he charged, ``violated their
constitutional responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions were posed by the senators through an arcane
process that forbade them to speak directly and required them to
submit their queries on lined cards to the respective party
leaders: Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi for the Republicans and
Sen. Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota for the Democrats. The
leaders screened them and sent them, one by one, with the parties
alternating, to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who then read
them to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Most went from Democrats to Democrats, Republicans to
Republicans. They were frequently vague and unchallenging, enabling
the House managers and the White House lawyers to veer off in
almost any direction they wished to. When Sen. Christopher T. Dodd
of Connecticut, a Democrat, objected that an answer to a question
he had put to Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican, was
not responsive, Rehnquist overruled his objection with the comment
that he was not inclined to ``police the responsiveness'' of
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Republicans from the House were prepared for some
of the questions, because they read out prepared answers and used
charts.
</P>
<P>
   The result was nothing like the cross-examination of a criminal
trial. It was more like the rebuttal and surrebuttal of a college
debate. But the two sides engaged each other more directly than
they had since the trial began eight days ago, and there was more
real debate than usual in the modern Senate, with its serial
speeches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, a stickler for form and punctuality at the Supreme
Court, added to a feeling of relaxation in the Senate chamber on
Friday. At the beginning, he told the lawyers, ``The chair will
operate on a rebuttable assumption that each question can be fully
and fairly answered in five minutes or less.'' In fact, many were
and many were not. Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, the first manager
to speak, took nine minutes on a broadly phrased question, and
Rehnquist did not cut him or anybody else off.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 questions were asked during the four-and-a-half-hour
proceeding, and more will be put during a session expected to last
most of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides debated whether overt threats were required to
prove intimidation of a witness, the Democrats saying yes and the
Republicans no. There was more argument about whether private acts
or only official acts could be subject to impeachment. And the
lawyers squabbled over whether the standards for the impeachment
trials of federal judges differed from those governing presidential
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more telling moments came when Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat, asked Rep. Lindsey O. Graham
of South Carolina, a Republican, whether he thought a president
should be impeached any time he committed a criminal offense,
regardless of its nature.
</P>
<P>
   No, Graham replied, ``I would want not my president removed for
trivial offenses.'' But it was no trivial offense, he suggested,
when Clinton ``coached'' Ms. Currie with a series of questions
about Ms. Lewinsky shortly after his deposition in the Paula Jones
case, intended, he later said, ``to refresh my memory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe he was refreshing his memory when he asked his
secretary, `I never touched her, did I?' '' Graham said. ``I
believe you should only remove a president who in a calculated
fashion puts the legal and political interest of himself over the
good of the nation in a selfish way _ that you only should remove a
president who, after being begged by everybody in the country,
`Don't go into a grand jury and lie,' and he in fact lied.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of Clinton's deposition in the Jones case, which
brought the Lewinsky matter to light, came up repeatedly. The
Republicans contended that Clinton had lied in it; the White House
lawyers said he had evaded, answered incompletely, misled but had
not committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he had, Clinton's lawyers said, it was a moot question,
because the House had rejected the Judiciary Committee's article
covering the Jones case. Not so, said the Republicans. Because the
president affirmed his statements in the Jones case when he
testified before the Lewinsky grand jury, he had piled perjury upon
perjury. But he had not affirmed them, Ruff insisted.
</P>
<P>
   So it went all afternoon, back and forth, with a little
name-calling to enliven things. The Republicans built ``straw
men,'' said Ruff; the White House had provided ``a lesson in legal
schizophrenia,'' said Rep. James E. Rogan, perhaps the most
hard-edged of the prosecutors.

RAFTER, STILL VULNERABLE AT HOME, FALLS TO ENQVIST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ It is too late for Patrick Rafter to
whisper in the tournament director Paul McNamee's ear about
changing the Australian Open this year. Too late to suggest nicely
_ this is Rafter, after all _ that the hardcourt surface be made
quicker and the balls lighter so that Rafter's serve-and-volley
style can play as well at home as it does in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it was Thomas Enqvist's turn to remind the third-seeded
Rafter, and the nation that admires him, of his limitations. Along
the way, the straight-talking and flat-hitting Swede reminded the
tennis world that he is playing as well as anyone this January.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has won the U.S. Open the past two years, but in eight
appearances in Melbourne he has never advanced past the fourth
round. His legs are still powerful, his reflexes still quick and
his hair still a little too long and unkempt for the taste of some
older Australians, yet his game is not quite the same at Melbourne
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the conditions suited him really well, and I think he
played too big and strong for me,'' Rafter said after Enqvist
dismantled him, 6-4, &QC; 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. His loss means that Pete
Sampras, who chose to skip this tournament to rest, will remain No.
1 when this Grand Slam event ends.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was hardly a reaffirming day for the pecking
order. Marc Rosset, a mountain of a man from Switzerland, put an
end to Britain's hopes by defeating sixth-seeded Tim Henman in
straight sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 7-5. In the night session, in a
match played indoors after the retractable roof on Center Court was
closed because of rain, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa upset
ninth-seeded Richard Krajicek, 6-7 (1-7), 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   With only half the third round complete, only five of the 16
men's seeded players remain and, for the first time in Australian
Open history, all four top-seeded players are out at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of top 10 players out there that aren't in the
top 10,'' Rafter said. ``The men's game is very close.
Unfortunately, it's not like women's tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   In years past that observation might have rung true, but Friday
provided plenty of evidence to the contrary. First came Maria
Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo's perplexingly lopsided 6-3, 6-0 upset of
third-seeded Jana Novotna, the reigning Wimbledon champion. Then
came Chanda Rubin's 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-4 victory over 15th-seeded
Natasha Zvereva. Last came Emilie Loit's 7-5, 6-1 defeat of
ninth-seeded Conchita Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attitudes are changing,'' said the 20-year-old
Loit, who still admitted she had to stop trembling at 5-0 before
closing out the match. ``I think there is a psychological
difference now, and the more examples there are of players in the
top 100 beating players in the top 10, the more it will keep
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a disastrous tournament for the Spanish. Of the 22
Spaniards who came here, including Alex Corretja and the reigning
French Open champions Carlos Moya and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, only
Sanchez Lorenzo remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for myself, but I'm a little sad for my
friends,'' said Sanchez Lorenzo, a baseliner ranked 65th who lost
in the first round of every Grand Slam event last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just still in a state of shock,'' said Novotna, who could
not remember when she had last lost a set at love, ``really not
knowing what went wrong, and it was just a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rubin, a once-promising career has been derailed since
mid-1996 by a broken bone in her right hand, subsequent surgery to
remove part of the bone and six months of rehabilitation. Defeating
Zvereva should help her regain the form that made her a
semifinalist here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just out here working hard for as long as I can,'' the
30th-ranked Rubin said. ``I feel like I can do as well as I did and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin was trading ground strokes with Zvereva, Rosset was
firing huge forehands and first serves at Henman. Rosset's next
opponent, Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, is well within the
long reach of the 6-foot-7-inch Swiss. Enqvist's next opponent is
Australia's other main attraction, Mark Philippoussis, who rumbled
past Jan Kroslak of the Slovak Republic, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist, who won his first tournament of the year in Adelaide,
has yet to lose in 1999. But he has often struggled in Grand Slam
events (his best performance was a quarterfinal finish here in
1996), and injuries to his ankle and foot have forced him to miss
significant playing time the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Against Rafter on Friday, however, Enqvist's second serve was
too strong, and his shots from the baseline often too deep and
forceful, to allow the Australian to attack consistently.
Meanwhile, the Swede was returning Rafter's serve with considerable
success.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Rafter, with his unpretentious
manner and love of a pristine beach, will ever win his national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see it a little bit quicker still,'' he said of
the courts here. ``If you look at the U.S. Open, where I've had my
best results and Philippoussis has had his best results, it
definitely suits us with those conditions. But that's a pretty
greedy thing to ask of the tournament director.''

LUMET'S REMAKE OF `GLORIA' REVIVES A STRONG PREMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though it came out as recently as 1980, John Cassavetes'
``Gloria'' is actually a prime candidate for a remake. Generally
regarded as one of the maverick director's low points, it's a movie
that failed both at the box office and with the critics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, everyone seemed to love its premise _ an
ex-gang moll and a child marked for gangland execution on the run
together _ and it worked as a vehicle for the director's wife, Gena
Rowlands, who earned a best actress Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   So why not try it again? This time with a more reliable genre
director _ Sidney Lumet, say? _ and with a star like Sharon Stone,
who, though six years younger than Rowlands when she played the
part, is no stranger to playing aging gun molls, witness her best
actress Oscar nomination for `Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   And, happily, the mix of Stone, Lumet and ``Gloria'' gels. It
definitely has its weak moments, but ``Gloria'' powers along rather
nicely as a thriller, and Stone _ complete with Brooklyn accent _
is surprisingly believable in the (heavily reworked) role.
</P>
<P>
   This Gloria is not a grandmotherly ex-moll who lives next door
to the endangered child, but a fairly smashing looking younger
woman just released from three years in a Florida prison _ having
taken the rap for her Irish gangster boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   When she confronts the boyfriend (Jeremy Northam) in his
Manhattan digs, she discovers his men have just killed the entire
family of a turncoat gang bookkeeper, except for a seven-year-old
boy (Jean-Luke Figueroa) they hold prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Furious with her ex-beau for never visiting her and sure the boy
is about to be murdered, she steals him (and an incriminating
computer disk his father gave him) and takes off. The rest of the
movie has the gangsters trying to track the fugitives down, as they
bond as surrogate mother-and-son.
</P>
<P>
   If the film has any real problem, it's that it comes off as
being too calculated a star vehicle, with too many ``big'' scenes
designed to showcase Stone's talent _ to the point that she
frequently seems to be overacting. The film would benefit from a
few more low-voltage moments.
</P>
<P>
   The script also suffers from a strange schizophrenia, in that
Stone looks like a million dollars, but people _ a hotel clerk, a
pawnbroker, everyone she encounters, in fact _ constantly react to
her with instant contempt, as if she's a frumped-up Rowlands, a
complete nonentity.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she gets on a bus but is short two quarters of the
fare. Turning to a bus-load of New York men, she asks for help. All
eyes look at her, then blankly out the window. Since she could have
just stepped out of a Victoria's Secret catalog, the scene is
absurd: the woman would be drowning in quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she gives a solid, watchable performance. She may not
have the instant sympathy of a Meg Ryan or Gwyneth Paltrow, but she
projects a street-smart intelligence and tough-cookie determination
as charismatically as any actress in films today. Her scenes with
her young co-star are warm and credible, without ever being
maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not in the league with his classics (a long list that
includes ``12 Angry Men,'' ``Dog Day Afternoon'' and ``Network''),
director Lumet gives the film zip, style and uniformly good
performances _ not just Stone but Northam and (especially) George
C. Scott as an aging Irish Godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite these obvious selling points, Columbia has
apparently decided to throw this movie away. Indeed, it must be the
first major studio star vehicle since ``The Avengers'' to open
without a press screening. (Why? Columbia's official response is a
damning: ``No comment'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria'' may be no masterpiece, but it's a lot better than
half the junk that studio has released with both a press screening
and a mouthful of superlatives. Whatever Columbia's reasons for
dumping the movie, a director with the track record of a Lumet
certainly deserves a little more respect.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria. Directed by Sidney Lumet. Screenplay by Steven Antin.
Cast: Sharon Stone, Jean-Luke Figueroa, Jeremy Northam, Cathy
Moriarty, George C. Scott. Columbia Pictures. 108 minutes. Rated R
for violence and language.

IF YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SEND A FREE E-CARD, TRY 
 (WWW.BLUEMOUNTAINARTS.COM)  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Wash., Kansas)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ It comes as no surprise to learn that the
headquarters of Blue Mountain Arts, a greeting card company that
set up shop here in 1971, used to be a hot tub palace. The tubs are
gone, but it is not hard to imagine the company's founders, Stephen
Schutz and Susan Polis Schutz, kicking back in the buff in the
steaming water. The image fits nicely with their self-proclaimed
mission: to help people communicate their deepest emotions.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that this touchy-feely principle has
helped propel Blue Mountain to the very top of the fierce world of
e-commerce: its site is now the Web's most popular ``shopping''
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at a time when e-commerce companies attract loads of
venture capital and promises of through-the-roof stock offerings,
Blue Mountain is the rare case of a site that has rocketed to the
top tier of the Internet without cashing in _ yet. Instead, the
company is trying to pull off a truly tricky feat: staying true to
its original mission to serve the cause of heartfelt sentiment
while starting to be serious about making money.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the family that runs Blue Mountain reflects the
twin impulses that rule the Internet: an openhearted,
free-wheeling, spread-the-word sort of place that has also been
profoundly altered by the temptation of potential gold.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Blue Mountain was a small card and book
publisher, featuring for the most part the inspirational art and
poetry of the Schutzes and a coterie of like-minded contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Full of bald announcements of emotion and feel-good pep talks _
card titles include ``Believe in Miracles!'' and ``To My Daughter,
With Love'' _ the cards captured a loyal but limited following. The
company is privately held, but according to its own estimates, Blue
Mountain, with about 100 employees, accounts for just about 1
percent of the $6.3 billion greeting card market. Hallmark, by
comparison, accounts for 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, the Schutzes, both 53, started a Web site
with free e-cards. They were an instant hit. Blue Mountain cards
began popping up in e-mailboxes all across the country, with
colorful animated greetings for just about every occasion, from
embracing polar bears for Hugging Day to an unfurling rose for
Robert Burns Day.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has never paid to advertise its Web site
(www.bluemountainarts.com), its growth has been staggering, even by
Internet standards. In November, it passed Amazon.com as the most
visited shopping site, according to Media Metrix Inc., the leading
Internet audience measurement firm. (Even though Blue Mountain
gives its cards away, analysts still count it as commerce.)
</P>
<P>
   In December, it became the 10th-most-visited site on the whole
Web, putting it in a league with America Online and Yahoo. Blue
Mountain has now reached 21 percent of the entire Web audience, or
some 12.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to e-commerce, the company is so far out in front
of Hallmark and American Greetings, both of whose Web sites charge
a fee for e-cards, that Jared Schutz, 24, the founders' son and the
company's vice president for business development, calls them
``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Blue Mountain's Web site has flourished by giving
cards away, the need for money has grown. For starters,
competitors, backed by big venture capital dollars, are using
advertising and professional-quality graphics to cut into Blue
Mountain's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Web site is being carried by the Schutzes'
publishing business, which has experienced 20 percent annual growth
since the company went online, but it is a drain on both finances
and management energies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the lure of loot. Mention making a profit and
Susan Polis Schutz sounds a bit annoyed. ``Frankly, I don't care
about that,'' she says curtly. Her ambition is for the site to
become the ``poetry and emotional center for communications on the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains, in part, why the Schutz family has turned away a
steady stream of interested buyers and investors. Still, the
opportunity to go commercial has piqued at least the second
generation's interest. ``When you constantly have New York
investment bankers beating down your doorstep,'' Jared Schutz said,
``it doesn't require too much of a leap of faith to realize that we
have something enormous on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now, somewhat paradoxically, is what, exactly, the
most formidable merchant on the Web can sell. Not cards. Users now
expect those free. At the end of November, Blue Mountain started
experimenting with taking ads from 10 partners _ the biggest are
Discover Card, barnesandnoble.com, and Qwest. Ms. Schutz calls the
ads, which are small and not featured on the main page, ``the least
obnoxious way'' to support the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain has developed the kind of personal relationship
with its customers that most merchants can only dream of. Craig in
Canada, for example, recently e-mailed: ``Tonight, I chose the
words of Susan Polis Schutz to ask the woman I love to marry me.
Tomorrow, she should pick up her e-mail in Jakarta, Indonesia, and
give me her answer. What joy this will bring to my life if she
consents to be my wife.'' (She said yes.)
</P>
<P>
   But this intimacy also carries hazards. James McQuivey, senior
analyst for online retail strategies with Forrester Research Inc.,
said, ``It is an extremely delicate community. Advertising is OK
with them as long as it is perceived as an extension of the
original service. The minute it goes from a serendipitous `I am
just thinking of helping you out' to the hard sell, they will lose
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the job of advancing bluemountainarts.com's business side
has fallen to Jared Schutz. Though close to his parents, he appears
to be cut from different cloth. A recent graduate of Princeton, he
has the pallor and stoop of Bill Gates and a hint of the same
ambitions. While his parents spent their early 20s traveling around
the country selling artwork from their beat-up van, Jared, at a
similar age, was busy co-founding and selling several Web
businesses _ including American Information Systems, Stardot
Consulting and Sportscape. Someday, he said, he would like to run
for public office.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Blue Mountain has enormous commercial potential.
``The future is electronic greeting cards, and we have a 70 percent
market share.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlines a plan for expansion that would do any Silicon
Valley charger proud: teaming up aggressively with other Web sites,
hiring a chief executive with experience in expanding a business
rapidly, recruiting top programmers to improve the site's graphics
and developing his own synergistic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   One example of Jared's initiative has been persuading his
parents to invest in a start-up he created called Proflowers.com.
Proflowers, which gets free advertising on the Blue Mountain site,
allows customers to order fresh-cut flowers directly from growers,
eliminating the flower shops.
</P>
<P>
   Such commercial game plans may sound slick for Blue Mountain,
but the competition plans to go much further. Tony Levitan,
co-founder of E-greetings Network, No. 2 in the field, said his
company, which used to sell some cards but made all of them free in
November, will catch and pass Blue Mountain by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Levitan sees it, his rival has done him a great favor by
raising awareness of e-cards. He says that the venture capital that
has poured in has helped him to create a more sophisticated site
(egreetings.com) than Blue Mountain's and to attract cards
featuring name brands like King of The Hill and Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, a recent Stanford MBA with no do-good pretensions, has
a clear plan to exploit his free site. To use e-greetings, a user
must register information like birthday, gender, and address, none
of which Blue Mountain asks for.
</P>
<P>
   He says he can package this data with information about a
visitor's emotional state garnered by the choice of card (grief,
celebration) and sell it to advertisers so they can channel their
pitches more accurately. After sending a Valentine's Day card, a
30-year-old man will be shown an ad for a bouquet of flowers in the
$60 range. A 20-year-old man sending the same card would see an ad
for a $20 bouquet. A new parent sending birth announcements would
be shown a banner for the Pampers site. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proven that we can affect the next click after sending
the e-greeting,'' he brags.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced at different times that high-profile corporate rivals
were engaged in unfair practices, it has sued and prevailed. In
1983, it won undisclosed damages and a cease-and-desist order
against Hallmark for copying Blue Mountain's designs and trying to
exclude its cards from retail outlets. Last month, a California
judge handed it a temporary injunction against Microsoft, whose
junk mail filter had been tossing unread Blue Mountain cards
straight into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   For Blue Mountain, however, the looming decision is not so much
about fighting the competition but deciding whether to join them.
If it does, what will happen to the company?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet,'' said Howard Rheingold, author of ``The
Virtual Community'' and a long-time Web watcher, ``it is assumed
people are in business to sell out, not to build something they can
pass along to their grandkids.''

MILITARY DISCHARGES FOR HOMOSEXUALITY DOUBLE IN 5 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five years after the Clinton administration adopted
its ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gay men and lesbians in
the military, the armed forces discharged more people as
homosexuals in 1998 than in any year since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released by the Defense Department late Friday show that
the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps discharged 1,145 gay men
and lesbians in the last fiscal year, a 13 percent increase over
the year before and nearly double the number in 1993, the last year
before the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which put Clinton at odds with the military early in
his presidency, was intended to allow gay men and lesbians to serve
in the military for the first time, but the number of discharges
for homosexuality has steadily increased since then.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the rise were sharply contested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the figures late on a Friday afternoon, a time
often used to disclose unfavorable news, the Pentagon said the
increases reflected a tendency by members of the armed services to
volunteer information about their sexual orientation as a way to
get out of the military.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for gay rights argued that the steady increase
reflected a failure of the policy. The discharges, they say, showed
that base and unit commanders were continuing to investigate the
sexual orientation of members of the armed forces in their ranks
despite the ``don't ask'' provisions of the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military leaders have turned a blind eye to the continued
asking, pursuit and harassment of gays, lesbians and bisexuals
serving our country,'' said C. Dixon Osborne, one of the executive
directors of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an
organization of lawyers who advise gay men and lesbians in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., who has long advocated letting gay
men and lesbians serve in the military, said the increases ``should
set off alarm bells as to whether `don't ask, don't tell' is
working properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Meehan and 23 other representatives wrote a letter
to Defense Secretary William Cohen taking issue with the Defense
Department's claims that declarations of homosexuality are
voluntary. Even so, the letter said, the department's statement did
not ``explain why there has been a consistent increase in
gay-related discharges in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Air Force had the largest increase: 414
discharges, compared with 309 in 1997. The Army also had a large
increase, with 310 discharges, compared with 197 the year before.
The Navy's numbers fell to 345, from 413 in 1997, and the Marine
Corps had a slight drop, to 76 from 78.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy de Leon, undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, issued a statement saying 87 percent of the discharges
involved voluntary statements from members of the armed services.
He also noted that the 1,145 gay discharges represented less than
one-tenth of 1 percent of the nearly 1.4 million people now in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said a large number of the declarations of
homosexuality _ 293 of the 414 _ took place at the service's basic
training camp at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Most of
those, the officials said, involved recruits who also requested
immediate discharge during the six weeks of basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Barbara Claypoll, a spokeswoman at the Air Force's
Education and Training Command, said one reason for the increase
was that before the current policy took effect, the service did not
count gay men and lesbians who were dismissed while at Lackland as
discharges.
</P>
<P>
   A survey ordered last year by Gen. Lloyd Newton, commander of
the Education and Training Command, found that in the vast majority
of cases the enlistees declared their sexual preferences to get a
quick discharge, Claypoll said. She added that many appeared to be
doing so falsely, as an excuse for getting out of the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, offered this
explanation: ``Throughout society there are more people declaring
their sexual orientation _ coming out of the closet, shall we say _
and there's no reason the military should be any different.''

SWISS BANKS AND VICTIMS OF NAZIS REACH ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for Holocaust victims, Jewish groups and
Swiss banks agreed late Thursday on some key elements of the $1.25
billion settlement of a lawsuit against the banks, including
identifying who can qualify for payments.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement involves two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, the lawyers agreed
on several broad classes of Holocaust survivors or heirs who can
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Included are the heirs of those who deposited money in Swiss
banks before World War II and later died in the Holocaust, as well
as those whose looted assets may have passed through Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement defines the victims or targets of Nazi persecution
as Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, Gypsies, homosexuals and the
physically or mentally disabled, said lawyers familiar with the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Others eligible for payments include those who were forced to
work for companies that kept money in Swiss banks or that used
slave labor. Jews who fled to Switzerland to escape the Nazis and
were then deported by the Swiss would also qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss banks were accused of profiting from the assets of
Holocaust victims, including those stolen from the victims. Under
the agreement, all companies incorporated in Switzerland or having
headquarters there would be released from further liability.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, The Associated Press reported, Swiss government
officials said in a statement, ``This settlement provides a closure
of all the financial claims raised against Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement still must be approved by U.S. District Judge
Edward Korman. Perhaps the most contentious phase of the case, how
to best distribute the money, will soon unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Because unclaimed Swiss bank accounts will account for only a
portion of the $1.25 billion settlement, the court must decide how
to distribute the rest. In recent months individuals and groups
have been proposing different plans for how to do so.

   Byrd family honored
</P>

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Seven months after the dragging death of James
Byrd Jr. and four days before the start of the capital murder case
for the first of three suspects charged in 49-year-old's brutal
death, members of the Byrd family received a national honor for the
way they responded to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Victorian Foundation on Thursday
presented the Byrd family with its annual Victoria Award for its
commitment to non-violence in dealing with the loss of its loved
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Byrds could very well have used the death of their loved
one, James Byrd Jr., to endorse all types of violence _ and been
justified in the eyes of many,'' Robin Zaruba, vice president of
the Victoria Foundation, said during a ceremony at the Holiday Inn
Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., they have seen a
mountaintop, and it has been their wisdom and fortitude that has
kept them on that mountaintop and not in the valley below, where so
many go in times of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria Foundation chose the Byrds over several nominees,
including Oprah Winfrey, Racehorse Hanes, Walter Umphrey and the
Rogers Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who display high degrees of humanitarian and
vocational merit receive the award each year. Past recipients
include Bob Hope and entertainer Howard Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett, acknowledged members of the
community for lending their support throughout the past seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man is an island,'' she said. ``We feed upon one another. I
not only accept this award for the Byrd family, but for the people
of Jasper, and for people all over the world who have had to
undergo trials and tribulations.''
</P>
<P>
   A life-changing event prompted Victoria Foundation president and
CEO, Ricky Jason to found the organization in 1995 as a means to
recognize individuals who make significant contributions to assist
their fellow man. After spending much of his childhood legally
blind, Jason's life changed forever when he received a corneal
transplant from renowned surgeon Dr. Richard Levacy.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Jasper, Beaumont and Port Arthur NAACP
chapters, attended the ceremony, as did Jasper city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Moore serenaded the Byrd family with his song ``I Won't
Complain'' from the Byrd-inspired album ``Love, Peace and
Harmony.'' Members of Houston-based Color Blind Entertainment set
up a table in the hotel lobby to sell cassettes, CDs and T-shirts
featuring Byrd's portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Jason, who also serves as co-founder of Color Blind
Entertainment and owns the original portrait of Byrd, set up the
painting next to the panel of Byrd family members.
</P>
<P>
   Since its unveiling at Lamar University in Beaumont a few months
ago, the portrait has appeared at the NAACP Image Awards, the YMCA
Awards, Rice University and has been viewed privately at a Beaumont
prison by blues legend B.B. King's son, Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait soon will go on display at its final stop in
Jasper. Jason said the family has not decided on a specific display
location for the painting.
</P>
<P>
   After just two weeks on display at Lamar's Dishman Art Gallery,
the portrait and frame _ which have a combined value of $500,000,
according to Jason _ sustained a cut in the right side of the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Jason believes someone intentionally damaged the frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to leave it like that to show there's still
some hate,'' he said. ``We're not going to take it out of the
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe someone also may have stolen a nameplate at
Byrd's grave site. The Byrd family has since replaced the
nameplate, Jason said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper city officials earlier this week held a ceremony to tear
down an iron fence that separated black and white graves for more
than than 160 years in the same cemetery where Byrd was laid to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Byrd died on June 6, 1998, after he was chained
behind a pickup and dragged down a county road. The murder trial of
William King, one of three white suspects in the slaying, begins
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not announced trial dates for two other
defendants in the murder case _ Shawn Berry, 23, and Russell
Brewer, 31. Prosecutors believe racial hatred provoked the killing.

EXPERT BEGINS AUTHENTICITY TEST ON TREASURE-FILLED CHEST FOUND IN
DESERT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A National Park Service expert departed Death
Valley National Park on Friday with photographs and tiny samples of
a battered chest and its contents that may have been left by a lost
Gold Rush expedition 149 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western Archeological and Conservation Center conservator
Gretchen Voeks will consult with experts and examine reference
books to try to authenticate dates for the find, park officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to follow up with a couple of things, possibly do
chemical analysis on some of the things she found,'' said Death
Valley National Park spokesman Tim Stone. ``She actually asked us
not to say much. ... She just doesn't want to say anything that's
negative or positive now.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of some of the objects may be verified by next week,
though chemical analysis of the samples Voeks scraped off objects
could take two weeks or so, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   The chest was found in November in a rocky alcove high in the
Panamint Mountains, Death Valley's western wall. Pearblossom
archeologist Jerry Freeman said he found the chest while
researching the possible route taken by the lost gold miners trying
to escape Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, his two adult daughters and two friends returned in
December on a backpacking expedition retracing the lost miners'
route. They retrieved the chest, at times having to lower it with
ropes down 20-foot cliffs, said Allan Smith, a documentary
filmmaker who was on the trek.
</P>
<P>
   The place was so hard to reach, he has no doubts the chest is
authentic, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The chest was turned over Jan. 5 to the National Park Service,
and officials are trying to verify its authenticity. Park officials
said the find, if authentic, would make a fabulous addition to
knowledge about the first white people to see North America's
lowest, hottest, driest spot.
</P>
<P>
   The chest contained gold and silver coins, bowls, books, a
flintlock pistol, plus a letter signed with the name of William
Robinson, one of the lost gold miners. He died 26 days and 200
miles later at the edge of what is now Palmdale. &QL;

CONSERVATIVES DISAGREE ABOUT CLINTON TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ When conservative evangelist Pat Robertson
suggested recently that Clinton was winning the public relations
war and that his Senate impeachment trial should be dismissed, it
jolted the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was fear of conservative backlash that some say
motivated GOP lawmakers to continue to press the case against
Clinton even though polls have shown the public wants the matter
swiftly concluded.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that all conservatives are singing from the same
hymnal.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Potomac River from the Senate proceedings, at the
annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a
number of participants said Friday they were shocked and bewildered
that Robertson was willing to admit defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they wanted the Senate to finish the trial and call
witnesses even if it appeared that there were not enough votes to
oust the president. The group applauded former Vice President Dan
Quayle, who is considering a bid for the White House, when he
commended the ``courage'' of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, and the GOP
managers for pressing the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is too early to surrender,'' said Andrea Sheldon,
executive director of the Family Values Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon said that even if Clinton is not ousted, she is
confident that his reputation has already been ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a loser,'' she said. ``You think some kid is going to
grow up and say I want to be Bill Clinton, I think his mom would
slap him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Robertson's comments, Sheldon said that good friends are
entitled to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But others were not as diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was crummy. I think he (Robertson) ought to keep
his mouth shut,'' said Van Arden, a stock broker from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Arden said Republican senators who vote to end the trial early
could face retribution from angry voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans back off and put their tails between their
legs, it will be much worse in terms of the electorate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those attending the conference of admitted Clinton
haters also acknowledged that there was a strong possibility that
the president would serve out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they, like most Americans, were weary of the scandal.
Others, particularly women, said there was no need to cross-examine
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky about the intimate
details of her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Clinton. But we still need to move on,'' said
Kathryn Baillie, a first-year law student at Regent University, the
Virginia Beach school founded by Robertson. While Baillie said the
Senate needed to finish the trial she added that it was not
necessary to hear from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of hearing about what happened to Monica Lewinsky.
She consented to it. She is no less guilty than Clinton,'' said
Baillie.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Atkiss, a college student from Dallas, said he was
``pleasantly surprised'' by Robertson's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was refreshing to see him with a realistic outlook,'' said
Atkiss, a senior at the University of Florida. ``It is something
most conservatives already know but don't want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon and Pam Watts, a couple from Washington state, differed on
how the trial should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Watts said the senators should call witnesses, including
Lewinsky, and ask the intimate questions.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be hearing all these details. We got the gist
of what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rotterman, a GOP consultant from North Carolina, however,
said that if the Republicans grill Lewinsky during prime time that
could change public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what the reaction of the public will be if Monica
Lewinsky gets up there and cries and says she was done wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotterman also said he did not believe the party will be hurt in
the 2000 elections because of the impeachment trial even though
polls now show voters unhappy with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years is an eternity in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of prolonging the Clinton trial has been on the
minds of Republican National Committee members meeting Friday in
Washington. They have watched in dismay as their party lost House
seats last year, in part attributed to the party's focus on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman of the RNC, Jim Nicholson, beat back a
challenge from Florida GOP Chairman Tom Slade on Friday, party
officials made it known that they expected him to do a better job
getting out the party's message, other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Tim Lambert, an RNC member from Lubbock, Texas,
who voted for Slade, said that he is not convinced that will be
possible until the trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   Texas GOP Chairwoman Susan Weddington, however, said the party
could do a better job of talking about public policy issues while
the trial is ongoing. Saying she was surprised by Robertson's
comments, Weddington said that it was important that the Senate
``adhere to the constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Senate trial, Weddington said, ``you want it to go away
but you want it completed in a proper way.''

LOUISVILLE NOT AN `ULTIMATUM GAME'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE _ The Bruins have described today's game as yet
another test of their mental mettle _ flying across country,
playing their first nonconference road game, facing a Top 25 team,
and so on. Truth is, it's not a test at all. It's a quiz, lacking
the NCAA Tournament repercussions that accompanied past matchups
with Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a victory would look good for the Bruins. Despite its loss
Thursday to Cincinnati, Louisville has a solid power rating, an
upset of Kentucky and two victories over DePaul to its credit.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA's youth reduces the consequence of its January games _
whether the opponent is Arizona, Stanford or Louisville _ and
places its postseason fate on success (or failure) in February and
early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to discount this Louisville game, but I wouldn't
say it's an ultimatum game for UCLA,'' said a member of the NCAA
Selection Committee who requested anonymity. ``There's a long road
ahead. UCLA is so young, you have to look at growth. I'm looking
for improvement from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10's overall strength also undermines the
significance of today's game. In recent years, with a weak Pac-10,
UCLA had few opportunities to face highly rated teams in league.
That placed abnormal emphasis on intersectional matchups with
Louisville and Duke. But this year, Stanford, Arizona, Cal,
Washington and Oregon provide the Bruins with 10 chances to improve
their power rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA will have plenty of other opportunities in league play,''
the Selection Committee member said. ``The conference's power
rating will help this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduced significance does not temper UCLA's task, however.
The Cardinals are not particularly big _ their tallest starter is
6-foot-7 _ but they play tenacious defense and shoot well from
3-point range (37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cardinals are banned from postseason play for
recruiting violations _ they are awaiting the results of an appeal
_ their urgency is unending and reflected in their spirited play.
The ban seemingly has had the greatest impact on Louisville's
seniors, guard Cameron Murray and center Alex Sanders, who combine
for 25 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team really seems to be playing hard and improving game
to game,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``You look at them and it's
not as though they have the same personnel as Duke, Kansas or
Kentucky. And yet they beat Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the 10 a.m. tipoff (PST), the Bruins traveled Thursday
and practiced in Freedom Hall on Friday. They will be without
starting center Dan Gadzuric, who sprained his right ankle at USC.
Freshman guard Ray Young will start in Gadzuric's place, giving
UCLA a small, quick lineup that will mirror Louisville
athletically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough for our young guys,'' said UCLA's only
senior, guard Brandon Loyd. ``It's a different atmosphere than
we're used to. Just like the Oregon State game (UCLA's first on the
road) was hard, this will be hard. It's not the friendly confines
of Pauley.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jim Nicholson overcame an energetic challenge and
was overwhelming re-elected as chairman of the Republican National
Committee on Friday after pleas from his supporters that he should
not be blamed for the party's discouraging performance in
November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, a real-estate developer from Colorado, is now poised
to guide the party through what will be a crucial two-year period
as Republicans try to win back the White House and hang on to their
slim majorities in the House and Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Republican Party chairman Tom Slade ran an aggressive
challenge against Nicholson, pointing to the party's defeats and
arguing that the chairman fell short as a national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, many party members _ conceding that Nicholson
had his flaws _ said they stood by him because he had raised record
millions of dollars for the party and because they liked him
personally. The vote, by secret ballot, was 127 for Nicholson and
36 for Slade.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech at a party convention here, Nicholson
expressed gratitude for his election, saying, ``If I were told I
had only two years left to live, I would want to live them as
chairman of the Republican National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   He then launched into a critique of President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore _ and a defense of the party's pursuit of the
impeachment matter. ``In politics,'' he said, ``character is doing
what's right even when everyone is looking at the polls. We cannot
be a political party that decides what it believes based on the
polls. Yes, we Republicans do worry that people won't understand.
But Democrats live in mortal fear that people will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman also asserted that while Clinton ``has few ironclad
beliefs,'' one that he does have is that ``winning is the sole
judge of right and wrong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a conference of conservatives across the river in Virginia,
former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is assembling a presidential
campaign, joined the chorus and derided Gore as promoting a
platform of ``New Age socialists.'' Gore's office shot back,
attacking Quayle as ``a medieval conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson was a little-known party veteran when he was elected
two years ago on the sixth ballot after party members could not
choose between two more prominent contenders. Despite his
re-election, many prominent fund raisers and party members said
they had qualms about his leadership and what they complained was a
failure to articulate a clear agenda for the party. And many party
members said they worried that the impeachment trial could end up
damaging the party.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nicholson's most enthusiastic backers were mindful of the
problems facing him and Republicans. In nominating Nicholson,
Arizona state party chairman Michael Hellon sounded defensive,
saying, ``The complaint I hear most often is that we lack a
coherent message. I agree. But that wasn't Jim Nicholson's fault.''
He blamed the party's leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Another backer of Nicholson, New York state chairman William
Powers said everyone knew that Republicans did not do as well in
the 1998 elections ``as we would have liked, and we need to learn
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade said after the election that the party was loathe to oust
Nicholson because ``it's hard to get a group of people wanting to
kick out of office a genuinely nice man.'' He also said the
chairman helped himself by dispensing ``huge amounts of money'' to
state parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some party members have expressed concern that Nicholson may not
be forceful enough to serve as something of a referee for the
growing field of presidential candidates. Republicans here also
speculated that Nicholson survived because. after the ouster of
Speaker Newt Gingrich in the wake of the elections. there was no
outcry for another dramatic move.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, is planning to
announce on Saturday changes in its top leadership. The biggest
beneficiary may be Vice President Al Gore, who has begun assembling
a presidential campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Democratic Party chairman Joseph Andrew will take over
as national chairman and will run the party's day-to-day
operations. Andrew is so close to the vice president that Gore had
offered him a job as his deputy chief of staff. Andrew will replace
Steve Grossman, who resigned as national chairman in December.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer will stay on as general chairman.
But in an effort to reach out to minorities, two other Gore allies
have been tapped for newly-created positions of party co-chairs:
Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, one of the nation's leading black
politicians, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California, who is
Hispanic.

   Few Willing Wallets On an Opening Night &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find a business leader or social bigwig at the
opening-night party of the Winter Antiques Show who actually bought
something. Evelyn Lauder, wife of Leonard Lauder, chairman of the
Whitney Museum, proudly displayed her acquisition, a 1939 sharkskin
paper cutter. But browsing was the order of the day at the party in
the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a voyeur,'' confessed art dealer Joan Washburn. Morley
Safer, the ``60 Minutes'' correspondent, said, ``I'm not buying;
I'm admiring,'' And Ronald O. Perelman, owner of Revlon, uttered
the classic ``I'm just looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shoppers held out at least a thread of hope to the charity
event's organizers. Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern
Art, said she and her husband, Daniel Shapiro, a lawyer, had just
bought a country hideaway, ``so I am looking for furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Stribling, the real-estate executive, said she
particularly liked a pair of 19th-century Italian chairs. Her
husband, Guy N. Robinson, a partner in Highland Asset Management,
retorted that the couple had plenty of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Tober, chairwoman of the American Craft Museum in
Manhattan and former editor of Bride's and Your New Home magazines,
said she had ``edited the whole show down to a wish list of three
things'': a set of china, an art nouveau choker and a David Webb
bracelet. When someone reminded her husband, Donald G. Tober,
chairman of Sugar Foods, that the couple's wedding anniversary was
just around the corner, he rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With a similar marital event looming for John D. Gilliam, chief
financial officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and his
wife, Deane Gilliam, Gilliam took preventive action, asking: ``What
are you going to buy me, Dear?''
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of ticket prices as high as $1,000, the
benefit for the East Side House Settlement in the South Bronx did

Kopelman, president of Chanel and chairman of the show committee,

made about 1840,'' with silver mounts and a candle holder on top.

   The art publisher Nicholas Callaway insists that his effort to
publish high-quality books about golf will be revived, even though
the enterprise is looking more and more like a missed swing.
According to publishing industry sources, the project's de facto
editor in chief, David McCormick, was given 20 minutes this month
to clean out his desk in the old mill building at South Street
Seaport that housed a dwindling staff of 20 editors, writers and
designers for Callaway Golf Media Ventures. Soon afterward, the
staff's computers were removed. McCormick didn't return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The project started more than a year ago as a joint venture of
Callaway Editions and the Callaway Golf Co., founded by Callaway's
father, Eli Callaway. But with sagging sales, the golf maker cut
back its involvement in the project, which had an initial budget of
$18 million and had commissioned writers like George Plimpton, Mark
Singer and John Seabrook.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, most of the staff members were laid off but allowed
to keep using the office. McCormick was kept on as a consultant
until his last week. Many of the commissioned writers were left in
limbo about whether to finish their pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Callaway said he expected the project to be revived and
publishing its first list of three books next year. A company
spokesman said a deal was in the works under which Callaway Golf
would transfer its share of the company to Callaway Editions for a
nominal price, forgive its debts, give it some operating money and
license its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan for the list is that it's going to be varied and
growing,'' Callaway said. &QL;

   Some of the savviest players on Wall Street are paying homage to
one of the most popular professors at the Columbia Business School
_ by going to his classes. Among those showing up this month for
Bruce Greenwald's two-day crash course in value investing were
Herbert Allen III, son of Herbert Allen, head of Allen &AMP; Co., the
investment bank; Michael Overlock, former head of investment
banking at Goldman Sachs, and Brad Patelli, a vice president with
Angelo Gordon, the arbitrage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted to take it,'' said Patelli, who recalled that
demand was so strong for the course when he was a student at the
school that he couldn't get in.

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most senior executive of Microsoft Corp. to testify at its
antitrust trial delivered an unflinching defense of the company's
practices Friday and an attack on the testimony of industry
executives who appeared as government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 160 pages of written testimony, Paul Maritz, a group vice
president at Microsoft, described the software industry as one of
fierce competition and relentless change, creating wealth and
benefiting consumers. And he warned of the danger of government
meddling.
</P>
<P>
   It would set a ``very bad precedent,'' he wrote, ``if a rule
were established, ostensibly with the objective of promoting
competition, that actually impeded efforts to compete through
product improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maritz reserved his most forceful and detailed testimony for
trying to discredit the courtroom accounts of executives from
Netscape Communications Corp., Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   These executives testified for the government earlier in the
trial, alleging that Microsoft used its market power to bully
partners and rivals. In these episodes, the government contends,
Microsoft was pursuing an illegal campaign to shield its monopoly
in operating-system software for personal computers from the
challenge posed by Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   As the executive in charge of most of Microsoft's software
development and marketing, Maritz played a central role in creating
and carrying out that corporate campaign. He is expected to take
the stand Monday afternoon, the first of nine Microsoft executives
scheduled to testify for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Intel, Maritz described the relationship between
the two companies as a highly productive partnership of equals,
with occasional disputes that ``become intense from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense disputes in the antitrust case involved mainly
Intel's work on Internet and multimedia software and its support
for Netscape, Microsoft's rival and the pioneer in software used to
browse the World Wide Web. Intel's main business is producing
microprocessors, the brains of PCs, but it also develops some
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states say Microsoft bullied Intel
into shelving software work that conflicted with Microsoft's plans
and curbing its support for Netscape's technology.
</P>
<P>
   To bend Intel to its will, the government charges, Microsoft
threatened to withhold software support for a new generation of
Intel microprocessors. Because more than 90 percent of PCs run
Microsoft's Windows operating system, any threat to withhold
Windows support for a microprocessor could severely damage Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Maritz describes Intel's software work as
second-rate development that ``often falls below the high quality
standards of Microsoft software.'' The temporary delay in support
for Intel's MMX chip in 1995, Maritz says, was actually Intel's
fault, resulting from what Microsoft regarded as the chip maker's
overly zealous approach to intellectual-property claims.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz also attacked the credibility of Steven McGeady, the
Intel executive who appeared as a government witness. McGeady
testified that in a private meeting in September 1995, Maritz
described Microsoft's strategy toward Netscape as seeking to ``cut
off their air supply'' _ by giving away free the Microsoft browser,
while Netscape's business depended on selling its browser.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Maritz wrote, ``I never said, in the presence
of Intel personnel or otherwise, that Microsoft would `cut off
Netscape's air supply' or words to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Maritz characterized McGeady as having a deep-seated bias
against Microsoft _ a witness whose accusations ``speak volumes
about his attitude toward Microsoft and the credibility of his
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal assault on McGeady's testimony could be risky, some
legal experts say, by inviting the court to choose whom to believe
_ the Intel executive or Maritz. If Maritz seems less convincing,
the credibility of his own testimony is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In one e-mail already in evidence, Maritz wrote that McGeady
posed a problem in getting Intel to curb its support for a
competing Internet technology, adding, ``Unfortunately he has more
IQ than most there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz strongly disputes the government's allegation that
Microsoft forced Apple to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer its
main browser by threatening to stop developing its Office
productivity programs for Apple's Macintosh systems.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for reluctance to continue developing word
processing, spreadsheet and other programs for the Macintosh,
Maritz wrote, was that in 1996 and 1997 Apple seemed on the verge
of failure. Many within the company, including Maritz, believed
that Microsoft's software developers could be better used writing
programs that promised higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz cites an e-mail written in November 1996 by the head of
Office development to Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. The
Macintosh ``is perceived as in decay,'' the testimony quotes from
the e-mail. ``There is broad resistance within the ranks to doing
this release,'' which was Mac Office 97.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another source of friction between the two companies, Maritz
wrote, was a long-running patent dispute. At the time, Apple's
management claimed that Microsoft's Windows and other programs used
intellectual property protected by Apple patents and sought $1.2
billion to settle the matter _ a claim Microsoft regarded as
outlandish, Maritz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after Steve Jobs took over as interim chief executive
in July 1997, the patent claims, the Office development issue and
others were settled. On Aug. 5, 1997, Microsoft announced a deal in
which it invested $150 million in Apple, the patent issue was
settled for an additional undisclosed payment, Microsoft agreed to
develop Mac Office, and Apple agreed to make Internet Explorer its
preferred browser.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer, Maritz testified, was not viewed as a key
part of the Apple-Microsoft pact. The browser issue, he wrote, was
not raised in the negotiations ``until the primary deal terms were
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Maritz denied the government's allegation that
Microsoft had tried to persuade Netscape to divide the browser
market, a violation of antitrust law. ``I never instructed any
Microsoft personnel to seek a `division of the market,' nor do I
believe that any such proposal was ever made,'' Maritz testified.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By investing $700 billion of the Social Security
trust fund's reserves in the stock market, President Clinton hopes
to generate enough high-voltage returns to keep the fund solvent
into the next century. Alas, the way he wants to do it almost
insures failure.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the fund needs some zip. It is now invested in
United States government securities _ the safest investment, but
not the highest yielding. During the 1980s, annual returns averaged
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan bogs down when it hands over investment decisions
to the government rather than to individuals. History shows that
public investors do not behave as profitably as private investors
do.
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank study of government-managed retirement plans found
that during the 1980s, they generally underperformed privately
managed plans. Annual losses ranged from 37.4 percent in Peru's
fund to 3.8 percent in Kenya's. Publicly managed funds that eked
out gains included Singapore's and Malaysia's, with 3 percent and
4.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, private pension funds in the United States scored
average annual returns of 8 percent; Chile's were the top
performers, at 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Underperformance is also typical among state and local pension
funds in the United States. A study by Olivia Mitchell, a professor
of insurance and risk management at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and Ping-Lung Hsin of Cornell
University found that from 1984 to 1990, while bonds returned an
average of 15.5 percent and stocks returned 13.9 percent, the
average state or local pension plan gained 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the lag? The World Bank identified two culprits.
One is the tendency to invest too conservatively. The other is the
tendency to invest too politically.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike private funds, public portfolio managers can invest in
socially desirable projects that may not meet the economic criteria
a private investor would demand. An example? Funding a local
company, as Connecticut's state employee pension plan did in 1990,
when it invested $25 million in the troubled Colt Firearms to keep
925 local jobs from being lost.
</P>
<P>
   But politically charged investments are very often losers. In a
study published last fall, John R. Nofsinger, a professor of
finance at Marquette University in Milwaukee, compared the returns
of funds that held such investments and funds that did not.
</P>
<P>
   During three years in the early 1990s, the funds that included
politically minded investments underperformed their benchmarks by
2.1 percent on average. Those that did not came out ahead by a
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the president's plan say an independent board can
keep politics out of the government's investment decisions. Dream
on, says Maureen M. Baronian, a stockbroker in West Hartford,
Conn., and a former state representative. She sat on the advisory
board overseeing Connecticut's investments when it bought into
Colt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baronian and three other board members voted against the
investment, but politics triumphed. ``Political considerations are
always there,'' she said. ``They may tell you they aren't, but they
have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baronian was right to object. Colt filed for bankruptcy in
1992, and Connecticut's employees lost their investment.

 &HT;    South's warm winter stirs deadly tornadoes
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a week of balmy weather, Southern states
inherited the wind. Tornadoes ripped through Arkansas, Tennessee
and Alabama Friday, and gale winds downed power lines and trees
across Mississippi and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta area forecasters kept a wary eye on states to the west
Friday night, hoping trouble wasn't aimed this way. But unusually
high January temperatures this week left the South vulnerable to
severe storm fronts, so today's heavy rains fit the pattern,
forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring came a bit early,'' said Frank Taylor with the National
Weather Service in Peachtree City. ``When it's warm in winter, you
have a potential for storms. Severe weather in Mississippi and
Alabama have a history of producing tornadoes, hail and wind damage
over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms and flash flood warnings for the metro Atlanta
area that began Friday night will continue through this morning, he
said, with temperatures in the mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the rains hit Georgia, high winds were blamed for
fires and downed power lines in Rockdale and Cobb counties Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wind knocked down power lines at South Cobb Drive and Austell
Road shortly after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours earlier, wind fanned flames on Pickens Road in Newton,
causing a trailer to burn to the ground and a three-acre wooded lot
to also burn. Fire fighters from seven station houses in the
Newton-Rockdale area answered the 3:30 p.m.call.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Falcons fans planning Sunday send-off
celebrations is that skies are expected to clear tonight and Sunday
should be sunny with afternoon highs around 53 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Across the South, a punishing storm system killed eight people
in two states and left thousands of people without power early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wave after wave of twisters hit central Arkansas, starting late
Thursday, collapsing roofs, knocking down power poles and leaving
trees strewn about the grounds of the governor's mansion in Little
Rock. Seven people died.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters estimate 30 tornadoes hit the state, though it will
be days before field checks can confirm an exact number.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, a tornado touched down in Clarksville on Friday,
ripping roofs off buildings. It was the second time in less than a
week that tornadoes hit the state.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Sunday, twisters killed nine Tennesseans.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather also pummeled Mississippi and Louisiana, but
there were no immediate reports of serious injuries. In western
Alabama, residents of Tuscaloosa and west-central counties were
under tornado warnings Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Clarksville, a city of 89,000 about 40 miles northwest of
Nashville near the Kentucky state line, a twister hit about 4:15
a.m. Friday, heavily damaging the downtown and causing a dozen
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The roof was ripped off the Montgomery County courthouse, much
of a historic church was knocked down, trees and utility poles were
blown over, and about 25,000 customers were without power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like somebody walked through with a broom and knocked
over whatever was loose enough to knock down,'' said Fred Dye,
photo editor at The Leaf-Chronicle of Clarksville, whose building
was heavily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sunday deaths in Jackson, Tenn., were blamed on a
faulty civil defense siren in Jackson that could have warned people
to seek cover, but didn't sound in time.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the alarm failure didn't matter because there was no
siren within earshot. But many were within the estimated one-mile
hearing radius, said Madison County Commissioner Jim Ed Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residents deserve better. Nobody should put up with
that,'' he said. Eight of the city's 20 sirens failed in tests
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage was worst in Arkansas. Two people were killed in the
Little Rock area when trees fell on them, and a 67-year-old
pharmacist at a supermarket died of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Beebe, 30 miles to the northeast, a 2-month-old son of a
firefighter was blown out of his home and killed and a woman was
found dead at her home.
</P>
<P>
   At Center Hill, Searcy school board member Wanda Wilson died
when her mobile home was hit, Superintendent Tony Wood said. And
south of Searcy, an unidentified body was found, said Lt. Bill
Lindsey of the White County sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas utilities officials said the storms left 72,000
customers without power, and authorities opened five shelters from
the Little Rock area to Newark, 90 miles to the northeast. At least
60 people were injured, including 45 in Little Rock. Parts of the
state also reported grapefruit-size hail.
</P>
<P>
   In Alexandria, La., violent winds ripped apart businesses and
downed electrical lines, cutting power to hundreds of residents.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the state was under a tornado watch as cool, dry air
moving south clashed with warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
The National Weather Service reported possible tornadoes in seven
parishes Friday, and Monroe Regional Airport reported some hangars
and planes were damaged by high winds. However, it appeared
Louisiana had escaped the devastation from tornadoes in Arkansas
and Tennessee. Severe storms and flood-producing rains pounded
Mississippi Friday after a night of tornadoes and gusting winds
left scattered damage. The Delta took the hardest beating, though
tornado watches remained in effect for much of north and extreme
west Mississippi until midday.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts of up to 60 mph were reported Thursday night in the
Greenville and Vicksburg areas. The storms knocked down trees,
power lines and damaged some homes in Hollandale, Miss. Power was
also knocked out in Indianola and Mayersville. Utilitiy companies
and the Georgia Emergency Management
</P>
<P>
   Agency stayed on alert Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our people on alert and we are watching the progress
of the storms headed this way from Mississippi and Alabama,'' said
Georgia Power spokesman James Peters.

COMPENSATION GROWING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have a 50-50 chance of getting a salary increase of 4
percent or more this year, according to Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a
compensation company based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 397 companies in five industry sectors, Watson
Wyatt found that the median salary increase budgeted for 1999 was 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Differences in merit pay increases among industries are
insignificant,'' Watson Wyatt said after surveying companies in
services; finance, insurance and real estate; manufacturing; health
and social assistance, and wholesale and retail trade.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the companies surveyed thought that their
workers regarded merit increases as an entitlement, usually tied to
age and seniority. But Rick Beal, a Watson Wyatt pay expert, said
corporations that ``shift resources away from paying people for
showing up'' and move more compensation to pay-for-performance
plans will be better able to cope with the aging work force. In the
next decade, the number of workers 56 and older will grow by half,
the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things remain a bit different atop the corporate pyramid.
The average pay for a chief executive last year was $7.57 million,
up 19 percent from 1997, according to Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners, an
executive compensation firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries for chief executives continue to hover around $1
million, the firm said _ apparently influenced by a federal law
that limits the tax deduction for such salaries to that figure. But
total pay is rising at nearly five times the rate of the average
worker's pay because grants of stock options to chief executives
are exploding and now comprise half the average chief executive's
pay package.

JULES LEDERER, 81, BUDGET RENT-A-CAR FOUNDER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Iowa, Ill., Britain)  (bl) 
By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jules W. Lederer, the founder of Budget Rent-A-Car and former
husband of Ann Landers, the popular syndicated advice columnist,
died of a heart attack Jan. 21 at his home near London. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Detroit, Lederer dropped out of school in the ninth
grade to support his mother and sister after his father had died.
He made his living as a salesman, selling everything from pens and
pencils bearing advertising slogans to hats and logs and newspapers
before starting Budget in the late 1950s, which grew into one of
the nation's largest automobile rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company became popular in its early days by renting cars at
lower prices than its competitors. It charged $5 a day and 5 cents
a mile. It gained a following among a growing business and leisure
travel market because of its practice of renting cars from offices
outside of airports. Lederer is also credited as one of the first
to apply franchising to the rental car industry.
</P>
<P>
   While selling hats in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1939, he met Ms.
Landers, then known as Eppie (Esther Pauline) Friedman, who was
engaged to another man and was shopping with her twin sister,
Pauline, who later became known as the advice columnist Abigail Van
Buren. The two were looking for wedding veils for their double
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Ms. Landers said: ``Jules was a world
class salesman. At age 21, he sold me on himself when I went to the
T.S. Martin Department Store to buy a wedding veil. I was engaged
to marry Lewis Dreyer, a Beverly Hills law student. I broke the
engagement and married Jules in a double wedding with my twin
sister, Pauline.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple divorced in 1975, after 36 years of marriage.
Informing readers of the decision in a column, which was shorter
than most, Ms. Landers said, ``I left the white space as a memorial
to one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the
finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederer spent more than two decades living in Chicago. He also
lived in Milwaukee, New Orleans, Chicago and Sioux City, Iowa. He
sold Budget to Transamerica Corp., an insurance company based in
San Francisco, in 1968. He moved to London after he separated from
Ms. Landers. While in London, he remarried and the couple had a
daughter, Anthea.
</P>
<P>
   Lederer is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Margo
Lederer Howard and Anthea Lederer; a brother, Sol; a sister,
Madelyn Ferris; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

TORNADOES KILL EIGHT IN ARKANSAS AND TENNESSEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The storm system rose out of Texas and
Oklahoma and crossed into Arkansas early Thursday. By the time it
exhausted itself, the tornadoes it spawned killed eight people in
two states.
</P>
<P>
   As many as three dozen tornadoes lashed Arkansas between about 5
p.m. and 8:30 p.m., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't stop,'' Teri Magsam of the Arkansas Office of
Emergency Services said Friday. ``They just kept on coming in, one
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   In White County four people died, including 2-month-old Kirk
McAfee, who was killed when his family's home in Beebe, a community
of 4,000 people, 35 miles northeast of Little Rock, was flattened.
The infant was either sucked or blown out of the home and was found
about a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCullock's family barely survived the tornado that
shattered their house. ``We got in the center hallway with the
mattress off the bed and began praying to beat the band,''
McCullock said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``brand-new'' junior high school that McCullock's daughter
attended was a pile of bricks and shingles.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado tore apart the home of Wanda Willis, 65, a member of
the school board in nearby Searcy, and tossed her body into a
field, said Tom Martin, chief of the Center Hill community's fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were a woman known only as Flo Taylor, estimated by
authorities to be in her 50s, and a fourth person found Friday but
not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Winds whipped across the grounds of the governor's mansion in
Little Rock. There was no damage to the building, but the tree
house in a backyard oak where Chelsea Clinton had once played was a
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   But only blocks from the governor's mansion, a supermarket
collapsed from the force of the winds, and on Friday morning one of
several people initially trapped in the wreckage, Robert Howard,
67, the store's pharmacist, died of his injuries. A 34-year-old
Little Rock woman, Lisa Jacko, died on Thursday night when a tree
struck the car she was driving a short distance from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, there was more
death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was in her wheelchair and my uncle was in the
back bedroom and he was coming down the hallway when the tree fell
and crushed him,'' said Eva Weikel, the niece of James Looper, 63,
who died in the wreckage of his mobile home in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The storm then moved into Tennessee, where a woman was killed by
a tornado west of Nashville when she went outside to get her dogs,
The Associated Press reported. The storm tore apart the historic
district of Clarksville, Tenn., early Friday, wrecking the
121-year-old courthouse and cutting power to 25,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes killed nine people in Tennessee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The storms cut off electricity to more than 70,000 Arkansas
homes and businesses on Thursday, and by late Friday afternoon
42,000 people were still without power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most unusual storms I've ever seen this time
of year _ strong and volatile,'' said George Wilken, a
meteorologist with 33 years' experience at the National Weather
Service in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes rarely occur in the South during winter, but when they
do, they are often very powerful, Wilken said. The latest storm
system, he said, was created when unusually warm, moist Gulf air
moved north under a cold air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Arkansas' 75 counties have declared local
emergencies and three were designated major disaster areas by Gov.
Mike Huckabee. ``It's just devastating,'' he said. ``We've seen
more damage that we expected. We weren't prepared for what we saw
in White County.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a small, but increasingly important, number of
Republicans expressing reservations about the wisdom of calling
witnesses, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the leading institutional voice in
the Senate, said on Friday that President Clinton's impeachment
trial should come to a swift end, and he announced that he would
offer a motion to dismiss the charges next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop,'' Byrd said
in a one-page statement, adding, ``I do not believe that witnesses
will add anything of consequence to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the
Judiciary Committee, said the Senate should wait until witnesses
were deposed before deciding whether the trial should be halted.
But if it is clear then that the constitutionally required
two-thirds vote to convict and remove the president cannot be
found, he said, the Senate should simply adjourn the trial. He said
the Senate would not need a censure but would ``acknowledge that
the impeachment vote in the House is the highest form of
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither proposal won quick support from the other
party, the two senators' comments suggested that the Senate's
center of gravity was shifting as the body appeared hungrier than
ever for a graceful exit from a potentially prolonged trial.
</P>
<P>
   While Byrd's motion still seemed unlikely to get the Republican
votes needed to pass, his decision was a blow to Republicans who
had hoped his traditionalism would lead him to support the call for
a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, all morning long, small clutches of Democratic and
Republican senators met away from the Senate chamber, in hallways
and small offices, searching for a plan acceptable to both parties
and then reporting back to their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to debate on Monday whether to dismiss
the charges against Clinton and whether to depose witnesses. A vote
on dismissal and, if that fails, on witnesses would come next, but
perhaps not until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch called Byrd's motion premature and said he thought it
would fail. But he said his idea was ``just another way of
resolving these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, the Democratic leader, quickly
responded that ``every single Democrat'' would oppose Hatch's
motion because it leaves the charges against Clinton unresolved.
``There must be a definite determination on the case,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's proposal could prove problematic to many Republicans as
well, most of whom want to cast final votes on the two articles of
impeachment. ``I think we should have the opportunity for each
senator to stand and face the other 99 and simply say yea or nay on
the ultimate question,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The first turning point in the case, however, could come as
early as next week, when the Senate takes up the question of
depositions. For the past several weeks, it has been evident that
most Republicans favor taking depositions from witnesses, hoping,
they say, that people like Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary, could clear up contradictory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans reiterated their concerns on Friday
about deposing witnesses, a sign that at least a few senators in
the party are nervous about prolonging the trial. The group is
pivotal because it would take six or more Republicans to block a
motion next week to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is having conversations,'' Sen. Byron L. Dorgan,
D-N.D., said. ``It's the largest group of negotiations in the
Senate's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said he believed there are four
or five Republicans who have an ``open mind'' on voting against
summoning witnesses. ``But whether they actually vote for it or I
vote for it remains to be seen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to persuade me that what the witnesses
are going to have to say is new,'' Shelby said. ``More of the same
_ we don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, echoed Shelby's cautiousness,
saying, ``I have to be persuaded that there should be witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a hallway interview, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said:
``There is a substantial core of moderates in both parties who
would like to find an endgame, sooner rather than later. A dozen or
so of us are speaking among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some concerns over witnesses, House managers are moving
ahead with their plan to try to persuade the Senate to call Clinton
as a witness. On Friday, in a letter to the Senate's Republican and
Democratic leaders, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, said the ``president is the only
individual with knowledge of almost every material fact relevant to
the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders have not decided whether to extend an
invitation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that Senate bipartisanship will face its second
major test next week, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, said on Friday that he was considering holding another
joint caucus in the Old Senate Chamber to talk through the next
stage of the trial. His counterpart, Daschle, said he would not be
averse to such a caucus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But of all the day's developments, it was Byrd's announcement
that he would be the one to offer a dismissal motion that prompted
the quickest, most partisan reaction among senators. The motion
would end the trial summarily, without a vote on whether to convict
or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement resonated with both parties because Byrd, who
has been sharply critical of Clinton's behavior, is esteemed as a
constitutional scholar and had remained undecided on the question
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately championed the decision, predicting that
Byrd might influence some Republicans to vote with Democrats to
dismiss the charges. ``He's among the members we suggest and look
to for leadership,'' said Sen. John B. Breaux, a Louisiana
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, with Lott's endorsement, held an instant news
conference after Byrd's statement to rebut it. ``I believe that
Senator Byrd's motion to end the trial is inappropriate,'' he said.
``I think it will be defeated. I believe this trial will go the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   A roster of other Republicans followed suit. Sen. John Chafee, a
R-R.I., and Hatch said they did not think the measure would pass
the Senate. And Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called for the
motion's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the U.S. Senate with more respect than
senator Byrd,'' said Rep. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. But, he added, ``I
am not deciding this case without the evidence coming in.''

SALT LAKE CITY STRESS: THE MORE INVESTIGATIONS, THE MORE ANXIETY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When the 2002 Winter Olympics were finally
awarded to this city after years of struggle, many residents said
Utah's capital, long regarded as clean and quiet and little else,
had finally arrived on the world stage, equal to the best.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many people here say that the other shoe has dropped.
With revelations in recent weeks that money and gifts had been
given to International Olympic Committee officials to influence the
bidding process, and with state, federal and independent
investigations churning behind closed doors, Salt Lake City, its
residents say, has also revealed itself to be no better, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan De Vries, for one, is glad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of it as the capital for the Mormons, the
headquarters of the church, and we shouldn't have any problems,''
said De Vries, a computer programmer who works and lives in the
city. ``But we do. We've got gang-related problems. We've got
corruption in politics. We've got this, that and the other, just
like any other city.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vries said he hoped the collective soul-searching that has
become part of the debate here on the Olympics will have a positive
effect on how the city regards itself in the future. ``Maybe it
will help us focus on our other problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Ostradicky, a land surveyor who was on her way downtown
to work this morning, said reaching for the Olympic rings had
simply proved the city had feet of clay. ``I guess we are just
normal humans like everybody else, and business is business,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has admitted to giving
hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts, medical treatment,
tuition reimbursements and other perks to IOC members or their
families. But the gifts, the officials have said, were humanitarian
aid, or tokens of good will, and not bribes.
</P>
<P>
   But the multiple investigations under way have accentuated the
sense of held breath. In one downtown building, for example, a team
of United States Justice Department lawyers from Washington has
been questioning witnesses this week in the local FBI offices. Six
floors below, a separate independent ethics investigation by the
organizing committee was conducting its work. A few blocks away, at
the State Capitol, the attorney general had begun her investigation
into possible violation of state laws.
</P>
<P>
   With so many questions still unanswered, perception has
heightened this city's Olympic anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents and local leaders say, for example, that they
think some members of the national and world news media have
falsely elevated the city's supposed ethical and moral purity as a
device to make the bribery allegations appear more newsworthy and
more shocking than they are _ that it could happen (gasp) even
here.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they think that Salt Lake City should genuinely be
held to a higher ethical standard, because of its religious
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is somewhere in the middle. Economists and
securities law experts say, for example, that Salt Lake City's past
ethical pedigree is not as pristine as local idealists or outsiders
have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, for example, it was one of the centers in the
nation, along with Denver, in penny stock trading, which was
notorious for its swindles and scams, in which low-priced shares in
often nonexistent companies _ especially in things like gold mines
and oil wells _ were sold to gullible investors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Michael Otterson, also said it would be the ``height of arrogance''
for him to say that Salt Lake City was more moral or ethical than
other places. What the church does, he said, is teach principles,
and then allows people to govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympic bidding process, Otterson said, the church took
no formal position and donated no money. Individual corporations
owned by the church, however, including The Deseret News and the
company that owns the local CBS television affiliate, did make
contributions to the bid committee totaling about $211,000. And
Otterson said many church members were involved in the bidding
process, including the former president of the organizing
committee, Tom Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church believes in following the highest moral and ethical
principles,'' Otterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as big a question as right and wrong, however, is who is
talking and who is not. The lawyer for Welch, who ran the Olympic
bid committee until his resignation in 1997 after being accused of
spousal abuse, said his client had not been subpoenaed. The lawyer,
Thomas Schaffer, said Welch had not been questioned by any state or
federal authorities or asked to appear. He said the facts, in any
case, would show Welch had done nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's secretary, Stephanie Pate, however, was interviewed by
Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents Wednesday, with
questioning to resume next week. Her lawyer, David Watkiss, said
his client had done nothing illegal and had not witnessed anything
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Residents here Friday said that rumor and perception were making
them confused about what to think of themselves. ``In some ways,
when the world is looking at you like this, you could look at it as
a compliment, too _ that Salt Lake lives at a higher standard than
the rest, so they shouldn't have been involved,'' said Duane
Carter, who works in computer security for a local utility company.
``But right now, it's kind of an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Caporale, an insurance agent, said she believed there
might be a badge of honor, of sorts, yet to be found. The fact that
questions about the Olympics happened to blow up here is partly a
result, she said, that people began admitting what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not too smart,'' she said. ``Or we're too honest.'' &QL;

REEL WORK WINDS DOWN IN L.A. COUNTY IN 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Year-end statistics released Friday for
entertainment production in Los Angeles County don't show a pretty
picture, with off-lot activity falling 4.2 percent in 1998 after
three years of supercharged growth.
</P>
<P>
   The most distressing data, based on permits issued by the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., comes in three key areas:
feature films, down 13.1 percent; commercials, off 7.5 percent; and
TV, down 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But industry trackers say they're not alarmed, pointing out that
1998's total of 45,653 production days is still a whopping 71
percent above the 1994 level and projecting this year's total will
remain steady with 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are pretty much what we expected,'' said Cody
Cluff, EIDC's director. ``The big key will be what happens in
feature films. Most of them are budgeted lower than what we've seen
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Both The Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. have trimmed
big-budget projects from their schedules to focus more on
moderately priced movies, but demand for TV and commercials
continues to be strong, Cluff said. There have usually been 100 and
150 crews working outside studio lots in the county on most days
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are really pretty good,'' Cluff said. ``Communities
treat filming pretty well, and crews are well-behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Stolkin Archuletta, director of the California Film
Commission, stressed that a leveling off was inevitable. ``We
aren't in a panic,'' she added. ``What we're finding is that we're
not seeing a lot of longer shoots on features. There's no question
that studios are keeping a close watch on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire 1998 decline can be traced to 25.7 percent and 18.1
percent drops in activity in September and October, respectively,
fueled by back-to-back plunges of 41 percent and 44 percent in
movie production. Some cited runaway production to Canada, which
has far lower costs, and places like New York, which trumpeted
increased production numbers this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Cluff believes that little of the gains in Canadian activity
are coming at Hollywood's expense, and scouts say the flight from
Hollywood is not significant. ``I don't think leaving town is that
prevalent right now,'' said Walter Roshetski, director of
commercial locations for Burbank, Calif.-based Universal Locations.
``I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roshetski said producers remain attracted to shooting locally
because the presence of film crews is no surprise to residents, who
tend to be mostly cooperative. ``If you go to Chicago or New York,
you may see some shooting, but you're always seeing trucks in Los
Angeles,'' he added. ``It's a way of life out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thompson, head of L.A.-based Real to Reel scouting service,
said activity has been solid this month and should pick up soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of TV, like `Providence' and `The
X-Files,' and a lot of commercials, particularly this time of year
because the weather is so much nicer than other parts of the
country,'' he added. ``We are anticipating a rush because we're
getting into pilot season.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said producers and directors are seeking significant
numbers of warehouses, hospitals and relatively simple homes. ``So
our plan is to increase our portfolio of everyday `Father Knows
Best' homes,'' he added. &QL;

C.G. ZUBROD, 84, ONCOLOGIST WHO EXTENDED CHEMOTHERAPY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Fla., Pa., Mo.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Gordon Zubrod, a retired oncologist at the National
Institutes of Health who furthered the use of chemotherapy to treat
cancer, died on Tuesday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington.
He was 84 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrod's medical career included 20 years with the institutes,
beginning in 1954. He was scientific director of the National
Cancer Institute from 1961 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he led a team of physicians and other
specialists who were researching and developing drugs to attack a
broad range of cancers. His group first showed that acute childhood
leukemia was curable.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, chemotherapy evolved as a standard
treatment for cancer. The principles established by his team remain
valid.
</P>
<P>
   For his contributions to cancer research, Zubrod won the Lasker
Award in 1972. He was also recognized for his work in pharmacology
and marine biology.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``The Cure of Childhood Leukemia: Into the Age of
Miracles,'' Dr. John Laszlo, a fellow scientist, wrote, ``If ever
there was a maestro who orchestrated the cure of childhood
leukemia, it had to be Dr. C. Gordon Zubrod.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., the son of a well-to-do stockbroker, he
was reared on Long Island and graduated from Georgetown Preparatory
School in Bethesda, Md. He graduated from the College of the Holy
Cross in 1936 and from the Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an internist, he became interested in pharmacology
and took part in the search for a substitute for quinine to treat
malaria in World War II when he was in the Army Medical Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He started an academic career at the Johns Hopkins University
Medical School in 1946. Before he joined the staff of the National

COMMENTARY: CLINTON BEATS DOLE II  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to change phrasing, describing Shakespeare's actions
as two-timing rather than forsaking. No other changes.)  By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Draft-dodging Bill Clinton beats World
War II hero Bob Dole at the polls. Philandering Bill Clinton
vanquishes Republican Puritans in the Senate. What's next? As our
marathon culture war reaches its catharsis in Washington, it may be
Hollywood's turn to provide the farcical coup de grace. The talk
here _ not for attribution, since no one wants to offend Steven
Spielberg _ is that ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the patriotic shoo-in
of the summer, might lose the Best Picture Oscar come spring to a
movie drenched in sex (and lies about sex) whose lovable hero
shamelessly cheats on the wife and kids he's left at home.
</P>
<P>
   The dark horse, of course, is ``Shakespeare in Love,'' in which
young Will two-times Anne Hathaway with a young woman betrothed to
another man. In my unscientific survey of Academy voters on Golden
Globes Eve, there remains a minority that feels this little ``art''
movie has no chance because: (a) comedies rarely win Best Picture;
(b) Spielberg-Hanks is a local combination to rival Mother Teresa;
(c) the Academy's old guard loves the likes of ``Braveheart,'' and
(d) both New York and L.A. critics have given ``Ryan'' their top
award. But ever since New Year's, when Variety's front page
questioned the front-runner's invincibility, ``Shakespeare'' has
been gaining ground as the anti-``Ryan'' alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare's'' proponents argue that ``Ryan'' is ``20 great
minutes followed by disappointment,'' that the literary pedigree of
``Shakespeare'' appeals to Hollywood's grandiose cultural
self-image (``We like to impress the world with our aspirations and
loftiness''), and that the mogul behind ``Shakespeare,'' Harvey
Weinstein of Miramax, is ``like the Wehrmacht'' when staging an
Oscar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But one likely Oscar nominee who is not connected with either of
these two movies _ and who is no fan of either Spielberg or
Weinstein _ feels that ``Shakespeare'' will win for cultural
reasons that transcend industry politics. ``I think people are a
little weary of the deadly earnest after this year in particular,''
he says. `` `Shakespeare' is fun, clever and has pretty people. It
says something uplifting about art and the human spirit. It
sparkles and bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if he's right about how his peers may finally
vote. But I do think he's right about why this movie is proving a
surprise hit with audiences throughout the country. Though
``Shakespeare in Love'' may not be built for the ages as its
namesake's plays are, it's hard to imagine a more fitting balm for
America at this moment. After a full year of listening to
politicians and the media wallow maliciously in a sex scandal,
there's something cleansing, even exhilarating, about watching a
movie that celebrates eroticism by reconnecting it to poetry (not
Walt Whitman's), humor and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' comes down against both camps in our yearlong
battle over Monicagate. Yes, it celebrates an extramarital affair
facilitated by a Betty Currie-like Nurse, but it's the linking of
two romantic souls in bed in a fairyland 16th-century London, not
the tawdry gratifying of body parts in the Oval Office. Yet a
villain of the piece is a purse-mouthed Elizabethan censor and
busybody who seems to combine equal parts of Kenneth Starr, Linda
Tripp and all the Sunday TV sermonizers.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the standard cultural take on the past year has
been the rise of what the writer John Gregory Dunne has aptly
labeled ``virtual patriotism.'' The nation's psychic antidote to
Clintonian sordidness, we've been told and told, is nostalgia for
World War II and the selfless (i.e., non-boomer) generation that
fought it, as captured in ``Ryan'' and best-selling books by
Stephen Ambrose and Tom Brokaw. But now, thanks to Henry Hyde's
cheesy exploitation of the war dead in his impeachment-trial
summation _ and the rhetorical counter-fire it prompted from
Charles Ruff and Dale Bumpers _ Omaha Beach has become another
tainted pawn in the capital's odious political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan, sex-life-and-art-affirming ``Shakespeare in
Love'' arrived at just the right moment to capture ``Private
Ryan's'' fallen flag and take us about as far away from that soiled
Washington as a movie possibly can. Here in the capital of show
business, whose leaders cannot afford to ignore the public will as
politicians do, there is little doubt that that's where the country
wants to go.

CLINTON DEFENSE RELIES ON TRIVIALIZING PROSECUTION'S CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-SCHOLARS)

By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In defending President Clinton, his lawyers have
portrayed the case against him as one cobbled together from events
that were often trivial and open to varying interpretations. Above
all, they have argued that the charges fall below the
constitutional standard for removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   While not defending Clinton's personal behavior, the lawyers
have repeatedly told senators that they are being asked to overturn
an election on what the lawyers contend were flawed conclusions and
disputed facts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``staggering thought,'' said White House lawyer Gregory
Craig, that a president could be turned out of office over such
ambiguous issues as the number of times he engaged intimate
relations with Monica Lewinsky. The House managers cited as perjury
the discrepancy between Clinton's statement that he had
inappropriate contact with Ms. Lewinsky on ``several occasions''
and her testimony that there were 11 sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers argued that that the case for removal
was wrong in three fundamental ways: the conclusions that the House
managers drew from the facts were wrong, the accusations did not
meet the legal requirements to prove the charges of perjury or
obstruction of justice, and none of the accusations rose to the
high level of wrongdoing needed to overturn an election.
</P>
<P>
   THE PERJURY CHARGE: `Silly,' `Frivolous' Math
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that the president did not commit perjury before the
grand jury, Craig derided many of the House managers' accusations
as meaningless and trivial. In one instance, the managers asserted
that Clinton had committed perjury with his statement that he and
Ms. Lewinsky had engaged in sexual talk on the telephone ``on
occasion'' while she testified it had occurred 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any dispute over this immaterial issue is silly,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Another example involves the prepared statement Clinton read to
the grand jury Aug. 17 in which he acknowledged intimate conduct,
saying: ``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include
this conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers told the Senate that such a statement
amounted to perjury because Ms. Lewinsky has testified that their
relationship began with flirting, ``including Ms. Lewinsky showing
the president her underwear,'' and not as a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   That, Craig said, was ``fundamentally frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   An issue that the White House lawyers did not portray as trivial
was whether Clinton lied when he told the grand jury that he had
not engaged in ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky, as the term
was defined in his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue is the conflicting testimony about
the explicit details of the intimate acts between Ms. Lewinsky and
the president. Without being specific, Clinton essentially
portrayed the relationship to the grand jury as one in which she
stimulated him sexually but he did not reciprocate. Ms. Lewinsky
has testified that the president touched her intimately on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true nub of the managers' allegation that the president
committed perjury is that he described some of the contact one way
and she described it another,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders told the Senate that such a
discrepancy could not amount to perjury because courts have ruled
that perjury cannot be based simply on two differing sworn
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., one of the 13 House managers, or
prosecutors, emphasized Friday that Ms. Lewinsky had told her
version of the intimate contact to as many as 10 people at the time
it occurred, the kind of testimony that lends weight to one side in
a swearing contest. He also cited as corroboration White House logs
and Secret Service testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers also complained strongly that the
perjury case was unfair because it included statements made by the
president in the Jones deposition Jan. 17, even though the House
voted down an impeachment article specifically accusing the
president of lying at the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers' claim that the deposition testimony may be
included rests solely on one statement Clinton made in his grand
jury appearance _ that he had tried to testify truthfully in the
Jones deposition six months earlier. In that deposition, the
managers noted, Clinton said that he could not remember if he had
ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky or had exchanged gifts with her.
</P>
<P>
   The White House argued that the effort to ``bootstrap'' the
deposition testimony was improper and that, moreover, Clinton told
the grand jury that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky and did exchange
gifts with her.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers also charged that Clinton had committed
perjury when he stood silent at the Jones deposition as his lawyer,
Robert Bennett, declared there was no sex between the president and
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in the grand jury appearance if Bennett's statement
that there ``is no sex of any kind'' was flatly untrue, Clinton
began his answer with the widely criticized phrase, ``It depends
what the meaning of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers have offered two defenses in rebuttal.
First, they argue that Clinton did not speak up because he was not
paying close attention to Bennett at the time. David Kendall,
another of the president's lawyers, also said that Clinton's
parsing of the word ``is'' was an effort to explain Bennett's
thinking, not a legalistic maneuver on the president's part.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE OBSTRUCTION CHARGE: What Human Beings Do
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House counsel Cheryl Mills argued that the
president had not obstructed justice when his secretary, Betty
Currie, collected some gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky that were
under subpoena by the Jones lawyers. Ms. Mills said there had been
no direct testimony that Clinton initiated or had anything to do
with their retrieval and that Mrs. Currie repeatedly testified that
it was Ms. Lewinsky's idea to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   She also argued that there had been no proof of obstruction in
Clinton's questioning of Mrs. Currie about Ms. Lewinsky the day
after he was asked about her in the Jones deposition. Mrs. Currie
has testified that the president put questions to her like,
``Monica came on to me and I never touched her, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The managers have asserted that Clinton's colloquy with Mrs.
Currie amounted to witness tampering, because he was trying to use
Mrs. Currie to support his denials of a sexual relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. The White House counters that she was not then a
witness, and that Clinton was merely trying to refresh his memory.
</P>
<P>
   In her presentation, Ms. Mills stressed another explanation:
that Clinton was trying to prepare himself for an anticipated
``media firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have asserted that Clinton played a major
role in encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file what they say was a false
affidavit in the Jones case and also rehearsed cover stories with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall argued that the affidavit was not false, because Ms.
Lewinsky shared the president's view that oral sex was not sex
under the Jones lawyers' definition. As for the cover stories, he
said that they were conversations that occurred ``when they were
both trying to conceal their improper relationship from others
while it was going on. Cover stories are an almost inevitable part
of every improper relationship between two human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also attacked the managers' contention that Clinton's
help in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job was aimed at buying her
cooperation in concealing her relationship with the president. He
cited Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that no one had ever urged her to
lie and that she had begun her job search well before she emerged
as a possible witness in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   THE STANDARD: Defining High Crimes
</P>
<P>
   The legal arguments over whether the crimes of perjury and
obstruction as charged against Clinton are enough to warrant
removal from office involve less the facts of the case and more the
history and interpretation of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers asserted that the president's actions
amounted to the high crimes and misdemeanors outlined in the
Constitution and required for his removal from office. Given the
murkiness of what qualifies as a high crime, the managers invoked
recent and ancient history and analogies that were homespun and
academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a high crime?'' asked Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``How
about if an important person hurts somebody of low means? It's not
very scholarly, but I think it's the truth. I think that's what
they meant by high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig made the case that impeachment should be reserved for
``assaults on the system of government'' and that nothing in the
impeachment case qualified as that.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that if the president's misconduct ``does not
implicate the office or the powers of the presidency, the remedy is
in a legal process involving prosecution, conviction and punishment
in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These articles do not justify the nullification of the
American people's free choice in a national election.''

DUSTIN HOFFMAN WINS SUIT IN PHOTO ALTERATION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (bl)  
By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that could affect the way magazines satirize
public figures, a judge Friday ordered Los Angeles magazine to pay
$1.5 million in actual damages to Dustin Hoffman for publishing a
computer-altered image of the actor in an evening dress and high
heels.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the magazine used a computer-generated photograph
of Hoffman in a fashion spread titled ``Grand Illusions,'' in which
famous movie stills were altered by computer, changing the way
actors were dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's head, taken from a still from the 1982 movie
``Tootsie,'' in which he dressed mostly in women's clothing, was
placed on a body wearing a Richard Tyler designer dress and Ralph
Lauren shoes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Dickran Tevrizian scheduled another
hearing for Thursday to determine the amount of additional punitive
damages to the actor. Hoffman filed a $5 million lawsuit against
the magazine last year, alleging violation of publicity rights in
his suit against Fairchild Publications, the owner and publisher of
Los Angeles magazine. Fairchild is owned by Capital Cities/ABC,
which is turn owned by Walt Disney Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Hoffman also alleged that the magazine violated
the Lanham Act, which monitors product endorsement, and that the
magazine engaged in unfair competition when it created and
published the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the first paragraph of the decision, Tevrizian praised
Hoffman's acting career and wrote, ``It can be said that Mr.
Hoffman is truly one our country's living treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's attorney, Charles Shephard, said that while Los
Angeles magazine had argued that it should be allowed to depict
Hoffman in whatever manner it wished, the court ruled that ``the
photographs were manipulated and cannibalized to such an extent
that the celebrities were commercially exploited and robbed of
their dignity, professionalism and talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Taylor, who was also depicted in the fashion spread,
has not sued the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Beck, the editor in chief of Los Angeles magazine, would
not take any phone calls relating to the matter Friday. Julie
Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, issued this statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed with the result and plan to appeal.
Editorial use of the material in question is protected by the First
Amendment, and we strongly believe our use was appropriate and
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC plans to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers think the decision may cast a creative pall over
the magazine industry. Richard Emery, a New York lawyer
specializing in First Amendment issues, said the decision could
cause ``a tremendous chilling effect on magazine creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a shame that Dustin Hoffman, whose life blood is
satire, among other things, would resort to this sort of device on
his own behalf,'' he added. ``There is a fundamental hypocrisy
there.''

ANALYSIS: IS THE SALINAS CASE A NEW ATTITUDE OR OLD MEXICAN
POLITICS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The verdict that sentenced Raul Salinas de
Gortari, brother of the former president of Mexico, to prison for
50 years for masterminding a political assassination in 1994 sent
the strongest signal yet that the political elite is no longer
beyond the reach of justice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling, by Judge Ricardo Ojeda Bohorquez, did not
resolve troubling doubts about the weak and tainted case on which
it was based.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, although momentous, left many Mexicans suspecting
that it was politically inspired. And, thus, it did not ultimately
break with the debilitating tradition of bending the judicial
system to shifting political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo made a forceful move to consolidate
his power and eliminate holdover influences of his predecessor,
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when he authorized Raul Salinas' arrest
on homicide charges on Feb. 28, 1995, barely three months into his
term.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Carlos Salinas and his family have become reviled
symbols of corruption, and Zedillo has maintained his distance from
them.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas went into exile in February 1995, shortly after
his brother's arrest, and has most recently been living in
Ireland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans assume, based on experience, that with Zedillo clearly
on the side of convicting Raul Salinas, Ojeda knew which way to
go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is based totally on hearsay,'' said a political
analyst, Jorge Castaneda. ``This is not the rule of law. This is
the political use of justice the way it has always been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda, 39, who has had a hand in several of Mexico's most
explosive criminal cases, anticipated that he would be accused of
tailoring his ruling to Zedillo's will. In a 16-page summary of the
voluminous verdict, the judge wrote, ``We did not receive any
orders, pressures or messages, nor was any other action taken
intended to subordinate us to any interest other than that of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ojeda presided over the four-year case with unusual
dispassion. He kept journalists and politicians at arm's length and
never gave the defense cause to complain about his handling of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda, who had sole responsibility for the decision, because
there is no jury trial in the Mexican system, acknowledged that
there was no definitive proof of Raul Salinas' guilt. Rather, he
said, the judge was moved by what he called ``interlocking
evidence'' to impose the 50-year sentence, the maximum for any
crime under Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently persuaded mainly by the testimony of one
witness, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez. Rodriguez Gonzalez has been
convicted of organizing and deploying the team that killed a
politician, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, on Sept. 28, 1994, on a
street here.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Gonzalez testified in February 1995 that Salinas was
behind the crime after he had been in custody for nearly five
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda pointed to statements by at least six other witnesses, as
well as to records of telephone calls to Salinas' house in the days
after the shooting, that supported Rodriguez Gonzalez's account
that Salinas had asked a political associate to set up the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda was not deterred by the fact that the associate, an
undistinguished but ambitious federal congressman, Manuel Munoz
Rocha, who is recognized by all sides as the crucial witness in the
case, disappeared one day after the shooting. He is being sought on
charges of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Rodriguez Gonzalez accused Salinas a new
prosecutor appointed by Zedillo paid the witness $500,000. In a
part of his ruling that the defense is sure to challenge on appeal
Ojeda found that the payment did ``not constitute a bribe,''
because Rodriguez Gonzalez never received the money. A member of
his family apparently took the money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Ojeda troubled by the prosecution's failure to
demonstrate any powerful motive for Salinas to order the murder of
Ruiz Massieu, who had been married to Raul Salinas' sister,
Adriana, remained a political confidante of Carlos Salinas until
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge accepted the prosecution's argument that Raul Salinas
nursed a grudge against Ruiz Massieu over his divorce from Salinas'
sister and from a feud between the two men over a government
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   The court record showed little evidence to illustrate those
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers said they would appeal to the next level of
federal courts and ask the Supreme Court to dismiss the case
because of prosecutors' irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said appeals courts rarely overturned criminal
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   One powerful expression of doubt about the verdict came from the
victim's family. In an open letter published Friday the Ruiz
Massieu family said, ``All the irregularities and illegal acts in
this case make us doubt the good faith of the prosecutors
responsible for sustaining the accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Massieu's relatives said they were ``very sad'' that the
truth of his murder would never be known.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Mexico City, however, opinion ran strongly in
favor of the verdict, although Mexicans said they were convinced
that it was politically induced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years, that's good,'' said Salome Pena, 31, an employee
in a drugstore near the Justice Palace, home of the appeals courts.
``It should have been more. But I'm sure they'll appeal. And then
under the next president he will get out.''
</P>
<P>
   A bus driver, Raul Sanchez, 36, said: ``We finally got some
justice. I don't care if it's political revenge. They should impose
the death sentence on him and all those who abused political
power.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that Carlos Salinas will be able to repair his
reputation or return to live here soon. Carlos Rojas Gutierrez,
secretary general of the Salinas brothers' party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, expressed his ``full respect'' for the
verdict. The PRI is also Zedillo's party.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the flaws of the verdict, many Mexicans welcomed the
precedent that it set. ``It may seem inconsistent to overturn
impunity with something far less than perfect justice,'' Federico
Estevez, a political scientist, said. ``But it still made a very
important point.''

HONG KONG PINS AIRPORT'S FAULTS ON FOREIGNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Seven months after Hong Kong's new $20 billion
airport opened amid a riot of lost luggage and rotting cargo, a
government commission Friday laid most of the blame on the
airport's Western managers.
</P>
<P>
   Describing them as ``overconfident,'' the report said the
executives should have asked the Hong Kong government to delay the
opening by two months to fix bugs in the airport's flight
information screens, baggage-handling systems, and its vast, but
woefully disorganized, cargo terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the airport opened July 6, its display screens
went dark, luggage went astray and crates of cargo _ including
fresh fish _ were left to rot on the runway. Though most of the
glitches were soon solved, it was a stinging embarrassment for a
city that prides itself on Swiss-watch efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The commission exonerated the government, which had been accused
by several opposition politicians of pushing to open the airport
too early so that the opening ceremony could coincide with the
first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and a visit by
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing 56 witnesses and combing through 800 boxes of
documents, the commission said there was no evidence ``to indicate
that the decision was made with any political or ulterior
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   That set off howls of criticism from opposition leaders, who
derided the report as a ``whitewash'' and said the commission had
not investigated the motives behind the government's decision to
open the airport in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a question of the airport managers being
overconfident,'' said James To, a pro-democracy member of Hong
Kong's Legislative Council. ``They all understood that this
deadline could not be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they were troubled that in a 702-page report, the
only people criticized by name were four senior executives of Hong
Kong's Airport Authority, three of whom are Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   Among those harshly faulted were Henry Townsend, an American
engineering executive who was the airport's chief executive, and
Douglas Oakervee, a British construction expert who was the project
manager. Both men have since retired, and they could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not single out either the chairman of the
airport's board of directors, Wong Po Yan, or the chief secretary
of the Hong Kong government, Anson Chan, who had oversight
responsibility for the project and chaired the committee that set
the July opening date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to point fingers at the expatriates,'' said Albert
Cheng, an outspoken radio commentator. ``They're already paid off
and gone. You don't want to embarrass the people who are still in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng and other critics said that since the handover, the
government has shown a predilection to pin Hong Kong's problems on
foreigners. Last August, when it intervened to prop up the stock
market, the government blamed overseas hedge funds for attacking
its currency and stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has been a cause of acrimony between China and the
West before. Britain conceived the project, which is built on
reclaimed land off a nearby island, about a decade before the 1997
handover. But its vast size angered Beijing, which suspected the
colonial administration was seeking to deplete Hong Kong's treasury
before it relinquished its possession.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa,
defended the report as fair and unbiased. ``It named the people
because the commission thought it was important to name the
people,'' Tung said at a news conference after the report was
issued Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tung said the government ought to shoulder some blame for
the fiasco. ``When the airport began its operations, everyone in
Hong Kong had great expectations,'' he said. ``We were all let down
very much and the disappointment that was felt by everybody was
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Obscured by all the apologies and recrimination is one happy bit
of news: The Hong Kong International Airport has recovered from its
hapless start to win enthusiastic praise from travelers. Cargo _
human and otherwise _ moves through the mammoth complex efficiently
and travel magazines have recently begun to rate it as one of the
leading airports in the world.

STARR SEEKS EMERGENCY ORDER TO COMPEL LEWINSKY TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose
investigation led to President Clinton's impeachment trial, sought
an emergency court order Friday to compel Monica Lewinsky to submit
to interviews by House prosecutors over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought the order at the request of Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, after Ms. Lewinsky refused to meet
with the House managers last week. Chief Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson of U.S. District Court was still considering the request
late Friday evening, said Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge grants the order, Ms. Lewinsky would face intense
questioning over the weekend. The House prosecutors, or managers,
believe that answers could be pivotal as the Senate decides early
next week whether to question witnesses or decide Clinton's fate
without witnesses, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting down to the point where we need to know who
we're going to call and why we're going to call them,'' McNulty
said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the week drew to a close and the White House defense team
finished its presentation, the House managers faced increasing odds
against calling witnesses. The situation grew more questionable
Friday as prominent senators, like Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called for
a quick end to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces two articles of impeachment, voted by the House of
Representatives a month ago, that accuse him of perjury and
obstruction of justice. The articles say he lied about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and engaged in illegal maneuvers to
have friends and aides cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Starr reached an agreement last July giving her
immunity from prosecution, provided that she answer questions
truthfully. She was interviewed extensively by grand jurors and
Starr's prosecutors, and her testimony about her relationship with
the president was the foundation for much of Starr's case against
him. The House managers also leaned heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony to try to show that Clinton lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem that she has already been asked every
conceivable question by Starr's prosecutors, and that nothing new
could be gleaned from her recollections, the House prosecutors want
to question her nonetheless. Hyde, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, went to Starr because, as the official who
reached the immunity agreement with Ms. Lewinsky, he is its chief
enforcer, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, McNulty said, Ms. Lewinsky ought to fear nothing
from House questioners _ assuming she tells the truth _ because her
immunity agreement covers anything she might say, her lawyer's
misgivings notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion before Judge Johnson, Starr asserted in part:
``The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its motion to
call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House has stressed its
need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors' sense of urgency becomes clear when
the impeachment timetable is analyzed. If, as expected, there is a
motion in the Senate early next week to dismiss the case against
the president, the House prosecutors want to be able to argue
against it based on whatever new nuggets they can wrest from Ms.
Lewinsky's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if the motion to dismiss the case is defeated _ as
head-counters think it would be, given the Republicans' 55-45
advantage in the Senate _ Republicans would want to use those
nuggets to support their arguments that witnesses should be called.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Starr's motion, at Hyde's request, before Johnson was
almost literally an 11th-hour attempt. Should the judge not grant
the motion, Republicans would lose their last big opportunity to
gauge what Ms. Lewinsky might say on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Starr's office Friday, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers
said their client would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed. But
they said they were not persuaded by Starr's assurances that the
independent counsel's office could guarantee her immunity before
Congress despite the agreement of last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Starr said Ms. Lewinsky could insist that his
office supervise debriefings by the House managers. But he rejected
any suggestion that his office would be acting as ``an agent'' for
them. Starr was responding to her lawyers' assertions that her
obligation to submit to questioning would be void if the
independent counsel were acting as an agent for another entity.
</P>
<P>
   His office, Starr said, ``has its own, continuing duty to
provide the House with information relating to impeachment'' and
was not acting as an agent for anyone. In any event, he said, the
immunity agreement allows the independent counsel's office to
subject Ms. Lewinsky to questioning not only on its own behalf but
on behalf of ``representatives of any other institutions as the OIC
may require.''
</P>
<P>
   One official close to the proceedings insisted there was still
information that Ms. Lewinsky could provide, contradictions she
might resolve. As an example, he noted her recollection that the
president's personal secretary came to her apartment at 2 p.m. on
Dec. 28, 1997, to retrieve gifts the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cellular-phone logs show the secretary, Betty Currie, called
Ms. Lewinsky at 3:30. Perhaps, the official suggested, Ms. Lewinsky
would recall, after her memory was jogged, that Ms. Currie came by
closer to 4 p.m., a two-hour difference that could be crucial in
showing motive and intent.

CENTRAL BANK TRIES TO HALT SLIDE OF BRAZIL CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Faced with another steep fall in the value
of its currency, Brazil's central bank used more of its dwindling
reserves of dollars Friday to buy Brazilian money in the foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
   The action helped stabilize the value of the currency, the real.
But it did little to calm the nerves of financial analysts and
economists who are on edge over the future course of Latin
America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The main stock market index, the Bovespa, which has become
something of a barometer of investor anxiety about Brazil, fell
1.79 percent, its second big decline after four days of large
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence in the Brazilian government is at a very low
level,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political consultant based in
Brasilia. ``Internally, people are asking what are these guys going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's move reined in Brazil's currency at 1.71
reais to the dollar, after it plunged earlier in the day to 1.90 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving passage of structural reforms to cut government
overspending until his fifth year in office, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso has suddenly run out of time, as the economic
storms that battered Asia and Russia now hammer Brazil. Though
Brazil's Congress passed an important measure on pension reform
Wednesday night, the expectation from financial markets is now that
Brazil must take more aggressive action to arrest its economic
slide.
</P>
<P>
   International investors now expect even deeper spending cuts
than the 28 billion reais originally scheduled (now worth $16.5
billion), changes in economic leadership and other more drastic
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The country is racing to fashion a series of policies that will
allow it to lower dizzyingly high interest rates, which most
financial observers say the country cannot sustain for more than 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's foreign reserves have now dwindled to $26 billion,
roughly a third of their level last summer. A team from the
International Monetary Fund, which is backing Brazil with a $41.5
billion standby loan, Friday headed for talks with officials in the
capital of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement the fund signed with Brazil just two months ago
has been largely superseded by the swift unraveling of Brazil's
economy in recent weeks, as interest rates soared and a dangerous
hemorrhaging of foreign reserves _ contained by the IMF-led bailout
a few months ago _ restarted.
</P>
<P>
   With important premises of the original accord not met, the IMF
agreement is being reopened for discussion. The agreement presumed
Brazil would maintain its policy of linking the currency's value to
the dollar, which it abandoned last week. Brazil also failed to
meet targets for domestic debt levels in December.

   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock
Exchange fell 7.6 percent in December, to 3.65 billion shares, the
exchange said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the American Stock Exchange, recently acquired by the
National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq market,
uncovered short sales fell 8.2 percent, to 161.2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are those
shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered by
repurchase. If the share price falls, an investor can profit by
buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, the short-interest figure for the month ended
Jan. 15 was equal to 1.5 percent of the total shares listed on the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The total for the month is well below the record of 4.21 billion
shares set in the month ended Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Placer Dome Inc., the gold mining company, had the largest
increase in short interest in the month, excluding companies with
stock splits. It more than tripled, to 33.7 million from 10.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest decrease in short interest was for American
International Group, falling nearly 70 percent, to 9.9 million from
32.6 million.

SENATORS TALK OF ENDING CLINTON TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As chapter two in President Clinton's impeachment
trial unfolded Friday, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., surprised the
Senate by announcing he would offer a motion to dismiss the case as
early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the influential elder senator, who had been
undecided about conviction, pointed to a movement among some
senators to end the trial without calling witnesses, despite the
prosecution's best efforts to head it off.
</P>
<P>
   While indicating that they would likely vote against Byrd's
motion, key Republicans suggested that it was time to start looking
for an exit strategy nonetheless. Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and
Olympia Snowe of Maine agreed with Byrd that there are not enough
votes to convict Clinton. Hatch offered his own plan to end the
trial, suggesting that senators allow both sides to sum up their
cases early next week. Senators would then vote on a motion to
adjourn with language attached that recognizes the House articles
of impeachment as ``the highest vote of condemnation and of censure
for the president's despicable acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of ending the trial came as senators moved Friday into the
first of two days of questioning. Senators were allowed to submit
written questions to House prosecutors and White House lawyers
through Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's motion to dismiss would need a simple majority of 51
senators and would end the trial without a final up or down vote on
whether Clinton should be convicted of the two articles of
impeachment the House filed against him last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Byrd said that, in his view, the president was guilty
of wrongful conduct in his attempt to hide his illicit relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, he added that he
saw no reason to prolong the trial absent the two-thirds majority
required to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats and a few Republicans are expected to vote
against conviction, making the likelihood of attaining the 67 votes
necessary to remove Clinton from office a mathematical
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop. I have also
become convinced that lengthening this trial will only prolong and
deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect this sorry affair
has visited upon our nation,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's statement drew support from many of his Democratic
colleagues who are eager to wrap up the case with their party's
presidency still intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have had a fair process ... The time has now come
for us to dismiss the case,`` said House Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   A few more Republicans also joined the growing opposition to the
idea of calling witnesses, although they said they would not
necessarily support Byrd's motion for an outright dismissal of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Allard of Colorado, for example, said, ``Right now I
don't see a real demanding need for witnesses.'' He said that both
sides have done a good job of making their cases and that most of
what he needs to know to make a decision on Clinton's guilt or
innocence has already been presented.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from senators, the House's chief
prosecutor, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois,
literally begged the senators not to adjourn the trial before
allowing them to put on a complete prosecution, including taking
more testimony from Lewinsky and other key witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He said that not allowing witnesses to appear at the trial would
be ``sending a terrible message to the people of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying, I guess, perjury is OK if it's about sex,
obstruction is OK,'' Hyde told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Byrd by name, he cautioned that approving a
motion to dismiss would amount to a ``cavalier treatment of our
articles of impeachment.'' Dismissing the case, he said, would
``throw out the window the fact that the president's lies and
stonewalling have cost millions of dollars that could have been
obviated.'' He said it also would cause ``damage to sexual
harassment laws'' and make it ``more difficult to prosecute people
in the military or elsewhere for perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are serious consequences,'' Hyde said, adding that while
the House impeachment case may have been an ``annoyance'' for the
Senate to deal with, it was at least ``a constitutional annoyance''
that should be played out to the end with witnesses and a final
vote on whether to convict and remove the 42nd president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde drew support from Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who told
reporters during a break in Friday's proceedings that it was
impossible to ``have an impartial trial without calling
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded senators that they have a responsibility to history
to conduct the impeachment process through to the end so that
future congresses will have a complete blueprint to guide them.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Senate had held final votes on the guilt or
innocence of 13 federal judges brought before them on impeachment
charges, he said Byrd's motion was ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private attorney David Kendall, however, argued that
calling the same witnesses who testified before a federal grand
jury in the investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky matter would only
give senators ``a 6th, 7th and 8th account'' of what's already
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling witnesses will add nothing to the record already
before you,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that bringing in witnesses would only delay the
conclusion of the trial for ``many months,'' because Clinton's
legal team would have to be given a chance to depose and cross
examine them before they appear.
</P>
<P>
   The clash over whether to simply end the trial or continue with
the calling of witnesses came as the House prosecutors and
Clinton's lawyers slogged their way through five hours of rebuttal
and counter-rebuttal in response to questions thrown at them by
Democratic and Republican senators. The question-and-answer session
will continue at 10 a.m. CST Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were spoon-fed, for the most part, to each side by
lawmakers sympathetic to one argument or the other. But the answers
broke little new ground, even though they did on occasion cause
senators to sit up and take note as the defense and prosecution
engaged in a clash over evidence and legal precedents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Rep. James Rogan of California, one of the House
prosecutors, assailed the White House defense arguments as nothing
more than ``legal schizophrenia'' meant to confuse and obfuscate
the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff countered with his own
observation that the House prosecutors, ``in their straw-man
building role,'' have tried ``to suggest that our position somehow
is so distant from constitutional reality ... that we could not
conceive of a situation in which private conduct, no matter how
egregious, would lead to removal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the case,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   As the day's proceedings wound down, at least one of the
prosecutors, Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, appeared to sense

POPE, IN MEXICO, URGES MORAL PRESSURE ON U.S.  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Thousands of glinting lights, reflections of
mirrors held up by Mexican followers, welcomed Pope John Paul II's
plane as he arrived in Mexico Friday to address Latin and North
America as a whole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First the pope gave a word of warning about the responsibilities
of the world's last superpower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States
remained alone,'' he told reporters traveling on his plane. ``I do
not know if this is good or not, but that is the way it is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, 78, who will meet with President Clinton next week in
St. Louis, chose Mexico as a meeting place for bishops from all the
Americas to underscore his point that the churches should work more
closely together.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants his bishops to pool their strengths to exert
greater moral pressure on Washington. In his arrival speech at the
airport, where 4,000 school children, church bells and mariachi
bands welcomed him, the pope sounded a theme that will be a
leitmotif of his pastoral visits to Mexico City and St. Louis,
calling for ``a just society, open to technological progress that
is in harmony with necessary moral progress.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stooped and frail, his hands shaky with the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, the pope nevertheless looked hale and alert as
he answered reporters' questions before landing. He said that after
this, his 85th papal trip, he still wanted to travel, and named
Russia and China, ``the biggest ones,'' as leading his list. ``So
far, I haven't lost the desire or the will,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He reported that he was ``quite pleased'' with the results of
his trip to Cuba a year ago, noting that afterward President Fidel
Castro allowed Christmas to be celebrated freely, ``and that is a
great step forward.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been little progress in Chiapas, a southern Mexican
state where guerrillas have been fighting government troops. Roman
Catholic priests who minister to the Indian population there have
been accused by the government of supporting the leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The pope did not share his own views of Bishop Samuel Ruiz
Garcia, who is accused by some in the government of being too close
to the rebels, but he did make clear that his views on liberation
theology ``or its offshoots'' have not changed since he condemned
it in Mexico 20 years ago, on his first papal trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some thought of substituting liberation theology with
the theology of an indigenous movement,'' he said. Such thinking
was too indebted to Marxism to work, he said, adding, ``I think the
true solution can only be solidarity and dialogue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his arrival speech, delivered before President Ernesto
Zedillo, the pope omitted a passage in his written text that
mentioned Chiapas along with other regions of Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, the pope was presented with a huge velvet sombrero
by a Mexican reporter, who sought to recreate the moment in 1979
when the pope happily donned a sombrero and delighted millions of
Mexicans. This time, the pope hesitated, and when she urged him to
put it on, placed it with a trembling hand over his head for a
second. It was a poignant moment, and the pope seemed wistfully
aware of the passage of time and youthful vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had changed since his first visit, he replied slowly,
``Above all, we are all older, you, and also I.`` But he noted one
change for the better. ``When I came in 1979 the priests who came
to see me were forbidden to walk around in their cassocks,'' he
said, referring to the period before 1991 when the Mexican
Constitution was fiercely anti-clerical. Mexican policy toward the
church has changed, he said, but the Mexican people have not.
``They are still enthusiastic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With church bells clanging a welcome in thousands of villages,
Mexican television reported that one million people turned out to
catch a glimpse of the pope. Zedillo embraced him on the airport
runway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Holiness is welcomed by a people that suffers material
wants but has an immense spiritual richness,'' Zedillo said. ``That
spiritual wealth strengthens the Mexican people's perseverance as
it seeks to multiply opportunities, diminish inequalities and
achieve a dignified life for all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope quickly got a taste of Mexico's vigorous new pluralism
when, after an hour's drive to Mexico City's historic center, past
thousands of Mexicans waving yellow-and-white Vatican flags, he
heard the mayor excoriate Zedillo's economic policies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city's mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is expected to run
for president next year at the head of a leftist party, said the
government's current economic policies have brought ``tremendous
deterioration in Mexicans' quality of life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, as everywhere else, the pope also intends to remind
people of the dangers of materialism. In this country of contrasts,
his message against consumerism and heartless profiteering clashed
with the unbridled marketing surrounding his visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Billboards lining the streets from the airport welcomed him with
the words, ``Mexico Always Faithful.'' There were two images: the
pope's and the Pepsi logo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A full-page advertisement for Sealy mattresses in one newspaper
showed a reflective angel looking skyward through the clouds, under
a bold headline: ``Starting today we're going to experience
unforgettable dreams.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kodak used a photo of the pope in advertisements Friday,
offering to develop snapshots of the pope for free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican snack food company, Sabritas, which is owned by a
division of Pepsico, has in recent weeks packaged its potato chips
with a wrap-around strip featuring John Paul's photo. And in a
televised commercial for Sabritas products, Norberto Rivera
Carrera, the archbishop of Mexico City, appeared personally to
thank the company for helping to underwrite the pope's visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid an outpouring of articles in Mexican newspapers criticizing
the Sabritas and other advertisements, Rivera defended the
commercials, telling reporters that the archdiocese had requested
financial help but had in no way intended to endorse any
corporation's products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many church officials expressed irritation with the
advertisements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Merida, Yucatan, Emilio Berlie Belaunzaran,
waded into the debate this week, pleading with Mexicans ``not to
banalize the image of the pope.''

EDITORIAL: FAIR PLAY FOR OSTERSUND  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   The early round of housecleaning the International Olympic
Committee will undertake this weekend should sweep the shakedown
artists from the governing body of the Olympic movement. But far
more needs to be done to clean up after the bribery scandal
engulfing the organization's choice of Salt Lake City for the next
Winter Olympics. The committee will need to devise an ethically
tight process for choosing future sites, and should reconsider its
award of the Winter Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Word that a top Australian Olympic official offered $35,000
apiece to two IOC members the night before Sydney won the 2000
summer games by a two-vote margin over Beijing should add a sense
of urgency to the IOC meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege of being the host of the Olympic Games should
never be sold to the highest bidder in a silent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's housecleaning will be cold comfort to the Swedish
town of Ostersund and its dreams of being host to the 2002 Winter
Olympics. Unlike some of the protagonists in Salt Lake City's
successful campaign for the 2002 games, the folks of Ostersund say
they abided by the rules. They spurned offers to buy delegate votes
with lavish gifts, money, cars and other bribery. Embracing this
kind of influence-peddling, including scholarships and jobs, helped
Salt Lake ingratiate itself with some delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Cities that have conducted bribe-free campaigns to win the
Summer or Winter Games should have been able to compete on a level
playing field, not one tilted by money and other forms of
corruption. The decision by the IOC's internal investigative panel,
headed by the Montreal lawyer Richard Pound, to broaden its inquiry
beyond Salt Lake to include the host-city competitions for the
Games held between 1996, the year the Summer Games were in Atlanta,
and 2006 is a wise one.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of Pound's panel of inquiry should allow the IOC to
determine which host-city competitions were fatally tainted by
bribes-for-votes. In cases where cities advanced to the finals or
won the right to be a host city because of influence-peddling, the
IOC will need to reopen the competition for those Games. Site
selection for both the 2000 and 2002 Games should begin anew.
</P>
<P>
   Those with oversight responsibilities for amateur and
professional sports now devote a good deal of their time to trying
to banish unscrupulous athletes who take performance-enhancing
drugs. The IOC cannot expect to command the respect and confidence
of nations if it enforces one ethical standard for athletes but
tolerates an anything-goes milieu for competitions to be the host
city.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Biological and chemical terrorism and disabling attacks on
American computer networks are not just the stuff of novels and
films. Nerve gas already has been released in the Tokyo subways.
Hackers and virus programs have struck supposedly secure computer
systems. President Clinton is right to plan a coordinated federal
response to what could become a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the $2.8 billion program Clinton unveiled
Friday to detect, prevent or limit the damage from such terrorist
attacks is on the mark. The money would finance research into new
vaccines; the stockpiling of antibiotics and other medications
likely to be needed in response to terrorist attacks; federal
training of state and city medical response teams, and research and
training in new computer security methods. A strong federal role is
needed in all these areas, and the spending levels are about right
for current needs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration promises to protect constitutional liberties
and individual civil rights as it assumes a larger role in
terrorist surveillance. Still, two areas bear watching. There have
been discussions in the Pentagon, but no decision, about creating a
new domestic military command to combat terrorism. That would erode
the long-established legal principle that America's armed forces
should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   There is also potential danger in federal monitoring of civilian
computer networks for intrusion by hackers. Such monitoring could
lead to improper government surveillance of private correspondence
on the Internet and elsewhere. The right role for Washington here
is financing research and providing technical advice to the private
sector about computer security techniques and software.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Clinton program warrants rapid Congressional
approval and funding. Lethal germs and deadly nerve gases are now
easily prepared in bathroom laboratories, and computer hacking
skills are common among high school students. Protecting the
American public from biological, chemical and computer attack
should not get bogged down in Washington's partisan warfare.

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The storm system rose out of Texas and
Oklahoma and crossed into Arkansas early Thursday. By the time it
exhausted itself, the tornadoes it spawned killed eight people in
two states.
</P>
<P>
   As many as three dozen tornadoes lashed Arkansas between about 5
p.m. and 8:30 p.m., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't stop,'' Teri Magsam of the Arkansas Office of
Emergency Services said Friday. ``They just kept on coming in, one
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   In White County four people died, including 2-month-old Kirk
McAfee, who was killed when his family's home in Beebe, a community
of 4,000 people, 35 miles northeast of Little Rock, was flattened.
The infant was either sucked or blown out of the home and was found
about a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCullock's family barely survived the tornado that
shattered their house. ``We got in the center hallway with the
mattress off the bed and began praying to beat the band,''
McCullock said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``brand-new'' junior high school that McCullock's daughter
attended was a pile of bricks and shingles.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado tore apart the home of Wanda Willis, 65, a member of
the school board in nearby Searcy, and tossed her body into a
field, said Tom Martin, chief of the Center Hill community's fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were a woman known only as Flo Taylor, estimated by
authorities to be in her 50s, and a fourth person found Friday but
not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Winds whipped across the grounds of the governor's mansion in
Little Rock. There was no damage to the building, but the tree
house in a backyard oak where Chelsea Clinton had once played was a
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   But only blocks from the governor's mansion, a supermarket
collapsed from the force of the winds, and on Friday morning one of
several people initially trapped in the wreckage, Robert Howard,
67, the store's pharmacist, died of his injuries. A 34-year-old
Little Rock woman, Lisa Jacko, died on Thursday night when a tree
struck the car she was driving a short distance from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, there was more
death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was in her wheelchair and my uncle was in the
back bedroom and he was coming down the hallway when the tree fell
and crushed him,'' said Eva Weikel, the niece of James Looper, 63,
who died in the wreckage of his mobile home in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The storm then moved into Tennessee, where a woman was killed by
a tornado west of Nashville when she went outside to get her dogs,
The Associated Press reported. The storm tore apart the historic
district of Clarksville, Tenn., early Friday, wrecking the
121-year-old courthouse and cutting power to 25,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes killed nine people in Tennessee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The storms cut off electricity to more than 70,000 Arkansas
homes and businesses on Thursday, and by late Friday afternoon
42,000 people were still without power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most unusual storms I've ever seen this time
of year _ strong and volatile,'' said George Wilken, a
meteorologist with 33 years' experience at the National Weather
Service in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes rarely occur in the South during winter, but when they
do, they are often very powerful, Wilken said. The latest storm
system, he said, was created when unusually warm, moist Gulf air
moved north under a cold air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Arkansas' 75 counties have declared local
emergencies and three were designated major disaster areas by Gov.
Mike Huckabee. ``It's just devastating,'' he said. ``We've seen
more damage that we expected. We weren't prepared for what we saw
in White County.''

OLYMPIC SCANDAL WIDENS: PAYMENTS LINKED TO SUMMER GAMES IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Australia)  (See also OLY-SALTLAKECITY) 
(fe) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic bribery scandal expanded to a new front on Friday
when documents were made public showing that the Australian Olympic
Committee offered tens of thousands of dollars to two African
members of the International Olympic Committee the night before the
decisive vote on the site for the 2000 Summer Games. Sydney was
awarded the games after it defeated Beijing by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released on Friday contain two letters from John
Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee and the
head of Sydney's bid to be named host of the 2000 Games, offering
payments of $5,000 a year for seven years each to national sports
programs run by Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis
Nyangweso of Uganda. The letters were delivered Sept. 23, 1993 in
Monte Carlo, Monaco, hours before Sydney edged Beijing, 45-43, in
voting among members of the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said Friday night that the payments had in
fact been made for the years 1994 through 1998 and that they had
insured that the payments went to the sports programs and not the
two officials. Because voting on awarding the games is secret, it
is impossible to say for certain if the two Africans ultimately
backed Sydney. Attempts to reach Mukora and Nyangweso Friday night
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the I.O.C. said the group was investigating the
actions of the Australian Olympic Committee and that the affair
would be taken up at a Sunday meeting of the 11-member executive
board of the international committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any proof or documents will be looked into,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of possible misconduct by the Australian Olympic
Committee is only the latest blow for the international body, an
organization that has already concluded that officials with the
Salt Lake City effort to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games had given
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and other benefits to
I.O.C. members in an effort to gain favor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya resigned Friday in
the wake of investigations into the Salt Lake City bid. His son,
Suher, has said that he received tuition assistance to two Utah
universities, as well as $700 a month in living expenses from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials. Suher Attarabulsi once even listed his
home address as the office of the Salt Lake Olympic committee. The
resignation was the second this week by a committee member,
following the departure of Pirjo Haggman of Finland, who resigned
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 other committee members face suspension or
expulsion in connection with the Salt Lake scandal when the
executive board meets this weekend in Lausanne, Switzerland, to
hear a report of wrongdoing in Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Sydney Friday night, Coates said the
Australian Olympic Committee had negotiated deals in the summer of
1993 with a handful of African and other countries to provide
sports scholarships and other assistance. He said he decided to
commit to precise cash payments the night before the vote because
he felt demoralized about Sydney's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was leveraging our bid,'' Coates said, defending both the
initial arrangements to provide assistance and the promises of
specific dollar amounts. ``But that was within the I.O.C.'s
guidelines and is within the I.O.C.'s guidelines until they rule
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one senior U.S. Olympic official, the latest
revelations could lead to additional calls for Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the powerful president of the I.O.C., either to take
drastic action aimed at reform or to perhaps resign. Accused
members who do not resign this weekend will be suspended, Samaranch
has said, and will face expulsion by a vote of the entire I.O.C.
membership in March.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said Samaranch was wounded and might soon face what he
called a ``palace revolt.'' He said his survival would probably
depend on whether a thorough housecleaning is carried out in the
wake of the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume a lot don't resign,'' Schultz said of the members
implicated in wrongdoing. ``If there is unanimity to vote these
people out and make changes, I think he will end up in a strong
position. If they can't do that, not only Samaranch but the whole
I.O.C. is in trouble. That will look bad all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz became the first high-ranking Olympic official to speak
publicly of the precariousness of Samaranch's hold on the Olympic
leadership after 18 years as president. The 78-year-old Spanish
marquis has said that he will serve out his current term, which
ends in 2001. The U.S. Olympic Committee has strongly expressed its
support for Samaranch, and Anita DeFrantz, an international vice
president from Los Angeles, has also said that she firmly believes
he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an interview with The Associated Press in
Switzerland, Samaranch appeared committed to remaining in his job.
``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the I.O.C. more than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the I.O.C.
has its headquarters, the senior International Olympic Committee
official from Australia said that the news was so disturbing that
it could raise calls for the games to be removed from Sydney. The
official, Kevan Gosper, said he did not previously know of the
inducement offers but described them to the Associated Press as
being ``beyond good will'' and called for all Sydney documents to
be made public and for a full-scale investigation of the city's bid
process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Thomas, a spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee,
said the idea of taking the Games from Sydney was not realistic.
``We are 20 months away,'' he said. ``How else could they put on
the games?''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said in an interview that he believed, at this point,
that the 2000 Summer Games would not be removed to another city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think so,'' Schultz said. ``I would hope not. It
will be a spectacular site for the games. They've invested so much
money in new facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it would be impossible to move the 2000 games at such a
late date, ``I suppose nothing is impossible. But you'd have to go
someplace where they've got their venues in place, like Seoul.''
The South Korean capital was host the 1988 Summer Games and is
preparing to be a co-host, with Japan, of the 2002 World Cup in
soccer.

   THE CENTRAL BANK OF BRAZIL ACTS TO STABILIZE CURRENCY
</P>
<P>
   Faced with another steep decline in the value of its currency,
Brazil's central bank used more of its dwindling reserves of
dollars to buy Brazilian money in the foreign exchange market. The
bank's action helped stabilize the value of the currency, the real.
But it did little to calm the nerves of financial analysts and
economists on edge over the country's future.
</P>
<P>
   The main stock market index, the Bovespa, fell 1.79 percent, to
7,190.21, its second consecutive drop.

   INTERNET FEVER STARTS TO COOL DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Internet fever has been growing as shares of newly public
companies have soared. But this week, a bit of the air leaked out
of what many Wall Street pros call the Internet bubble and many
analysts are warning of a steep decline that could rattle the wider
market.

   DUSTIN HOFFMAN WINS MAGAZINE SUIT
</P>
<P>
   A judge has ordered Los Angeles magazine to pay $1.5 million in
actual damages to the actor Dustin Hoffman for publishing a
computer-altered image of him in an evening dress and high heels.
The magazine had used Hoffman's head, taken from a still from the
1982 movie ``Tootsie,'' and placed it on a body wearing a Richard
Tyler designer dress and Ralph Lauren shoes.

   MANAGERS BLAMED FOR AIRPORT WOES
</P>
<P>
   A report by a government commission laid blame for the problems
when Hong Kong's $20 billion airport opened on its expatriate

delay in the opening to fix bugs in its flight information screens,
baggage-handling systems and cargo terminal.

   HIGHER HEALTH PREMIUMS PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries with relatively high incomes would have
to pay higher premiums under proposals outlined by the chairman of
a congressional commission seeking ways to avert a financial crisis
in the health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the poorest among the nation's 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries, people with incomes below $10,000 a year, are going
without aid from government safety net programs intended to help
them pay their health care expenses.

GENESIS GETS   NAME CHANGE   BEFORE IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Wall Street's interest in Internet-based
companies slowed perceptibly over the past week, at least one local
firm hopes the market is just catching its breath.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-based GenesisIntermedia.com Inc. will launch an initial
public offering late next week. And the company went so far as to
change its name, tacking on the ``.com,'' in an apparent effort to
ride the wave of investor excitement generated in the last year by
several high-profile IPOs of Internet-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis acknowledges in its prospectus both that it has a
limited operating history and that ``virtually all of (its)
revenues to date have been derived from conventional media
solutions,'' not from the Internet. Still, the company says it
plans to increase its online presence through future acquisitions
of Internet-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO, underwritten by newcomer Millennium Financial Group
Inc., has a target price of $8.50 for each of 2 million shares the
company wants to float.
</P>
<P>
   Genesis sells products that it owns or for which it has licensed
the marketing rights via infomercials on broadcast television,
cable TV and print advertising. It then resells customer data to
other retailers in the form of mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the company's top money-makers has been audio and video
products spun off from the best-selling John Gray book ``Men Are
From Mars, Women Are From Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1993, Genesis' sales slowed last year, with $9.37
million in revenue in the first nine months of 1998, compared with
$11.72 million in the same period of 1997. Earnings, however, crept
up over the three quarters to $795,000, compared with $763,000 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the company's quiet period prior to the IPO, Genesis
Chief Financial Officer Douglas Jacobson declined to comment on the
company's future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   While not necessarily critical of the company as a going
business, some IPO watchers say Genesis' name change to one that
implies an Internet-based operation is a cynical move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company, not just Genesis, that is putting the dot-com in
its official name in close conjunction with going public is without
question taking advantage of the buyer feeding frenzy'' surrounding
Internet stocks, said David Menlow, president of Millburn,
N.J.-based IPO Financial Network Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for whether or not it's ethical, that's something left to
the decision of the investors,'' Menlow said. ``But I'd caution
anybody who's involved that when buying an IPO they carefully read
the prospectus to see if their expectations for price performance
are based solely on the name or an actual business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact date of the IPO is unknown because Nasdaq has yet to
assign a date on which the shares can begin trading, Jacobson
said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FOOD STAMP INFRACTIONS  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's boast about cutting New York City's
welfare rolls suddenly has a thinner ring to it. As Rachel Swarns
wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday, federal investigators
from the Department of Agriculture found that the city's new
rigorous welfare-to-work program was in ``substantial
noncompliance'' with the federal Food Stamp Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft report, the department criticizes the city for not
immediately telling welfare applicants they could apply for food
stamps. It also chastises the state for not monitoring the program.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the state is criticizing the city from the other
direction _ arguing that Giuliani's welfare workers are giving too
many of the state's food stamps to ineligible immigrants. As for
the federal program, state officials say they found city workers
denying emergency access for eligible applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mayor is charging federal officials with issuing
a ``political document'' to impose ``user-friendly'' welfare
regulations on the city. A welfare system friendly to users is
nearly the opposite of Giuliani's ideal.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan federal court, advocates for the poor are arguing
this week that the mayor's welfare plan is so severe that many
applicants walk away without even realizing that they qualify for
help with their grocery bills. On Thursday, city officials promised
changes in the application process, including new forms for
applicants and retraining for workers. But the city could still
require a second visit to secure food stamps, a delay that may
violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor and his administrators have insisted, their goal is
to encourage welfare recipients to become independent, mainly by
finding work. For many women with children, this is especially
difficult because to work they need child care _ one promise by the
city and state that is still far from reality. Those unable to find
work are being pushed to look for help from the nearest friend,
family member or charity. As a last resort, after much effort and
several visits to the city office, welfare is available.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's new welfare workers, now called ``financial
advisers,'' should understand that food stamps and Medicaid can
often help people climb back into the workplace. Promoting
independence, however lofty a goal, cannot always mean a bracing
lecture and a quick shove out the door.

EDWARD T. PARRACK, 84, EX-HEAD OF KETCHUM ADVERTISING AGENCY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward T. Parrack, an advertising executive who supervised some
of the best-known campaigns in the early years of television, died
Jan. 13 at his home in Oakland in western Pennsylvania. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   As an account executive of Ketchum MacLeod &AMP; Grove, an
international advertising and public relations agency based in
Pittsburgh, he helped organize the commercial sponsorship of the
nationally televised political conventions that nominated Dwight
Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson. Along the way, the conventions
helped to make household names of Walter Cronkite, the CBS newsman,
and Betty Furness, a spokeswoman for Westinghouse appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Parrack also arranged for the sponsorship of the first televised
broadcasts of football by teams affiliated with the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, said Gerald Voros, a longtime
colleague at Ketchum.
</P>
<P>
   Parrack joined Ketchum in 1936 after graduating from the
University of Pittsburgh. He became assistant to George Ketchum,
the president and a founder of the agency, in 1940. He was chief
executive from 1962 until shortly before he retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As president and later chairman, he helped to transform Ketchum
from a medium-sized Pittsburgh agency that specialized in big
hometown accounts like Gulf Oil, H.J. Heinz and Pittsburgh Plate
Glass into an international business with offices in London and
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum acquired Botsford, Constantine &AMP; McCarty, a West Coast
agency in 1969. Three years ago, Ketchum itself was bought by the
Omnicom Group, based in New York, the world's largest advertising
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Parrack was born in New York in 1914 and moved to Pittsburgh as
a teen-ager in 1926. During World War II, he was a Lend-Lease
officer for Poland, Greece and Yugoslavia, and in 1945 he was a
special assistant to the secretary of state, Edward R. Stettinius,
at the San Francisco conference that created the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   He was a life trustee of the Carnegie Institute and served on a
number of hospital and private school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth Felix Parrack of
Pittsburgh; a son, Edward Jr. of New York; and two grandsons.

BYRD SAYS HE'LL ATTEMPT TO END IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Impeach-Questions)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial took a twist
Friday as Senator Robert C. Byrd, dean of Senate Democrats and one
of Clinton's harshest critics, abruptly called for dismissing the
charges to ``end this sad and sorry time for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's move came at a critical juncture, as senators face a
potentially explosive decision next week on whether to prolong the
trial for weeks, if not months, by calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking the dismissal, as early as Monday, Byrd was seen by
members of both parties as galvanizing Senate Democrats against the
impeachment charges and increasing the pressure on Republican
leaders to engineer a relatively swift conclusion to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a former Senate majority leader who is influential among
members of both parties, had opposed dismissing the charges until
Friday. Although senators in both parties said Byrd's proposal is
not likely to attract the 51 votes required to dismiss the charges,
they agreed the move may hasten the push for a bipartisan pact to
end the proceedings soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Byrd's decision really increases the possibilities,''
said Senator John F. Kerry, who is pushing for a bipartisan plan to
wrap up the two-week trial. ``It gives greater weight to the
dismissal vote in a way that may compel some people to find some
other resolution faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The development unfolded as Clinton's lawyers and 13 House
Republicans who are prosecuting the impeachment case submitted to
five hours of questioning by senators. The Senate will conduct a
final round of questions and answers Saturday, scheduled to begin
at 10 a.m., in a prelude to next week's showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides scored points in the initial question
period, many senators said Byrd's move and private negotiations
over the next phase of the trial had greater potential to affect
the outcome of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's proposal ``is a profound idea,'' said Senator Richard C.
Shelby, an Alabama Republican who is seen as leaning against the
impeachment charges. ``He is an institution here, a man of great
respect, who surprised a lot of people by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   But GOP conservatives, who propelled the impeachment charges
through the House and hold considerable sway in the Senate, lashed
out at Byrd's move as a way for Democrats to skirt a direct vote on
the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great defender of Senate procedure has lost his way,''
said Senator Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican. ``Here's a
man who talks about honor in the Senate, and he wants to
short-circuit the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy fired back, telling reporters ``our
founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves'' if the
Senate voted for the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the House Republicans remained steadfast. Responding to
questions from senators, the GOP managers launched their final push
to extend the trial with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue is crucial because Republicans face the
possibility of a public backlash if they approve prolonging the
trial with witnesses on a party-line vote. Polls show the public
wants a speedy end to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the GOP dilemma, Jim Nicholson, who was reelected
party chairman Friday, acknowledged Republicans ``have sustained
political damage'' because of the impeachment saga. But he asserted
that Democrats ultimately will be hurt for defending Clinton and
``failing to stand up for basic democratic...values.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Representative Bill McCollum of Florida
voiced the prosecution's enduring desire to extend the trial,
saying ``The House definitely holds to the position that we should
call witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the lead House manager, Representative Henry J. Hyde,
urged Senate leaders in a letter Friday to invite Clinton to
testify. The letter followed several days of closed-door debate by
the House team over whether to seek the president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with lying under oath to a federal grand jury
and obstructing justice by trying to cover up his affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the president is the only individual with knowledge of
almost every material fact relevant to the trial, the House
believes that his testimony would greatly help to expeditiously and
fairly bring this matter to a close,'' Hyde's letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate's interest in calling witnesses,
particularly Clinton, has waned in recent days, although a short
witness phase still appears likely.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting the trend, Clinton's private lawyer, David E.
Kendall, argued during the question period that witnesses ``would
add nothing'' to the process except satisfy the House managers who
are ``hoping maybe something will turn up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also raised the specter of a trial grinding on
indefinitely. ``I think you are looking realistically at a process
of many months,'' he said, causing a buzz among Republican
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby is one of several GOP senators who have expressed little
or no interest in summoning witnesses. Among the others are
Senators James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Robert F. Bennett of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the declining interest in a full slate of witnesses, Hyde
expressed rare public frustration on the Senate floor during the
question period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, oh do I know, what an annoyance we are in the bosom of
this great body,'' Hyde said of the House managers. ``But we're a
constitutional annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hyde had many Senate allies, including at least two
Republican moderates from New England who said they want to call a
small number of witnesses: Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island
and Susan M. Collins of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee predicted Byrd's motion to dismiss the charges will fail,
clearing the way for witnesses. Speaking to reporters after the
question period, Chafee warned the House managers to use restraint
in requesting witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to find the senators are very fussy,''
Chafee said. ``They aren't just going to approve every Tom, Dick
and Harry they want for a witness.''
</P>
<P>
   During the question period, the first of its kind in the Senate
since the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868,
both the White House and House managers conceded they had
mischaracterized elements of their earlier presentations to
senators or of their trial briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The legal teams alternately responded to questions that were
written by Republicans and Democrats and read aloud by the
presiding officer, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not accurately reflect the fact that the Jones lawyers
indeed issued'' a subpoena for Currie, White House counsel Charles
F.C. Ruff told the senators. ``For that misleading statement, I
apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   The House managers conceded that their official report to the
Senate misstated the time a federal judge had issued an order
permitting Jones' lawyers to interview Lewinsky about her
relationship with Clinton. The time was important because it
concerned an allegation that Clinton and his friend, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., had intensified their search for a job in New York for
Lewinsky to influence her testimony in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the order was issued, the House managers
acknowledged, Jordan was on a plane to Holland and could not have
intensified his role to find a job for Lewinsky that day, as they
had alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the corrections by both sides, the question period
generated little new information, although it provided senators an
opportunity to indirectly underscore their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said the question
phase helped him ``narrow some of the areas where there are factual
contentions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, took a
different view, describing the back-and-forth nature of the
proceeding as ``a ping-pong experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same-old, same-old,'' Leahy said.

SAIPAN WORKERS SAY AMERICAN DREAM BECAME A NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
SAIPAN, NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS _ The Chinese garment worker sat
stiffly in her lawyer's office, staring at the floor. Her carefully
manicured hands were clenched in her lap, red nails digging deeply
into calloused palms.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was in America and in a protected place. But she was scared
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   The woman is one of dozens of anonymous plaintiffs in a
class-action lawsuit against some of the world's biggest clothing
labels and their local contract manufacturers. The suit, filed last
week in Saipan, California and federal courts, accuses the firms of
exploiting her and thousands of other indentured foreign workers in
sweatshop conditions on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   When the garment worker came to Saipan in 1997 from her home
province of Jilin, in northern China, she expected life in America
to be different.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the
western Pacific, she in many ways found less freedom than she had
back home.
</P>
<P>
   She was forced to work long hours of unpaid overtime in order to
meet production quotas. Her supervisor yelled constantly and beat
the workers ``whenever he felt like it,'' she said. He also forced
her and others to ``lend'' him money that was never repaid.
</P>
<P>
   In the company dormitory where 120 workers lived, eight to a
room, conditions were primitive: Food was unsanitary, and there
were a total of three working toilets and five showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't respect us, and they made me feel like I wasn't a
human being,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   As she worked 12- to 16-hour days stitching clothes for The Gap
and other major clothing labels, she was trapped in an insidious
system that gives the islands' employers near-total control over
their 40,000 foreign contract workers. If they are fired for any
reason, they are almost immediately deported to their home
countries, where most face heavy debts to the corrupt government
officials who gave them the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the woman rebelled and filed a complaint with
the islands' labor office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My supervisor came to me and said, `You have a choice: Either
you withdraw the complaint, or you get sent back to China.' I
didn't know what to do, so he fired me,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now she wanders Saipan's 10-mile-long urban and industrial zone,
looking for another job in the booming garment industry. But she
worries that if the manufacturers find out that she is a plaintiff
in last week's lawsuit, she will be blacklisted _ or deported
immediately to China, where she still owes $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will I tell my family?'' the woman asked, gazing
reproachingly at her lawyer. ``What will happen to us?''
</P>
<P>
   Her fingernails dug deeper into her hands as she spoke.
</P>
<P>
   None of the plaintiffs who have given depositions in the case
will reveal their names or those of their employers, because some
are still working and others are looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   When a visiting reporter asked the woman whether she would
recommend to her younger sisters that they come to Saipan, she was
silent for a long moment, her hands twisting violently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them, `Stay where you are, don't, don't ever _' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice caught, and she stopped. Her body seemed to collapse
upon itself. She jumped up and rushed from the room, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Marianas' mix of tough working conditions, control
and fear has engendered a struggle in Congress, where the
Republican leadership is blocking attempts by Democratic lawmakers
and the Clinton administration to eliminate the islands' longtime
exemption from federal immigration, customs and minimum-wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy illustrates how multinational corporations have
spurred _ and become dependent on _ the large-scale flow of migrant
labor across international borders. With this flow increasingly
dominated by organized crime and corrupt governments, corporations
sometimes find themselves complicit in a complicated web of abuses
committed by their subcontractors, human-rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern Marianas, local government officials and
clothing industry officials insist that they are not responsible
for those abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the payments in China or what goes on
there,'' said Richard Pierce, executive director of the Saipan
Garment Manufacturers Association. ``All we know is that while
there may have been some problems here in the past, we've worked
very hard to clean them up, and any federal takeover would simply
make matters worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing controversy, the industry has tried to put its
best foot forward.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Saipan's largest garment manufacturer, Tan Holdings
Corp., showed reporters around its factories and employee
bunkhouses. Conditions were clean and orderly _ although some
facilities appeared to have been scrubbed especially for the
occasion. The company, still nervous about publicity, did not allow
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Three subsidiaries owned by the company's owner, Hong Kong-based
shipping and gambling tycoon Willie Tan, are defendants in last
week's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Some impartial observers dispute whether conditions are as bad
as the plaintiffs allege. These observers say that in the past
year, the garment industry has reacted to the accusations by fixing
the worst problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Labor Department said Wednesday that it had been
forced to intercede last year after five island employers had
refused to pay more than $2.1 million in overtime pay owed to 1,315
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said: ``We must
stop the exploitation of workers on these islands. We will continue
to hold employers accountable and will work to get U.S. minimum
wage standards ... extended to the Northern Marianas.'' (The
commonwealth's minimum wage is $3.05 an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is not whether the factories are total
sweatshops or just partially so,'' said one U.S. official who took
part this week in talks with the island's government over the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, they've probably improved some. What's more important
is that none of these abuses are permitted under U.S. law, and the
Northern Marianas shouldn't be able to pick and choose between the
laws of the land just to benefit a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal arguments, however, pale beside the overwhelming daily
reality of an economy totally dependent on an imported proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Northern Marianas' 27,000 U.S. citizens, most active
workers are government employees, while the private sector is
dominated by 40,000 workers from China, the Philippines, Thailand,
Bangladesh and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   The islands' press reflects the same social division.
</P>
<P>
   The two daily newspapers _ one of which is owned by Tan _ are
staffed exclusively by Filipinos on one-year, renewable contracts.
Like the garment workers, hotel workers, housekeepers and myriad
other foreigners, these imported journalists must practice
self-censorship for fear of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10,000 foreigners are in Saipan illegally after
overstaying their work permits. Among them are hundreds of
Bangladeshis who have been marooned after being cheated by labor
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   A typical example is M.A.H. Durbar, who came in 1997 with 21
others who each paid $5,000 for jobs as security guards in Saipan _
a huge amount of money in Bangladesh, where the annual per-capita
income is about $250.
</P>
<P>
   Durbar, 26, was told by the labor contractor that he was going
to Saipan U.S.A., America, the land of the free _ located only a
train ride away from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A fiasco awaited the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Northern Marianas government granted him a work
permit, the jobs turned out to be nonexistent _ a collaborative
scam mounted by the Bangladeshi contractors and an unscrupulous
Saipan security firm, Benavente Security.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Northern Marianas court last July ordered Benavente
to pay the Bangladeshis $104,684, the local government has been
unable _ or unwilling, or perhaps too incompetent _ to collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold my house and I borrowed to get this opportunity to come
to America,'' Durbar said as he sat cross-legged on the floor of
the small house he shares with 16 other destitute Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I must go door to door, begging for work. I can't send
money home to my family. They think I'm a liar, that because I'm in
America, I must be making good money and spending it all at
nightclubs, doing things with girls, rather than helping them pay
what we owe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know that the American flag doesn't mean much,'' he
added. ``In World War II, thousands of American soldiers died to
put the flag in these islands. But I ask, what for? Where is
justice? It's now the responsibility of the Americans to restore
the dignity of that flag.''

KNICKS' FANS WILLING TO FORGIVE SPREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To some hard-core Knicks fans, he is the long-sought
scorer who deserves a second chance. To other Knicks disciples, he
is a short-tempered embarrassment who doesn't belong in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But, like it or not, Latrell Sprewell has come to town.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade made official Thursday, Sprewell, the talented but
troubled shooting guard, will be in a Knicks uniform when the
National Basketball Association begins its strike-shortened season
next month. To get Sprewell, who choked and punched his coach with
the Golden State Warriors, P.J. Carlesimo, in December 1997, the
Knicks traded the popular shooting guard John Starks and the backup
forwards Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. Sprewell has not played in
a pro game since his infamous altercation with Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Knicks fans seem willing to give Sprewell, 28, the
opportunity to prove himself on an aging Knicks team desperately
searching for an NBA championship. In more than 20 interviews
Wednesday at Madison Square Garden, on Wall Street, aboard subway
trains and in lunch joints around the city, most everyone thought
Sprewell could improve Patrick Ewing's chances for his first
professional title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him, we need him, he's a winner,'' said Jeffrey Dupree,
a sandwich maker at Cosi Sandwich Bar on Pine Street in Lower
Manhattan, who became giddy at the thought of Sprewell in a Knicks
jersey. ``Sprewell is just like Michael Jordan, he's just going to
get better and better. I bet we win a championship with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If most Knick supporters weren't as sure as Dupree, many said
they were eager to see how the slashing, fluid Sprewell, who has
averaged more than 20 points a game over five NBA seasons, would
stand up under the city's intense media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's New York, everyone is going to be watching him,'' Clifton
Sewell, of the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, said as he rode
the No. 1 train toward Lower Manhattan on Wednesday morning.
Sewell, who said he had been a Knicks fan ``forever,'' said
Sprewell deserved a shot with the Knicks. ``Hey, everybody makes
mistakes,'' Sewell said. ``Let's not judge him too early.''
</P>
<P>
   But sitting across the aisle, Robert Margulies, a lawyer and
30-year fan of the team, was not as forgiving. ``I'm sure he's a
great player, maybe a better player than Starks,'' Margulies said,
folding the sports page into his black overcoat. ``But the Knicks
shouldn't have made that deal, because of the kind of person he
is.'' The trade for Sprewell, he said, sends a ``bad message to
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Knicks-conscious kids seemed unfazed by Sprewell's
misbehavior. At the Frederick Douglass Playground on Amsterdam
Avenue at 101st Street, Luis Morales, 17, was shooting hoops with
three friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can win a title, then it's all right,'' Morales said
when asked about Sprewell's pummeling his coach. ``He ain't going
to make the same mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? ``He lost $10 million,'' Morales said, referring to the
money Sprewell lost as a result of being suspended by the Warriors
last year. ``Knicks are going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Andrews, 19, support for Sprewell was conditional.
``If he helps the Knicks win a championship,'' he said, ``then I'm
with him. But I didn't want Starks to go. He was my man.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans felt the same way about Starks, whose scrappy,
mercurial play endeared him to some and enraged others. ``That's my
guy,'' sighed Dale Polerstock, who arrived at Madison Square
Garden's closed box office Wednesday morning from Huntington, N.Y.
``I didn't want to lose Starks,'' he said. ``He was the heartbeat
of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   At the NBA Store on Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street, WFAN radio's
veteran Knicks analyst John Andariese fielded fans' questions
during a live broadcast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the place was buzzing all day,'' Andariese said,
noting that the comments about Sprewell, Topic A, were mostly
negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this part of the country don't know about him as a
player, they just know the bad things that happened,'' Andariese
said after the broadcast. ``A lot of his talents suggest Jordan.
He's got a very fluid body. The man can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo, the former governor and a notable Knicks
aficionado, gave an unequivocal thumbs-up for Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they have Sprewell,'' Cuomo said Thursday in response
to a telephone inquiry. ``They have got to take a gamble here. This
is a wild situation, and a speculative one. If the Yankees are
willing to bet on Albert Belle from Cleveland, then why not the
Knicks on Sprewell?''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it was Nate Newton, a delivery man from Hunts Point in
the Bronx, who best summed up Knicks fans' overall view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprewell could be a good addition,'' he said. ``Just don't
choke our coach.'' &QL;

 California Wines Reach Worldwide  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
California vintners are making a big splash overseas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, California wine exports jumped 26 percent to more than
36 million gallons in the first 10 months of 1998 compared to the
same 1997 period. These sales will account for close to 10 percent
of total 1998 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Exports to the biggest offshore markets were even more
impressive. Sales to Japan more than doubled to 12.2 million
gallons in the first 10 months of 1998. And sales to the United
Kingdom jumped 37 percent to 15.1 million gallons from 11 million
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   E&AMP;J Gallo Winery, it turns out, is not only the top U.S.
producer but the largest exporter. The Modesto vintner sells about
20 million gallons, or close to 15 percent of its production,
overseas, which is more than all other California wineries
combined. As a sign of its clout, Gallo recently had a front aisle
display at Harrods' new wine shop in London and claims to be
England's top-selling brand.
</P>
<P>
   While Gallo sells the most overseas, Wente Vineyards of
Livermore sells the largest portion of its production overseas _
close to half a million gallons, or nearly 60 percent of its annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   It is finally dawning on California producers that ``they have
barely scratched the surface of export sales compared to many other
wine-producing nations,'' said Jon Fredrikson, president of the San
Francisco wine consulting firm Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's easy to see why California vintners want to sell
overseas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Per-capita wine consumption in the United States has declined
in recent decades. Last year, for example, total domestic shipments
grew only about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Foreign producers from Europe, South Africa, South America and
Australia are aggressively selling their wine here and in other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ There could be a future &UR;  &LR; wine glut &UR;  &LR; in this country as more
than 20,000 acres of new California vineyards come into production
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most world-class wine producers, California vintners have
had the luxury of being able to sell all the high-priced wine they
made on their home turf. Overseas markets were viewed as a safety
valve during years of surplus production.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WINE23 (80702 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But that strategy has shifted with the globalization of the wine
industry. As overseas markers continue to grow, particularly in
Asia, and U.S. producers have to contend with more imports from
more countries, California vintners feel the need to fight back and
target other countries for exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 10 years, most California wineries have looked
at exports as a way to get rid of excess supply,'' said Ken Lizar,
vice president of E.&AMP;J. Gallo's international division. ``But we've
made it a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   When there was a temporary shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon a few
years ago, Gallo put some U.S. customers on allocation before it
restricted supplies to key export markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gallos decided quite a while ago to make E&AMP;J Gallo a
global wine brand, and you can't do that by going in and out of
supply,'' said Lizar. As a result, over the past five years,
Gallo's exports have tripled from 5 percent to about 15 percent of
total volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gallo did in the '50s to become the biggest wine seller
across the United States, they are now doing in foreign markets,''
said Fredrikson.
</P>
<P>
   In competing overseas, Gallo and other producers are taking
advantage of their ability to prominently place their brand names
on their bottles. That's not the case in most countries, where
local wines are marketed primarily by grape type or growing region,
like Bordeaux and Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   Lizar said that kind of marketing advantage has made Gallo ``the
No.1 brand'' in Britain, where Gallo accounts for three of every
five bottles of California wine sold.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the importance of brand recognition worldwide, some
local vintners lobbied for and just won government approval to put
the ``San Francisco Bay'' appellation on their wine labels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gallo sells to 86 nations, it focuses on big-volume
markets including Great Britain, Japan, Canada and Germany. By
contrast, Wente Vineyards is carving out a market in 147 countries.
</P>
<P>
   To attract international travelers and get its brand known in
developing countries, Wente has signed up more than 30 national
airlines to serve its wines and is opening wine bars and duty-free
wine shops at airports from Nairobi to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WINE23 (80702 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Wente also recently formed a joint venture with India's largest
wine producer to get a crack at selling to India's 17 million
millionaires and a middle class nearly as large as the entire U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see establishing a strong international brand as part of
our long-term viability,'' said Eric Wente, chief executive of the
family-owned winery that started in Livermore 115 years ago. Wente
figures it is small enough to tailor its strategy country by
country and said marketing costs tend to be lower than in the U.S.
market where there is rampant price discounting.
</P>
<P>
   But opening new markets is not without surprises and dangers.
When Wente introduced its wines at Nairobi's Carnivore Restaurant a
few years ago, Senior Vice President John Schwartz recalls he had
to make a quick call on which wines go best with antelope and
zebra. Another time, Wente sparkling wine blew their corks during a
freeze in St. Petersburg, Russia, and three months ago the winery
pulled out of Moscow because of economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties, California vintners feel exporting is
worth the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following my father's vision, to be a real factor in the fine
wine business, you need to be in the better restaurants and hotels
of the major wine-drinking countries around the world,'' said
Michael Mondavi, chief executive of Robert Mondavi Corp. The Napa
producer, which pioneered promoting California wines overseas 27
years ago, increased foreign sales by more than a third last year
to about 9 percent of production.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi sells in 77 countries and has its wines strategically
placed _ from the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong to Paul Bocuse
Restaurant near Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is comparable to 40 years ago, when the vast
majority of good-quality California wines were consumed in
California and then gradually spread across the U.S.,'' Mondavi
said. ``Now we are looking at the premium wine market from a global
perspective, and Mondavi wants to export a minimum of 20 percent of
sales by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram Chateau &AMP; Estate Wines company also is making a big push
overseas too. Seagram's Mumm Napa Valley sells half of its annual
production of 200,000 cases of sparkling wine to 40 countries, and
about 8 percent of Sterling Vineyards' production goes the same
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We export to develop brand equity,'' explained Seagram export
director Jonathan Pey. ``Consumers increasingly are linked
globally. They fly from Toronto to Tokyo and we want to make sure
our brands are wherever they there.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of WINE23 (80702 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Unequal taxation is major problem for U.S. exporters. Gallo's
Lizar insists that one reason the United States imports about 10
times as much wine as it exports is that this country imposes an
average duty of about 3 percent, or 58 cents a case, on imported
wine while European countries charge about three times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   And the situation is worse in other parts of the globe. Lizar
said China imposes a 114 percent excise tax and duty while Taiwan
charges about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a level playing field, we should be exporting
three times as much wine,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: TAX REBATES IN NEW JERSEY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 23,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Like two-thirds of the nation's governors, Christie Whitman of
New Jersey is now wrestling with the ``problem'' of fat budget
surpluses brought on by a booming economy. This month, to no one's
great surprise, Mrs. Whitman proposed in her State of the State
message to send money back to taxpayers in the form of a rebate for
their local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is certain to be popular, but there is a worrisome
catch. The cost of the rebate would grow from $200 million the
first year to $1 billion annually in five years, raising questions
about whether the money will be there to pay for it if the economy
turns down.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman's zest for tax-cutting is a signature of her career
and crucial to her claim for consideration as a nominee for vice
president in the next national election. She first ran in 1993 on a
pledge to cut the income tax, and then kept her word by using
budget gimmicks to make up for the lost revenues. Her past tax cuts
now amount to about $1.2 billion in annual lost revenue. Currently
she proposes to cut taxes in the next five years by nearly as much
as in the last five.
</P>
<P>
   But since Mrs. Whitman cannot run for a third term, it will
probably be up to her successor to deal with any adverse long-term
consequences of her actions. That should give pause to the State
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In her re-election campaign in 1997, Mrs. Whitman discovered
that voters were less grateful about the enacted state income-tax
cuts than angry over rising property taxes and insurance rates. Her
victory over a little-known Democratic opponent was close and
hard-fought. Mrs. Whitman's response, an average $600 rebate for
homeowners, is politically understandable. But it fails to address
the basic structural problems that drive up property tax rates,
which include the duplications and inefficiencies in New Jersey's
566 municipalities and 611 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's State of the State address featured several
commendable but modest spending initiatives, including more money
to maintain parks and open space, as well as an expansion of health
services for children and the elderly. Some of the money for the
health programs may come from $7.5 billion that New Jersey is to
receive over the next 25 years in the tobacco suit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Mrs. Whitman's preference for being known as a
tax-cutter rather than a spender is likely to be noticed by the
national Republican Party.

 Pacific Exchange, NASD Interested in Talks  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Pacific Exchange yesterday welcomed comments from a top
official of the National Association of Securities Dealers that the
association's Nasdaq Stock Market is open to buying the San
Francisco bourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is interested in talking, we're interested in talking,''
Pacific Exchange spokesman Dale Carlson said in response to a
remark by Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of NASD, which
operates the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb told Bloomberg News earlier this week that NASD was ``open
to conversations'' about acquiring the Pacific Exchange, the
nation's third-largest options market, noting that the association
needs to study the economics of a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange said it is interested in combining with
another securities market following the breakdown of its planned
merger with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the No. 1 U.S.
options market.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago exchange pulled out of the deal earlier this month,
citing delays caused by a federal antitrust probe and the need to
concentrate on countering competitive threats from electronic
options trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and options markets around the world have carried out a
series of mergers amid growing competition and the rapid
development of electronic trading systems that bypass traditional
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the CBOE merger, Pacific spokesman Carlson
said the exchange has received ``two or three'' inquiries about an
acquisition from parties he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   After its experience with CBOE, Pacific wants to be sure that it
reaches an agreement with an organization ``with the resources,
wherewithal and strength to fulfill whatever commitment we agree to
make,'' Carlson stressed.
</P>

   Pacific and Nasdaq had held talks about a combination, but they
were halted when the exchange chose CBOE as its partner, Carlson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two also held conversations about a separate sale of
Pacific's stock exchange operations up through the end of 1998, he
added. Pacific's stock trading floor is much smaller than its
options operations and was not part of the CBOE merger.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq has been expanding in the options business. When it held
acquisition talks with the Pacific last year, ``we were quite
excited,'' said a Nasdaq official who asked not to be identified.
``Then they just dropped off the screen.''

MURRAY BECOMING ACCUSTOMED TO PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He grew up in a high-profile basketball family with a
high-profile older brother and played for a high-profile high
school program. Cameron Murray has become accustomed to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But after five years of college, two schools and an array of
injuries that always seem to strike at the most inopportune times,
Murray reached a crossroads heading into this, his final season.
</P>
<P>
   So Louisville's 6-foot, 175-pound senior point guard prepared
for 1998-99 unlike anything he had done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lot hungrier this past summer,'' said older brother
Tracy Murray, a former UCLA standout now with the Washington
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the urgency sprouted from the possibility of Cameron's
basketball finality. He is not counting on an NBA career, although
he won't pass up an opportunity to impress any team that should
come calling.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers spent most of their summer together at Tracy's
Marina del Rey home, one pushing the other toward personal goals,
although Tracy admitted Cameron had a little more fire in his
belly.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy remembers waking up mornings with his younger brother
knocking on his bedroom door, urging him to get up. Cameron already
had been awake for hours, had run on the beach, climbed the sand
dunes and now wanted to continue the workout on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something totally different than I've seen from him
as far as intensity,'' said Tracy, like Cameron a Glendora High
graduate. ``He did so much on his own, and it's because he wanted
to prove he had his game back.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cameron's senior year is shaping up as his best, which
includes the two seasons he spent at USC, where he averaged 8.0
points and 4.3 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who arrived in Louisville this year 17 pounds lighter
but with more muscle mass, has led the 24th-ranked Cardinals to a
surprising 10-4 record and into the thick of the Conference USA
title race. The team's only losses have been at home Thursday night
against fifth-ranked Cincinnati and on the road at Mississippi,
North Carolina and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who will lead Louisville into Saturday's noon
nonconference game against No. 12 UCLA at Freedom Hall, is the
team's leading scorer at 13.5 points per game. He also leads with
4.3 assists per game, and minutes played, 29.8 per game. He is
shooting 52 percent from the field, up from 33 percent last season,
and 48.6 percent on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't care if he's the high point man on his team,''
Cameron's father, Bob Murray, said. ``As long as he keeps everyone
happy and they win, that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping himself happy also is a priority for Murray after
suffering through some down times during his first four years in
college. Especially difficult was his time at USC, which ended with
Murray leaving the team late in his sophomore year, shortly after
coach Charlie Parker was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Even last season, his first on the court for Louisville after
sitting out 1996-97 following his transfer, burdened him in ways
unlike never before.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, stepping in for four-year starter DeJuan Wheat, suffered
the wrath of fans and was the focal point for blame, along with
guard Marques Maybin, as Louisville stumbled to a 12-20 record. It
was the worst mark in coach Denny Crum's 28-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Because Crum's system demands more from his guards than any
position, Murray was an easy target for those looking for a
scapegoat. It was a season he termed ``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult playing for coach (Crum) because he does demand
a lot and is extremely critical of the guard play,'' Murray said.
``If you win, (the guards) get the credit, but if you lose, you
also get the credit for losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he didn't expect the losses to pile up the way they
did, but he did anticipate it would take fans time to warm to him
after watching Wheat for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get focused on one person for four years, it's hard
to get used to someone else,'' Murray said. ``It was hard and
something I had to adjust to. But this season, the crowd has really
let me into their family and they respect the way I play.''
</P>
<P>
   That never was more apparent than earlier this season, when
Louisville beat rival Kentucky for the second consecutive year with
Murray at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he can always say is that he was 2-0 against
Kentucky,'' Tracy said of his brother. ``He played two great games
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sweetness of the victory was his performance in
light of a medical report five days earlier. Murray was diagnosed
with a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal bone of his left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   He still finished with a 14-point, 10-assist performance in an
83-74 victory against the third-ranked Wildcats. He will have
surgery on his foot after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to play through it and keep it off my mind,''
Murray said. ``Beating Kentucky felt good. It kind of eases my pain
of not having been able to beat UCLA yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said is as happy as he has been in college, especially
with those 7-21 and 11-19 seasons at USC, along with last season's
disaster, in his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, he's as tough as he's ever been,'' Bob Murray said.
``I knew he would have some trouble getting used to Crum's system,
but he's adjusted well and this is Cam's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, problems persist.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the NCAA placed Louisville on three years
probation. The basketball program was banned from postseason
competition for one season and stripped of two scholarship because
of two rule violations committed by former assistant coach Scooter
McCray. He was found to have provided improper benefits to the
father of junior forward Nate Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The school appealed the decision last week and could have a
ruling on its fate by the end of the month. Murray, along with
seniors Alex Sanders and Eric Johnson, are most interested in the
outcome. Especially Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and Johnson have participated in the NCAA tournament.
Murray is waiting for his first chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out about the probation, I was extremely
disappointed,'' Murray said. ``We had set some high goals during
the summer after all the adversity we went through, and this sort
of took away some of the spark.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray insists there is plenty to play for, regardless of
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Playing in the tournament) is something I always wanted, but
it doesn't make me feel bad if I don't get the chance,'' Murray
said. ``If you don't turn negatives into positives, you won't come
out on top in life. (Probation) won't stop us from winning.''

 &HT;    Byrd seeks impeachment trial dismissal to `end this sad and
sorry time'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Momentum gathered Friday for putting a speedy end
to the Senate impeachment trial, as senators began questioning both
sides in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant development for the president, Sen. Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) issued a statement saying he planned to make a motion to
dismiss the two articles of impeachment against Clinton as early as
Monday to ``end this sad and sorry time for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and are not likely to develop,'' said Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have also become convinced that lengthening this trial will
only prolong and deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect
that this sorry affair has visited upon our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Democratic majority leader and an author of Senate
history, Byrd is widely respected among both Republicans and
Democrats. He is considered one of the Senate's leading
constitutional scholars. Because of his conservative views and his
frequent criticisms of Clinton, Byrd was also seen as one of the
Democrats most likely to side with Republican claims that the
president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   While it is far from certain that Byrd can sway at least six
Republicans to vote for dismissal _ the number needed assuming no
Democrats vote no _ his surprising statement was a clear signal
that Democrats are virtually united in wanting a quick end to the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) was so concerned about the
impact of Byrd's statement that he asked Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas)
to hold an impromptu news conference during one of the afternoon
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution (to dismiss) will be defeated,'' Gramm
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia said he would be among those
voting against the motion to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, are far from united in what they believe
should come next. Under the bipartisan agreement on trial
procedures worked out two weeks ago, senators will first consider a
motion to dismiss. If that fails, they then proceed to a vote on
witnesses that, if successful, will prolong the length of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans want to allow the House prosecutors to call
whatever witnesses they want. Others have said they want no
witnesses, while still others said they believe a few witnesses,
limited to narrow areas of testimony, would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Republicans want to avoid the perception that they
are ending the trial before all the evidence about the president's
guilt or innocence has been put before the Senate. And many want an
up or down vote on the articles of impeachment themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think we are going to have an idea where we are
going until Monday,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). Lott
suggested senators should consider another bipartisan meeting like
the one that produced the initial framework for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome Monday or Tuesday, Democrats are already
talking about censure alternatives. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) said she was prepared to offer a censure resolution the
moment the trial was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) also revived a proposal he has to call
for a motion of adjournment at the point when it appears that the
Senate cannot convict the president. Hatch, who favors deposing
some witnesses, said adjournment would let the House's impeachment
vote stand as the ``ultimate censure'' and end Democratic efforts
to ``cover their backsides'' with a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs Friday that House prosecutors were losing
their battle to convince more undecided Republicans that the
president should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said he was still wrestling with the
question of whether Clinton should be removed, even if all the
allegations against him are true.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) suggested she wasn't convinced
by the perjury evidence against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's grand jury testimony is replete with lies,
with half-truths and evasions,'' Collins said. ``I'm considering
whether despite that they meet the test under our perjury laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins added that she was more impressed with the case for
obstruction of justice and would like a separate vote on each
article.
</P>
<P>
   GOP senators also appeared unsympathetic to the prosecutors'
request that Clinton be invited to testify in his own impeachment
trial. In a letter to majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and
minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) wrote that prosecutors believed Clinton's testimony
``could greatly help to expeditiously and fairly bring this matter
to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is going to go anywhere,'' said Senate
Judiciary Chairman Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Tuesday, there was speculation that a liberal
Democrat sympathetic to the president would be the person to make
the motion to dismiss when the time came. The fact that it came
from Byrd will give it an added element of seriousness, several
senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have more impact than anyone else would,'' said Sen.
Craig Thomas (R-Wy.).
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows the Constitution better than Robert C. Byrd,''
said Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who issued his statement less than an hour after asking
White House lawyers if Clinton had not broken the public trust,
said he believes Clinton badly damaged the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has caused his family, his friends and this nation great
pain,'' he said. ``He has weakened the already fragile public trust
that has been placed in his care.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said continuing the trial would only divert attention
away from more pressing concerns such as social security reform,
education, health care and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary that we begin now the process of healing and
reconciling the differences caused by these events and address
together the issues, challenges and opportunities facing our
nation,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to Byrd's statement, Gramm said it would be an
affront to the notion of justice and impeachment precedent to
dismiss the case before having an opportunity to convict or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is a process and not a verdict,'' Gramm said. ``We
have had a trial and voted guilty and not guilty'' in each of the
13 impeachment trials where the defendant had not resigned to avoid
trial, Gramm said. ``In each case, we have gone the distance.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a small, but increasingly important, number of
Republicans expressing reservations about the wisdom of calling
witnesses, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, a widely respected senior member of
the Senate, said on Friday that President Clinton's impeachment
trial should come to a swift end, and he announced that he would
offer a motion to dismiss the charges next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop,'' Byrd,
D-W.Va., said in a one-page statement, adding, ``I do not believe
that witnesses will add anything of consequence to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the
Judiciary Committee, said the Senate should wait until witnesses
were deposed before deciding whether the trial should be halted.
But if it is clear then that the constitutionally required
two-thirds vote to convict and remove the president cannot be
found, he said, the Senate should simply adjourn the trial. He said
the Senate would not need a censure but would ``acknowledge that
the impeachment vote in the House is the highest form of
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither proposal won quick support from the other
party, the two senators' comments suggested that the Senate's
center of gravity was shifting as the body appeared hungrier than
ever for a graceful exit from a potentially prolonged trial.
</P>
<P>
   While Byrd's motion still seemed unlikely to get the Republican
votes needed to pass, his decision was a blow to Republicans who
had hoped his traditionalism would lead him to support the call for
a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, all morning long, small clutches of Democratic and
Republican senators met away from the Senate chamber, in hallways
and small offices, searching for a plan acceptable to both parties
and then reporting back to their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to debate on Monday whether to dismiss
the charges against Clinton and whether to depose witnesses. A vote
on dismissal and, if that fails, on witnesses would come next, but
perhaps not until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch called Byrd's motion premature and said he thought it
would fail. But he said his idea was ``just another way of
resolving these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, the Democratic leader, quickly
responded that ``every single Democrat'' would oppose Hatch's
motion because it leaves the charges against Clinton unresolved.
``There must be a definite determination on the case,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's proposal could prove problematic to many Republicans as
well, most of whom want to cast final votes on the two articles of
impeachment. ``I think we should have the opportunity for each
senator to stand and face the other 99 and simply say yea or nay on
the ultimate question,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The first turning point in the case, however, could come as
early as next week, when the Senate takes up the question of
depositions. For the past several weeks, it has been evident that
most Republicans favor taking depositions from witnesses, hoping,
they say, that people like Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary, could clear up contradictory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans reiterated their concerns on Friday
about deposing witnesses, a sign that at least a few senators in
the party are nervous about prolonging the trial. The group is
pivotal because it would take six or more Republicans to block a
motion next week to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is having conversations,'' Sen. Byron L. Dorgan,
D-N.D., said. ``It's the largest group of negotiations in the
Senate's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said he believed there are four
or five Republicans who have an ``open mind'' on voting against
summoning witnesses. ``But whether they actually vote for it or I
vote for it remains to be seen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to persuade me that what the witnesses
are going to have to say is new,'' Shelby said. ``More of the same
_ we don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, echoed Shelby's cautiousness,
saying, ``I have to be persuaded that there should be witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a hallway interview, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said:
``There is a substantial core of moderates in both parties who
would like to find an endgame, sooner rather than later. A dozen or
so of us are speaking among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some concerns over witnesses, House managers are moving
ahead with their plan to try to persuade the Senate to call Clinton
as a witness. On Friday, in a letter to the Senate's Republican and
Democratic leaders, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, said the ``president is the only
individual with knowledge of almost every material fact relevant to
the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders have not decided whether to extend an
invitation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that Senate bipartisanship will face its second
major test next week, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, said on Friday that he was considering holding another
joint caucus in the Old Senate Chamber to talk through the next
stage of the trial. His counterpart, Daschle, said he would not be
averse to such a caucus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But of all the day's developments, it was Byrd's announcement
that he would be the one to offer a dismissal motion that prompted
the quickest, most partisan reaction among senators. The motion
would end the trial summarily, without a vote on whether to convict
or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement resonated with both parties because Byrd, who
has been sharply critical of Clinton's behavior, is esteemed as a
constitutional scholar and had remained undecided on the question
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately championed the decision, predicting that
Byrd might influence some Republicans to vote with Democrats to
dismiss the charges. ``He's among the members we suggest and look
to for leadership,'' said Sen. John B. Breaux, a Louisiana
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, with Lott's endorsement, held an instant news
conference after Byrd's statement to rebut it. ``I believe that
Senator Byrd's motion to end the trial is inappropriate,'' he said.
``I think it will be defeated. I believe this trial will go the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   A roster of other Republicans followed suit. Sen. John Chafee, a
R-R.I., and Hatch said they did not think the measure would pass
the Senate. And Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called for the
motion's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the U.S. Senate with more respect than
senator Byrd,'' said Rep. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. But, he added, ``I
am not deciding this case without the evidence coming in.''

AFTER SERIOUS HEALTH SCARE, REEVES IS FEELING BLESSED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves sat in his office after
practice Friday and spoke about his remarkable recovery from
quadruple-bypass heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually a miracle,'' said Reeves, who will lead the
Falcons into their first Super Bowl, against the Denver Broncos, on
Jan. 31 in Miami. ``With the circumstances that led up to my heart
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves felt a burning sensation in his throat all season.
Stubbornly, he told himself that it was all in his mind. Didn't he
have a physical before the season and everything had checked out
fine? A visit to the doctor could wait until the season ended.
After all, the Falcons were battling the San Francisco 49ers for
supremacy in the National Football Conference West and even the
Minnesota Vikings for the best record in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   But, after a victory over the Saints in New Orleans on Dec. 13,
the burning sensation became unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong,'' said the 55-year-old Reeves. ``It was like I
wanted someone to agree with me that there was something wrong or
that I was fine. Dr. Harrison, the team's internist, is usually not
on the trips, but he was with us for New Orleans. I told him about
the symptoms and asked if I should wait until after the season to
see a specialist. He said, `That's dumb. Let's do it tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves went to the hospital the next morning with his wife, Pam,
and the rest of his family. Doctors found three arteries blocked
and told him quadruple-bypass surgery was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't any different than preparing for a game,'' Reeves
said. ``We had a word of prayer as a family before I went into the
operating room. I was calm. I've had surgeries in my football
career, and I don't think you go into surgery any different than
you go into a game. You expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Reeves, the Falcons-Saints game was on a Sunday
and not on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had waited one more day, I don't know if Dan could have
survived an extra day,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year in the United States, more than 500,000
quadruple-bypass surgeries are performed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kauten operated on Reeves at the Fuqua Heart Center at
Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a new technique on Coach Reeves called harvesting a
vein,'' Kauten said. ``We wanted to get him up and mobilized
without leg problems. Many heart patients complain of their legs
hurting worse than their chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make one small incision in the leg and use an endoscopic
technique to scope and dissect down through the scope so there is
no swelling. Then we hook it to the heart. It gets nourishment from
vessels that feed inside the vein itself. We clamp off the aorta
and the blood goes back to the heart. It opens all the bypasses
within 30-60 seconds. Coach Reeves has a strong heart and he flew
off the bypass.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' prognosis for the future is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' Kauten said. ``He's young. His first
episode of heart disease was at 46 and that is almost always due to
heredity. He has to take care and stay in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Kauten said Reeves belongs on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he does his work,'' he said. ``It would be more
stressful to be up in a box seat. For Minnesota, I was more curious
that no one would run into him or hug him or knock him down.
Someone knocked his headsets off and I jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' mentor, Tom Landry, the former head coach of the Dallas
Cowboys, called to tell him to calm down on the sidelines. Reeves
plans to run on the treadmill at his Miami hotel, reluctantly
giving up mayonnaise and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he is motivating his players as a head coach they
trust, and not a man who survived quadruple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many ways you can say things. Having the
surgery hasn't changed anything in the locker room. They don't give
me a big ol' bear hug now that my chest is cut open. I still walk
on the field. I try not to cough or sneeze _ that hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is not quick to join the thousands of Falcon fans who
believe that divine intervention occurred last Sunday when the
Falcons upset the heavily favored Vikings, 30-27, to win the NFC
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think God takes sides,'' Reeves said. ``There are many
Christians on the Minnesota Vikings team. On my side, I ask for
wisdom and I pray. You hope the Lord blesses you. Why he smiled on
us, I can't say. We took the opportunity when they missed the field
goal. God doesn't choose sides.'' &QL;

DIRECTV TO BUY PRIMESTAR FOR $1.8 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major consolidation of the satellite-TV broadcasting
industry, Hughes Electronics Inc.'s DirecTV Inc. subsidiary has
agreed to buy troubled Primestar Inc., its major competitor, for
$1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Primestar by Hughes, a unit of the General
Motors Corp., would leave only one other significant competitor in
satellite-TV broadcasting, the Echostar Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, which is paying for Primestar with $1.6 billion in cash
and $220 million in GM stock, would be in a stronger position to
compete against Echostar as well as cable-TV operators, which
dominate the $44 billion pay-TV market.
</P>
<P>
   The deal partly bails out Primestar's owners, which include
shareholders and a group of cable-TV companies. But they are
unlikely to make much money from the sale, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in TCI Satellite Entertainment, the publicly traded
portion of Primestar, fell $1.47 a share Friday, to close at $1.09.
It had traded at a 52-week high of $8.43 last April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great deal for equity owners,'' said Theodore
Henderson, who follows the company for Janco Partners, an
investment firm. Tom Wolzein, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP;
Co., said: ``This is the satellite industry cleaning house. Now you
have two players. That is probably more appropriate to what the
industry can do. The competitive edge of satellite offering lots of
channels becomes less.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will not work out too well for John Malone, chairman of
Tele-Communications Inc. and TCI Satellite Entertainment. Malone
had 4.24 million shares of the satellite company when it was spun
off from Tele-Communications, at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wolzien said if Malone had sold them when the spinoff occurred
they would have been worth about $50 million, compared with today's
value of $5 million. Malone subsequently acquired another 1.4
million shares at just under $8 a share. Today his two stakes, once
worth about $60.7 million are worth about $6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is essentially buying access to 2.3 million medium-power
satellite subscribers whom it hopes to convert to high-power
satellite customers within the next two years. The purchase could
expand the number of DirecTV's customers to 6.8 million from 4.5
million, if they all convert to high-power satellite service, which
uses smaller satellite dishes increasingly favored by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes is also acquiring Primestar's high-power satellite
assets, which include 11 high-power satellite licenses and two
satellites capable of delivering TV programs to the small satellite
dishes that DirecTV provides to customers. Hughes will use those to
increase its channel capacity for subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The payment is complex, with DirecTV paying $500 million in cash
for the high-power assets that it will use to increase channel
capacity for subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is also paying $1.1 billion in cash and $220 million in
GM stock for the medium-power assets.
</P>
<P>
   Primestar, which rents out satellite dishes rather than sell
them, incurred huge debt largely by purchasing those dishes.
Primestar customers have high disconnect rates that helped push
losses to $98 million on revenues of $371.3 million for the three
months ended Sept. 30, 1998, and the company was rapidly running
out of cash for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes will not assume Primestar's $1.8 billion in debt. Rather,
Primestar will use the proceeds of the sale to buy back its debt at
a discount. It's unclear how Primestar bondholders will react to
that plan.
</P>
<P>
   One bondholder said some creditors found it objectionable
because the plan gave priority to the the cable partners, who are
junior to the bondholders. Currently the cable partners bear the
responsibility for $575 million of credit.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million that DirecTV is paying for the high-power
satellite operations applies to that, so that cable companies will
not be responsible for the payment.
</P>
<P>
   How good a deal Hughes is getting depends on how successful the
company is in converting subscribers to high-power satellite
service. Hughes is paying $1.3 billion for 2.3 million medium-power
satellite subscribers, or $579 a subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if only half of them convert to high power, then Hughes is
paying twice as much,'' said Douglas Shapiro, who follows the
company for Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   If Hughes succeeded in converting all the subscribers, it would
end up with 6.8 million of the industry's 8.8 million subscribers.
Echostar owns the balance. Even though Hughes stock rose $1.875 a
share Friday, to $46.625, some analysts said there was no need to
do the deal since Primestar might have gone out of business anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Star's major setback came last spring when the Department
of Justice thwarted a merger between Primestar and ASkyB, the News
Corp.'s high-powered satellite business, arguing that a consortium
of cable operators including Tele-Communications, Time Warner, Cox
Communications and Comcast should not be allowed to own crucial
assets in a rival technology to cable. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Following is the statement issued Friday by Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., about the impeachment trial of President
Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   I have met with the Senate Republican and Democratic leaders to
inform them that I plan to offer a motion to dismiss the charges
and end this impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement entered into between Republican and Democratic
senators a few days ago, provision was made for a motion to dismiss
that could come as early as the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
   I plan to make this motion not because I believe that the
president did no wrong. In fact, I think he caused his family, his
friends and this nation great pain. I believe that he has weakened
the already fragile public trust that has been placed in his care.
</P>
<P>
   But I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop. I have also
become convinced that lengthening the trial will only prolong and
deepen the divisive, bitter and polarizing effect that this sorry
affair has visited upon our nation. I am well acquainted with the
charges and the evidence. I do not believe that witnesses will add
anything of consequence to this process, but, to the contrary, they
will only foster more of the same hallway press conferences and
battle of press releases that are contributing to the division of
our parties and our nation.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard the public, and while it is clear that there is a
great rift of public opinion on this matter, there is also a
consensus that the nation is sorely in need of leadership and
healing. Pressing issues are facing this nation _ issues including
Social Security, education, health care, jobs and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of these matters, I see a motion to dismiss
as the best way to promptly end this sad and sorry time for our
country. It is necessary that we begin now the process of healing
and reconciling the differences caused by these events and address
together the issues, challenges and opportunities facing our
nation.

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS GREET POPE

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II on Friday effortlessly captured
hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic hearts with his frail
presence as he began a five-day pastoral visit to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's fourth visit to this fervently Roman Catholic country
was greeted with whooping cheers and enthusiastic waving of Vatican
and Mexican flags from hundreds of thousands of faithful followers.
</P>
<P>
   His first blessing may have been the day's clear blue skies _
unusual for this time of year when the city of 20 million is
normally shrouded in a brownish-gray smog.
</P>
<P>
   Many homes on the pope's processional route were festooned with
the Vatican's yellow and white colors. Pictures of the nation's
spiritual patroness, the Virgin of Guadalupe, hung from balconies
or were prominently displayed in windows.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Vatican plane arrived Friday afternoon at
Benito Juarez International Airport, many thousands staked out
street vantage points for what at best would be a fleeting glimpse
of the leader of nearly 1 billion Catholics worldwide
</P>
<P>
   Many along the parade route carried small mirrors, hoping to
reflect the sun toward the sky in greeting as the pope's jet flew
overhead on its landing approach. Unfortunately, the plane flew by
too quickly for most to react.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the waiting crowds engaged in raucous yelling and
cheering led by seemingly tireless students, many of whom had
arrived at dawn. The result was an intensely emotional reception
from Mexicans who are struggling with many national problems,
including a crisis-plagued economy that has left many impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   The papal convoy's speedy procession through the street
disappointed many. They were unable to get a good look at the
pontiff. Especially let down was Maria Esther Perrea Porra. She and
eight members of her family had traveled from Pierra Blanca, a town
in eastern Veracruz state, to see their religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not dishearten her, her sisters or the other
members of her family. All said they intend to try to get a glimpse
of the pope at another procession Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Naomi Campos drove an hour by car to bring her son
and daughter for the pontiff's procession from the airport to a
central city ceremony and then to the apostolic nunciature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him once before and it was very exciting,'' said Campos
with 14-year old David and 10 year-old Aline standing close by. She
wanted the same experience for her children. But more than that,
she welcomed a papal boost to the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want bad thoughts lifted for at least a week,'' said Campos.
``I hope the people change their thinking and pessimistic
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   She also hopes the pope can divert the nation's attention away
from economic and other problems to positive thoughts of peace and
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Beatriz Nunez, 34, a special education teacher from San
Luis Potosi, expected the papal visit to spark a national spiritual
renewal. ``He is coming to us with so much hope that we have to
respond,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled the 300 miles from her northern Mexico city with 60
other students and young professionals to help at papal events. She
planned to sleep out in the open Saturday night at the Hermanos
Rodriguez Racetrack, which will be the site of a papal Mass. She
and her friends will assist at the Sunday service, which is
expected to draw more than 125,000 worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez's fellow teacher, Gaby Garcia, 26, also of San Luis
Potosi, considers the pope a ``living saint'' and hopes that
Mexicans will use him as a spiritual role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see what we can do to be like him. We have to
struggle to reach holiness,'' she said. ``It is possible.''

POPE HAS STRONG VIEWS ON U.S. `AGGRESSION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalists all over the United States are scrambling for ideas
to fill out their coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit to St.
Louis next week. Pity them. It is really not so easy to come up
with a fresh approach after the news media blitz that surrounded
the pope's trip to the United States less than four years ago and
the many overviews of his papacy, which marked its 20th anniversary
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's a suggestion. On Dec. 17, Dr. Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, the pope's spokesman, who will be accompanying him
on his U.S. visit, made a brief statement about the bomb and
missile strikes against Iraqi targets that had begun a day earlier.
The statement included this sentence: ``The Holy See hopes that
this aggression ends as soon as possible and that international
order is re-established.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This aggression''? A very strong term, to put it mildly. Given
the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on just and unjust war, it
appears to mean that American and British forces were acting
immorally in hitting Iraqi targets while Iraq's military was simply
exercising justifiable self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation was echoed, although in words less stark than
Navarro-Valls', by a flurry of other Vatican statements, some from
the pope himself.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this flew beneath the radar _ pardon the metaphor _ of
the American news media, the Catholic press included. The Catholic
News Service did begin an article on the attacks with a sentence
saying that ``the Vatican called the move an act of aggression,''
and a few Catholic papers picked up that blunt language in their
headlines. But even that did not seem to stir up much reaction, pro
or con, among the American Catholic population.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders' concern was manifest, however, in a letter that
Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who is responsible for the pastoral care
of Catholics in the U.S. armed forces, sent to Catholic military
chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien was visiting troops in the Middle East when the action
against Iraq occurred, and his letter almost certainly reflects a
desire not to appear to be blessing the bombs and missiles that the
pope was at that very moment decrying. The result is a carefully
composed statement.
</P>
<P>
   First, O'Brien praises ``the courage and professionalism'' of
American troops risking themselves ``in the role of peacekeeper''
in Bosnia, the Middle East and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he affirms that ``once civilian leadership decides a
policy requiring military action, it is the sworn obligation of all
in our armed forces to execute their mission in complete obedience
unless in a specific instance the required action is judged clearly
illegal or immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, he reviews all the misgivings about military action
against Iraq voiced by the Vatican, and last fall by the American
Catholic bishops, and whether that action meets ``just-war
requirements'' that civilians not be made targets, that expected
good results outweigh the expected harm and that there be likely
prospects of success.
</P>
<P>
   And finally he leaves military personnel with a two-sided
admonition. ``In executing orders that might violate just-war
requirements,'' he reminds them, they ``are not exempt from making
conscientious decisions.'' But when they lack sufficient evidence
to reach a clear conclusion of their own, they may follow ``the
presumably better-informed decision'' of their military superiors.
</P>
<P>
   This letter resurrects a perennial debate, of course, about the
relevance of just-war teachings not so much to policy-makers as to
those in the military. Moralists of differing views may ponder why
a Catholic bomber pilot should prefer the ``presumably
better-informed decision'' of a military superior in a moral
judgment call to that of the pope _ and also ponder the prospect of
chaos within the chain of command if the pilot did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraq episode also illustrated the pope's profound
ambivalence about the use of military force. John Paul II swings
between just-war teaching and something approaching pacifism,
between declaring that ``the aggressor must be disarmed'' in regard
to Bosnia and that war ``will never be an appropriate way to solve
problems'' in regard to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the episode adds to the impression that the extent of
contemporary Catholics' adherence to papal positions will never be
separated from the strength of the arguments backing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is understood when it denounces economic sanctions
on Iraq for the toll they take on innocent civilians. It is
understood when it abhors military destruction. But it does not
offer any comprehensive moral analysis of what should be done about
a regime like Saddam Hussein's and the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. Is this not really a problem? Or if it is, should
it be left in God's hands?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because the Vatican's positions appear ad hoc and
incomplete that Catholics here so easily deflect even the language
of American ``aggression.''

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. _ The Kellogg Co. has been scrambling to
revive its stagnant breakfast business, but its approach so far has
been about as successful as trying to freshen soggy cereal by
pouring on more milk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, key investors seem to have run out of patience, some senior
executives have left in frustration and major shareholders and
analysts wonder how long the company can remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see a takeover, but I don't know if that would not
be better all around,'' Agnes Gund, the president of the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, whose family is Kellogg's second-largest
shareholder, said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Gordon Gund, a Kellogg board member who owns the
Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, said he, too, had been
concerned about the company's performance. But he insisted on
Friday that Kellogg has a strategy that will lead to a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kellogg's missteps in the marketplace _ its slow
response to changing eating habits and overestimation of what
shoppers would pay for flakes of wheat and corn _ are well known.
The stock is now trading no higher than it did in 1995, and the
company has warned investors that 1998 profits may be as much as 20
percent lower than in 1997. The company is expected to report its
annual results on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid mounting displeasure among shareholders, Kellogg's board _
after years of watching people eat less and less of the company's
Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes and Raisin Bran _ announced earlier
this month that it would replace Arnold G. Langbo, the chief
executive for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no secret that the numbers have not been good,'' said
Dorothy A. Johnson, president and chief executive of the Council of
Michigan Foundations, who joined the Kellogg board last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson, who has been a trustee since 1980 of the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation, Kellogg's largest shareholder, acknowledged
that she was aware of the frustration felt by many of the company's
investors. The board has ``devoted numerous extra hours to it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gund said the decision to replace Langbo was prompted by
his own desire to speed his retirement. ``This is a very orderly
transition and is a good one,'' Gund said. ``I feel very confident,
as do the other board members.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether the appointment of Carlos M.
Gutierrez, a long-time Kellogg manager, as chief executive is just
another example the company's inability to think outside the
proverbial box. While current Kellogg executives and most board
members declined repeated requests for interviews, discussions with
several former senior executives as well as analysts and money
managers paint a portrait of a proud, insular organization that has
long relied on tradition and shopworn tactics to solve its
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kellogg is a funny company,'' explained one former executive
who became so disillusioned with Kellogg that he sold his shares.
Like all the executives interviewed, he would speak only on the
condition of anonymity. ``As recently as the mid-90's, we were
still asking what Kellogg would have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, of course, was Will Keith Kellogg, the visionary
business manager who along with his brother, Dr. John Harvey
Kellogg, invented flaked cereal in 1894 at the Battle Creek
Sanitarium, where they offered rich and famous patients a regimen
of exercise, fresh air and strict diet. The flakes spawned what in
1922 became the Kellogg Company and established Battle Creek as the
cereal capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, falling back on the Kellogg heritage served the
corporation well, as it capitalized on its wholesome reputation for
nutritious products at a fair price. But in recent years, the
company has found it hard to react to the pressures of the modern
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether Gutierrez, who has been at Kellogg
23 years, and its board, heavily influenced by its two largest
shareholders and a former chief executive, are willing to break
with tradition to turn around the company and prevent it from being
sold. If so, the fire will have to come from within: Those
shareholders, which together own nearly half of the company's
shares outstanding, make it possible for Kellogg's management to
ignore the rumblings of all but a few investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Carlos to succeed, he has to operate very different from
the past,'' said another former executive. ``If he becomes another
Arnie, I don't think he can turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are striking parallels in the backgrounds of
Carlos Gutierrez and Arnold Langbo. Both started their careers as
sales representatives and have never worked anywhere else. Both
have extensive experience in virtually all aspects of the company's
management structure. Neither has a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   But there also are important differences. Gutierrez, a native of
Cuba who was raised in Mexico, has far more international
experience, having run Kellogg's Mexican and Asia-Pacific
divisions. He is also expected to focus more than his predecessor
on expanding sales, rather than cutting costs, although last week
the company announced it would slash a fifth of its European
salaried workforce.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Gutierrez, who is to take over as chief
executive in April, may not have nearly as much time as Langbo did.
If the company's results do not soon improve, Kellogg may explore
other options, including a possible merger, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kellogg looks like an attractive candidate,'' said Jaine I.
Mehring, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``It has a leadership
position in what is a very large category that is important to
retailers and has something that really few other companies have,
and that is truly global brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   One name frequently mentioned as a merger partner is the much
larger Unilever, whose international distribution network would
help push Kellogg's strong global brand name into more households
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gund, saying on Friday that she did not want to foster
conflict within her family, emphasized that she and her siblings
did not favor a sale of the business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has been unable in recent years to capitalize on the
power of its brand. While it remains the nation's top-selling
cereal maker, it lost more than two percentage points in market
share from 1994 to 1997, according to Information Resources Inc., a
research firm in Chicago. Competitors, like General Mills Inc.,
that lost share in that period rebounded last year. But Kellogg
lost nearly another two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Langbo, who joined Kellogg in 1956 and will
remain chairman until next year, has lacked creativity in solving
Kellogg's problems. He has tried to cut costs by slashing jobs, to
lure back customers by throwing money at advertising and promotion
and to restore profits by raising prices. The last few years have
been difficult for all cereal makers, as companies that offer
cheaper supermarket or other private-label brands have taken an
increasing share of the market. Consumers also have favored bagels
and other convenience foods to a bowl of cereal in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Langbo seemed unable to rise to the challenge.
Hand-picked by his predecessor, William E. LaMothe, who remains on
the Kellogg board, Langbo is described by former colleagues as
unwilling to delegate, choosing for years not to appoint a chief
operating officer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has been unable to get a grip on just how much people
are willing pay for its cereals, especially when other boxes of
corn flakes seem more like its brand than ever before. A few years
ago, the company set off a price war, hoping to make up the lost
profits through volume, but then struggled to raise prices again.
In the end, the approach gave consumers sticker shock at grocery
checkout lanes and benefited competitors like General Mills, whose
strategy depended less on its pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much discounting and repricing going on that
it is very confusing to consumers, and General Mills seems to have
taken advantage of that,'' said Timothy Ghriskey, a senior
portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp., which sold its 540,000
shares of Kellogg months ago. General Mills also has benefited from
marketing that stressed nutrition even as it promoted the addition
of frosting and honey flavor to old-line cereals like its Cheerios,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Kellogg spokesman insisted that Langbo has positioned the
company for future growth. The company has added an advertising
agency to push its nutrition message more aggressively. Kellogg has
also purchased several factories to produce convenience foods. It
is rolling out a product line it calls Ensemble _ frozen entrees,
cookies, muffins, and other foods, for both breakfast and other
meals, that the company will promote as being healthful. And it is
adding 200,000 distribution points in places like convenience
stores to increase sales of single-serving snacks, like Rice
Krispies Treats.
</P>
<P>
   In Langbo's defense, Gund also was quick to blame industry
trends, like people eating on the run, for the company's troubles.
While he said the change in leadership ``was appropriate'' he added
that he would not ``speculate on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, nonetheless, has judged Langbo harshly. During
his tenure, the stock significantly underperformed other food
stocks, retdd sloturning an average 3 percent a year, compared with
13 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of food stocks. While
the board stood by, many investors abandoned the company, selling
their shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either expect to get change or go onto something else,''
said Charles Mayer, a portfolio manager with Invesco Funds in
Denver, which continues to own stock in Kellogg. Even steadfast
investors, he said, had made their feelings known to the company.
At its closing price Friday of $38.125, Kellogg has a market value
of $15.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What has protected the company for so long from investors' wrath
is its domination by two friendly shareholders. The W.K. Kellogg
Foundation, created in 1930 by Will Keith Kellogg, owns about a
third of the company. The Gund family received shares in 1928 after
selling what is now known as Sanka, the decaffeinated coffee brand,
to Kellogg; the Gunds now control about 12 percent of the shares
outstanding, worth about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation and Kellogg continue to be closely tied, and many
directors sit on both boards. Langbo, for example, serves as
co-trustee of the foundation's trust, which controls its Kellogg
shares and whose bylaws require a company representative on the
trust board.
</P>
<P>
   Three foundation trustees are also company directors: LaMothe,
the former chief executive of Kellogg; Ms. Johnson, the head of the
Council of Michigan Foundations, and Dr. William C. Richardson, the
chief executive of the Kellogg Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other ties as well. Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former
Defense Secretary, for example, used to serve on the board of
Sears, Roebuck with LaMothe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cozy relationship between the company and the foundation
and Battle Creek made it difficult for the board to see the forest
for the trees,'' said one of the former executives.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, the Lilly Endowment, which owns 16 percent
of Eli Lilly, has no representatives on the drug maker's board.
</P>
<P>
   What is also striking is the presence of LaMothe _ who presided
over the company in its heyday _ on Kellogg's board. He is viewed
by outsiders as having considerable sway over other board members.
``He is so tied up in the corporate history that they don't know
how to make an independent decision,'' said one former executive.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be compounded for Gutierrez, who will be
looking at two ex-chief executives when he sits down for board
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Gund insisted that Gutierrez ``is going to express his own views
and not be influenced by anyone else.'' What is more, Gund said,
both former chief executives are likely to step down from the board
next year.
</P>
<P>
   He also took issue with criticism of the board, saying that
``there is no insular issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   The directors, he said, were independent: ``We want to do the
very best we can for this business and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders are restless. Ms. Gund says her family became
increasingly concerned about the stock's performance because it
threatened to hamper their philanthropic activities. Ms. Gund said
that she and other family members had expressed their concerns to
Gund several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest annual report, the foundation made reference to
the stock's volatility and said that it ``has a significant impact
on the foundation's grant-making capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the foundation _ which supports numerous causes, including
those related to health, education and youth _ has been able to
increase the amount it gives, the value of its assets has declined.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Gutierrez represents the potential for a new
direction. He is described by colleagues and others who have met
him as a driven and intelligent executive who was clearly the best
choice among the inside candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One colleague recalls Gutierrez's spending an hour on Sundays,
after buying his children dessert at McDonald's, watching consumers
buy cereal at a supermarket. ``There were people running the
company the last five years who didn't understand why that was
important,'' this person said. Gutierrez, he said, realized that
adding frosting to flakes or spending more on Tony the Tiger
commercials was futile unless the company figured out why
once-loyal shoppers were switching to its competitors' products.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez also seems decisive. Money managers and analysts
credit him with being the force behind a shake-up at Kellogg's
headquarters in September, in which all managers were forced to
justify their jobs and hundreds were subsequently dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In his first significant management appointment, Gutierrez took
the step _ unusual at Kellogg _ of naming an outsider to a top job,
bringing in a Procter &AMP; Gamble manager whom the company found
through a search firm to oversee the company's Asia-Pacific
operations. He is expected to hire another outsider, possibly later
this month, to run the company's all-important North American
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is revolutionary for this company,'' said Ghriskey of
Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, as even Battle Creek community leaders acknowledge,
is that it is a challenge to lure executives to this sleepy town
tucked beside the Battle Creek River, 113 miles west of Detroit and
170 miles northeast of Chicago. It is a community where nearly
every resident either works for Kellogg or knows someone who does,
and where schools, auditoriums and museums are named for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is against this backdrop that Gutierrez, who himself was
anointed by Langbo, will soon reign. That is why some people are
skeptical about how hard he is likely to push for change. Beyond
wooing executives from other companies and expanding lines of
noncereal foods, ``I really doubt he will significantly rock the
boat,'' Ghriskey said. ``He's someone from inside, he's a longtime
crown prince, and he pretty much toes the company line.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company insists that this year will be a turning point
and Gutierrez ``is not looking for a honeymoon period,'' investors
are waiting to see the tangible results of any new strategies.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Gutierrez has is that there now appears to be no
one else at Kellogg prepared to run the company. Describing him as
the last inside hope, one former colleague remarked, ``Carlos knows
he is holding the cards right now.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24)  
 (af)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address and, again, before a roaring
crowd in Buffalo, N.Y., President Clinton last week floated the
idea of Universal Savings Accounts, a new type of subsidized
savings for low- and moderate-income workers akin to a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   The government would use 11 percent of the projected budget
surplus to match money the workers would save on their own in the
USAs.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the plan appears designed to appeal to both
political parties. It is intended to help workers at the low end of
the spectrum who now have only Social Security at retirement. That
should appeal to Democrats. For Republicans, there is the draw that
these accounts would be controlled by individuals, not the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the president's plan will get bipartisan support, or any
support at all, is unknown. Right now, the USA proposal is high in
concept and low in details, and the administration says it will not
have more specifics for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, both liberal and conservative economists say
they find such accounts an intriguing way to increase the savings
rate. They also say the proposal is another volley in a larger
debate about investing government retirement funds in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, basic questions remain. Is this the best way to spend
part of the budget surplus? How would the matching formula work?
What can the savings accounts be used for? How may the money be
invested? And will the public support a new government program that
redistributes wealth to lower-income citizens?
</P>
<P>
   ``These accounts are still a very nebulous concept,'' said Steve
Moore, director of fiscal policies at the Cato Institute, a
free-market research group in Washington. ``I like the idea of
setting up savings accounts. We want to create a culture of savings
in this country. But it's bad in the way it's done. It looks more
like a new entitlement program than an IRA. I don't see the
rationale of creating a new income distribution program.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The administration envisions the program, which would cost
nearly $500 billion over 15 years, or $33 billion a year, as
offering $100 grants to workers to start accounts. The government
would then match workers' contributions at a variable rate based on
income. About 100 million Americans who earn less than $80,000 to
$100,000 a year _ the precise cutoff has not been set _ would be
eligible for the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is to get more people to do more saving on
their own,'' said an administration spokesman. ``There are so many
things to help the rich save. We think there is a big hole in
savings at the low end.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 41 percent of all workers earn less than $15,000 a
year; of those, only 8 percent have a retirement program at their
workplaces, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute,
a Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   The match rate for the new accounts would be progressive, with
the lowest-paid getting the most. The investment options would be
modeled closely after the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan,
which offers three government-run investment funds _ a stock index
fund, a bond index fund and a Treasury bill fund.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the administration said a worker earning $40,000 a
year could deposit up to $600 a year. At that income level the
government would match 50 cents on the dollar, providing $300 more
to the account. Counting the $100 starting grant, that comes to
$1,000 in the first year, $400 of it from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Thompson, a Washington representative for Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., the nation's largest broker, praised the plan as ``opening the
door to private investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill and other Wall Street firms would prefer that the
government use a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to
finance the accounts, rather than using the budget surplus, and
would like the program to be open to workers of all income levels.
Thompson said he was concerned about how the accounts would be
financed when the budget surplus ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather see all people given the option of investing a
portion of their payroll taxes, maybe one or two percentage points,
in accounts that would be similar to IRAs, and invest that money
however they see fit,'' Thompson said. This idea is similar to one
proposed by some Republicans as an alternative to Clinton's plan to
strengthen Social Security by allowing the government to invest in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other sellers of investments had little to say, for the moment.
``We don't have enough information to judge yet,'' said John
Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, the
trade association for the mutual fund industry. In general, brokers
and mutual fund companies want the opportunity to sell investment
products to USAs, but worry that a program restricted to
lower-income people would result in many small accounts with low
balances, which are costly for brokers to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, wants to
see the funds less restricted in another way: what savings can be
used for. ``Done right, USA accounts are a very good idea,'' Aaron
said, but the money should be available for more than just
retirement _ education, medical care, down payments on first homes
and and business start-ups, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a device to help make savings fashionable and
educate people on the power of compound interest,'' he said, adding
that USAs are much ``sweeter'' for lower-income people than are
individual retirement accounts, which offer only a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research group, also reacted favorably to the plan,
though with reservations. ``I'm not sure what these accounts offer
that isn't already out there in the market,'' Mitchell said. ``I
like that Clinton recognizes that private investment is the key.
But it will not succeed unless we put a chunk of the payroll taxes
into it, because the poor will not be able to build up a good
balance. They cannot use disposable income for this because they
don't have enough.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic scandal expanded to a new front on Friday when
documents were made public showing that the Australian Olympic
Committee offered tens of thousands of dollars to two African
members of the International Olympic Committee the night before the
decisive vote on the site for the 2000 Summer Games. Sydney,
Australia, was awarded the games after it defeated Beijing by two
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released on Friday contain two letters from John
Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee and the
head of Sydney's bid to be named host of the 2000 Games, offering
payments of $5,000 a year for seven years each to national sports
programs run by Charles Mukora of Kenya and Maj. Gen. Francis
Nyangweso of Uganda. The letters were delivered Sept. 23, 1993 in
Monte Carlo, Monaco, hours before Sydney edged Beijing, 45-43, in
voting among members of the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials said Friday night that the payments had in
fact been made for the years 1994 through 1998 and that they had
insured that the payments went to the sports programs and not the
two officials. Because voting on awarding the games is secret, it
is impossible to say for certain if the two Africans ultimately
backed Sydney. Attempts to reach Mukora and Nyangweso Friday night
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the I.O.C. said the group was investigating the
actions of the Australian Olympic Committee and that the affair
would be taken up at a Sunday meeting of the 11-member executive
board of the international committee in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any proof or documents will be looked into,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of possible misconduct by the Australian Olympic
Committee is only the latest blow for the international body, an
organization that has already concluded that officials with the
Salt Lake City effort to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games had given
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and other benefits to
I.O.C. members in an effort to gain favor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya resigned Friday in
the wake of investigations into the Salt Lake City bid. His son,
Suher, has said that he received tuition assistance to two Utah
universities, as well as $700 a month in living expenses from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials. Suher Attarabulsi once even listed his
home address as the office of the Salt Lake Olympic committee. The
resignation was the second this week by a committee member. On
Tuesday, Pirjo Haggman of Finland resigned after it was reported
that her former husband had worked for the Salt Lake bid committee
and that years earlier the couple's rent had been paid while he was
working on behalf of a Toronto bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 other committee members face suspension or
expulsion in connection with the Salt Lake scandal when the
executive board meets this weekend to hear a report of wrongdoing
in Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Sydney Friday night, Coates said the
Australian Olympic Committee had negotiated deals in the summer of
1993 with a handful of African and other countries to provide
sports scholarships and other assistance. He said he decided to
commit to precise cash payments the night before the vote because
he felt demoralized about Sydney's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was leveraging our bid,'' Coates said, defending both the
initial arrangements to provide assistance and the promises of
specific dollar amounts. ``But that was within the I.O.C.'s
guidelines and is within the I.O.C.'s guidelines until they rule
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one senior U.S. Olympic official, the latest
revelations could lead to additional calls for Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the powerful president of the I.O.C., either to take
drastic action aimed at reform or to perhaps resign. Accused
members who do not resign this weekend will be suspended, Samaranch
has said, and will face expulsion by a vote of the entire I.O.C.
membership in March.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, said Samaranch was wounded and might soon face what he
called a ``palace revolt.'' He said his survival would probably
depend on whether a thorough housecleaning is carried out in the
wake of the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume a lot don't resign,'' Schultz said of the members
implicated in wrongdoing. ``If there is unanimity to vote these
people out and make changes, I think he will end up in a strong
position. If they can't do that, not only Samaranch but the whole
I.O.C. is in trouble. That will look bad all around the world.''

   Schultz became the first high-ranking Olympic official to speak
publicly of the precariousness of Samaranch's hold on the Olympic
leadership after 18 years as president. The 78-year-old Spanish
marquis has said that he will serve out his current term, which
ends in 2001. The U.S. Olympic Committee has strongly expressed its
support for Samaranch, and Anita DeFrantz, an international vice
president from Los Angeles, has also said that she firmly believes
he should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in an interview with The Associated Press in
Switzerland, Samaranch appeared committed to remaining in his job.
``In this moment, I have to be at the head of the I.O.C. more than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the I.O.C.
has its headquarters, the senior International Olympic Committee
official from Australia said that the news was so disturbing that
it could raise calls for the games to be removed from Sydney. The
official, Kevan Gosper, said he did not previously know of the
offers to the Africans but described them to the Associated Press
as being ``beyond good will'' and called for all Sydney documents
to be made public and for a full-scale investigation of the city's
bid process to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Thomas, a spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee,
said the idea of taking the Games from Sydney was not realistic.
``We are 20 months away,'' he said. ``How else could they put on
the games?''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said in an interview that he believed, at this point,
that the 2000 Summer Games would not be removed to another city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think so,'' Schultz said. ``I would hope not. It
will be a spectacular site for the games. They've invested so much
money in new facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it would be impossible to move the 2000 games at such a
late date, ``I suppose nothing is impossible. But you'd have to go
someplace where they've got their venues in place, like Seoul.''
The South Korean capital was host the 1988 Summer Games and is
preparing to be a co-host, with Japan, of the 2002 World Cup in
soccer.

   The government has ruled that the National Health Service will
limit treatment with the impotence drug Viagra to patients whose
conditions stem from surgery or serious injury. It is the first
instance in its 50-year history that the service has excluded care
for cost reasons. Frank Dobson, the health secretary, said
unlimited prescriptions would increase tenfold the $20 million now

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The storm system rose out of Texas and
Oklahoma and crossed into Arkansas on Thursday. By the time it
exhausted itself, the tornadoes it spawned had killed seven people.
An additional person was killed in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   As many as three dozen tornadoes lashed Arkansas between about 5
p.m. and 8:30 p.m., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't stop,'' Teri Magsam of the Arkansas Office of
Emergency Services said Friday. ``They just kept on coming in, one
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   In White County four people died, including 2-month-old Kirk
McAfee, who was killed when his family's home in Beebe, a community
of 4,000 people, 35 miles northeast of Little Rock, was flattened.
The infant was either sucked or blown out of the home and was found
about a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCullock's family barely survived the tornado that
shattered their house. ``We got in the center hallway with the
mattress off the bed and began praying to beat the band,''
McCullock said.
</P>
<P>
   A new junior high school that McCullock's daughter attended was
a pile of bricks and shingles.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado tore apart the home of Wanda Willis, 65, a member of
the school board in nearby Searcy, and tossed her body into a
field, said Tom Martin, chief of the Center Hill community's fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were a woman known only as Flo Taylor, estimated by
the authorities to be in her 50s, and a fourth person found Friday
but not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Winds whipped across the grounds of the governor's mansion in
Little Rock. There was no damage to the building, but the tree
house in a backyard oak where Chelsea Clinton had once played was a
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   But only blocks from the governor's mansion, a supermarket
collapsed from the force of the winds, and on Friday morning one of
several people initially trapped in the wreckage, Robert Howard,
67, the store's pharmacist, died of his injuries. A 34-year-old
Little Rock woman, Lisa Jacko, died on Thursday night when a tree
struck the car she was driving a short distance from the store.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, there was more
death and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was in her wheelchair and my uncle was in the
back bedroom and he was coming down the hallway when the tree fell
and crushed him,'' said Eva Weikel, the niece of James Looper, 63,
who died in the wreckage of his mobile home in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The storm then moved into Tennessee, where a woman was killed by
a tornado west of Nashville when she went outside to get her dogs,
The Associated Press reported. The storm tore apart the historic
district of Clarksville, Tenn., early Friday, wrecking the
121-year-old courthouse and cutting power to 25,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes killed nine people in Tennessee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The storms cut off electricity to more than 70,000 Arkansas
homes and businesses on Thursday, and by late Friday afternoon
42,000 people were still without power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most unusual storms I've ever seen this time
of year _ strong and volatile,'' said George Wilken, a
meteorologist with 33 years' experience at the National Weather
Service in North Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes rarely occur in the South during winter, but when they
do, they are often very powerful, Wilken said. The latest storm
system, he said, was created when unusually warm, moist Gulf air
moved north under a cold air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Arkansas' 75 counties have declared local
emergencies and three were designated major disaster areas by Gov.
Mike Huckabee. ``It's just devastating,'' he said. ``We've seen
more damage that we expected. We weren't prepared for what we saw
in White County.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: SPREWELL HAS APOLOGIZED ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE BROOK, N.Y. _ Billie Holiday tartly sang ``Don't Explain,''
and after listening to questions fired at Latrell Sprewell Friday,
the new Knicks player might be wise to heed that advice, sooner
rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speculation, heated debate and controversy
before he even signed a contract, the National Basketball
Association's most controversial player, wearing his trademark
cornrows, met the news media Friday. He didn't snarl, he didn't
growl. Instead, Sprewell set the tone by saying he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start by apologizing to coach Carlesimo for the
incident in December of '97,'' he said, adding an apology to the
Warriors' organization and a thanks to fans, family and the Knicks
``for giving me a second opportunity to come out and show you
people the real Latrell.''
</P>
<P>
   Apologies set the tone for most of the 45-minute news
conference, as they had set the tone for the last few days. The
round of apologies began last Sunday when Sprewell met with the
Knicks' hierarchy in Milwaukee. A day later, coach Jeff Van Gundy
and Sprewell shared a flight to New York. Thursday morning,
Sprewell met with NBA commissioner David Stern, who pronounced him
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was Friday's session, sometimes humiliating,
often paternalistic, with Sprewell apologizing and assuring the
moral media that he will behave. At times it seemed as if we were
in the principal's office with Sprewell, the Coasters' ``Charlie
Brown,'' being scolded for a multitude of classroom sins:
</P>
<P>
   Can you control your anger? Will you snap again? Do you realize
many people don't want you here?
</P>
<P>
   I just hope contrition doesn't so set the tone for Sprewell's
stay in New York that he loses the edge, which is why his new
bosses brought him here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy opened Friday's Sprewell greeting with a farewell to
John Starks, who was traded to Golden State. ``Because of his
effort over the past eight years,'' Van Gundy said, ``he's done
unbelievable things for my career and I'll always be appreciative
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice sentiment. But Starks couldn't do for the rest of Van
Gundy's career what a focused Sprewell can do. At a time when
rumors of Phil Jackson's return to New York as a coach are in the
air and, of course, the ambitious John Calipari is in the region
with the Nets, Van Gundy needs some powerful afterburners to
separate him from the pack nipping at his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is no saint; what we looked for Friday was contrition,
and Sprewell was filled with it. ``I made a mistake,'' he said.
``We all make mistakes in life. I've paid the price. I'm sorry for
what has happened in the past. I'm just asking for some
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks made a bold basketball decision and, in a perverse
way, an even better public relations move. Everyone talks about fan
apathy, but if the reaction to Sprewell's signing _ pro and con _
is any indication, fan anticipation is in late-season form. The
Feb. 7 home opener against the Miami Heat will be as electric as
any big game. Pat Riley? Alonzo Mourning? Sprewell?
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Sprewell Friday if he knew what to expect on
opening night. He said he did not, but I'm not sure Knick fans know
how they will react, either. Sprewell, a three-time NBA all-star,
is different from any player the Knicks have had in decades. He is
aggressive, like Starks, and also has Starks' defensive capacity.
He has an edge, obviously, a scorer's attitude and a consistency
that is the opposite of Starks' unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   But can Sprewell withstand the withering New York pressure?
``Nothing is worse than the first week after the incident,''
Sprewell said, referring to the aftermath of his choking of P.J.
Carlesimo. ``There was so much said about me, so much negative
publicity, and I've heard it all. If I can handle that, I'm pretty
sure that I'll be ready to handle anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure will very likely be greater than he realizes: This
is not West Coast space; it is East Coast density. At the same
time, Sprewell is freer than he has been in his career. He knows
that a lot of fans _ and the news media _ will resent him
regardless of what he says. Other fans will give him the benefit of
the doubt. The vast majority of fans are mercenaries, willing to be
won over by performance.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more for Sprewell to say, and there are only so many
times he can apologize before it becomes debilitating and hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell apologized about six times Friday. My advice from this
point forward is simple: Don't explain. Just play.
</P>

METHOD TO SOME, MADDENING TO MANY , MAX IS MAD ABOUT SAVING WHALES

(DW) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Max!'' has become an eye-rolling epithet in some
Boston quarters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Max is barred from the New England Aquarium after ranting at
visitors about whale-watching cruises. He is on notice not to enter
government offices where he has made workers cry. He has been
arrested 130 times, by his count. A federal court decision called
him a ``highly aggressive and abrasive individual.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his wildness, though, Max also gets credit from some for
pushing forward the desperate cause of the planet's most endangered
whale, the North Atlantic right whale, where others feared to
tread. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Max is Richard Max Strahan, self-titled ``Prince of Whales,'' a
longtime radical campaigner whose solicitation table covered with
graphic photographs of bloody whales injured by ships or fishing
gear is a fixture in Boston gathering spots, and who has himself
become a self-representing fixture in the Boston courts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Strahan is better known as Mad Max, in part for his tendency
to lash out at anyone who disagrees with him: judges; environmental
colleagues favoring more moderate or scientific means of saving the
right whale; even passersby who pause at his table near Faneuil
Hall Market or in South Station to eye the photos but refuse to
give money or sign a petition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you hurt your own cause by alienating so many people,'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strahan was asked recently after a diatribe aimed at a
retreating back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, oh oh, God!,'' Strahan snapped back. ``Boring story, I've
heard that one.'' He went on:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not about me, it's about them. It's about them! The
system! Maybe the issue is that I'm just a plain old Joe who's
doing this Good Samaritan thing to save the whale, and when I do
the most basic common sense things like say, `Hey, let's put a
speed limit on a boat,' and, `If you want to go whale-watching,
let's license it, let's obey the law,' maybe that's my major thing.
That's why they call me the Wyatt Earp of whales, because I'm just
saying, `Let's obey the law.' And maybe when I ask that simple
thing, everybody just freaks out!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, part of the problem is how Strahan asks. He asks
often, filing scores of lawsuits based mainly on the Endangered
Species Act. He demands radical measures, from banning commercial
fishing _ because fishing gear can entangle whales _ to closing
ports _ because ships occasionally collide with whales. He often
asks not very nicely, such as when he refers to government
officials, in court papers, as vermin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has the front-toothless, snarl-haired mien of a street
person, though snug in bright fleece and down. He seems to lack a
phone or office (but has e-mail), and he refuses to talk about
where or how he lives, leading to persistent rumors that he is
homeless and that his group, GreenWorld, consists mainly of him.
</P>
<P>
   He is reviled by some environmentalists, who say he does far
more damage than good, and by fishermen, who fear that he is out to
destroy their livelihood. He can drive to distraction just about
everybody he deals with, from lawyers to environmental allies to
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much as they might like to, his critics cannot simply
dismiss him as a ``kook.'' Some even grudgingly respect him, in
part because he is a largely self-taught expert on environmental
law and his own legal rights, in part because he has become an
undisputed catalyst in saving the right whale, but most of all
because, despite everything, he has had some success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he sued the Coast Guard to stop its ships from running
into and killing North Atlantic right whales, distinguished by
wrinkles on the throat and chest. Their numbers have shrunk from
the thousands to a current official count of 300; in 1996 the
service was ordered to change its practices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he sued Massachusetts, seeking a ban on commercial
fishing in state waters because the lines and gear can hurt right
whales. The suit helped lead to a partial ban on fishing with gill
nets and lobstering in the months when the whales spawn near shore
and to changes in fishing gear. Late last year, the U. S. Supreme
Court declined to hear the state's appeal of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I disagree with his lawsuit, and firmly believe the
state should have won every step of the way, you have to give the
guy credit,'' said Sal Giorlandino, the assistant attorney general
who represented the state in the suit. ``He did bring a lawsuit,
which other people did not bring, people who thought about suing
and didn't. So he deserves the credit for pushing the issue
forward, though I disagree with his claims and the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have failed to reach Giorlandino's philosophical
acceptance of Strahan's wild ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sues everybody who could be his ally,'' said Dr. Scott D.
Kraus, senior scientist at the New England Aquarium, which Strahan
sued for barring him after he accosted visitors about the evils of
whale-watching boats. ``It's not just abrasive personality. I could
deal with that. He inhibits people who could do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan also has repeatedly subpoenaed all of the aquarium's
whale data for other cases. ``It takes away from the time we could
be spending doing something for the animals,'' Dr. Kraus said. ``I
think you're glorifying someone who's destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass., which,
like the aquarium, studies whales at sea, is also named by Strahan
in his suit against whale-watching. He says the whale-watching
boats hurt whales by getting too close, disrupting their lives and
sometimes hitting them.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents question Strahan's sanity. Two state officials
recalled that Strahan told a judge in federal court that he had
been a Supreme Court Justice in a previous life and written the
very decisions under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, absolutely no one, should underestimate the man,''
said Giorlandino. ``He might throw 10 legal arguments at you, 10
claims, and 9 might miss. But it only takes one.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have repeatedly questioned what happens to the
money that Strahan gathers in his panhandling style, barraging
passersby with information on whales and then asking them,
clipboard in hand, to sign a petition and contribute cash for his
campaign. He refuses to register as an official charity and to
report his proceeds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strahan refused to talk about the finances and membership of
GreenWorld, his group, saying that it is a radical organization,
not the Sierra Club.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only on one thing do all sides, the pro-Max, anti-Max and Max
himself, agree: the plight of the North Atlantic right whale is
dire and previous efforts to protect it have fallen far short.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While other advocates of the whale talk about federal budgets or
habitat studies, however, Strahan offers a particularly Max-like
plan: lawsuits to shut down East Coast ports, arguing that their
shipping traffic hurts the endangered whales. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No ports, no ship traffic, no dead whales,'' he said in a
recent e-mail. ``A winning suit.''  &QL;

HOW TO RUN FOR OFFICE WITHOUT SEEMING TO TRY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suppose that you are a high-level Cabinet official
wondering if you should run for elective office. Do you have a
chance? Can you raise money? Will the potential of your candidacy
excite party leaders and newspapers? Most important, is there a way
to answer these questions without risking the embarrassment of a
failed run for office?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that last question is yes, and it's not hard to
do. All it takes is a friend or two to whisper to a reporter or two
that you are thinking about the race. A few subsequent mentions in
newspapers should allow for a painless testing of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services, who was one of several prominent public officials _
including the wife of a certain president of the United States _
who showed up on lists of potential candidate for Senate in 2000,
after Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., retires from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But now, two months later, Ms. Shalala has joined another list:
of prominent Americans who are forgoing the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of her friends in New York urged her to run, but she's
decided to continue her public service as secretary of health and
human services,'' said Ms. Shalala's spokesman, Melissa Skolfield.
The secretary has decided, Ms. Skolfield said, that she would
rather devote her energies into staying at Clinton's side for the
final two years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalala's policy interests aside, it would be fair to say
that her rumored candidacy made hardly a ripple in New York waters,
even at a time when Democrats have looked with increasing despair
at their possible candidates for a race that could include, on the
Republican side, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But this was
one trial balloon that, by all appearances, never quite left the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Rising Lowey Balloon
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalala's statement followed a similar declaration by two
other almost-candidates: Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of
housing and urban development, and state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall. That leaves Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester. Ms. Lowey
floated her own trial balloon to win attention.
</P>
<P>
   New York being New York, Ms. Lowey had barely got off the
telephone with reporters before someone laid a claim for her job.
Mark Weprin, the Queens Assemblyman _ and son of former state
Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin _ called reporters to say that he was
ready to run for Ms. Lowey's Congressional position, assuming that
Ms. Lowey runs for Moynihan's position (which, just to set things
straight, assumes that Hillary Rodham Clinton won't be running for
Moynihan's old job).
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Weprin is talking up Ms. Lowey qualifications
to run for the Senate, which would, not coincidentally, leave her
job (the one Weprin wants) vacant. ``I actually think Nita might be
a better candidate than Hillary,'' Weprin said. ``Hillary comes
with a lot of baggage. She's got the carpetbagger issue. The fact
that Nita is from Westchester is really going to sell in a lot of
parts of the state. On paper, she's stronger than Chuck Schumer was
two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki PAC Lunch
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ambitions, Gov. George Pataki spent Friday in
Washington, tending to his presumed national ones. He held the
first fund-raising lunch for the national political action
committee he set up to pay for his exploratory trips around the
country. The lunch cost $1,000 a person and drew about 40 people,
most of them Washington business leaders, according to Pataki's
communications director, Zenia Mucha. It was, in keeping with
Pataki's custom, closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha reports that in his speech to contributors, and in a
separate Washington speech to Republican leaders from across the
country, Pataki did not mention his concerns about the Republican
drive to remove Clinton from office. But, she said, he did ``talk
about the need for the Republican Party to unify behind a message
and talk about how important it is that we go back to core
Republican principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Open Option
</P>
<P>
   What will Mrs. Clinton do? Speaking at a breakfast sponsored by
the New York City Partnership and Crain's New York Business on
Friday, Sen. Charles Schumer said he discussed the matter with the
first lady recently. ``She has said to me, and she said it to many
others, that she is not going to begin really thinking about this
until after the impeachment process closes,'' he said. ``I take her
at her word.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Schumer said, ``The first lady and her people
have not tried to end the speculation about her candidacy, which I
guess is an indication that it's not off the table.''

COMMENTARY: AN OLD DOOR TO LISTENERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On stage at Cooper Union's Great Hall _ the very
place where Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech that helped him get
elected in 1860 _ Hi Brown paced among a quintet of actors in front
of a few slender microphones. They were about to record ``The Naked
Truth,'' a radio dramatization of another talk delivered there, by
Victoria Woodhull, a feminist who scandalized the country with
ideas about free love and women's rights in 1873.
</P>
<P>
   The hall was still great. The audience was modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of an audience is not new,'' Brown said to the 20
people who sat before him. ``We used to do this way back when I
used to do the `Philip Morris Playhouse' at the Ed Sullivan
Theater. We wore tuxes and whatnot and had 300 people fighting over
tickets. The audience does not please me as much as having
thousands of people listening for the first time at home.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody listens anymore,'' he said softly. ``We've lost the art
of listening.''
</P>
<P>
   With a lead-in like that, who wasn't going to pay attention? The
few people who had braved a nasty night spent the next hour hearing
voices from another era. In the fall, thousands more can hear them
on WNYC radio in a series marking the 140th anniversary of Cooper
Union, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Hall on Astor Place was where the spoken word sparked
passions that propelled social movements like women's suffrage,
labor unions and civil rights. The series is called ``They Were
Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   That title also applies to Brown. He wasn't yet a teen-ager when
he literally talked himself into a radio gig reading poems. In the
1930s he went on to direct and produce radio shows like ``Dick
Tracy,'' ``Terry and the Pirates,'' ``Inner Sanctum Mysteries'' and
``CBS Mystery Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The creaking door that opened those last two series inspired
millions of nightmares while giving Brown a lasting claim to a
legendary chapter in American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   What is not as lasting, unfortunately, is the attention span of
radio audiences, who now have slim pickings between shock jocks and
nonstop Monica. Whatever happened to storytelling?
</P>
<P>
   ``The spoken word has been around since the guy came home, sat
by the fireplace and said, `Let me tell you about the people who
came before us,''' Brown said. ``We don't have time anymore. You're
overloaded with TV, motion pictures. Everything is special effects.
Everything is handed to you on a silver platter. There's no chance
for your imagination or your creativity. In radio drama, you have
to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown taught millions how to listen. Who wouldn't, considering
the roster of actors he employed over the years? Boris Karloff,
Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, E.G. Marshall and Agnes Moorehead all
played in his radio dramas.
</P>
<P>
   He had an eye for talent even in his earliest days, when he
secured the rights to ``Dick Tracy'' while still in college. He
talked a friend from English class into writing the gang-busting
scripts. His name? Irwin Shaw. Some friend.
</P>
<P>
   With an apartment overlooking Central Park, Brown has come a
long way from cartoons. Now the drawings that he dotes on are
impressionist paintings that hang in every room. Radio has been
good to him. Just as it was for families who used to huddle
together in their more modest homes decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Depression years, people didn't have 5 cents for
movies,'' he said, tapping a marble table for emphasis. ``What did
they have? They turned on the radio. The only escape they had was
the soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants people to escape the cultural abyss that often
passes for entertainment. His work on the Cooper Union series was
paid for by his own foundation, like an investment in audience
development.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to revive ``Mystery Theater'' on public radio soon.
He figures that with billions of dollars spent each year on audio
books, there is an eager audience for radio dramas. And he doesn't
mean dusting off some old tapes, either. He has new tales lurking
behind the creaking door. He insists he could go on for another 10
years. He is utterly persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People change, dialogue changes,'' he said. ``There were great
painters who were impressionists, but you don't write off Jackson
Pollock, either. I just don't want to live in the world of 1932 to
1950.''
</P>
<P>
   Will a new generation get hooked on radio? Will mystery lovers
shudder once again, or will they be condemned to a cruel, cruel
fate of Monica madness? And what about Hi Brown, who went from the
Depression to the impressionists?
</P>
<P>
   Tune in tomorrow, and listen closely. The door may be creaky,
but Hi Brown is anything but.

OF FOOLS, FUMBLES AND A FINE FIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The long and short of it:
</P>
<P>
   _The seven-point spread favoring Denver over Atlanta in the
Super Bowl is too high. And oddsmaker Roxy Roxborough expects it to
rise because ``fans are much more familiar with John Elway, Terrell
Davis and the Broncos than they are with Chris Chandler, Jamal
Anderson and the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   _It's not the Falcons who'll have to pick up their game next
Sunday. It's Pat Summerall and John Madden, Fox's over-the-hill
gang in the booth. Either Summerall is missing half of what's going
on or he's playing the ``understated'' routine to such an extreme,
it brings back memories of NBC's no-play-by-play experiment. And
Madden didn't seem to be kidding when he exclaimed, ``I thought the
ground couldn't cause a fumble!'' after someone in the NFC
Championship Game fell down _ without being tackled _ and the ball
was jarred loose.
</P>
<P>
   _Received an envelope from the USOC that read, ``Your Olympic
name labels are enclosed.'' And those names would be what _
``Bugsy,'' ``Scarface'' and ``Prettyboy''?
</P>
<P>
   _The more you know, the more you think Tonya Harding belonged in
the Olympics all along. And a really good tire iron would come in
handy about now.
</P>
<P>
   _If you're feeling a certain cynical glee over the Olympics
scandal, it's probably because the Games present themselves as such
a bastion of righteousness, with the trumpet fanfares and Dick
Enberg saying ``grandeur'' every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _Has anybody looked into possible corruption in X Games site
selections?
</P>
<P>
   _The wit and wisdom of Pat Summerall and John Madden:
</P>
<P>
   Summerall: ``7:40 (left in the game). When they start this
(play), it'll be less than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden: ``There gets to be a point where time is of the
essence.''
</P>
<P>
   _While Francois Botha taunted Mike Tyson as no Tyson opponent
before him, Tyson behaved like the frightened fighter in Las Vegas
last weekend. Not frightened for his safety but afraid that if he
followed his corner's plan and boxed straight up, he'd find out his
fundamental skills are as gone as the critics say. So he relied on
erratic haymakers and got lucky when Botha walked into one.
</P>
<P>
   _A friend says I'm puritanical to argue that this
thrown-together NBA season will reward the good guys _ those who
can stand the four- or five-games-a-week grind because they worked
out in the uncertain offseason. That's who I'm rooting for, all
right: the Indiana Puritans.
</P>
<P>
   _David Claerbaut, author of a book called ``The NBA Analyst,''
sets out to do for basketball stats what Bill James did for
baseball stats. Claerbaut says Shaquille O'Neal is ``a genuinely
great player,'' but five things keep him from the Michael
Jordan-Karl Malone class: He lacks a perimeter game; he can't make
free throws; he doesn't get the ``big rebound''; he's not a leader,
and ``he seems to lack court sense.'' If all that is true, then the
standard for genuinely great players must be pretty low.
</P>
<P>
   _Speaking of Jordan, how about the notion that a whole sport
depends on one player? A recent news item on Mark McGwire's
Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year Award said his 70 home
runs ``helped save the game of baseball.'' Worse-case scenario, if
the home run record hadn't happened, if players never signed
another autograph, if everybody stayed mad at everybody, do people
really think baseball was about to disappear? Or when you equate a
fractional decline in major-league attendance with impending doom,
are you making the same mistake as those who spotted a 10 percent
shift in national voting patterns and proclaimed it a Republican
Revolution?
</P>
<P>
   _The wit and wisdom of Pat Summerall: ``Randy Moss _ he's got
good speed.''
</P>
<P>
   _For what it's worth: Eric Karros, Chan Ho Park, Eric Young and
Dave Hansen are the veteran regulars at the Dodgers'
three-times-a-week workouts at Dodger Stadium. Kevin Brown worked
out on the first day and went home to Georgia. Manager Davey
Johnson appeared the first day and went home to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   _Question inspired by the impeachment trial: Are we going to
have to call him Mr. Mgr. Davey Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   _Baseball's young, hip, multicultural image took a hit when
photos of Bud Selig, George Will and George Mitchell appeared on
the same page in the current Baseball Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   _For those who wrongly excuse fighters' misdeeds on the grounds
that everybody in boxing is dirty: Vladimir Cerin, a thoroughbred
trainer at Santa Anita, named his daughter after Alexis Arguello,
the three-division champion of the 1970s and '80s. His
!ital!daughter!off!. Cerin, who used to condition human athletes,
said Arguello was ``the classiest fighter I ever met. He was always
apologizing about knocking people out.'' (Alexis Cerin is a pretty
good athlete herself _ a senior midfielder on Arcadia High's
undefeated girls' soccer team.)
</P>
<P>
   _Don't be surprised if NBA fans come back faster than baseball
fans did. That's a backhanded compliment to the NBA. Baseball fans
were still innocent enough before the 1994-95 strike to think the
American Pastime wouldn't do that to them. Basketball fans held no
such illusion about the leaders of their game.
</P>
<P>
   _When Larry Robinson benches a Kings veteran, then tells
reporters he talked with the player to make sure no feelings were
hurt, is it possible he is just too nice to be a head coach?
</P>
<P>
   _The wit and wisdom of John Madden (on players' motivation in
conference-title games): ``I don't care what people say. They say,
`You can't smell Super Bowl.' I guarantee you, you can smell Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   _Or something.

(ATTN: Wash.)  
 McILVAINE, NEWEST NET, KNEW IT ALL ALONG  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Three clues were all Jim McIlvaine
needed to predict his next stop in the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the Seattle SuperSonics wanted to cut salaries, that the
Nets wanted to block more shots, and that John Nash, the Nets'
general manager, respected him as a person and as a player. So as
early as last summer, McIlvaine began envisioning himself playing
the baseline alongside Jayson Williams, making outlet passes to Sam
Cassell and helping the metropolitan area's other basketball team
move beyond the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in Leo's Italian Restaurant in Hoboken with my
buddy during the lockout,'' McIlvaine said Friday, moments after
his first workout with the Nets. ``I was in for a union meeting and
I told him I was going to get traded. He said, `Where do you think
you're going to go?' And I said, `Well, I might end up here,
because John Nash drafted me and I could fit in pretty decently out
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, McIlvaine, who served on the negotiating
committee for the players union, was running wind sprints inside
the Champion Center. He had been traded to the Nets, shipped out of
Seattle on Monday for Michael Cage and Don MacLean. Just as he had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, already equipped with two capable centers in Williams
and Rony Seikaly, brought the 7-foot-1-inch McIlvaine in to do
three things: block shots, change trajectories and bang bodies. It
is a role for which he is well suited. In four NBA seasons,
McIlvaine has averaged 1.8 blocks in less than 15 minutes a game.
That is nearly as much as the Nets' starting frontcourt of
Williams, Keith Van Horn and Kendall Gill averaged together last
season.
</P>
<P>
   With little reason to fear going inside, Nets opponents drove to
the basket unceasingly last season, usually dunking or laying the
ball up, as the Nets blocked only 314 shots, fourth worst in the
league. Now, with McIlvaine in the fold, the path to the basket
will not be as inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a presence that we didn't have last year,''
Cassell said. ``Sometimes a blocked shot means as much as a field
goal. A blocked shot can change a game around drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   After two disappointing seasons in Seattle, McIlvaine, 26, is
hoping his career also changes. When Nash, then the general manager
of the Washington Bullets, selected the Marquette product in the
second round of the 1994 draft, expectations were low. But it
quickly became evident that McIlvaine possessed a gift for
rejecting shots. His talent became appreciated throughout the
league in his second season when he averaged 2.1 blocks a game in
what amounted to little more than a quarter's worth of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play help-side defense and keep my eyes on my man and the
ball at the same time,'' McIlvaine said, explaining why he blocks
so many shots. ``Plus, I'm tall. That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   After his break-out season, McIlvaine became perhaps the most
coveted 2-point scorer in recent NBA history, signing a free-agent
contract with Seattle worth $35 million over seven years. The
Sonics had just lost in the NBA finals to the Chicago Bulls and saw
McIlvaine as the final piece to their championship puzzle. But they
were mistaken. Inserted into Seattle's starting lineup, McIlvaine's
deficiencies _ little offense, little rebounding _ became glaring,
and he suffered under the spotlight of high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Nets, there are no such expectations. He is a
third-string center who will play 10 to 15 minutes a game and be
asked only to do what he does best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easy when you have a well-defined role and things
are laid out for you,'' McIlvaine said.
</P>
<P>
   After going through the deaths of two close friends _ his agent,
Ron Grinker, and the Washington assistant coach Derek Smith _ in
the last two years, McIlvaine said he believed he was destined to
experience brighter days in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife that I think I've got two basketball angels
looking over me,'' McIlvaine said, ``and wherever I go they'll make
sure everything works out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are hoping that is another McIlvaine prediction that
comes true.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   If MICHAEL CAGE, a 14-year veteran, does not retire and is
waived by Seattle, look for him to fill the Nets' 12th roster spot.
. . .SAM CASSELL left Friday's morning practice early with leg
cramps. It did not appear serious. . . . The Nets' individual game
tickets go on sale next Friday at 9 a.m. at TicketMaster,
TicketMaster On-Line and at the Continental Arena box office.  &QL;

POPE BEGINS FOURTH VISIT OF `THE BLESSED LAND' OF MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
and RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II flew into Mexico's tumultuous
capital Friday to begin his fourth visit to a nation he calls
``always faithful'' to the Roman Catholic creed.
</P>
<P>
   Walking slowly but firmly with the aid of a cane, the
78-year-old pontiff descended from his jet to the sounds of
mariachi music played by a band on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a source of immense pleasure to find myself once again in
this blessed land, where the Holy Mary of Guadalupe is venerated as
a beloved mother,'' said John Paul, referring to Mexico's patron
saint _ the Virgin of Guadalupe _ in his arrival speech before a
large crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic officials hope this papal visit will help set the
church's course in the Americas into the next millenium. John
Paul's church is beset by dropping attendance at Mass, internal
divisions between the conservative hierarchy and grass-roots
Catholics intent on social change, and a growing conversion to
Protestant faiths.
</P>
<P>
   In his arrival remarks, John Paul emphasized the importance of
Catholicism to Mexico following Spain's conquest of the indigenous
nations that once reigned here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't possible,'' John Paul said, ``to understand Mexico
without the faith brought from Spain to these lands.''
</P>
<P>
   In greeting the pope, President Ernesto Zedillo said Mexicans
were ``proud to be a mixture of races, languages and cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Favor us with your message,'' Zedillo told the pope. ``But
also do us the favor of enjoying our colors, our flavors, our
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches, two groups of children _ four of mixed race
and four Indians _ marched solemnly to the seated pope with gifts.
A clearly pleased John Paul affectionately kissed the children on
the cheeks and foreheads, stroked their hair, whispered in their
ears.
</P>
<P>
   Following the ceremony, John Paul rode into the heart of Mexico
City, where he was presented the keys to the city by Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and then into the southern suburbs, where he
was to sleep at the house of the papal nuncio, or Vatican envoy to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people began lining the pope's route
hours before his airplane landed. As news spread that John Paul had
arrived, hundreds of people along one downtown street began
chanting, ``The pope is here. We feel his presence!''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul rode in a glass-sided bus for the trip to the city
center, then switched to the traditional pope mobile, a small truck
with a glass-enclosed platform on which the pontiff sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My batteries are charged and ready,'' said Olga Alegria, who
rode a bus for 36 hours from the northern city of Hermosillo to
stand on a downtown street corner. ``I hope to realize my dream, to
touch the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   As the papal caravan neared, the crowd's excitement surged. Some
people poured into the street, despite heavy security, in hopes of
getting closer to the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited,'' Teresa Contreras, 47, said after John Paul
passed her place on the sidewalk. ``At that moment I was bursting
with love.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic officials have said that the pope's trip to Mexico and
his 30-hour visit to St. Louis next week are meant to emphasize the
Western Hemisphere as a single entity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico to which John Paul arrived Friday has in many ways
changed dramatically since his first visit to the country in 1979.
The population has grown by nearly 30 percent to 95 million, more
than three-quarters of whom live in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The once authoritarian government controlled for 70 years by
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party has grudgingly given
way to a pluralistic system that looks more like democracy with
each election.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old trade pact with the United States and Canada has
brought more prosperity to northern and central cities, while
further eating at the economy of the largely rural and Indian
south. Income levels are skewed between the wealthy few and the
impoverished many.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, the opposition Mexico City mayor who is the political
left's best hope to win presidential elections next year, told the
pope that the two decades since his first visit have brought many
negative social and economic consequences to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in many places, the imposition of anti-social economic
policies during this time has resulted in the sustained fall in
income for the majority of the population,'' Cardenas said in a
dour-faced speech.
</P>
<P>
   The last two decades, he added, have brought a ``constant
increase in the number of Mexicans living in poverty, an
unprecedented concentration of riches in the hands of a few, as
well as the penetration of corruption and the complicity of crime
in the nation's vital (affairs).''
</P>
<P>
   For many, Mexico's new consumer society was starkly evident in
the many billboards, ads and trinkets promoting the companies that
are helping pay for the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent trips to poor countries in Latin America and
Africa, the staunchly anti-communist pontiff has criticized the
unbridled capitalism that has swept most of the world since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-day visit here, John Paul will put his seal of
approval on the results of a meeting of the hemisphere's bishops,
who met last year to chart the Catholic Church's mission in the
region during the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
   In his arrival speech, John Paul said that the bishops hope
their blueprint for action ``responds fully to the redeeming plan
of God and human dignity in the framework of just, reconciled and
open societies with a technical process that must converge with
necessary moral progress.''
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere in Latin America, Protestant faiths during the past
two decades have made inroads into Mexico's once-solidly Roman
Catholic population, especially in the impoverished indigenous
communities of the south. Much of the current social violence in
southernmost Chiapas state, in which rebels have taken up arms
against the government, has divided Maya Indian villages between
Catholic insurgents and pro-government Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul referred to the Protestant conversion Friday by
emphasizing the important contributions that Catholicism has made
to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to their evangelizing effort, which made
Catholicism an integral and fundamental part of the nation's soul,
the (Spanish) missionaries left profound cultural traces and
prodigious examples that today are sources of legitimate pride for
all Mexicans,'' he said at the airport ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will say Mass on Saturday for Catholic clergy at the
Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe near downtown Mexico City.
Catholic faithful believe the church marks the spot where an
olive-skinned Virgin Mary appeared to a poor Indian farmer soon
after the Spanish conquest. A symbol of the mixing of European and
indigenous cultures, the Virgin of Guadalupe has become the patron
saint of Mexico and is revered throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, John Paul will say Mass for the general
population at an automobile race track. On Monday he is to deliver
a message to the hemisphere's youth in the giant Azteca sports
stadium on the city's south side. On Tuesday, the pope is scheduled
to fly to St. Louis.

LIGHTS, CAMERA, APOLOGY: SPREWELL TAKES THE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Calif.) (bl) 
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE BROOK, N.Y. _ Latrell Sprewell's image reclamation project
began Friday afternoon about half past three as a curtain parted
and his lanky figure appeared in tan pants and a peach sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The pastel colors seemed fitting for a man trying to present a
softer side to counter the vision of an angry player known for his
furious dunks and his violent attack on coach P.J. Carlesimo 14
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a half hour, Sprewell sat on a dais and apologized a lot,
smiled a lot and displayed unwavering poise through the stickiest
of questions after he was introduced at a news conference as the
New York Knicks' latest acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   As he paged back to Dec. 1, 1997 _ the day he choked Carlesimo
and left the Golden State practice only to return and threaten his
coach _ he discounted the notion that he had a problem controlling
his rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say I had a bad day,'' said Sprewell, who
is expected to begin practicing with the Knicks on Saturday once
all parties in the trade _ John Starks, Terry Cummings and Chris
Mills, who were sent to Golden State _ pass their physicals.
``That's not me. I don't have a problem. I don't walk around angry.
It's not like every time someone says something to me I get up in
their face. I really wouldn't say I had a problem. I'd say I had a
bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has had a few of those. Last March, Sprewell lost
control of his car and was charged with reckless driving. He was
sentenced to three months of house arrest. On July 31, a federal
judge dismissed his $30 million lawsuit against the NBA, a suit
Sprewell filed with the belief that the league conspired against
him when it handed down a year's suspension that was reduced to
seven months by an arbitrator. He has since re-filed that lawsuit.
In October, Sprewell sued his agent, Arn Tellem, for malpractice
because he failed to negotiate a salary protection clause in his
deal with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell sounded contrite Friday, but expressed no intention of
dropping his pending lawsuits and beginning his second basketball
life completely unencumbered by his past problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize I should have been punished,'' Sprewell said.
``But I felt that the punishment was a bit severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was officially reinstated after a 20-minute meeting
this morning with commissioner David Stern. Sprewell said he
expressed to Stern how wrong he was for his attack on Carlesimo and
reassured him that he would be a positive influence in the NBA.
Friday was the first step in revealing that side of his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real me is the caring person,'' said Sprewell, who is
expected to play in a three-guard lineup. ``It's not the person
that has been portrayed in the media. I'm not someone who has an
attitude problem. I'm not mean. People may think that because of
the aggressive way I play the game. That's just the way I play. I
don't walk around the streets like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would know. Sprewell has been out of the public eye,
spending his basketball exile at his family's home in Milwaukee. It
was the land of home-cooked meals and comfortable surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell is a professional athlete. For him to sit dormant
for a year is like keeping a sports car garaged. Will he sputter or
backfire once he is rolled out onto a showroom floor like Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Although he stayed active with daily weight training at the
closest Bally's sports club, his basketball void was hardly filled.
Most days, he said, he played one-on-one with his brother or jumped
into a pickup game at the YMCA. He was a three-time All-Star
playing with guys on their lunch break. Often, just because he was
the tallest person in the game, at 6 feet 5 inches, Sprewell played
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played against NBA players since December of '97,''
said Sprewell, who rated his playing condition at 7 or 8 on a scale
of 10. ``I'm not going to sit here and say I'm in great playing
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy sat next to Sprewell as the player
talked about his return. Whatever dust was on Sprewell's game, Van
Gundy was excited to have his talent. He said he was especially
impressed with how little Sprewell expressed concerned with playing
time and personal statistics. On first impressions, Van Gundy
viewed this player as an all-star of a coach's dream, not of the
Carlesimo nightmare. On first impressions, Van Gundy seemed
undaunted by the challenge of mixing Sprewell into the team
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Van Gundy said he was neither awed by
Sprewell's polished delivery Friday or skeptical of his sincerity.
He was just realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find him to be very sincere and direct and honest,'' Van
Gundy said. ``But the only way for him to show it is to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; CHRIS DUDLEY &LR;  missed practice Friday because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   _ The league rescinded the latter half of the two-game
suspension the Heat's  &UR; ALONZO MOURNING &LR;  received after his fight
with  &UR; LARRY JOHNSON  &LR; in Game 4 of last year's playoff series.
Neither played in Game 5. After the Knicks advanced past the Heat
in the playoffs, Johnson sat out his second game in Game 1 against
Indiana. Johnson lost $206,000 for those two games.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, who would have been forced to sit out this year's
season opener, saved $161,000.

NYC CONSIDERS PLAN TO SEIZE CARS OF ACCUSED DRUNK DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Legal scholars and criminal lawyers questioned Friday
the legality of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to seize the cars of
people charged with drunken driving, as mayoral aides acknowledged
that city lawyers were still reviewing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Thursday that, starting in
February, officers would seize the car of anyone charged with
drunken driving, including first-time offenders. If the car were
owned by someone other than the accused driver, or if the accused
were eventually acquitted, the car would be returned. Otherwise, it
would be forfeited to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, after meeting with police commissioner, Giuliani
approved the concept of the plan, said Colleen Roche, the mayor's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor and the police commissioner are in complete
agreement about the use of forfeiture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche said city lawyers were still examining some legal
issues and other city officials were reviewing practical matters,
including where all the cars would be stored.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows the forfeiture of vehicles owned by drivers who
repeatedly drive while intoxicated, but the law is rarely enforced.
Safir, in discussing his proposal Thursday, said police would rely
on what he called a creative interpretation of the city's
forfeiture laws, which give officers the authority to seize
property, like firearms, drugs and burglary tools, used in the
commission of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers said Friday that it was uncertain whether the
administrative law could be read to permit the seizure of the car
of a first-time offender _ especially before the person is tried
and convicted. Several lawyers also wondered about the propriety of
seizing a leased car or one that was purchased with a bank loan.
The companies leasing or financing the car might well go to court
to challenge a seizure, saying they owned the car, not the driver,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take on it is that it may be extremely harsh,'' said Burt
Neuborne, a professor of law at New York University Law School.
``One sympathizes with the desire to curb drunk driving, but the
imposition of a forfeiture in a situation like that may really
impose an excessive penalty and may do so without adequate
statutory authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws in 22 states authorize municipal officials to confiscate
the cars of drunken drivers, but virtually all those laws involve
repeat offenders, said officials with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, a federal agency. Federal officials said
they were unaware of any city's using its own laws as the basis for
forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers wondered how the city would store cars while a
driver's case was adjudicated, who would pay for insurance while
the cars were stored and what the city would do if a
drunken-driving case were resolved through a plea bargain, as they
often are.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concerns are, what are the procedural aspects?'' said
Charles Adler, chairman of the criminal law committee of the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York. ``Are people going
to be required to waive their right to return of the car in order
to be able to negotiate the charge? Typically these charges are
negotiated. Very few cases go to trial. Is the routine disposition
of a case going to involve the person giving up the car?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city wants to use that as a deterrent, then it ought to
put in place streamlined procedures that assist people who have
legitimate claims easily and quickly. What concerns me most is:
What are the safeguards for fairness going to be?''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers predicted that first-time offenders would fight the
confiscation of their cars in court. ``I think it's inevitable that
there is going to be litigation,'' said Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other states, it's based upon conviction,'' Siegel said.
``Here, he is seizing this based upon arrest. That undermines the
presumption of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had initially thought that Thursday's announcement was
premature, in part because the city's lawyers had not reviewed the
plan, mayoral aides said. But the mayor evidently became convinced
that Safir's idea was a useful tool to discourage people from
drinking and then driving.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, speaking with reporters after he met with Giuliani at
City Hall, said the initiative would go forward, although he
revised his earlier comments to say that no starting date had been
set. ``We just want to make sure we do this carefully and we do
this correctly,'' he said.

U.S. IS ASKED TO INVESTIGATE ABUSE AT PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ As lawyers of other former inmates came
forward with accounts of what they say is rampant abuse at the
Nassau Correctional Center, Democratic county legislators called
Friday for a federal investigation into the treatment of prisoners
at the jail, where the police say a man was fatally beaten on Jan.
8.
</P>
<P>
   Alleging a number of complaints about corrections officers,
legislators Lisanne Altmann of Great Neck and Roger Corbin of
Westbury asked that the U.S. attorney, Zachary Carter, begin an
investigation of the East Meadow jail, following the Jan. 13 death
of Thomas Pizzuto, a Hicksville man whose family says he was
brutally beaten by guards after demanding to receive methadone
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The call for a wider-ranging federal inquiry, on top of separate
investigations of Pizzuto's death by four local and state agencies,
came as lawyers for a number of former inmates and their families
described life inside the 2,200-bed jail as replete with violence
and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that complaints by inmates as well as
well-meaning guards were discouraged and frequently squashed, and
asserted that a strict code of silence had made it all but
impossible to prosecute abusive guards. Prosecutors investigated 15
complaints by prisoners of abuse last year, which resulted in no
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pizzuto case, law-enforcement officials confirmed that
guards forced the 38-year-old to sign a statement falsely saying
his injuries were accidental; the explanation was that he fell in
the shower, according to the Pizzuto family's lawyer. Investigators
say they have encountered difficulty in obtaining information from
guards who were in a position to see or hear about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau County sheriff, Joseph Jablonsky, refused to be
interviewed Friday. Instead, Jablonsky, who has overseen the Nassau
Correctional Center since 1988, issued a four-sentence statement
saying that the jail ``has a proud record of service,'' and that
``any allegations of improper care will be fully investigated, and
appropriate action will be taken if required.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the corrections officers union, Mark
Barber, conceded that there might have been abuses in the past and
attributed any problems in the culture inside the jail to a failure
by the authorities inside and outside the Sheriff's Department to
investigate allegations thoroughly enough. ``I welcome the Pizzuto
investigation,'' he said, adding that he had instructed all his
members to cooperate with law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for former inmates on Friday described numerous
instances of abuse and neglect at the jail in recent years.
Frederick Brewington, a civil rights lawyer in Hempstead, said that
one of his clients, Gary Boylan, 46, of Hicksville, who suffers
from Parkinson's disease, was ``beaten into a coma'' by guards on
Sept. 14, while he was being held on a charge of reckless
endangerment of a minor, which was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Boylan had suffered a seizure while driving and had asked a girl
``to get help,'' the lawyer said. She misunderstood his plea as
``get in,'' and he was arrested, Brewington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time his mother sees him it's two days later, and
he's in the hospital,'' he said. ``He had hundreds of stitches in
his head. They beat him into a coma that lasted four days. His
face, neck, back, arms _ he was injured all over. People told his
mother that he had a seizure and fell and hurt himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewington said that his client, who suffered permanent head
injuries, had been attacked by guards who should have been
protecting him. ``Somebody in the jail thought he was a child
molester, and they were going to give him an attitude adjustment,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brewington also asserted that prisoners were frequently denied
needed medical treatment. He cited the death last July of
Christopher Jackson, 28, of Locust Valley, a sickle-cell anemia
patient who was awaiting trial on a minor drug charge when he
became ill and lapsed into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Brewington, who is suing the county on behalf of Jackson's

issue a report soon on its inquiry into allegations that Jackson
had asked for treatment but was not hospitalized for three days,
until his mother urged officials to get her son a blood
transfusion.

BOEING SETTLES DISCRIMINATION SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - In what civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson called ``a
significant step on the long journey to making Boeing the best it
can be,'' the aerospace giant Friday announced it has settled two
class-action lawsuits brought by African American workers who said
the company discriminated against them.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson helped negotiate a consent decree filed Friday in
federal court in Seattle. It requires Boeing to pay $15 million to
settle the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing must improve the way it selects and promotes
workers, adopt a new system for handling complaints about
discrimination, harassment or retaliation, and hire a consultant to
assess how well the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made significant progress on every front ... to foster
an environment of inclusion,'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said at
a morning news conference at the company's Seattle headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's settlement represents one more step toward (Boeing)
becoming a company of inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was held in an auditorium where Boeing in
past years has held its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shareholders, this time Condit faced many of the
black employees who brought suit against the company, claiming they
were routinely harassed on the job and lost promotions to
less-experienced white workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also spoke. He first met with Condit last September and
played the key role in the two sides reaching a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing's capacity to do good is enormous,'' Jackson said,
referring to Boeing's position as the world's largest aerospace
company.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in his remarks, Jackson mentioned Airbus, the
European airplane maker that is Boeing's only remaining rival in
building planes with more than 100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inclusion is the key to economic growth,'' Jackson said.
``Let's get together ... then when Boeing meets Airbus in the Super
Bowl it can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking were two Seattle attorneys who represented the
workers who brought suit.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Oscar Desper, said Boeing would be watched closely
to see that it complies with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be around to watch and make sure this consent decree
is just not a piece of paper, but that changes in fact will be
made,'' said Desper, whose father worked for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the 35-page consent degree, Boeing denied it ever
engaged in any pattern of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter why that language is in the decree, Condit
said it was better for Boeing to settle the lawsuits and not spend
time battling in court.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was time for Boeing to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed last year. The initial suit was brought
by 43 black workers who said discrimination was common at Boeing
plants in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, black workers for Boeing in Philadelphia and in Wichita,
Kan., joined in the suit. A second suit also was started. The suits
complained of a racially hostile work environment that saw blacks
the object of slurs, crude drawings and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 13,000 blacks work for Boeing around the country. The
total work force numbers about 228,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, 20,000 current and former
employees of Boeing and its subsidiary companies, including
McDonnell Douglas, would be eligible to share in $7.3 million in
payments.
</P>
<P>
   About half the money, or $3.77 million, will go to 264
individually identified plaintiffs, who generally will get payments
of $10,000 to $30,000, with some individuals getting as much as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   More than $4 million will go to plaintiffs' lawyers for fees and
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also agreed to spend $3.65 million on improved training
and changes in the way it selects managers and makes other
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Desper, the lawyer for the small Seattle firm that brought the
main case, said it was not about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started as a dream for justice. This was for justice. It
was not for the money,'' Desper said, his eyes filling with tears
and his voice breaking with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is just the first step toward reconciliation for all
races of people at The Boeing Co. so that everyone can be treated
the same, from the janitor to the top, whether they are female,
Asian or black ... that you are treated the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the plaintiffs in the Boeing auditorium for the
announcement was Solomon Williams, who has worked at Boeing for 22
years. He is the lead operator of a milling machine at the
company's Auburn plant.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled to reporters how he and other experienced black
workers were passed over for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The promotions went to young white males who had little if any
experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we questioned this, the response was, `We have a gut
feeling they (the white workers) can do the job.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said conditions at his Boeing job site have improved since
the discrimination suit was filed, but not significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they discovered there was a problem, they started making
superficial changes,'' Williams said. ``They made a few more blacks
inspectors, a few more blacks supervisors. But it's not widespread
enough yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Williams said he feels ``vindicated'' by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me want to go and do an even better job, because I
know I will be graded by my performance and not who I play golf
with, who I go hunting with or who I go fishing with. ... If you
were not in the good old boys club, you didn't move ahead.''

   MUSICAL-MAKEOVERS (subslug) (New York) _ The birth of a new
musical: it's all so ``Act One,'' all so invigorating. Hey, hold on
a sec. Did I say new? The show in question is ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' and while the frantic pre-Broadway preparations, with
Bernadette Peters as pistol-packin' Annie Oakley, are indeed
occurring in 1999, the date on the musical's copyright is 1946.
Although it was a critical and popular success in the '40s, running
on Broadway for 1,147 performances, the show, with music and lyrics
by Irving Berlin and book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, has long
been considered unrevivable, in large part because of its
hopelessly outdated portrayal of Indians. The solution that the
show's producers, Fran and Barry Weissler, came up with for ``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' which begins previews on Feb. 2 at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway, is one that has become increasingly common in
musical theater: wholesale renovation. ``Basically, it's a new
book,'' said Peter Stone, the veteran librettist, with credits
stretching from ``1776'' to ``Titanic,'' who was hired to bring the
structure and sensibility of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' into line with
musicals of the late 1990s. By Peter Marks. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STANDUP-COMEDIANS (New York) _ There's only one thing more
humiliating than being a stand-up comic. And that's trying to be a
stand-up comic. That's the lesson I learned after six months trying
to make it as a comedian. Ask Jerry Seinfeld, Rosie O'Donnell or
any successful stand-up: the bottom rung of the comedy ladder can
be uglier, crueler and more demeaning than in any other line of
entertainment _ be it actor, model, musician, writer or clown.
Sexism and racism run rampant, club-owners ask struggling comedians
to scrape gum off the bottom of tables to get a booking,
competition between comics is fierce, and newcomers have to pay to
perform. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   DRY-CLEANING-FILM (Paris) _ Miou-Miou, 48, has appeared in good
films and bad, hits and flops, yet for 25 years France's affection
for her has not wavered. True, being loved has been no guarantee of
good screen roles or healthy box-office returns. Yet, for an entire
generation of French moviegoers, she remains reassuringly familiar.
Her very stage name, Miou-Miou, given to her by a lover when she
was barely 18, makes her sound like the gamine next door. Her
latest film is Anne Fontaine's ``Nettoyage a Sec,''or ``Dry
Cleaning,'' which was well received in France 15 months ago and
opens on Feb. 5 in New York. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-SEX-FILMS (Undated) _ When it comes to issues of sexual
identity, European films can be difficult for American viewers to
talk about or even understand fully. We assume that Europeans,
whose leaders can carry on extramarital affairs without falling
from grace, are more sophisticated, more laissez-faire about sex in
general and, specifically, about the blurring of hetero-, bi- and
homosexuality. But we can't quite figure out how they achieve this
nonchalance. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   BALLET-BRITISH-COLUMBIA (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ Back in
1985, when the latest of a series of West Coast balletic phoenixes
rose tentatively from the ashes of Pacific Ballet Theater, nothing
so ambitious as a passport appeared on the agenda for the new
Ballet British Columbia. It was to be a Vancouver-based company
with a regional mission, to bring ballet to the various centers of
its home province. Less than a decade later, the company was
dancing at Whitman Hall at Brooklyn College, where it was
characterized by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times as ``a
handsome group of 16 classical dancers whose bold demeanor evokes
the tough, frank manner of contemporary ballet troupes in Europe.''
In its return one-week New York engagement starting Tuesday at the
Joyce Theater, the program will consist of contemporary Canadian
works, according to its artistic director John Alleyne. By William
Littler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   AKALAITIS-THEATER (New York) _ Ms. JoAnne Akalaitis, 60, has
been called a theater radical whose work grows increasingly
distilled, profound and challenging, as well as a bloodless
modernist who disrespects Shakespeare, debases the Greeks and
shamelessly distorts Jean Genet and Tennessee Williams. The
symbolist gestures she favors _ sometimes her actors move in a kind
of slow-motion Kabuki style or fall to the ground as if pulled by a
demonic force _ have been celebrated as inspired and decried as
gimmicky. Fans say her penchant for updating classics makes them
see the works anew; critics complain that she has a narrow academic
vision and that her changes are gratuitous and distracting. Ms.
Akalaitis is currently working on the ``The Iphigenia Cycle.'' By
Nancy Hass. (Moved). Photo.

   LONDON-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Sir Colin Davis and the London
Symphony will appear at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for
three concerts focusing on another enigmatic post-Romantic
composer, Sir Edward Elgar. The series, part of a larger festival,
``The Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar,'' presented by Great
Performers at Lincoln Center, opens Sunday afternoon with Elgar's
Introduction and Allegro, and Cello Concerto (with Steven Isserlis
as soloist). By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-SONGS-CLASSES (New York) _ At a lecture before a recent
lieder recital in Los Angeles, Graham Johnson made a case for
balkanizing Schubert, after a fashion. Johnson, a piano
accompanist, scholar and teacher based in London, suggested that
the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by Heine included in the
posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be split off and viewed as
a free-standing work. The idea is vintage Johnson, unconventional
yet compelling. Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a
series of five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing
on German song. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   VERNON-DUKE-MUSIC (Undated) _ There is something so improbably
consoling about the sadness at the heart of the best Vernon Duke
melodies. This redemptive afterglow could be a consequence of sheer
melodic sophistication; Duke knew how to construct a song,
elegantly, with surpassing craft and harmonic flair. An
aristocratic White Russian emigre turned Broadway songwriter, he
seems to have had a rather good time of it all, dressing with
notorious sartorial dash, charming in a polyglot of romance
language chorus girls and theatrical producers alike. Among some of
his popular songs were ``Autumn in New York,'' ``April in Paris''
and ``I Can't get Started.'' By Barry Singer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-INDIAN-ART (Undated) _ Thirty years ago, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art presented a ground-breaking exhibition titled
``Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village.'' Organized by
the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it brought together
work from outside India's ancient classical traditions. Much has
changed since the 1960s. Qualitative distinctions between fine art
and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art is taking its
rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why the small
exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum until Feb. 3, ``Threads of
Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from
the Stella Kramrisch Collection,'' carries a thrill of delight
rather than a shock of surprise. The show is, in a sense, a reprise
of ``Unknown India'' three decades later and in miniature. By
Holland Cotter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-DILBERT (Culver City, Calif.) _ If anyone in the television
industry is afraid of corporate downsizing, it is UPN. The
struggling four-year-old broadcaster is widely seen to be on the
verge of eradication after a string of hitless seasons and notable
public relations fiascoes, like last season's ``Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a very short-lived alleged Civil War satire.
For public consumption, network officials grit their teeth and deny
it, but it is widely believed in the industry that the success or
failure of ``Dilbert'' an animation show by Scott Adams, will be a
definitive marker of UPN's ultimate _ or, ominously, short-term _
viability. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-GUY (Los Angeles) _ One of the things Seth MacFarlane
liked about animation when he was growing up was the way it
elasticized reality. Anvils dropped without consequence and skunks
sang in French, creating a sort of pluperfect pliability where he
could retreat from a world in which people treated him, shockingly,
like a child and enter one where he was in complete control. There,
in the manner of a visiting deity, he spoke for everyone, he had
all the money in the world, and a thought never entered anyone's
head that he didn't put there. This was, of course, perfect
training for Hollywood, where MacFarlane _ now 25, but still
growing _ remains in almost complete control of the new world he
has created: an animated half-hour comedy called ``Family Guy''
that will have its premiere on Fox next Sunday following the Super
Bowl. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FUTURAMA (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ Matt Groening, 44, the
creator of the ``Simpsons'' is preparing to introduce a new series
called ``Futurama.'' The series is scheduled for a March premiere
on Fox. ``Futurama'' is set in the year 3000 in New New York City,
which is built atop the ruins of the original New York. By Anita
Gates. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMEDY (Moscow) _ It's not hard to make fun of what is
happening in Russia these days. New jokes about the new rich (now
the new poor after last summer's sudden financial crisis) are
posted on the Internet. President Boris Yeltsin's fumbling speech
is always an easy laugh. There may be more comedy routines about
bank failures than there are solvent banks in Russia. But real
humor _ the deep, biting, funny-sad satire that makes Russians
laugh, usually at themselves _ has become rarer, or at least so
says Mikhail Zhvanetsky, the country's premier stand-up comedian
and humor writer. By Celestine Bohlen. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NY-RUSSIAN-COMEDIANS (New York) _ Everyone's a comedian. Wander
along the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, as a team of young immigrant
comics does for their twice-monthly television show. Shove a
microphone at any ordinary-looking guy in a fur hat. Has he got a
joke for you? Has he got a joke for you! Humor, the elixir that
helped relieve the aches and pains of life in the former Soviet
Union, has survived the Russian immigrants' voyage to Brooklyn. Not
only are the streets filled with wags; the Russian newspapers are
filled with page after page of jokes. The Russian-language
television and radio station, WMNB, broadcasts two locally produced
comedy shows. Transplanted Russian comics work the private-party
circuit, while the most successful of the New York City immigrant
troupes, Kanotiye, fills the 600-seat National restaurant in
Brooklyn every time the group opens a new variety show. By Susan
Sachs. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MEDIEVAL-ARCADE-ANTIQUES (New York) _ A few months ago, Ward and
Co., New York dealers of ancient and medieval art, sent out a
lavish, fold-out booklet of photographs to display some of the rare
objects from its collection. Most of the objects were from
prehistoric or classical times, but an arresting one was from the
medieval world: an arcade, or arch, from a 12th-century Romanesque
choir screen from the church of the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.
This architectural fragment was enticing because it conjured up an
entire structure yet stood on its own as a piece of sculpture. By
Paula Deitz. (Moved). Photo.

DEVILS WIN SECOND STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey Devils coach Robbie Ftorek evaluates his players over
10-game spans. Although their last 10 games have been their worst
this season, they made it respectable by winning the last two games
of their three-game California trip that was completed at the Forum
in Inglewood, Calif., on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   After losing at San Jose in the opening game of the trip, the
Devils (25-14-5) defeated the Mighty Ducks at Anaheim on Wednesday
night and edged the Los Angeles Kings by 3-2 on Thursday night to
go 4-5-1 in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Although their last two victories came with a great deal of help
from the Mighty Ducks and the Kings, Ftorek gave all the credit to
his players as he summed up the three-game trip following the
narrow victory over the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way we bounced back after losing the first game,''
Ftorek said. ``Yeah, this is the worst 10-game segment, but we made
strides to improve our game. And I think we'll be better once we
get into divisional games.''
</P>
<P>
   He apparently meant conference games because the Devils have
only eight games left against Atlantic Division opponents after the
break for tomorrow's All-Star Game. Knowing that the Devils
traditionally play better against teams in their conference, Ftorek
and the Devils should be pleased going into the All-Star Game
break. The Devils are 9-2-1 against Atlantic Division opponents and
10-7-4 against other Eastern Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will have four representatives at the All-Star Game.
Martin Brodeur will be the starting goaltender on the North
American team, which includes Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain.
Bobby Holik is on the World All-Stars, where Ftorek will serve as
the assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The break will be good for us,'' said Brian Rolston, who has
been playing well in recent weeks and has been given more ice time
by Ftorek. ``It'll give us a chance to rest our bumps and
bruises.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston could have added that it would give the Devils players
time to recover from the flu, which hit at least five members of
the team. Patrik Elias was the worst, missing the last five games,
and he has lost 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, who played nearly 25 minutes against the Kings, took
five shots and assisted on Holik's goal, which gave the Devils the
lead. Scott Niedermayer scored the winner for the Devils, and
Brodeur was brilliant down the stretch. He appears to be in top
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good right now,'' said Brodeur, who made his 14th start
in the last 15 games. ``I hope it continues.''

CONFUSION FOLLOWS FANFARE OVER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET LINK FOR NYC
SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and executives from
Cablevision Systems announced with much fanfare this week that the
company would provide high-speed Internet access to more than 900
public and private schools in the Bronx and Brooklyn, there was
just one problem: Nobody told the teachers, principals and students
who will eventually use it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those principals say their schools do not have enough
computers to take advantage of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nine principals and district superintendents canvassed at
random Friday in the Bronx and Brooklyn districts where Cablevision
plans to install the high-speed cable modems, not one knew when or
how the technology would come to their schools or how it would be
used in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know a lot about it,'' said Alan Fierstein, the
principal at Eugenio M. DeHostos Middle School in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn. ``I saw it on TV the other day. I wasn't notified of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And some principals and Board of Education officials expressed
confusion about how the Cablevision plan would fit in with the
board's efforts to install Internet-ready computers in every public
school by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's something we need in this school or
not,'' said Esther Forrest, the principal at the Bronx New School,
a magnet school emphasizing math and science, when asked about the
Cablevision plan. The Board of Education program, called Project
Smart Schools, equipped each of her classrooms with two Macintosh
computers last year. ``We're already hooked up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   School board officials said they were told almost nothing about
the Cablevision plan. ``We're really left out of the loop on this
whole thing,'' said a Board of Education official who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of classroom technology in October by the journal
Education Week found that students in New York State had less
access to computers and the Internet than their peers nationwide.
And in New York City, many schools have even less. At Public School
155 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, for example, the principal, Stan
Lovelle, said he was pleased to hear of the Cablevision plan but
added that the school had only three Internet-ready computers for
about 800 students.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony Thursday at Intermediate School 220 in Borough
Park, Brooklyn, Cablevision announced that it would wire every
school in its New York City service area _ the Bronx and much of
Brooklyn _ with high-speed cable modems, which operate up to 100
times as fast as telephone-based modems and could connect
classrooms of students to an array of Internet-based educational
tools.
</P>
<P>
   The cable-modem plan is part of the company's operating contract
with the city, but Cablevision says it will go well beyond that
contract. It will also provide the technical infrastructure to
allow teachers to hold classes remotely, through computers, company
officials said. All the schools will be connected to the company's
network by 2003. The company estimated the value of its
contribution at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this to be a long-term partnership, not simply
attaching a wire to the school and moving on,'' said Charlie
Schueler, a spokesman for Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the technical questions, teachers also face other,
perhaps more formidable barriers to turning the Internet's digital
medium into a useful tool for pupils. The problem now, experts
said, is too many connections and not enough content to connect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet right now is more like a multimedia television
set,'' said Frank Moretti, executive director of the Center for New
Media Teaching and Learning at Columbia University. ``There's a
whole level of enterprise that really hasn't taken place yet,'' he
said, especially in the areas of student-oriented software and
curriculum. Cutting-edge hardware is a positive step, Moretti
added, but ``it's not an educational panacea.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many schools, Cablevision may provide a doorway to the
digital world.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Weston, the principal of Paul Robeson High School in Crown
Heights, Brooklyn, said he was unaware of the Cablevision plan but
called it a wonderful idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give my students exposure to the Web and to the
world,'' Weston said. Though the school has 250 computers in
libraries and classrooms, only three can connect to the Internet,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators also noted that as advanced as
Cablevision's high-speed connections may be, unfettered access to
the Internet can actually turn into a liability in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-speed Internet access is wonderful,'' said Nelson Abreu,
the principal of Roberto Clemente Middle School in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But only if it is regulated, he said, adding: ``I would not want
my schoolchildren to have access to the Internet carte blanche. I
don't think any intelligent person would.''

PASSING OF A BLUES LEGEND: NEGLECT DIDN'T STOP CHARLES BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL SELVIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Brown got his second chance.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythm-and-blues pioneer, who died of congestive heart
failure Thursday at 78 in Oakland, Calif., had been all but
forgotten only 15 years ago. But he lived long enough to see honors
heaped on him, to play piano and sing for presidents and kings, and
to acquaint a new generation of blues fans with the works of a
master.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame only
weeks ago, died at Summit Hospital after a battle with heart
disease that left him bedridden for the past three months in a
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he got out of bed long enough to attend a sold-out
benefit on his behalf at the Great American Music Hall in San
Francisco, featuring such friends and fans as Charlie Musselwhite,
Maria Muldaur, Dr. John and Bonnie Raitt. He sat in a wheelchair in
the wings, beaming that contagious smile that lighted dark corners
wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   Rock star Raitt, in fact, played a large role in bringing Brown
back into the spotlight, taking him on her tours as her supporting
act, singing with him on records and generally acting as his
unofficial fan club president.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 15 years ago, Brown had been reduced to working
as a janitor, although he was always careful not to do anything
that might jeopardize his fingers, because even at his lowest ebb
he envisioned a return to the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have been able to work and get close to Charles during our
dual comebacks this last decade is one of my life's greatest
gifts,'' Raitt said.
</P>
<P>
   And return he did. In 1989 he received one of the first awards
from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and played a subsequent
Kennedy Center concert in Washington, D.C. In 1997 at the White
House, President Clinton presented him with the Heritage Fellowship
of the National Endowment for the Arts. He won awards all over the
country and even found himself schmoozing with Clinton in 1995
during a break at the wedding of Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson at
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The rock world awakened to Brown's return and paid its respects.
Eric Clapton asked him to New York for a recording session. Elvis
Costello wrote a song especially for him to record. Van Morrison, a
fan who turned up at various Brown appearances, used him as a
pianist on a John Lee Hooker record Morrison produced.
</P>
<P>
   His first time around, Brown was a king of the segregated black
music world. In the days immediately after World War II, he became
a phenomenon with the smash hit ``Driftin Blues,'' with Johnny
Moore's Three Blazers, when trade magazines still called
rhythm-and-blues records race music.
</P>
<P>
   His smooth, elegant vocal style became a touchstone for young
singers, and many black performers such as Ray Charles and Sammy
Davis Jr. began their careers doing little more than Charles Brown
impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he dashed off a Christmas song and sold the rights for
$35. The song, ``Merry Christmas Baby,'' grew to rival ``White
Christmas'' over the next half-century, with versions recorded by
Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Otis Redding, Bruce Springsteen and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Brown is like Ben Webster on the tenor _ they both got
air to spare,'' said record producer Jerry Wexler, who supervised
historic sessions with Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and others.
</P>
<P>
   Brown left Moore in 1948 and quickly established himself as one
of the leading solo artists in the burgeoning rhythm-and-blues
field.
</P>
<P>
   His star dimmed through the '50s, although he managed to lodge
one more Christmas record, ``Please Come Home for Christmas,'' on
the charts in 1961, a song that was later revived by the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Brown landed in the East Bay, playing an organ in
1971 at the basement nightclub in Oakland's then-decrepit
California Hotel, he was a forgotten figure. In 1976, when Tom
Mazzolini, producer of the San Francisco Blues Festival, booked
Brown for the annual event, the singer was living in a dump in San
Francisco and playing at a small neighborhood bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was interested in Charles Brown at all,'' Mazzolini
said. ``He turned off to the music business. Charles was just
hanging. His career was nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And when guitarist Danny Caron heard Brown perform at a small
Oakland nightclub in 1987, the singer was living on his Social
Security and was musically rusty from inactivity. Caron steered
Brown back into a productive and prosperous musical career at a
time when most people his age had retired.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a senior citizens' housing center in downtown
Berkeley. When the money started rolling in during the past decade,
as he and his band started playing European jazz festivals and
prestige nightclub dates around the country, he moved out of his
studio apartment and into one of the fancier one-bedroom units
downstairs. He also moved up from the $2 window at the Golden Gate
Fields racetrack in Albany, Calif., where he could customarily be
found every day.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was a kind, gentle man with a deep, slow-rolling voice, as
remarkable in conversation as singing. He had a million stories, a
never-ending reservoir of long, involved tales featuring the greats
and near-greats of show business. He liked to practice piano in the
early morning hours, often playing classical works by Debussy,
Ravel or Liszt, whom Brown called ``a showoff pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   He never expressed the slightest bitterness over the harsh
treatment life handed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think over the mistreatments I've had,'' he said in an
interview 11 years ago. ``'Cause I've had a wonderful life.''

PHOENIX AREA GOES CAR CRAZY WITH CLASSIC AUTO AUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The traffic is heavy, but certainly not boring.
There's a gleaming Cadillac from the '50s, looking all big and
chunky next to the modern compact cars.
</P>
<P>
   A high-performance 1969 Chevy Camaro, painted bright yellow,
rumbles along noisily. A car-carrier totes a black-and-white
Studebaker high above the gridlock. And, amazingly, a valuable
Ferrari Testarossa goes skittering by in the opposite direction
with a smoky roar, it's rear haunches looking impossibly wide.
</P>
<P>
   Must be auction time.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every January, when the big classic car auctions come
rolling in. The Phoenix area goes bonkers for vintage vehicles of
every shape and stripe, with old classics, sports cars, even
antique pickup trucks, seeming to come out of the woodwork. Many
sit on the side of the road wearing ``For Sale'' signs, their
owners eager to cash in on the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper's classifieds, the usual single column of
classic vehicle ads suddenly blossoms into nearly two full pages.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend is the big one, the Barrett-Jackson Classic Car
Auction and Exposition, once a minor Scottsdale event that in the
past 28 winters has grown into an international classic-car fest of
multimillion-dollar proportions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120,000 people are expected to wander through the rows
of veteran vehicles up for auction at WestWorld in north
Scottsdale. About 800 cars and trucks are lined up, everything from
old Fords and Chevys to exotic Bugattis, Ferraris and Duesenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd is a significant smattering of millionaires and
well-known celebrities, such as TV star Tim Allen, who has a Shelby
Mustang up for auction, and Peter Fonda, who is hawking a replica
of his famous Captain America custom Harley-Davidson, made famous
in the '60s film classic, ``Easy'' ``Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Exposition tent are the real high-roller cars, displayed
with frightening price tags on their windshields. These are the
thoroughbreds, the big classic Packards and Cadillacs from the
'30s, one-of-a-kind custom Rolls-Royces and Mercedes-Benzes, garish
concept cars, rare Europeans and some real pieces of automotive
history.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra's T'bird is there, a 1956 two-seater painted the
same custom slate grey in which Frank himself ordered it. It's
flanked by two other automotive members of the notorious Rat Pack
that once roamed Las Vegas: a 1962 Dual Ghia that belonged to Dean
Martin (martini bar not included) and a custom-bodied 1964
Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III that Sammy Davis Jr. tooled around in.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees, Frank's wheels are the hottest. Ordinarily, a
restored '56 Thunderbird would be parked down on the polo field
with the rest of the semi-affordable iron. But Sinatra's cachet
boosts the value immeasurably, turning a $35,000 classic into a
six-figure collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   The original invoice with Sinatra's name on it is propped up in
the front seat, next to the album cover for the LP record, ``Come
Fly With Me.'' The original price, with all the options and extras,
came to $3,146. ``It's going to bring an inordinately high
amount,'' said Dave Dubie, a Scottsdale classic-car professional
who's working at the Exposition tent. ``It's going to shock
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other T'bird, I don't care how nice it is, would never
bring more than $40,000, maybe $50,000. But with this chemistry,
with Sinatra's name attached to it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Dubie shrugs. Auction officials expect the Sinatra 'Bird to
bring well in excess of $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it goes with so many of the vintage cars, how
the celebrity touch or some other piece of historic magic boosts
the value of an automobile. Two years ago, Jerry Seinfeld sold a
1954 Porsche 356 Speedster for a record price: $82,950.
</P>
<P>
   At this auction, John Lennon's Roll-Royce limousine is up for
sale. And Fonda is expected to autograph the gas tank of the
Captain America chopper for whomever is fortunate enough to win it.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding reaches a fevered pitch as people vie for their
hearts' desires. Friday morning, an automobilia auction is under
way. People are in hot pursuit of old automotive artworks, toys and
collectibles, some going for top dollar, some surprisingly cheap.
</P>
<P>
   There, up on the big auction stage where thousands of expensive
cars have gone on the block, a veteran classic-car auctioneer holds
up a small metal toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I bid for this exquisite Rolls-Royce Dinky toy, only
missing one headlight?''
</P>
<P>
   It sold for 50 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Katz of Boston was waiting in line to claim his automobilia
prize, as pair of 1920s car trunks, the kind that fastened to racks
at the rear of automobiles in the days before cars had built in
trunks. He crowed about paying just $200 for something that easily
could have gone five times that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stole them, a hundred bucks apiece,'' Katz said. ``I have a
'24 Packard coupe and a '30 Packard rumble-seat roadster, and these
will go great on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said he travels to Scottsdale every year for the auction.
This year he was here to buy _ what else? _ another Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Also waiting to pick up his automobilia was Jerry Capizzi of
Chicago, who had paid $40 for a simple brass oil can, vying for it
only because it was embossed with the Ford logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Ford fanatic,'' Capizzi said. ``I have Ford blue in my
veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Out among the expensive automotive jewels are quite a few
automobiles that regular folk can afford. Old Fords, small British
and Italian sports cars, befinned '50s behemoths, even Volkswagen
Beetles and a restored microbus will cross the block.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great opportunity to pick up a gem, or get a bit too
caught up in things and end up with a real expensive white
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For Cameron
Thieriot of Occidental, Calif., his auction prize was a Porsche,
but not quite what you'd expect.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 1962 Porsche diesel tractor, 15 horsepower, painted red
and described in the auction literature as ``very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would someone travel from Occidental, Calif., to buy a
Porsche tractor at auction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to paint it a Porsche color,'' Thieriot said, ``and
use it for my vineyard.'' &QL;

GOVERNOR ACCELERATES IMPROVEMENT PLANS FOR SOUTHLAND FREEWAY
INTERCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At Gov. Gray Davis' urging, a plan to ease
gridlock on the 101-405 freeway interchange will be moved up by at
least a year so construction could begin by early 2001, state
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to add a lane to the connector road from the
northbound San Diego Freeway to the eastbound Ventura Freeway and
build another on the northbound 405 from Mulholland Drive to
Ventura Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   State Transportation Commissioner David Fleming predicted that
the improvements will sharply reduce congestion on California's
fourth-busiest interchange, which was designed 44 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step. Clearly, it's going to eliminate half or more
of this gridlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With strong support for the improvements from L.A.-area
legislators, Davis has recognized that congestion on the 101-405
freeway interchange must be solved, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Davis has outlined the need to update California's
transportation system, it's one of his priorities, and the 101-405
interchange is one of the busiest in the state,'' said Chris
Campana, spokesman for the governor. ``Right now, money is
available, and I think today's action is an indication that funds
will be moving more quickly to critical projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Harris, director of the state Department of
Transportation's District 7, which includes Los Angeles County,
said Davis and area leaders pushed for the project to move faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the direction of Gov. Davis, Caltrans is stepping up its
efforts and commitment to provide congestion relief to the
motorists using the 101-405 interchange,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Caltrans, adding lanes to the interchange would
cost an estimated $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration feels confident that the projects will be
funded,'' Harris said. ``So why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans' move follows a Metropolitan Transportation Authority
committee's unanimous vote Thursday to contribute a 20 percent
match to the $14 million proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The California Transportation Commission still must approve the
project, but Fleming said that is a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Provided the project does not need a more detailed environmental
impact study, the two widening projects could be completed within
18 months, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Also strongly pushing for acceleration of the project were
Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles; state Sen. Richard Alarcon,
D-Pacoima; and Maria Contreras-Sweet, secretary of the state's
Business, Transportation and Housing Agency
</P>
<P>
   ``This is major, major progress by Gov. Davis in less than a
month,'' said Knox, who was recently named chairman of a special
Assembly committee that will study the 101-405 congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Knox also credited the public for putting pressure on
transportation officials. ``The public response has been absolutely
overwhelming,'' Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   Knox and Fleming said legislation is needed to allow emergency
improvements at congested interchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the transportation system was a hospital in California,
we've got a hospital without an emergency room. We need to build
emergency facilities for people who are in critical condition,''
Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be elective surgery. It's going to require
some immediate first aid _ and that's what we're trying to do,''
Fleming said. ``There has to be long-range solutions, as well as
short-range _ to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Caltrans will begin the design and
environmental review of proposed improvements to the clogged
interchange, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps will overlap: Caltrans will begin the environmental
review at the same time it does preliminary engineering for the
design of the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the environmental document phase precedes the
preliminary engineering phase, said Harris, who added that no
environmental rules will be relaxed.

 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, sought an
emergency court order Friday to compel Monica Lewinsky to submit to
interviews over the weekend by House prosecutors in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought the order at the request of Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, after Ms. Lewinsky refused to meet
with the House managers last week. Chief Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson of U.S. District Court, who held a closed hearing Friday
afternoon, was still considering the request late Friday evening,
said Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge grants the order, Ms. Lewinsky would face intense
questioning over the weekend. The House prosecutors, or managers,
believe that answers could be pivotal as the Senate decides early
next week whether to question witnesses or decide Clinton's fate
without witnesses, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting down to the point where we need to know who
we're going to call and why we're going to call them,'' McNulty
said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the week drew to a close and the White House defense team
finished its presentation, the House managers faced increasing odds
against calling witnesses. The situation grew more questionable
Friday as prominent senators, like Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called for
a quick end to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces two articles of impeachment, voted by the House of
Representatives a month ago, that accuse him of perjury and
obstruction of justice. The articles say he lied about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and engaged in illegal maneuvers to
have friends and aides cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky and Starr reached an agreement last July giving her
immunity from prosecution, provided that she answer questions
truthfully. She was interviewed extensively by grand jurors and
Starr's prosecutors, and her testimony about her relationship with
the president was the foundation for much of Starr's case against
him. The House managers also leaned heavily on Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony to try to show that Clinton lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem that she has already been asked every
conceivable question by Starr's prosecutors, and that nothing new
could be gleaned from her recollections, the House prosecutors want
to question her nonetheless. Hyde, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, went to Starr because, as the official who
reached the immunity agreement with Ms. Lewinsky, he is its chief
enforcer, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, McNulty said, Ms. Lewinsky ought to fear nothing
from House questioners _ assuming she tells the truth _ because her
immunity agreement covers anything she might say, her lawyer's
misgivings notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity agreement calls upon Ms. Lewinsky to testify
truthfully before grand juries, trial juries ``and in any other
executive, military, judicial or congressional proceedings.'' As
for debriefings, the agreement specifies that they will be
conducted by Starr's office and before ``attorneys, law enforcement
agents, and representatives of any other institutions'' as his
office requires.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion before Judge Johnson, Starr asserted in part:
``The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its motion to
call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House has stressed its
need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors' sense of urgency becomes clear when
the impeachment timetable is analyzed. If, as expected, there is a
motion in the Senate early next week to dismiss the case against
the president, the House prosecutors want to be able to argue
against it based on whatever new nuggets they can wrest from Ms.
Lewinsky's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if the motion to dismiss the case is defeated _ as
head-counters think it would be, given the Republicans' 55-45
advantage in the Senate _ Republicans would want to use those
nuggets to support their arguments that witnesses should be called.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Starr's motion, at Hyde's request, before Johnson was
almost literally an 11th-hour attempt. Should the judge not grant
the motion, Republicans would lose their last big opportunity to
gauge what Ms. Lewinsky might say on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Starr's office on Thursday, Plato Cacheris and
Jacob Stein, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, said it would be inappropriate
for their client to be ``placed in the position of a partisan,''
meeting with Republicans but not Democrats in the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Starr's office Friday, Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers
said their client would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed. But
they said they were not persuaded by Starr's assurances that the
independent counsel's office could guarantee her immunity before
Congress despite the agreement of last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyers also contended that her obligation to submit to
questioning would be void if the independent counsel were acting as
an agent for another entity.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Starr said Ms. Lewinsky could insist that his
office supervise debriefings by the House managers. But he rejected
any suggestion that his office would be acting as ``an agent'' for
them.
</P>
<P>
   His office, Starr said, ``has its own, continuing duty to
provide the House with information relating to impeachment'' and
was not acting as an agent for anyone. In any event, he said, the
immunity agreement allows the independent counsel's office to
subject Ms. Lewinsky to questioning not only on its own behalf but
on behalf of ``representatives of any other institutions as the OIC
may require.''
</P>
<P>
   One official close to the proceedings insisted there was still
information that Ms. Lewinsky could provide, contradictions she
might resolve. As an example, he noted her recollection that the
president's personal secretary came to her apartment at 2 p.m. on
Dec. 28, 1997, to retrieve gifts the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cellular-phone logs show the secretary, Betty Currie, called
Ms. Lewinsky at 3:30. Perhaps, the official suggested, Ms. Lewinsky
would recall, after her memory was jogged, that Ms. Currie came by
closer to 4 p.m., a two-hour difference that could be crucial in
showing motive and intent.

NEW COACH WILL TRY TO SELL ISLES ON TRAPPING DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Coach Bill Stewart turned around the St. John
Flames, taking them from the basement of the American Hockey League
to Calder Cup contenders in one season. His formula for success was
simple: defense, defense, defense.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who replaced Mike Milbury as head coach of the New York
Islanders on Thursday, may be in the National Hockey League now,
but his philosophy is the same. ``I think you have to have a system
if you don't have the most talented team,'' Stewart said after his
debut, a 5-2 victory over the Penguins in Pittsburgh. ``You have to
do what suits your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart prefers the word ``system'' to ``neutral-zone trap,''
but the object is the same. The object is to strangle the
opposition by cutting off the passing lanes and forcing turnovers
in the neutral zone. This defensive strategy is often used by teams
with limited talent.
</P>
<P>
   The St. John Flames followed Stewart's blueprint, improved 27
points in the standing last season and recorded the lowest
goals-against average in the history of the AHL. But for Stewart's
system to be effective in the NHL, players like Zigmund Palffy,
Mariusz Czerkawski and Robert Reichel have to buy into it. If they
don't, the result will be the same as it was for the Islanders last
season, when they did not make the playoffs and coach Rick Bowness
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart did not have enough time to install his system before
Thursday's game. But when the Islanders (14-29-3) return from the
All-Star Game break on Monday, Stewart will begin the hardest sell
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who is negotiating a two-year contract with the
Islanders, played 10 seasons as a defenseman in the NHL, with
Buffalo, St. Louis, Toronto and Minnesota. He is considered to be a
good communicator, and very intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a bunch of misfits to want to play,'' said the
Islanders' Steve Webb, who played for Stewart at Muskegon of the
Colonial League during the 1995-96 season. ``It was amazing what he
did there.''

FUNK LEADS HOPE CLASSIC BY A STROKE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Ten years ago, Fred Funk was a 32-year-old
golf coach at the University of Maryland hoping to reach the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Call Funk a late bloomer. Call him determined. But 10 years
after finally making the tour, Funk has evolved into one of the
game's most consistent players, and he has begun 1999 as if it
might be a career-best year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a two-stroke lead, Funk shot a
six-under-par 66 to maintain a one-stroke lead through three rounds
of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Funk stood at 17 under par (199)
for the five-day, 90-hole tournament, one stroke ahead of Steve
Pate, and two strokes ahead of both John Daly and Tom Pernice Jr.
</P>
<P>
   For Funk, it was a continuation of strong early-season play. He
has broken 70 in eight of his 11 rounds this year. He tied for
fifth place at the season-opening Mercedes Championships and tied
for 12th last week at the Sony Open in Hawaii. Having already won
$147,550 this year, Funk is eyeing this weekend's $540,00
first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, making the tour was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are to improve each year, and so far I've been
able to do it,'' said Funk, who earned a career-best $1.21 million
last year. ``No question I'm a late bloomer. I wasn't that good
when I was in my 20's. In college, as a junior player, I just
wasn't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were ideal today. Jonathan Kaye set the course record
with a 10-under-par 62 at Tamarisk Country Club, one of four
courses on which the tournament is being played. Kaye broke the
previous record of 63, set by Johnny Miller and matched by Bob
Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Birdies could be had and Funk took advantage at the Palmer
Course at PGA West. He had an eagle, seven birdies, a bogey and a
double bogey. Instead of losing his composure after a bad hole,
Funk responded. After he three-putted for bogey at No. 1, Funk made
an eagle at the par-5, 514-yard No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Funk was tested again at the par-3 No. 5, when he missed the
green with his tee shot, chipped on, then three-putted for a double
bogey. But he regained his momentum, playing six under par over the
final 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key stretch of my tournament,'' Funk said. ``I
turned the whole tournament back into a positive when I was going
the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly also remained in the hunt with a 66 at Indian Wells Country
Club. Having not won an official event since the 1995 British Open,
Daly is eager. ``I think I'm due,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, with two rounds left, nothing has been finalized, and a
host of players entered the weekend with a legitimate chance to
win. One player to watch will be David Duval, the tour's hottest
player, who moved into a tie for sixth place (11 under par) after
shooting a 64 at Indian Wells. Duval has eight victories in his
last 27 starts. If Duval remains in contention into Sunday's final
round, no one will have more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Funk also likes his chances. He played in Sunday's final
twosome with Duval at the Mercedes Championships, and though Duval
pulled away and won the tournament by nine strokes, Funk learned
from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty good, and I felt comfortable,'' Funk said. ``I
just didn't putt well that day. Even though I don't have the game
David Duval has, I can beat anybody on a given day.''

MANY THINK DRIVING UNSAFE, WITH THEMSELVES PLAYING A ROLE, SURVEY
FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget crime, it's down sharply. Americans' big
worry these days is driving _ 98 percent of the nation's drivers
want something done about the threat to their personal safety posed
by speeding and unsafe driving.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Friday by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration found concern about unsafe and aggressive
driving is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, those surveyed admitted they too were part of the
problem _ entering intersections as signals turned red, rolling
through stop signs and speeding on freeways.
</P>
<P>
   The results back what California Highway Patrol and local police
officers are already doing: cracking down on motorists who make
streets and highways more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to community meetings all the time and it's kind of
amazing,'' said Sgt. Michael Harrington, motor supervisor for the
Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``With gangs, narcotics, robberies, all these other issues that
we would think would be quality-of-life issues, usually what comes
up first in these meetings is traffic. They are concerned with the
speed on their streets and the safety of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dominguez of Lancaster, Calif., agreed with those surveyed
who said more people are driving more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some days they just try to run you off the road,''
Dominguez said of his daily drive to work. ``You're not fast enough
when they're coming up on your tail. Too slow is 65.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released at the start of a two-day symposium on
aggressive driving, was conducted in two parts by telephone in 1997
to learn more about the public's experiences and beliefs. A total
of 6,000 interviews were completed with drivers 16 and older. One
focused on speeding and one on other forms of unsafe driving.
</P>
<P>
   The results led federal transportation officials to assert their
commitment to stricter enforcement of the nation's traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressive driving patterns, such as speeding and red-light
running, are violations of the law, and this symposium will
consider how the courts can best enforce them and thus improve
safety for all motorists,'' said Rodney E. Slater, U.S.
transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the respondents reported that they see
vehicles traveling at unsafe speeds all or most of the time they
drive on residential streets, and interstate and non-interstate
highways.
</P>
<P>
   The other types of unsafe driving they encounter on the roads
they regularly drive are: cars weaving in and out of traffic, 24
percent; tailgating, 17 percent; driver inattention, 15 percent;
unsafe lane changes, 10 percent; unsafe passing, 9 percent;
ignoring stop signs, 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One-third said it was more dangerous now. The reasons they gave
were: more traffic and cars, 33 percent; careless and inattentive
drivers, 20 percent; faster drivers, 18 percent; increased speed
limits, 16 percent; aggressive driving, 14 percent; young drivers,
10 percent; and drunk drivers, 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about aggressive driving specifically, 30 percent
thought drivers in their area were driving a lot or somewhat more
aggressively than a year ago. Speeding and unsafe driving actions
by other people were considered major threats by 61 and 66 percent,
respectively, of those questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The potential perils of driving from the L.A. suburb of Woodland
Hills to Redondo Beach four days a week on the perpetually packed
San Diego Freeway drives Bonnie Dirks to be a particularly
defensive driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many cars. The changing the lanes or trying to get
ahead is a concern,'' Dirks said. ``They're all huffing and
puffing, and are usually on the phone telling people they will be
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorists surveyed also acknowledged that they can be part of
the problem. About two-thirds reported they at least occasionally
exceed what they consider to be the maximum safe speed on roads
they regularly use.
</P>
<P>
   The leading violations admitted by those surveyed were: entering
an intersection just as the light was turning red, 30 percent;
slowing, but not completely stopping at a stop sign, 26 percent;
and driving 10 miles per hour over the speed limit on an
interstate, 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Getting motorists to admit speeding or unsafe driving is an
important element in making streets and highways safer, said
Officer Ed Sandoval with the Glendale regional office of the
California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval seems to always find signs of hope when teaching
traffic school to motorists eligible for the diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to them, the majority of them are there for speed.
I always ask them, How many of you felt that you deserved more
tickets than you have at this present time, and everybody raises
their hand,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're aware of their habits and that there are times they
are out there contributing to the problem.''

A PLAYER'S UNSETTLING END LEAVES QUESTIONS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa., Texas)   By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ After the death of her parents, Katrina
Price did as she always had done to salve her soul in times of
trouble: she turned to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The sport was both her passion and emotional outlet from the
moment she began playing the game as a young girl on the
playgrounds of Waco, 150 miles from here. Basketball remained with
her through high school in Bellmead, Texas, where she was an
academic and athletic standout, through college at Stephen F.
Austin State University, where she again starred on the court and
in the classroom, then began her pro career with the Philadelphia
Rage of the American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the court, I can block everything out,'' the
5-foot-10-inch guard often told friends and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the ABL abruptly shut down. Price, at 23, found
herself for the first time facing life without the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday she died of a gunshot wound to the head in an
apartment she shared with a sister here. The police believe she
shot herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her family and many in this small east Texas community known for
its piney woods, collegial atmosphere and American Indian name, are
grief-stricken and stunned. They also wonder whether the prospect
that she might never play again competitively _ and never to redeem
what had been an unimpressive rookie year _ may have been too
daunting for her to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had so many mountains to climb with losing both of
our parents,'' Glenda Shead, one of the nine sisters, said Tuesday
in an interview with The Associated Press. ``She was not busy
playing basketball anymore and I think she had some time to think
about everything that had happened to her. We just didn't know
something like this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also speculate what happened to Price, the high school
salutatorian who graduated from college cum laude with a bachelor's
degree in education and a player whose numerous accolades included
career scoring leader at Stephen F. Austin, a USA Today
all-American and the seventh overall draft pick of the ABL last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the popular 5-foot-10-inch player known as Sugar, a
nickname included in her obituary and one that befitted her
on-court style as well as her demeanor, has left many here,
including the police, with unsettling thoughts and unanswered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Price reportedly left two notes addressed to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Armor Webb, 25, befriended Price when the two played for
opposing junior high school teams and the two became best friends
when they played together at Stephen F. Austin a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lying awake at night thinking about the last time we
talked,'' Armor Webb recently said at a restaurant near where she
works as the director of cardiac rehabilitation at a doctor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right before we played Northwestern State,'' she said
of the game the Stephen F. Austin women played on Saturday. ``I
asked her about the ABL folding and she said, `Man, I don't want to
talk about it.' But the tone she used wasn't _ what _ down or
anything. It was just Katrina talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Armor Webb has replayed that conversation and others over in her
head to try to make sense of her friend's death. For instance, she
noticed that Price had recently lost weight. She asked about it but
Price shrugged it off, saying she had been working off a few pounds
in order to get quicker on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had been anyone other than Katrina, it may have
worried me,'' said Armor Webb. ``In hindsight, maybe I should have
asked more about the ABL, but Katrina was also a private person. In
all the years I've known her, I can't say whether or not she had a
boyfriend. But believe me, no one would have thought she was
capable of something like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Basketball was the thread that bound Price and her eight sisters
together, especially after their parents' deaths, her mother,
Daisy, of cancer in 1993 and her father, Leo, of a heart attack her
senior year in college. The sisters, ranging in ages from 20 to 40,
were her biggest fans and often attended games, even those hours
away from the university.
</P>
<P>
   Price, who had received her undergraduate degree in kinesiology
in 1998, had enrolled in Stephen F. Austin to pursue a master's
degree in education
</P>
<P>
   Around 5 a.m. last Monday, a despondent Price reportedly
telephoned Shead in Kilgore, Texas, telling her she was deeply
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Price apparently had composed herself after the hourlong
conversation and told her sister she was going back to bed,
according to Armor Webb. Approximately one hour later, Price's
younger sister, Lucrettia, was awakened by the sound of a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived around 7 a.m. and found Price's body in a
bedroom. A shotgun was under her body.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ralph Ervin, one of several Nacogdoches police officers
conducting the investigation into Price's death, said the police
believed the fatal shot was self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find out how she came into the possession of a
shotgun,'' said Ervin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is legal in Texas to possess a shotgun similar to
the one found next to Price, the police are attempting to discover
where the weapon was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it has for so many in this city, Price's death has
touched even professionals like Ervin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two numbers that have been going through my head
these past few days are 23 and 44,'' said Ervin, referring to
Price's age and team jersey number. ``I saw her play. She was an
extremely talented young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 people attended a memorial service held in Bellmead,
last night at La Vega High School, Price's alma mater. Among those
seated on the stage in the school auditorium was the mayor of
Bellmead, who read a proclamation from the city council declaring
Friday as a day of mourning for Katrina Rosha Price, the
superintendent of schools in La Vega and several members of a local
school board.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the audience were classmates, parents, teachers and
basketball fans. Many of them broke down when one of the Price
sisters began screaming while a soloist sang ``Wing Beneath My
Wings,'' a song that pays tribute to those who willingly avoid the
limelight and let other share the glory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday friends, relatives and fans will gather for her
funeral. Saturday's game between the Lady Jacks and the University
of Texas at Arlington was postponed due to another tragedy. The son
of the Texas-Arlington coach, Eddie McCarter, was killed during a
carjacking in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Armor Webb plans to attend the service in Oakwood although she
knows it will not bring the closure she is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never know what happened to Katrina,'' said Armor Webb,
currently on the Stephen F. Austin team and Price's best friend.
``The only thing I can think of is that maybe she felt everything
was going to be all right now because she was going to be with her
mom and dad.'' &QL;

INS SPEEDS UP PROCESS OF APPROVING APPLICANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When legal U.S. residents were faced with losing
federal benefits, L.A.-area resident Miguel Contreras Vallarta
decided it was time that he became a U.S. citizen. But he had one
major worry.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, who emigrated from Mexico, had heard the horror
stories of friends who applied for citizenship only to wait as long
as two years before the Immigration and Naturalization Service
processed their paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to measures adopted by the INS to address the
nationwide backlog of 1.8 million people waiting to become
Americans, immigrants like Contreras are waiting dramatically
shorter periods and are, in fact, naturalizing ahead of those
applicants caught in the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I was lucky ... the process wasn't delayed,'' said
Contreras, 30, who waited about 10 months before taking his
citizenship oath last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy because I've been in this country for 16 years,
and I wanted to take advantage of the situation since they were
taking away benefits from residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agencies like the San Juan Macias Orientation
Immigrant Center in Pacoima, an L.A.-area suburb, said the reduced
waiting period is unprecedented. Immigrants who applied at the
center's citizenship drive last May are today U.S. citizens,
according to center spokesman Felipe Kofman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as new applicants are concerned, the steps that the INS
has taken are incredible from what they were,'' Kofman said.
</P>
<P>
   Measures the INS has implemented to reduce the backlog _ which
in the Los Angeles district numbers at 382,500 applications _
include hiring 300 employees nationwide to ensure applications are
complete, creating a national telephone customer service center and
computerized fingerprinting services, and centralizing the INS' 25
million paper files to reduce retrieval time.
</P>
<P>
   While computerized fingerprinting services have allowed the INS
to speed up the citizenship process, that same automated system is
causing problems in the process as well.
</P>
<P>
   This month, INS service centers mistakenly sent 5,000 notices
nationwide informing applicants who filed before an increased
naturalization fee took effect that they owed an additional $130
and that their citizenship process would be delayed until they
paid.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenship processing fee hike from $95 to $225 went into
effect Jan. 15. In fact, those applicants, 2,500 of whom reside in
the INS Los Angeles District, did file before Jan. 15 and were only
obligated to pay the $95 fee, said Jane Arellano, assistant
district director for adjudications in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an automated system error, and possibly somebody wasn't
careful when they generated the notices,'' Arellano said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The INS plans to send a second notice after Feb. 1 informing
applicants that the proper fee was received, that the application
process will continue and that no additional money is required,
Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving 30 of these notices for applicants who
filed from the San Juan Macias center, Kofman said his office was
flooded with phone calls from concerned applicants this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably going to be a lot of folks who didn't apply
at a center like our own, and when they receive the notice, they'll
be totally shocked,'' said Kofman, who advised applicants to keep
the notices as proof of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Kofman's center has also received calls from applicants caught
in the backlog who are displeased that newer applicants are being
processed faster. Arellano said the INS did not intend to process
applicants out of turn and is remedying the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We identified that July 1998 filings were getting scheduled
for interviews, but we've since stopped that because we do want
backlogs and older cases to have precedence,'' Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
   Applications weren't being processed chronologically because the
fingerprints of older cases were outdated and had to be refiled,
Arellano said. In addition, criminal records, required of all
applicants, are often difficult to obtain and delay the process for
the backlogged applicants. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a small, but increasingly important, number of
Republicans expressing reservations about the wisdom of calling
witnesses, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a leading authority on Senate
traditions, said on Friday that President Clinton's impeachment
trial should come to a swift end, and he announced that he would
offer a motion to dismiss the charges next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the necessary two-thirds for conviction
are not there and that they are not likely to develop,'' Byrd said
in a one-page statement, adding, ``I do not believe that witnesses
will add anything of consequence to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the
Judiciary Committee, said the Senate should wait until witnesses
were deposed before deciding whether the trial should be halted.
But if it is clear then that the constitutionally required
two-thirds vote to convict and remove the president cannot be
found, he said, the Senate should simply adjourn the trial. He said
the Senate would not need a censure but would ``acknowledge that
the impeachment vote in the House is the highest form of
condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither proposal won quick support from the other
party, the two senators' comments suggested that the Senate's
center of gravity was shifting as the body appeared hungrier than
ever for a graceful exit from a potentially prolonged trial.
</P>
<P>
   While Byrd's motion still seemed unlikely to get the Republican
votes needed to pass, his decision was a blow to Republicans who
had hoped his traditionalism would lead him to support the call for
a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, all morning long, small clutches of Democratic and
Republican senators met away from the Senate chamber, in hallways
and small offices, searching for a plan acceptable to both parties
and then reporting back to their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to debate on Monday whether to dismiss
the charges against Clinton and whether to depose witnesses. A vote
on dismissal and, if that fails, on witnesses would come next, but
perhaps not until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch called Byrd's motion premature and said he thought it
would fail. But he said his idea was ``just another way of
resolving these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, the Democratic leader, quickly
responded that ``every single Democrat'' would oppose Hatch's
motion because it leaves the charges against Clinton unresolved.
``There must be a definite determination on the case,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's proposal could prove problematic to many Republicans as
well, most of whom want to cast final votes on the two articles of
impeachment. ``I think we should have the opportunity for each
senator to stand and face the other 99 and simply say yea or nay on
the ultimate question,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The first turning point in the case, however, could come as
early as next week, when the Senate takes up the question of
depositions. For the past several weeks, it has been evident that
most Republicans favor taking depositions from witnesses, hoping,
they say, that people like Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary, could clear up contradictory testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans reiterated their concerns on Friday
about deposing witnesses, a sign that at least a few senators in
the party are nervous about prolonging the trial. The group is
pivotal because it would take six or more Republicans to block a
motion next week to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is having conversations,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., said. ``It's the largest group of negotiations in the
Senate's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he believed there were four or
five Republicans who had an ``open mind'' on voting to dismiss the
charges. ``But whether they actually vote for it or I vote for it
remains to be seen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to have to persuade me that what the witnesses
are going to have to say is new,'' Shelby said. ``More of the same
_ we don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, echoed Shelby's cautiousness,
saying, ``I have to be persuaded that there should be witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a hallway interview, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said:
``There is a substantial core of moderates in both parties who
would like to find an endgame, sooner rather than later. A dozen or
so of us are speaking among ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some concerns over witnesses, House managers are moving
ahead with their plan to try to persuade the Senate to call Clinton
as a witness. On Friday, in a letter to the Senate's Republican and
Democratic leaders, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House
Judiciary Committee, said the president ``is the only individual
with knowledge of almost every material fact relevant to the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders have not decided whether to extend an
invitation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that Senate bipartisanship will face its second
major test next week, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from
Mississippi, said on Friday that he was considering holding another
joint caucus in the Old Senate Chamber to talk through the next
stage of the trial. His counterpart, Daschle, said he would not be
averse to such a caucus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But of all the day's developments, it was Byrd's announcement
that he would be the one to offer a dismissal motion that prompted
the quickest, most partisan reaction among senators. The motion
would end the trial summarily, without a vote on whether to convict
or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement resonated with both parties because Byrd, who
has been sharply critical of Clinton's behavior, is esteemed as a
constitutional scholar and had remained undecided on the question
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately championed the decision, predicting that
Byrd might influence some Republicans to vote with Democrats to
dismiss the charges. ``He's among the members we suggest and look
to for leadership,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, with Lott's endorsement, held an
instant news conference after Byrd's statement to rebut it. ``I
believe that Senator Byrd's motion to end the trial is
inappropriate,'' he said. ``I think it will be defeated. I believe
this trial will go the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   A roster of other Republicans followed suit. Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., and Hatch said they did not think the measure would pass
the Senate. And Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called for the
motion's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one in the U.S. Senate with more respect than
senator Byrd,'' said Rep. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. But, he added, ``I
am not deciding this case without the evidence coming in.''

JUDGE APPROVES SETTLEMENT IN CHILD-WELFARE SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Friday approved the sweeping
settlement of a 1995 federal class-action lawsuit against New York
City's troubled child-welfare system, rejecting a last-minute
objection by advocates for gay and lesbian youths in foster care,
and in the process ending 26 years of litigation that sought the
system's overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement in Marisol vs. Giuliani opens the city's
Administration for Children's Services to intense independent
scrutiny by a panel of experts over the next two years. It also
sets a moratorium on new class-action lawsuits during that period.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the agreement dissolves the Wilder Settlement,
the decree in a lawsuit originally filed in 1973, which was
supposed to ensure that all children in need of foster care were
placed fairly and according to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   In approving the settlement, Judge Robert Ward of U.S. District
Court in Manhattan effectively closed the door on Joel A. vs.
Giuliani, a lawsuit brought last week as a class action on behalf
of a group of gay, lesbian and bisexual youths in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit was brought by the Urban Justice Center, a
nonprofit advocacy organization for the homeless, and lawyers at
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, working pro bono. It
charges that because of the plaintiffs' sexual orientation, they
are routinely subjected to physical abuse by peers and
child-welfare staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreements provide no direct, concrete or effective relief
from the daily devastation suffered by class members,'' Doug
Lasdon, director of the Urban Justice Center, contended, calling
the settlement's promise ``wholly illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge disagreed, finding that the special needs of the
children in the Joel lawsuit would be covered in the Marisol
settlement. Its plaintiffs can still seek relief and damages
through the courts as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Marisol lawsuit was filed shortly after the notorious
beating death of Elisa Izquierdo, a 6-year-old who was killed by
her mother while under the city's watch.
</P>
<P>
   The suit sought the takeover of the child-welfare system by a
receiver. But at Friday's hearing a succession of advocates and
city officials praised the settlement as a more effective means of
building on the reforms being instituted by Nicholas Scoppetta, the
agency's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The Marisol and Wilder lawsuits were brought by Marcia Robinson
Lowry, now the director of a national advocacy organization,
Children's Rights Inc. Marisol, a child who almost starved to death
in a closet while she was in the city's child-protection system,
has now been adopted by a loving family ``because of this
lawsuit,'' Ms. Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   But in urging Ward to approve the accord at a hearing Friday,
she invoked the fate of her original plaintiff, then a 13-year-old
girl named Shirley Wilder, who died last Sunday at 39, alone in a
hospice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in foster care shouldn't mean that you grow up to die
alone,'' Ms. Lowry said, obviously fighting back tears. She told
the judge that the new settlement was ``the best chance for making
sure that other children don't have the experience Shirley had.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Donald Thornton, a successful Ford dealer here
for many years, still recalls his anger on the day three decades
ago when his daughter Kathy, then 7, came home from a birthday
party in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little kid next to her _ the little worm, I could choke
him _ leaned over and said, `My daddy says all car salesmen are
crooks,''' Thornton recounted recently, sitting at the scarred wood
desk across which he has been selling cars since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. have long worried that
the little boy's father was right _ at least in some cases.
Unscrupulous dealers have tarnished car brands and undercut their
rivals, eroding profits for automakers and honest dealers alike.
</P>
<P>
   So, after nearly a century of relying on independent dealers to
sell their cars and trucks, the two automakers, the world's
largest, have begun separate moves into the retail end of the
business. They have started setting up retailing ventures in
partnership with dealers like Thornton who have tried to pursue
more ethical ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   The ventures, in which the automakers typically hold 20 percent
to 30 percent of the stock, buy up all the automakers' dealerships
in a city and then set uniform business practices at every site. In
most cases, they also set the same prices for vehicles at all of
their outlets and do not allow negotiation. By eliminating local
competition among dealerships, the automakers may be able to
increase profits at the retail level. Some of that money, they
hope, will be invested in better showrooms that will make their
cars and trucks look more attractive, thereby increasing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even some consumer advocates are pleased, welcoming almost any
change as an improvement over traditional sales tactics, despite
the slightly higher prices that might result.
</P>
<P>
   But setting up and running the retailing operations has proved
harder than anticipated. Ford dealerships here in Tulsa have lost
close to two dozen of their 160 sales representatives over a switch
from commissions to salaries, and more than a dozen of their 180
mechanics who were leery of management changes. Ford's market share
here has fallen. Whatever consumer advocates say, many customers,
after decades of haggling to buy cars, distrust any dealership that
will not allow them to bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Byrd, 57, a mail carrier, checked prices at downtown Ford
dealers last fall and was angry that no one would negotiate. ``I
would call it price-fixing,'' Byrd said, standing in the showroom
of a dealership in Claremore, northeast of Tulsa, where he had gone
instead to buy a white Ford F-350 pickup truck for less.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and antitrust lawyers say that consolidating the
ownership of a single automaker's dealerships and setting common
prices is ethical and legal, although half the states put some
limits on manufacturers' ownership of dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   James F. Rill, the assistant attorney general for antitrust in
the Bush administration, said that each partnership is a single
legal entity no matter how many dealerships it owns and so cannot
be accused of illegal collusion to fix prices. Because most cities
also have dealerships that sell Chevrolets, Dodges, Hondas and
other brands, he added, the partnerships cannot be accused of
monopolizing local auto markets.
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of competition among brands, it is hard for any
dealer to raise prices beyond what a given car or truck justifies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial problems, Ford has big plans for expansion,
while G.M. is moving in the same direction but more cautiously.
Both are trying to act quickly because they are alarmed by Republic
Industries, the auto retailer based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that
has bought nearly 400 franchises _ mostly big, highly profitable
dealerships _ in the last two years. Ford and GM are wary of losing
too much control over their retail distribution networks to H.
Wayne Huizenga, the billionaire chairman of Republic, or to other
consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for us to react now, or wait and watch
some of the publicly traded corporations take some of the
strongest'' dealerships, said Ross H. Roberts, president of Ford
Investment Enterprises, the new subsidiary that is setting up the
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wants to strengthen already successful franchises in
growing, midsize cities by having them work together. GM's strategy
is more defensive, aimed at fixing weak dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Ford already has helped create companies that own all of its
Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in Tulsa and Oklahoma City,
and both of its Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in San Diego. Ford has
plans for similar partnerships in Salt Lake City and Rochester,
N.Y., in the next two months. The automaker is negotiating more
retailing partnerships in nine other United States cities this
year, as well as in cities in Australia, Britain, Canada and New
Zealand, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   GM has set up retailing companies to own dealerships in
Baltimore, Houston and the San Fernando Valley in California, and
is considering a number of ventures elsewhere, said Ronald
Zarrella, the GM president for North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But only the San Fernando Valley operation, which involves 10
franchises at five dealerships that used to have extremely low
market shares, is trying to set no-haggle prices. The Baltimore and
Houston ventures are aimed at consolidating the ownership of
Pontiac-GMC dealerships and helping black dealers expand in those
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's approach is influenced by the iconoclastic sales
techniques that GM pioneered for its Saturn models. All Saturn
stores already use one-price selling, and in many cities, all
Saturn stores are owned by the same dealer, eliminating
competition. GM is also setting up Saturn Retail Enterprises, a
separate company that plans to buy as many as 150 of the 400 Saturn
dealerships nationwide. The retailer may make an initial public
offering of stock in a year or two but is not trying to change
Saturn's approach to selling, said Donald Hudler, president of the
new company.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has long owned a minority stake in a third of its
dealerships in Japan, according to Minoru Nakamura, the chief
executive and president of Nissan North America. But, he said,
these dealerships tend to perform worse than the truly independent
dealerships, and Nissan might sell its stakes if anyone wanted
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own, you work 24 hours a day, seven days a week,''
Nakamura said. At dealerships with partial corporate ownership, he
added, ``you work eight hours and take weekends and holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler experimented several years ago with different ways to
sell cars and concluded that dealers did best when left alone _
particularly in weak markets, where an entrepreneur might be able
to cut costs, lay off staff and lower prices more easily than a
corporation could.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., and car
dealers in Tulsa vow that the new ventures will be entrepreneurial
and flexible. ``I've got 100 percent of my dealership assets
invested in this operation,'' said Fred J. Hall, the chief
executive of the Oklahoma City retailing company, which started
operations on Jan. 7. ``That makes me want to work very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fixed prices, the Oklahoma dealerships have
changed the way sales representatives are paid _ salaries plus
bonuses based on the number of vehicles sold, instead of sales
commissions. Consumer advocates loathe the industry's traditional
commissions, typically 20 percent to 35 percent of a dealership's
profit on a vehicle. That pay structure, they say, gives sales
representatives an incentive to quote as high an initial price as
possible on each vehicle, so as to maximize profit for both the
dealer and the employee making the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say the commission system prompts sales agents to
give most of their attention to customers who are interested in
high-profit models, like the Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Suburban
and other sport utility vehicles. Buyers of small cars can be
largely ignored, because little if any money is made on these
typically overstocked vehicles that sell for close to the dealers'
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultants say that no-haggle dealerships charge $100
to $200 a vehicle more than a good bargainer would pay by
negotiating. Yet Jack Gillis, an automotive retailing expert at the
Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, said the
elimination of haggling and of commissions was good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the reaction from customers in Oklahoma to the new Ford
partnerships has, indeed, been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Robine, a 31-year-old computer programmer who
recently bought a Ford F-150 pickup truck at a Ford outlet in
Oklahoma City, was happy not to have to spend hours negotiating the
price for a new set of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a truck that I liked and the price was pretty good _ I
even checked on the Internet,'' he said as he waited for the
paperwork on his shiny, bright red pickup to be completed. ``I
wonder if you can get a better price if you really sit down with
someone and negotiate. But I'm not someone who really likes to get
in a fight, and sometimes that's what it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marcia Lynch, a 56-year-old teacher, was furious earlier
this month when she took her 1995 Ford Windstar minivan to two Ford
dealerships in Oklahoma City, only to be offered the same trade-in
price at both, with no room to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `You do it our way or no way,''' Mrs. Lynch said. ``And
I don't like that. I feel it's degrading and demeaning.'' She said
she got a better deal by trading in her old minivan for a new one
at Cooper's dealership in Midwest City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the Oklahoma City partnership has not been running long
enough for its success or failure to be judged, the Tulsa
partnership, Ford's first, has had serious problems, executives in
Tulsa and in Dearborn acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who were used to ordering new vehicles from the
factory for single dealerships were suddenly asked to work together
in ordering for all six Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in
Tulsa, and they did not increase the size of their orders
accordingly. As a result, the Ford operations did not have enough
vehicles to sell when a strike crippled GM Ford's local market
share actually fell then, even as it was rising nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Rival dealers, including some Ford dealers, have responded
aggressively to the new venture in Tulsa. Advertisements have
warned, ``One price is a high price,'' as some dealers have vowed
to beat the partnerships' fixed prices, even if by only $50 or
$100. Similar tactics stopped many dealerships' experiments with
fixed-price selling several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rivals here have hired sales representatives and mechanics
away from the Ford retailing experiment. But Robert L. Rewey,
Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service, said
that the departure of sales agents from the Tulsa dealerships had
provided an opportunity for the new venture to hire more women and
members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors are also taking advantage of the Ford partnerships'
pledge to pay customers the appraised value of their used vehicles,
regardless of brand, even if the customers do not actually trade
them in on new cars or trucks. Dealers like Rodney O. Maupin, who
sells Chevrolets and Nissans in Tulsa, now send customers over to
the Ford dealerships to collect cash for their vehicles and then
bring it back as a down payment on a new Chevy or Nissan. Maupin
said he had sent only a few customers, though other dealers had
sent more.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to keep the cash policy because it builds good will
with customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the carmaker is also trying to learn from some of the
mistakes made here in Tulsa. Here, there was a delay of nearly
three months in starting the operation after it was announced, but
in Oklahoma City, six months later, the retailing venture was in
operation in less than four weeks. Hall met all 1,000 employees of
the 12 franchises in Oklahoma City to explain the changes. Partly
as a result of these moves, fewer than a half-dozen people have
left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa venture also confused customers by changing the names
on its dealerships twice. First, the venture eliminated familiar
names like Don Thornton Ford, instead calling all of its outlets
Experience. A few months later, it renamed them as the Tulsa Auto
Collection, after Ford executives in Dearborn decided that the name
sounded more elegant and reflected the fact that the dealerships
were selling a bevy of Ford brands, including Jaguar, Mazda,
Lincoln and Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the dealerships in Oklahoma City have been renamed
just once, as the Fred Jones Auto Collection. That has a familiar
ring, since half the city's Ford franchises already were named for
Jones, who was Hall's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The natty Hall, 47, who was a deputy assistant secretary of
state in the Reagan administration and is the third-generation heir
to a family fortune from the airline, auto parts and auto
dealership industries, is cited by Ford officials as a model
retailing executive. He introduced fixed-price selling in his
family's dealerships in Tulsa and Oklahoma City in 1993, increasing
their sales, and played a large role last year in persuading Ford
to turn Oklahoma into the test bed for its new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he would not sell cars by any other means, especially
high-pressure haggling. ``I will not go the other way _ it is
anathema to my moral fiber,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, the Tulsa Ford dealer whose daughter cried upon
hearing her father being called a crook, is equally convinced,
after selling cars for most of his adult life, that fixed-price
selling must replace longstanding techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton experimented with fixed-price selling in the early
1990s and switched to a less stringent policy of low prices with a
narrow range of negotiation after other dealers undercut him; his
former showroom is hung with dozens of plaques and banners from
Ford, awards for seldom having customer complaints. Now he sees
citywide ventures with automaker support as a way to bring order to
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton emphasized that he did not have to try Ford's
experiment. ``I was as happy as a pig in slop,'' he said. ``I was
64 years old. I had two sons-in-law in the business. I was doing
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But two-thirds of car buyers these days, especially young
professionals, do not want to negotiate, and dealerships must
adjust, Thornton added. ``This,'' he said, ``is the wave of the
future.''

QUARTEY VOWS TO BREAK DE LA HOYA'S BONES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a few minutes, his manager, Fred Levin, was to be
honored for his public service and installed as a chief in the
Akuapem traditional area of Ghana in a ceremony Friday at the
United Nations. But first, Ike Quartey wanted to discuss how he was
going to break every bone in Oscar De La Hoya's body when the two
meet in a 12-round World Boxing Council welterweight championship
bout Feb. 13 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to break all his bones, like a chicken, and divide
it into pieces,'' said Quartey, a native of Ghana, who also
received an award at the ceremony from Koby Koomson, Ghana's
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey added about De La Hoya: ``I think he's a chicken. Of
course, I want to hurt him. I'm going to beat him. I'm too strong,
too fast. It's going to be a knockout fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The bout between Quartey (34-0-1) and De La Hoya (29-0) was
postponed from Nov. 21, when De La Hoya was cut on the left eyelid
in a sparring session at his California training camp. Quartey is
viewed as De La Hoya's toughest test yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, the president of Top Rank, De La Hoya's promoter, said
about 12,000 tickets for the 19,000-seat arena have been sold. Arum
said the delay benefited De La Hoya in at least one way: after an
appearance on a Spanish-television talk show in which he sang, he
has been pursued by four Spanish-language record labels that want
to sign him to a recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said De La Hoya would sign a deal before the fight and
would spend three weeks in March recording his first album.

Clemens rekindles his interest in Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ The Astros' quest for Roger Clemens is
regaining strength.
</P>
<P>
   The five-time Cy Young Award winner and Houston resident said
Friday that the Astros are back in the hunt for his services. And
he wouldn't rule out starting spring training next month with the
Astros rather than with the Toronto Blue Jays, his current club.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the subject since saying Dec. 22
that he had no interest in playing for the Astros and rescinding
his request that the Blue Jays trade him, Clemens said he is open
to all possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're back in it,'' Clemens said of the Astros.
``The communication lines are still open and as long as that's the
case, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that door is shut by any means. I did voice some
displeasure over the way things were handled and how things were
turned around on me. But right now, I would say that anything is
possible and in that regard, the Astros are a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is playing in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a pro-am
event on several golf courses in the Palm Springs area.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his round Friday with pro Fred Couples and
Atlanta Braves pitcher Tom Glavine, Clemens said he doesn't want to
hold a grudge against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset (last month) because of some of the things that
were said, and I came home early from vacation because of the
situation,'' Clemens said. ``I felt like it was necessary to tell
the Astros that I wasn't happy about the way the situation was
handled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, was asked if it would take some fence-mending, or
perhaps an apology, by Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker to
help facilitate his agreeing to a trade that would bring him to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a process that will be done behind the scenes,'' he
said. ``That's the business side of the scene. All I'm worried
about is getting ready for the season, to play a game I love
playing. I have no control over the marketplace and that other end
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was quick to emphasize he considers himself a Blue Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm in Toronto,'' Clemens said. ``That could change
in a couple of weeks. Or it could not change in a couple of weeks.
The only thing I'm doing right now is concentrating on my regular
workout schedule that I always start after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm in Toronto, we'll try to win a championship there. If
I'm somewhere else, whether it's Houston or wherever, I'm still
going to start the season with the goal of trying to win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training begins in a month. Any trade for Clemens likely
would mean the Astros parting with a significant amount of young
talent, as well as probably reworking Clemens' contract, which
calls for the pitcher to earn $16.1 million over the next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, Clemens and his agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks,
called a news conference at which Clemens rescinded his Dec. 2
request to be traded by the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the news conference, Clemens said he did not want to be
involved with the Astros as long as Hunsicker and club president
Tal Smith were running the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very upset at what Mr. Smith and Mr. Hunsicker said and
how they directed things towards me as a person,'' Clemens said
four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   `I'd like to play in Houston. But we'll just have to see where
it goes from here. Like I said, if I'm in Toronto, I'll be happy
there, too.'Roger Clemens
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know them personally; they don't know me as a person.
I am not interested in working with or alongside those two
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Friday he still would consider it an honor to play
in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play in Houston,'' he said. ``But we'll just have
to see where it goes from here. Like I said, if I'm in Toronto,
I'll be happy there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens won his fifth Cy Young Award last season after going
20-6 with a 2.65 ERA. He has been one of the game's dominant
pitchers since coming out of the University of Texas in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He alson won the 1997 Cy Young Award with the Blue Jays and won
Cy Youngs with the Boston Red Sox in 1986, 1987 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Trade talks in December centered on the Astros, New York
Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. was negotiating with Clemens'
agents in early December. After making an offer to McLane, Randy
Hendricks said he left the winter meetings in Nashville, Tenn.,
expecting to get a counteroffer from the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Hunsicker _ who had not been in contact with
McLane _ said the Astros were ending trade talks with the Blue Jays
and general manager Gord Ash.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clemens, the Astros and Blue Jays were close to
completing a trade before things fell apart. That led to him
rescinding his trade request and saying he was prepared to stay
with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears Clemens is open to a resumption of trade talks.

CLINTON OUTLINES PLANS TO FIGHT UNCONVENTIONAL TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS with new top, picking up original text at 4th graf: Clinton
said ...)  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed steps Friday to defend
against unconventional terrorist warfare, including the creation of
25 urban medical emergency teams to respond to germ weapons attacks
and the training of a new ``Cyber Corps'' of computer specialists
to detect and defeat intrusions into critical civilian and military
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at the National Academy of Sciences, Clinton
sought to muster public support for a large increase in federal
spending to combat exotic threats. He said that terrorists with
computer skills and access to chemical and biological agents had
extended the field of battle from physical space to cyberspace and
from land, sea and air to the human body.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposals stand a good chance of passage on
Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers have been pressing for
several years to strengthen federal counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Department of Health and Human Services was
being enlisted in the battle against domestic terrorism, expanding
its disease-fighting role into a national security mission. The
agency will be charged with developing and stockpiling vaccines and
treatments against chemical and germ weapons and with mobilizing
public health agencies to respond to any suspected attack of
infectious agents.
</P>
<P>
   The president's actions mark a significant expansion of federal
involvement in efforts to respond to threats that officials say are
quickly moving from the realm of science fiction to reality.
Clinton said that defenses against unconventional threats had
failed to keep pace with the speed of development of new kinds of
weapons of terror, weapons that can be developed in a clandestine
laboratory and transported in a briefcase or sent through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The president also warned that a talented hacker with a desktop
computer and a modem could now threaten the nation's military,
banking, communications, power, transportation and water networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know the fight against terrorism is far from over,
and now terrorists seek new tools of destruction,'' Clinton told an
audience of government officials and scientists Friday. ``The
enemies of peace realize they cannot defeat us with traditional
military means, so they are working on two new forms of assault
which you've heard about today: cyberattacks on our critical
computer systems, and attacks with weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological, potentially even nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The president sought to increase awareness of emerging threats
without raising undue alarm about events that have yet to
materialize on American soil. He said the government would assure
civil liberties even as it organizes its military, intelligence,
criminal justice and public health agencies to respond to the
threat of biological or computer terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a cause for panic,'' Clinton said Friday. ``It is
essential that we do not undermine liberty in the name of liberty.
We can prevail over terrorism by drawing on the very best in our
free society: the skill and courage of our troops, the genius of
our scientists and engineers, the strength of our factory workers,
the determination and talents of our public servants, the vision of
leaders in every vital sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan devotes $2.8 billion to prepare for attacks
with exotic weapons and to combat computer warfare threats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the administration has virtually
doubled the funds devoted to protecting Americans against attacks
with unconventional weapons. The president's 2000 budget proposal
allocates $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the total are $683 million to train emergency
workers in U.S. cities to cope with a chemical attack or an
outbreak of bioterrorism; $206 million to protect government
facilities; $381 million for research on pathogens, development of
vaccines and therapies, technology to detect and diagnosis rare
illnesses, and decontamination of affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also requesting $87 million, a 23 percent
increase over current spending, to improve the nation's public
health surveillance system to better detect the outbreak of an
epidemic and determine if it is an act of nature or of deliberate
terror.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes $52 million to continue to build a
national stockpile of specialized medicines to protect civilians
against attack by germ agents such as anthrax, smallpox or
pneumonic plague. The administration also is seeking to triple
spending, to $24 million, to create 25 new urban medical response
teams in major U.S. cities. At present, only four cities _ Miami,
Denver, Washington and Charlotte _ have teams prepared to respond
to a biological or chemical weapons emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all here talking about a kind of scenario that we hope
that our citizens never have to confront, but the point is to be
prepared,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services, who appeared with Clinton Friday. ``This is the first
time in American history in which the public health system has been
integrated directly into the national security system.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the president's proposal is an intensified
effort to protect the nation's critical, computer-based
infrastructure _ from power grids to firefighting networks. Such
defenses have seen a 40 percent spending increase in the past two
years, from slightly less than $1 billion in 1998 to the more than
$1.46 being sought for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money will go to the Pentagon for development of
systems that detect unauthorized intrusion into sensitive computer
networks. The administration also proposes to spend $500 million
for research on preventing efforts by computer hackers to disrupt
and damage government and private information networks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration budget proposal also includes money to create
a ``cyber corps,'' a cadre of computer security experts who can
respond to a computer crisis. The White House said it would spend
several million dollars next year to begin to design a program to
train and recruit computer science students as a counter-hacker
squad.
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers appear small given the government's huge
budget, administration officials noted Friday that the money would
significantly accelerate research on biological weapons agents and
the means to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the initiatives unveiled Friday do not include the
$4.5 billion over the next five years that the administration will
soon request for converting Russian defense industries,
safeguarding its nuclear stockpiles, and dismantling its chemical
and germ facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said he was pleased that Clinton was
devoting attention and money to a problem he has sought to
publicize for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has been the one to take the initiative on the issue,
while the Clinton administration has largely ignored these
threats,'' said Weldon, chairman of the research and development
subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. ``It's good to
see that the president has finally come around; better late than
never.''

 &HT;    Living in a new generation of the Catholic Church
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Andrea Truini remembers vividly the trip she took
to Vatican City in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was so excited about seeing the pope,'' she said.
``There were giant speakers, this little itsy-bitsy man and
hundreds of people swarming the piazza to see him. They had such
high appreciation for what he stood for.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a 21-year-old University of Dayton senior, Truini, of
Rochester, N.Y., still holds fast to that feeling. ``He is the Holy
Father, the one with a red phone line to God,'' she said on a
recent afternoon while sipping a Coke in the student union.
</P>
<P>
   But she also holds fast to pro-choice beliefs, defends friends
who are gay and believes that ``not using contraception because the
church says so is unrealistic for today's society. Telling people
not to have sex is not something the church should do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II, 78 years old and ailing, makes his fifth
and likely final visit of his papacy to the United States this week
in St. Louis, he will beseech young adult Catholics like Truini to
embrace the Roman Catholic church's ``immutable'' teachings of
chastity, homosexual sex as sin, the absolute sanctity of life and
nonordination of women.
</P>
<P>
   Can they live their faith and bring those teachings into the
next millennium?
</P>
<P>
   They are the so-called Generation X, born after 1964, ages 18 to
35. They have come of age with divorce, open expression of
homosexuality, abortion, birth control, sexual freedom, women's
rights, euthanasia, assisted suicide, rampant consumerism and
materialism.
</P>
<P>
   And more than any other generation of Catholics, they have
witnessed their own church's sins come to light as case after case
of sexual abuse by priests has made newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Diocese of Dallas agreed to pay the victims of
sexual abuse by the Rev. Rudolph Kos $22.5 million, and the Vatican
took the rare step of defrocking Kos, 53. He is serving a life
prison sentence, convicted of sexual assault and indecency for
molesting four boys more than 1,350 times between 1987 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the 20- and 30-something crowd, an estimated one-fourth of
the nation's 61 million Catholics, say they accept church teaching
and Pope John Paul II as its highest teacher precisely because of
the taxing moral issues of their time. And they seek to play a
vibrant role in parishes that are home to the 547,000 registered
Catholics in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, which includes Dayton.
A nationwide survey of 848 confirmed Catholics, age 20 to 39,
showed that 30 percent attend Mass weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is at least some evidence that young people
identify themselves very strongly with a Catholicism you might call
more traditional,'' said Sandra Yocum Mize, assistant professor of
religious studies at UD. ``They find themselves attracted to the
challenges the pope has issued: a challenge to chastity, to bring
Christ into the world, to stand against abortion, to stand for the
poor and against other kinds of social injustice. They are not a
majority, but they are a visible and vocal minority, certainly on
this campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Those less visible may have drifted from the church because
fewer Catholics are attending Catholic elementary and high schools,
said Dean Hoge, a sociology professor at Catholic University of
America in Washington, D.C. But the Cincinnati archdiocese's 134
Catholic elementary and high schools continue to be a mainstay of
religious education, where Catholics make up 87 percent of 57,994
enrolled students.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to an interfaith marriage rate of 50 percent, and a
shortage of parish priests as a hindrance to young adults becoming
active in the church. The number of priests has steadily dwindled.
Fewer priests make meaningful relationships more difficult and role
models less available, some priests say.
</P>
<P>
   Others may have been turned off by guilt and an inability to
reconcile personal behavior with strict church teachings, or
angered by abuse that the church has been slow to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Still others may have never bonded to the church because their
parents opted out. In Dayton and Cincinnati, a dramatic radio and
television advertising campaign and program titled ``Come Home''
calls them to return.
</P>
<P>
   But the call may be in vain, especially to a generation of women
who have grown up with more equal rights than any other in history.
``What should they do when they see unequal and unjust treatment in
their own church?'' asks Francis Kissling, president of Catholics
for a Free Choice in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the vehemence with which the pope has spoken against
women's ordination. He has said this is a closed topic _ no one
should talk about it,'' said Kissling. ``These kinds of statements
really are a barrier in terms of women's feeling of inclusion
within the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sister Maureen Fideler of the Maryland-based advocacy group
Catholics Speak Out: ``To young women 18 to 30 it makes absolutely
no sense that women can't be priests. It makes no sense in terms of
the Gospel and no sense in terms of their life experience. The
majority believe that some day they are going to wake up and change
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truini, the UD student, is puzzled over all the fuss. ``I've
never understood the desire to be a priest,'' she said. ``You can
do just as much and have a family, which would mean more to me than
being a celibate mother of a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Truini believes women can be just as effective in the role of
nuns, but says she knows few Catholic women who are genuinely
interested in religious life.
</P>
<P>
   Truini sees abortion, birth control and sexual orientation as
private matters. ``Sometimes the church's views are a little
outdated,'' she said. ``If you disagree with the teaching, you have
to go back to the Gospel and read it with your own viewpoint
because the Bible is a timeless story.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pope John Paul's uncompromising stance on abortion compells
Tim Bete, 36, of the Church of the Ascension in Kettering, and his
UD colleague, Carl Brown, 27, to make the six-hour trek by car to
St. Louis to see the Holy Father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has written on the `culture of death.' Some people think of
pro-life as only abortion,'' said Bete. ``But he is able to
champion pro-life as birth, end-of-life issues, quality of life, as
well as death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bete, a father of two children, ages 3 and 1, added, ``The
church's teaching on contraceptives is hotly debated and something
he hasn't equivocated on. I think he is respected because he hasn't
bowed to what secular society doesn't even think is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is married and the father of an 18-month-old
daughter, agrees. ``It's the church that says contraception and
abortion hurt women. They do not provide choices to women, but lock
them into roles that are obsessively focused on sex and allow men
to be irresponsible,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Bete and Brown say they brainstorm for ways to share their faith
with others. Elsewhere in the United States, young Catholics are
engaged in the same effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the Archdiocese of Atlanta, where about 300,000 Catholics are
5 percent of the population of northern Georgia, ministries reach
the 20- and 30-something crowd with church advertisements on bar
restroom doors and in gym locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, said Janice Murphy of the Office of Adult
Ministry in the Atlanta archdiocese, is to attract those who have
defined their spirituality outside the institution of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they can be spiritual enough by themselves, or in
nature,'' she said. ``They have a distrust for organized religion
in this generation. In a way, some don't want to be affiliated with
the pope. They see the church as just money-making, a business,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At UD Campus Ministry, the Rev. Jim Fitz observes the same. ``I
see a great desire for spirituality and a sense of purpose and
meaning in life,'' said Fitz, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is not the sense of commitment to institution that I
had. The institution is not as important to them. For example, a
number of young people are very committed to service and
volunteering. But students committed to working for institutional
change, such as justice issues like you had with civil rights in
the 1960s, I don't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 36, believes her generation craves the church's
2,000-year tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rich in the lives of the saints, and in sacraments. I
think a lot of people our age want something to hold on to because
the world is so fast-changing, so fast-food,'' she said. ``They are
looking for a faith that stands up for something, not just health
and wealth, but stands up for human rights, social justice issues
and the sanctity of life. That's what I like about being Catholic.
I like being challenged to stand up for those things.''
