<HEADLINE> 1 Lebanese Civilian Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian was killed in
Israeli air raids Thursday afternoon in south Lebanon, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Hatab, 35, was killed in a track transporting construction
material, which was directly hit by an Israeli air-to-ground
missile near the village of Rueizi, on the edge of the eastern
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets also raided the nearby villages of Arametai and
Iqlim Toufah region which are believed as military bases used by
Hezbollah (Party of God) for attacking Israeli posts inside the
zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli air raids came in a response to earlier attacks
launched by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which reportedly did not
score direct hit on Israeli posts.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war trying to oust an
estimated 2,000-strong Israeli occupying forces from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim to protect its northern area from
cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Develop New Relations with China: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretoria, April 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, scheduled to visit Beijing on April 9, said here on
Thursday that his country is keen to develop new relations with
China in various ways.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Mbeki said the ruling African
National Congress of South Africa and the Chinese Communist Party
have been enjoying good relations for decades, and now it is time
to pay more attention to promote the government-to-government
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day stay in China, Mbeki will meet Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of
National People's Congress Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji. The
two sides will focus on bilateral relations and establishment of
comprehensive cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is time for ruling parties of South Africa and China to
"talk about what other things to do together", he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to visit agenda, Mebeki said he will also discuss
with Chinese leaders international political and economic issues,
including restructuring of the United Nations Security Council,
and exchange views on African situation and the development of
the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan issue, Mbeki reiterated that South Africa will keep
its word made in a joint communique signed with China on December
30 last year -- "South Africa recognizes there is but one China
in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is
the sole legal government representing the whole of China and
recognizes China's position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China."
</P>
<P>
South Africa's relations with Taiwan will be restricted to
unofficial and economic and trade fields, Mbeki stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addtion to China, Mbeki's 11-day Asian tour will also take
him to Japan and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets up Task Forces on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Economic
Consultative Forum executive core group Thursday set up five task
forces to look into specific economic problems affecting Zimbabwe
and come up with recommendations for consideration by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The task forces would look into incomes and price policy,
macro-economy and foreign exchange market, industrial policy,
land reform and indigenisation, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Plans to form similar task forces on technology transfer and
water development are underway.
</P>
<P>
They would comprise business people and experts with
experience on the issues, who have already been appointed.
</P>
<P>
At its third meeting in Harare, the group agreed to set up a
secretariat to coordinate the activities of the forum which would
initially be funded by the United Nations Development Programe
while the government made arrangements to fund it.
</P>
<P>
Industry and commerce minister Nathan Shamuyarira, who is
chairman of the forum, said the task forces would be set in such
a way that the forum does not end up having permanent structures
for it to remain action-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting also discussed the issue of unemployment
and how various sectors of the economy could be improved to
create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the meeting, president Robert Mugabe
said unemployment had reached unsustainable levels which
threatedned to erode all the gains achieved after independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely critical that we resolve the importance of
vocational education which should enhance the skills development
of our youths so that they can generate employment for themselves
and for others as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the research component of the task forces was
vital since there are no easy solutions to problems of volatility
on financial markets, unemployment, incomes and price policy,
among others.

<HEADLINE> Outlook For Wheat In 1998-99: IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- On the basis of information
currently available, world wheat production is forecast at 593 m.
tons, or 15 m. below the 1997 record of 608 m. tons.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the International Grains
Council (IGC) released here Thursday, larger crops are projected
in the European Community and North Africa, but output is expected
to decline in other major producing regions.
</P>
<P>
Growers in Canada and the United States switched from wheat to
crops considered more likely to bring higher returns, especially
oilseeds, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Major producers which are usually net importers will probably
experience smaller crops, especially India and China, it expected.
</P>
<P>
The IGC also warned that weather will remain the predominant
influence on the eventual world outturn, including the lingering
effects of the current EI Nino system.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Foreign Reserves Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's foreign currency
reserves had risen to four month's import cover and would soon be
boosted by inflows from the just begun tobacco marketing season,
a foreign exchange expert said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Treasury director of first banking corporation Andy Hodges
told the Zimbabwen News Agency that with the expected sales from
tobacco sales, they hoped levels of foreign currency to rise to
five or six months import cover.
</P>
<P>
He said, "a rise in foreign currency reserves will, however,
depend on how sales do at the floors and of course the
performance of various other sectors. Sectors like horticulture,
mining and others will also need to build their own reserves."
</P>
<P>
Last year reserves drastically dropped to two months import
cover in contrast to the four to five months import cover
generally expected after tobacco exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hodges said the Zimbabwean dollar was stabilising
against hard currencies and was expected to improve further with
tobacco sales having started.
</P>
<P>
Currently local currency is about 16.2 Zimbabwean dollars
against one U.S. dollar from a ratio of 19 to one in January this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean dollar plunged to an all time low against all
major currencies in November last year after being under import
demand for quite some time.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges U.S. to Publicize Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Thursday urged the United States to formally publicize its new
initiative aimed at reviving the Middle East peace process, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh, Mubarak said Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat has expressed welcome to the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
"He (Arafat) welcomed the U.S. initiative in principle but he
does not know the details," Mubarak said. He held talks with
Arafat on Wednesday in the resort to sound out Palestinian
response to the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the difficulties to accept it, he (Arafat) has
decided to consider it so that the United States may help him,"
Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that "the United States has to announce it
officially. Otherwise the situation will be shaky." The American
plan, brought to the region by special envoy Denis Ross last week,
was never fully revealed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Washington wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for security cooperation
from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the idea seemed to have been snubbed by both Israel and the
Palestinians. Before ending his mission empty-handed, Ross did on
Monday fly to Sharm el-Sheikh, where Mubarak has been staying
since Sunday, to seek Egyptian help in persuading the Palestinians
to buy the U.S. idea.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, on his part, renewed warnings against the danger of a
protracted peace impasse. "The alternative will be violence and
terrorism from which no one will be immune," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that all efforts be mobilized to get the peace process
out of the deadlock, already one year old since Israel began
construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last
March.
</P>
<P>
Ross will present U.S. President Bill Clinton a report of his
five-day shuttle mission in the region to sell the U.S.
initiative. The American administration, already anxious about the
lack of progress in the peace process, has threatened to remove
itself as the mediator.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Somalia Continues to Claim Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- There have been reports of
fighting between the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and those of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid in Baidoa, Somalia on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, the RRA spokesman, his
forces of nearly 150 men launched the attack on the militia bases
of Hussein Aidid, killing seven and wounding ten others.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle said the RRA has lost three men while five others
sustained gunshot wounds before retreating back to the jungle
outside the town.
</P>
<P>
There's no word yet from Hussein Aidid's side over the
clashes, however travellers from the town of Baidoa confirmed the
hit and run attack. The town of Baidoa, the venue for the
national reconciliation conference to be held on May 15, was calm
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the southern port town of Kismaio, 500 km south of
the capital, was also under artillery attack Wednesday afternoon.
Residents in the town said there was no deaths or wounds caused
by the shelling. However, the people were terrorized by the loud
noise of the heavy rounds.
</P>
<P>
The town of Kismaio has been calm but tense ever since the
armed clashes Monday between the ousted Narehan militiamen and
those of the allied Majerten, Ogaden and Dhulbahante armed men.
The effects of Monday's fighting are still felt in the town as
nearly 100 wounded people are still being treated in the town
hospital where some are dying of the wounds. The latest who died
was a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Colonel Hassan Dahir Aweys, militia commander of
the fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad was attacked and wounded by
unidentified gunmen early Thursday morning in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness in the area, Aweys was on his way to a
nearby mosque to say his morning prayers when five gunmen
intercepted him with shooting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Gold Output Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's gold production is
expected to rise to 25,000 kg this year if the BHP-Hartley
Platinum Mine gets fully operational, the country's Chamber of
Mines said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Derek Bain, chief executive of the Chamber of Mines, told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that this year's production would be more
than the 24,242 kg of last year.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming Hartley Platinum Mine will be fully operational, and
the fact that for the first two months of this year production
was about 4,000 kg, then that level can be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official also noted that a depreciating
Zimbabwean Dollar which fell by about 70 percent in 1997 had
improved the mining sector's local earnings, but the cost of
importing vital machinery had severely reduced operating profits.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low prices and high input costs, gold production
was expected to be 25,000 kg, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold producer in Africa after
South Africa and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Demonstrations Over Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Sparked by the death of Hamas
bomb maker Muhei Eddine Sharif, Palestinians hold demonstrations
on Thursday in several West Bank towns and clashed with Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, thousands of Palestinians
carried Sharif's body snaking through the downtown to a local
mosque.
</P>
<P>
"revenge, revenge" were chanted repeatedly by the mourners who
claimed that Israel had assassinated Sharif. And anti-Israel
slogans called for suicide bombers to blow up Tel-Aviv, the main
coastal city of Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the funeral, dozens of Palestinians ran to a nearby
Jewish settlement and threw stones at Israeli soldiers who
replied with tear gas and rubber bullets. A number of
demonstrators were injured in the clash.
</P>
<P>
In another autonomous Palestinian town of Bethlehem and
northern Jerusalem, Palestinians also held demonstrations and
clashed with Israeli soldiers
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians declared a general strike through the
West Bank, including eastern Jerusalem. Merchants closed shops and
schools were also affected.
</P>
<P>
In a leaflet, Hamas vowed to carry out more terror attacks
against Israel to avenge Sharif's death. A Hamas political leader
in the Gaza Strip said on Thursday that more suicide bombing
attacks were likely, noting that "Hamas will not neglect its
martyrs."
</P>
<P>
In response, Israel security forces remained on high alert
for the possibility of terror attacks, tightening controls at
shopping centers and busy locations in main cities.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, leading bombmaker of Hamas, was found dead Sunday
night near a car that exploded in an industrial zone of
Ramallah, but the identity of his body was not announced until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Sharif was killed with shots to the
chest before the explosion, accusing Israel of having carried out
the assassination. But Israeli officials categorically denied
Israeli involvement in Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday made it
clear again to Abu Mazan, deputy to Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat, that Israel has no role in the
accident. He called Abu Mazan to prevent the violence from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
also said he was concerned that Hamas would exploit Sharif's
death to recruit new members and prepare terror attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders to Factories Decline Sharply in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Orders to the U.S. factories
and plants declined sharply in February, mainly due to a large
drop in demand for aircraft, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.9 percent drop in factory orders, slightly more than
expected by economists, followed a 0.6 percent increase in January
and brought orders to a seasonally adjusted 334.8 billion U.S.
dollars, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers, the commercial aircraft industry in
particular, have been affected by soft demand in the crisis-ridden
Asian countries. However, the impact so far has not been as
serious as some economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released by the Labor Department today,
the number of applications filed at state offices for unemployment
benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 309,000 last week, a
decrease of 5,000 from the week before. The level shows still
strong demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
A four-week average of benefit claims, which smoothes weekly
fluctuations, rose 1,000 to 308,250. It was the average's eighth
consecutive week below 310,000, the longest such stretch in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders for durable goods, big ticket items expected to
last three or more years, dipped 1.1 percent in February. That's
slight better than an initial estimate last week of a 1.7 percent
drop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was a 7.8 percent drop in transportation
equipment. A 32.8 percent plunge in aircraft orders more than
offset a 4.2 percent increase for autos and parts.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic equipment and for medical and other types
of instruments also fell. But orders increased for stone, clay and
glass products, primary metals such as steel, fabricated metal
products and industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, factory orders
inched 0.2 percent higher in February.
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods orders decreased 0.5 percent, pulled down by
drops in textile mill products and petroleum and coal products.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, a measure of current production,
increased 1.2 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted 337.5
billion dollars. As a result, the backlog of unfilled orders fell
0.5 percent, the second consecutive decrease, to 542.9 billion
dollars. The stockpile of goods in inventory rose 0.5 percent to
457.6 billion dollars, the 13th increase in 14 months.

ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- In a major development,
Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban militia Thursday nominated five of
their senior leaders for the Joint Steering Committee that would
negotiate with their rival alliance, a senior Taliban official
here said.
</P>
<P>
The religious gathering or Ulema Committee will also have five
members from the rival Northern Alliance, said Abdul Hakim
Mujahid, Taliban's ambassador in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The names were announced in line with the United Nations and
Pakistan's initiative taken during the last month visit to
Pakistan by Head of Taliban's Interim Council Mohammad Rabbani,
said the Taliban official. The Ulema (Islamic scholars) commission
would aim at restoring peace in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have respected our promise to nominate members for the
steering committee which reflects the resolve of our government to
solve the conflict peacefully," Mujahid said.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee could discuss four issues -- the number
of the Ulema, their qualifications, authority of the Ulema and
guarantee from both sides to accept all decisions of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Taliban, who control two-thirds of the Afghanistan,
had proposed the formation of the Ulema commission last year but
had rejected a list of scholars sent by the Northern Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Sandstorm Again Hits Egypt, Affects Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A sandstorm hit Egypt early
Thursday, shutting down the Cairo International Airport for two
hours due to a poor visibility of about 100 meters, along with a
series of airports southward along the Nile river.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency quoted EgyptAir official Ibrahim
Abderabbou as saying that seven flights destined for Cairo were
forced to divert to other airports outside the spell of the
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
The official said flights coming from Saudi Arabia bound for
Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada airports, had to return to
Jeddah, a Saudi Red Sea port city.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm with a wind velocity of about 64 kilometers per
hour, caused a rise in temperature between six and seven degrees
centigrade Celsius across the country.
</P>
<P>
There have been improvements in weather conditions and
visibility in Cairo in the evening, as expected by head of
Meteorology Authority, Mohamed Abdel-Rahman Mahran.
</P>
<P>
Seasonal sandstorms, known as khamaseen in Arabic meaning
50-day wind, batter Egypt every spring, sending sand from the
Western Desert and Libya to the country and blanketing cities and
towns with yellow sand and dust.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the sandstorms hit harder and more often than
the past three years, according to Mahran.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorms, which could last between commonly hours and
rarely days, started a couple of weeks ago this year and are
expected to blow on and off until late April, he said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Probe Continuing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite a judge's dismissal of
Paul Jones' charges against U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr said Thursday "We're moving
very quickly."
</P>
<P>
White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles -- Clinton's
highest-ranking adviser -- went before Starr's grand jury here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We're moving very quickly," Starr said. "We do recognize there
is very keen and powerful interest in bringing all these matters
to resolution as quickly as possible. We're very sympathetic to
that."
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied in a deposition in
that civil case, or asked other witnesses to lie
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters for about 20 minutes outside his home in
McLean, Virginia, Starr shot down speculation that he had no
criminal case against Clinton now that a federal judge has thrown
out the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Starr's commentary was broadcast live on some TV news programs.
"That strange press conference revealed that, after four years and
40 million dollars, this investigation is only about a partisan
pursuit of the president," senior White House adviser Rahm Emanuel
said.
</P>
<P>
Starr said, "We must all play by the rules. If you don't play
by those rules -- if you lie under oath, if you intimidate a
witness, if you seek otherwise to obstruct the process of justice
-- it doesn't matter who wins and who loses in the civil case.
What matters from the criminal law's perspective is were crimes
committed."

<HEADLINE> French Investment in Mozambique on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- French investment to Mozambique
has been on the rise over the years, with 250 million Francs
(about 40.4 million U.S. Dollars) in 1997, the Mozambique News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the yearly investment is long-term loan
through the French Development Bank for infrastructure projects,
while the other 20 percent is in the fields of culture,
education, health and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
French companies have been involved in many development
programs in Mozambique. For instance, the ALCATEL has
participated in the construction of a mobile telephone network in
the country as well as the development of the Maputo Corridor.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996 however, France invested in Mozambique only 120
million Francs (about 19.4 million Dollars), accounting for
merely one percent of the total foreign investment in the
country, far behind Portugal and South Africa which took up 22
percent and 21 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
To promote further bilateral cooperation, the news agency
said, French President Jacques Chirac will pay a visit to
Mozambique this June.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Passes Law in Preparation for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament on Thursday set
the stage for the introduction of the single European currency in
the country by passing a law providing for how Germans should
adapt to the new currency after its launch in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, which was adopted by a large majority in the
lower house of the parliament, German companies and individuals
could choose to use either the single currency, known as the euro,
or the German mark in cash-free transactions during the three-year
transition period after the planned euro launch on January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Companies are also allowed to list their capitals or annual
balance reports in euro up from 1999. Moreover, stock exchanges
are also required to boost their tradings in euro to a significant
level as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The new law also included a number of stipulations providing
for the transfer of power from the German central bank to the
future European central bank which will set common monetary policy
for all euro member states after the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union timetable, the euro would be launched
in 1999, but first in a cash-free form. The actual notes and coins
will be introduced over a six-month period starting January 1,
2002, after which the participants' present currencies will
finally cease to be legal tender.
</P>
<P>
During the five-hour debate about the new law at the German
parliament, the euro had won support from all speakers, including
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and chairman of the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
It now appears almost certain that the parliament will give the
final approval for Germany's participation in the euro at its
debate scheduled on April 23-24.
</P>
<P>
A legal challenge to the punctual start of the euro, launched
by four German professors earlier this year, was also rejected by
the German supreme court on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Europe Eager to See Stability, Confidence Return to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior British official called on
Asian and European countries Thursday to focus on a firm response
to the Asian financial crisis based on further market
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Bargaret Beckett, president of the Board of Trade of Britain,
said: "Asia's problems are Europe's problems and Europe is eager
to see stability and confidence return to Asian markets."
</P>
<P>
In her opening speech to the third Asia Europe Business Forum,
Beckett said that in the eye of present storm, it is perhaps easy
to forget Asia's "formidable and continuing strengths."
</P>
<P>
These are strengths built upon the individual efforts of Asian
people and in particular, their extraordinary commitment to the
highest standards of education, she added.
</P>
<P>
Beckett stressed: "We should not forget that most Governments
in the region remain in strong budgetary positions with
impressively low levels of inflation. Some of the world's largest
and most advanced companies are based in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Although adjustment in Asia following the crisis may well take
some time and be painful, she said: "I am confident that with
hindsight this period will be seen as no more than a pause during
Asia's impressive economic development ..."
</P>
<P>
Companies should not abandon market positions that they have
worked hard to build up in Asia, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rather they should work with their Asian partners to help them
in the process of adjustment, Beckett said, adding that "We are
not fair-weather friends."
</P>
<P>
She believed that the current problems in Asia call for a firm
and focused ASEM response, based on a commitment to market
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
What would do great damage would be a return to protectionism
as a means for dealing with current difficulties, Beckett pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Taking place for the first time alongside the Asian and
European Heads of Government meeting (ASEM 2), which starts
Friday, the Forum meets at a crucial time in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
This is the third Asia-Europe Business Forum following two
previous fora, one in Paris in October 1996 and the other in
Bangkok last November.

<HEADLINE> First China-EU Summit Issues Joint Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
the joint press statement issued by the first China-EU summit held
in London, Britain, Thursday:
</P>
<P>
On April 2, 1998, HE Zhu Rongji, Premier of the People's
Republic of China, the Rt Hon. Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom - the current EU Presidency - Jacques Santer,
President of the European Commission, held the first China-EU
summit in London. The two sides held an in-depth exchange of views
on the further development of China-EU relations and international
issues of mutual interest in a friendly atmosphere, and reached
broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that with a great and profound change of the
world's situation, an increase in dialogue and cooperation between
the EU and China is not only in the fundamental interests of both
sides but is also conducive to world peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
China expressed keen interest in the process of EU integration
and welcomed and supported the launching of the Euro. The EU
welcomed China's strong commitment to market reform and the
impressive way it has undertaken the economic restructuring
process. In particular, the EU commended the Chinese Government's
bold agenda of specific initiatives announced at the Ninth
National People's Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
The EU side briefed the Chinese on the Commission's recent
communication on China. China welcomed the Commission's proposal,
which aims to upgrade the status and substance of the China-EU
relationship. The two sides expressed their hope to build a
long-term, stable and constructive partnership between China and
the EU for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed that stronger economic and trade ties
between China and the EU are an important foundation for the
continued development of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to securing
China's entry into the World Trade Organization on terms that will
be of mutual benefit and reinforce the world trading system. The
Chinese side appreciated the EU's support for China's entry into
the WTO and reiterated its desire to become a member at an early
date on the basis of balanced rights and obligations. The two
sides agreed to make a concerted effort to make continued progress
on the WTO negotiations over the coming months, focusing on the
task of securing agreement on a package that would give
substantial market access for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The two sides welcomed progress made in the China-EU human
rights dialogue since its resumption last year. The EU welcomed
China's decision to ratify the UN Covenant on Social, Economic and
Cultural Rights and its intention to sign the UN Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. Both sides agreed on the importance of
achieving further progress through a continued EU-China dialogue
covering all aspects of human rights, and supported by a wide
range of cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
The EU praised China's steadfast reaction to the financial
troubles in Asia, particularly its continued determination not to
devalue its currency and its commitment to maintaining the pace of
economic and financial reform. Both sides expressed their
conviction that Asia will not only overcome the temporary
difficulties caused by the financial turmoil, but with effective
implementation of the necessary reforms Asia should emerge even
stronger than before.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will strengthen their exchanges and cooperation
in the international financial and monetary field. The EU offered
China a package of technical assistance measures aimed at
facilitating the creation of a sound financial system, an offer
which was welcomed by China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believe that this successful and productive
summit is of great significance to EU-China relations. They agreed
to sustain the momentum of high-level exchanges and to consider
holding such summits on an annual basis.

Chairman Yegor Stroyev and acting Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable meeting will focus on Yeltsin's nomination of
Kiriyenko as prime minister and the composition of the new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma and the Federation Council have shown strong
reservation on Kiriyenko's nomination.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming roundtable meeting, which will also concentrate
on another of the country's main concerns -- the economic
problems, will be attended by trade union leaders, regional
representatives, parliamentary and government leaders and
President Yeltsin, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's meeting, Kiriyenko promised to give an "honest,
undisguised" review of the Russian economy when he faces
parliament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies in the opposition-dominated State Duma (lower
house) have called for broader roundtable talks to discuss the
composition of the new government and have expressed concern that
Kiriyenko, 35, is too inexperienced for the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Russia Unhappy about NATO's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO's planned expansion topped
the agenda of a joint Russian-NATO seminar held here Thursday on
the military and political implications of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the Security Committee of the State Duma
(the lower house of parliament) Sergei Boskholov said Russian
parliament deputies are opposed to the enlargement of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We are categorically against NATO's eastward expansion. We are
categorically against the admission of the Baltic republics into
the bloc," he said, adding that this is not a "blindly stubborn"
position.
</P>
<P>
NATO representatives, however, argued that the organization's
enlargement did not make Russia its target.
</P>
<P>
The idea of the expansion is being carried out in the interests
of peace and security and envisages development of partnership
between Russia and NATO, representatives from the western military
bloc claimed.
</P>
<P>
Russian parliament deputies and NATO representatives were
present at the seminar.

<P>
BUCHAREST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana Thursday urged Romania to do more in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"Romania has to play an important role, to contribute to the
entire region's stability and welfare," he said at a joint press
conference held after talks with Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his talks with Romania's high-ranking officials,
Solana said they focussed on the bilateral relations between NATO
and Romania as well as on Romania's political and economic
evolutions.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Constantinescu stressed that it is
praise-worthy that Romania has maintained its character of stable
zone in a region still marked with potential and open conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He underscored his country's continuous effort in seeking a
NATO membership, saying it was an effort assumed by "the
government, the political leaders, and also assumed, fully aware
of it, by this country's citizens."
</P>

Solana, who arrived in Bucharest Wednesday evening, left for
Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria, on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Inventors Awarded Grand Prix at Geneva Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian inventors were awarded
the Grand Prix of the 26th International Exhibition of Inventions
of Geneva on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two inventors, Alexandr Apunevich and Evgeny Titarenko,
were awarded for their environment-friendly invention of a
portable apparatus for soldering, brazing and cutting metals.
</P>
<P>
Instead of detonating gas or toxic products, the new device,
called ALPAZ, consumes water, electricity and a little alcohol.
</P>
<P>
When its 60 millilitres water tank is heated, ALPAZ produces
steam. Once under pressure, the burning-hot steam is partially
transformed into plasma, thus forming an electrical arc capable of
reaching 8,000 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
At different temperatures, it cuts, solders and brazes,
combining the capacities of gas soldering and arc soldering. It
can cut steel sheets of 6 millimetres thick.
</P>
<P>
Including the electricity supply, the portable device weighs
only six kilograms. Without using compressors or unstable gases,
it is safe to be used at places like households, garages,
laboratories and workshops.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 exhibitors from over 40 countries and regions
participated in the 26th International Exhibition of Inventions
which began on March 27. Around 1,000 inventions in all aspects
are being presented at the show.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will end on April 5.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Tchijov described his talks

</P>
<P>
During their talks, Tchijov did not rule out the possibility of

who is due to arrive in Cyprus on Friday for talks with all the
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"If we find ourselves in the same place at the same time, it

</P>
<P>
As for the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to be purchased by

<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said here on Thursday there is no obstacle standing in the way of
building cross-century relations between China and Britain with
the settlement of the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in No. 10
Downing Street, Zhu said Hong Kong's smooth return to the
motherland has ushered in a new page in Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current international situation, the further
development of Sino-British relations not only conforms to the
interests of the peoples of the two countries, but also conduces
to world peace and stability," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches importance to building
long-term and stable relations of friendship and cooperation with
Britain" because the two countries share broad common interests,
he told Blair.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the two countries are complementary to each
other and the potential for economic and trade cooperation is
great with a vast prospect, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Zhu that China has an important position in the
world and is an important force in international arena. "Britain
is ready to cooperate with China and further consolidate and
develop British-Chinese relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister also expressed his willingness to
build more and closer links with China in various fields, which is
in the interest of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports China in entering the World Trade
Organization and will make efforts to that end," Blair stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China "welcomes investment from British enterprises
to jointly develop the central and western part of China."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the two governments will take common
measures to support their enterprises, including medium and
small-sized ones, in cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to see cooperation in financial fields and will
take positive consideration of the requirement from the British
side on developing financial and insurance business in China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu is on a three-day official visit to Britain which ends
later Thursday. He will then attend the second Asia-Europe meeting
to be held in London on Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Resuming Cyprus Bicommunal Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A Russian envoy on Thursday
expressed concern about the deadlock in peace process in Cyprus
and underlined the need to renew bicommunal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Russian envoy for Cyprus Vladimir
Tchizhov said "what is needed at the moment is the promotion of
the U.N. Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)'s good offices mission and
the resumption of bicommunal talks soon."
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov had visited Greece and Turkey, which have strong
influence on the two communities in Cyprus, to talk with their
leaders in quest of a solution to the decades-old problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's refusal to
participate in U.N.-sponsored bicommunal talks unless his
breakaway state is recognized, Tchizhov said "we are one step
behind where we were last Summer."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two communities held two rounds of talks under
U.N. brokerage last summer, but failed to produce anything due to
Denktash's refusal of further discussions following the European
Union's decision to start membership negotiations with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots also spurned an invitation from Greek
Cypriots to participate in the negotiating team in the accession
talks with the EU, which opened in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Moscow will carry out a deal to safely deliver the
surface-to-air missile system S-300, ordered by the Cypriot
government in 1997, Tchizhov reminded the journalists of a recent
statement made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told a Greek military delegation that the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missile system will be delivered.
</P>
<P>
The deal was criticized by the U.S. and some other western
countries, and Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if
they are deployed. The deployment is expected to take place later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy is expected to have separate meetings with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash to discuss the
recent situation and ways of bringing a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov said he is in contact with U.S. State Department
Coordinator for Cyprus Tom Miller, who also arrived here Thursday
for meetings.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke is
also expected here Friday in an attempt to resume the stalled
intercommunal dialog.

<HEADLINE> Forty Arraigned before Court for Riot in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Forty people in connection with
the riot last Sunday in Dar es Salaam were arraigned Thursday before
the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court.
</P>
<P>
The accused are charged with threatening peace, destroying
properties, setting fire on houses and automobiles, and causing
injuries to people, said Assistant Commissioner of Police,
Leonard Mashaka.
</P>
<P>
The accused will be remanded until April 17 as the investigation
is still going on and other suspects are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rioters near the Mwembechai Mosque in the capital
city burned two government vehicles and attacked offices of the
Tanzanian ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Sunday
afternoon. They also looted shops.
</P>
<P>
During the riot, two people, including a three-year-old girl, were
killed. Police and the Field Front Unit had used tear gas to
disperse the mob.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, The Guardian Thursday said that the police
has launched a nationwide manhunt for two suspects in connection with
masterminding the riot.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred
Gewe, named the wanted persons are Ponda Issa Ponda and Omar Bashir.
</P>
<P>
Ponda Issa Ponda is the Secretary of the Committee for Moslems
Rights with temporary headquarters at the mosque while
Omar Bashir is a self-proclaimed Chief Imam of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
"The two suspects are wanted by the police for stirring up riots,
conducting religious preachings and destroying properties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the police force will ensure that the suspects
are arrested wherever they have hidden.
</P>
<P>
Heavily-armed policemen are still surrounding the mosque while
other police officers made patrols in nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
The riot is reported to have happened after the police banned a
meeting of the Committee of Moslem Women last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, has said that the
riot, the third since January 12, is suspected to have a political
nature and foreigners may got involved in it.

<HEADLINE> Member States Call for Strengthened UN Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- As the U.N. Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operation continued its general debate,
more and more member states are calling on the world organization
to strengthen its peacekeeping capacity as well as its stand-by
arrangements system, sources close to the debate said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the Special Committee started Monday
and will last until April 24.
</P>
<P>
Poseci Bune, delegate of Fiji, said Wednesday that when a
peacekeeping operation became necessary, that operation must have
clear political goals, a precise mandate, and effective command
and control structure, as well as clearly defined and uniform
rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations, Bune said that preventive actions were the most
cost-effective ways of preventing disputes from arising,
preventing them from escalating into conflicts, and resolving
existing conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Bune was echoed by Zambian representative Humphrey Kunda.
</P>
<P>
"Preventive diplomacy is a vital aspect of peacekeeping, and
the United Nations should act before the outbreak of a
conflict," Kunda said during the debate.
</P>
<P>
To be effective and successful, U.N. peacekeeping operations
needed to be supported by the member states, especially
financially, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kunda said that the U.N. needed to reimburse troop-contributing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged all member states to pay their financial dues in full,
on time and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Russian delegate Dmitiri Youndi also said that efficient
peacekeeping required the existence of reliable finance and
logistics.
</P>
<P>
Even under the economic and financial difficulties of the last
year, the Russian Federation had done everything in its power not
only for a timely payment in full of assessed contributions, but
also for reimbursement of its arrears.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek National Defense
Minister Apostolos Tsokhatzopoulos said Thursday that his country
and Russia have reached a high level of political and military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
the Greek defense chief was quoted by The Itar-Tass news agency
as saying that Russia-Greece cooperation rests on common stances
on security in the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean and Black
Sea regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said Greece is to buy anti-aircraft
systems, speed boats, inflatable cushions and electronic systems
in Russia, and will buy all arms and equipment in tenders, in
which Russia will participate.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the NATO expansion plan, Tsohatzopoulos said the
plan could be replaced by creation of regional security
institutions.
</P>
<P>
As for the admission to NATO of the Baltic republics and Balkan
states, he said the process "would take a great deal of time".
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister noted that a better alternative to NATO'
expansion is the creation of regional collective security
institutions heeding for interests of nations in these
territories.
</P>
<P>
Greece, as one of the member-states of NATO, stands for that a
renewed NATO should expand towards southeastern Europe and ensure
Euro-Atlantic security in a broader region, said Tsokhatzopoulos.
He also noted that NATO should take into account the position of
Russia and Ukraine on its expansion.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kosovo crisis, the minister said that Russia
and Greece should work out a joint position on the Kosovo
settlement, and the issue should be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Albanian minority should be granted
wide autonomy, without the option of seceding from Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister arrived in Moscow Tuesday for a working
visit. He had met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other
Russian top military and political officials.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister

countries to intensify cooperation and solidarity among
themselves so as to enhance the continent's economic and

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation sees
the Security Council resolution on Kosovo as "a well-balanced
document", while noting that it opposes the enhancement of
sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Russian Mission to the U.N.
on Thursday, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the
resolution was "a well-balanced document aimed at preventing
escalation of tension and promoting a political settlement of the
conflict in Kosovo, based on territorial integrity of the FRY
(Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)".
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said: "We have resolutely opposed
enhancement of sanctions, particularly economic, which may be
fraught with most dire implications for the whole Balkan region as
well as for many other states.
</P>
<P>
"All states and international organizations concerned should
exert their efforts to foster and promote the political process,
support the dialogue as much as possible, and prevent backslide."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Security Council adopted a draft resolution
sponsored by Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal,
Sweden and the U.S. to impose an arms embargo on Yugoslavia,
urging it to take further steps to achieve a political solution to
the issue of Kosovo through dialogue.

development of Sino-British relations not only conforms to the
interests of the peoples of the two countries, but also conduces
to world peace and stability," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches importance to building
long-term and stable relations of friendship and cooperation with
Britain" because the two countries share broad common interests,
he told Blair.
</P>
<P>
The economy of the two countries are complementary to each
other and the potential for economic and trade cooperation is
great with a vast prospect, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Blair told Zhu that China has an important position in the
world and is an important force in international arena. "Britain
is ready to cooperate with China and further consolidate and
develop British-Chinese relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister also expressed his willingness to
build more and closer links with China in various fields, which is
in the interest of both peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Britain supports China in entering the World Trade
Organization and will make efforts to that end," Blair stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he is looking forward to visiting
China this autumn. He also invited President Jiang Zemin to visit
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China "welcomes investment from British enterprises
to jointly develop the central and western part of China."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the two governments will take common
measures to support their enterprises, including medium and
small-sized ones, in cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to see cooperation in financial fields and will
take positive consideration of the requirement from the British
side on developing financial and insurance business in China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also met with South Korean Presidnet Kim Dae-jung,
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who are also here to attend the second
Asia-Europe meeting, separately on Thursday and exchanged views
with them on the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Zhu is on a three-day official visit to Britain which ends
later Thursday. He will then attend the second Asia-Europe meeting
to be held in London on Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Peace Process in Angola Not Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Angola
has not been completed as scheduled, U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt told reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said March 31 was to have marked the conclusion of the
1994 Lusaka Protocol, but that did not prove to be the case. Radio
Vorgan of the National Union of the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) continued to broadcast in spite of assurance given by
UNITA that it would cease on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The telephone conversations that was to have taken place on
March 31 between UNITA leader and Angolan President did not occur
for what were described as "technical reasons", the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the deadline for completing the peace process had not
been met, the process was still moving forward, Carlos said. The
Security Council of the United Nations was scheduled to consider
the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola at
the end of April, he added.

<HEADLINE> AL Rejects Israel's Suggestion on S.Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Thursday declared
its rejection of the Israeli proposal to pull out from south
Lebanon with "crippling conditions," the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Arab League Secretary General Ahmad Ben Heli told
reporters that the recent Israeli proposal in fact involved
"ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
"Israel aims at covering its arbitrary policies vis a vis the
peace process and driving a wedge in the Arab ranks especially the
unity of the Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AL official expected that the Israeli government would
launch an intensive, misleading media campaign on the various
arenas.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated full Arab support for Lebanon's efforts to
exercise its sovereignty over its territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel's inner security cabinet Wednesday approved a
20-year-old U.N. resolution, which calls for Israel to withdraw
its troops from south Lebanon, but linked the pullout to security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded south Lebanon in 1978 and then in 1985
proclaimed the area a so-called security zone there to protect its
northern towns from any attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have rejected the Israeli initiative, saying
that 1978 Security Council Resolution 425 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Damascus, which wants to regain the strategic
Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in 1967, has little
interest in reducing the pressure on Israeli forces in the
15-kilometer wide border zone in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Businessmen Deported from S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of
Sierra Leone has ordered the deportation of 22 foreign
businessmen living in the country for their alleged assistance to
the former military junta, the State Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 deportees, 21 are Lebanese and one is believed to be
Guinean national.
</P>
<P>
According to an official press release, the S.leonean
government wishes to express its concern about the behavior of
certain individuals who in no small measure contributed to the
current economic hardship and insecurity Sierra Leoneans are
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
The police alleged that these people are highly involved with
the dislodged military junta in fighting against the restoration
of May.
</P>
<P>
They are also accused of violating the economic sanctions and
embargo imposed by west African countries and importing arms and
ammunition for the junta.
</P>
<P>
The development is said to give a surprise to the Lebanese
ambassador to Sierra Leone, who said he was still waiting for the
official notification from the Sierra Leonean foreign ministry
before making a statement.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese businessmen hold a lion's share in Sierra Leone's
economic activities, particularly in the field of commerce and
trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Attorney-General Amos
Wako Thursday announced the list of members of the long-waited
Constitution Review Committee with several leading opposition
lawmakers included, Kenya News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The aim (of the committee) is to ensure that the
constitutional review process reflects the views of the widest
possible range of Kenyans and enjoys their confidence," the
report quoted a statement from Wako's office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prominent opposition leaders like Raila Odinga of the National
Development Party, Charity Ngilu of the Social Democratic Party
and Richard Leakey of the Safina Party were included in the
panel.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 24 committee members are from the
opposition, said the report.
</P>
<P>
On the list are also Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, East
African and Regional Cooperation Minister Nicholas Biwott and
Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho who is also the Secretary-General
of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU).
</P>
<P>
The committee will meet next Tuesday to decide "the date and venue
for wide and extensive consultations with all interested parties
concerned with the constitutional review process," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, starting his fifth and last
term in office at the beginning of this year, said Tuesday that
the constitutional review was central to the program of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"I urge (parliamentary) members to move with speed to smooth
the way towards an orderly and peaceful debate of our
constitution," Moi was quoted by the statement as saying.

<HEADLINE> China, EU Hold First Summit in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The first summit between China and
the European Union was held here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji held talks with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, whose country is holding the current EU
presidency, and European Commission President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that this is a historic meeting which they
believed will add vitality to the further development of China-EU
relations.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts of both sides, the relations between
China and the EU as well as EU member states have enjoyed sound
development in recent years, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have increased contacts of high-ranking officials
and political dialogues, while their trade relations have seen
steady progress. Cooperation and exchanges in the fields of
science and technology, education and culture have been expanded.
</P>
<P>
The EU, an important force on the international political and
economic stage, will surely become an important pole in the
multi-polar world, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China supports the EU for a more positive role in international
affairs and attaches importance to developing relations with the
EU and its member states, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides share many similar or identical views on major
international issues and bear important responsibilities in
safeguarding world peace and stability, as well as in promoting
common economic development, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and EU leaders should take a broad and long-term
view and take advantage of the common points of their respective
interests, so as to work for an overall development of the China-EU
relations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Santer briefed Zhu on the recently-adopted documents of the
EU's China policy. The document, he said, aims at further
promoting the EU-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu welcomed the new EU policy on China. He said China attaches
great importance to its relations with the EU and is ready to make
joint efforts with the EU to push their bilateral ties to a new
level.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed the hope of
establishing a mechanism to hold regular meetings between Chinese
and EU leaders. Zhu agreed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the globalization of world economy,
economic and trade links between countries and regions have become
ever closer. Deepening economic and technological cooperation is
an important aspect of the China-EU relations, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that China and the EU have made considerable
progress in strengthening their economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed economic and trade cooperation and
China's accession to the World Trade Organization and cooperation in
the financial field.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that they have gradually achieved a consensus
on many issues after years of consultation and talks.
</P>
<P>
They said they should make full use of the existing mechanism
of bilateral trade consultation and cooperation to explore a
long-term plan and measures to further consolidate their economic,
trade and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement was issued after the summit.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls on Israel to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Bassem Al-Sabaa on Thursday called on Israel to resume peace talks
with Lebanon and Syria from where they were left off, Lebanese
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabaa said after a cabinet meeting that the Israeli proposal
on conditional troop withdrawal from south Lebanon breached the
U.N. resolution 425, which actually calls for unconditional
Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of an Israeli diplomatic campaign in which it seems
intended to withdraw from south Lebanon and west Bekka, but in
fact it is working to violate Lebanon's sovereignty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabaa called on Israel to return to the negotiating table
with Lebanon and Syria under the land-for-peace principle which
was reached in the 1991 Madrid Middle East peace conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the security-for-peace policy adopted by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has proved futile in that only peace
can lead to security, not the contrary.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the Lebanese government is ready to reopen
peace negotiations with Israel from where they were left off.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon since 1985 as a self-proclaimed security zone to
protect its northern region from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israeli inner cabinet formally announced that it
accepted the resolution 425 and planned to withdraw from south
Lebanon provided security arrangements are worked out with the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabaa said it is impossible for the Lebanese army to provide
Israel with security and work for Israeli forces. The Lebanese
government is only responsible for its people, not for Israelis,
he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the Israeli demand to extend safety to its allied South
Lebanese Army (SLA), the minister said that in so doing, it would
mean that the Lebanese government punishes the resistance movement
defending Lebanon and awards those serving the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong pro-Israeli SLA is helping Israeli occupying
forces patrol the security zone. Its commander, Antoine Lahd, has
been sentenced to death for treason by a Lebanese court in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Lebanese and Syrian have been
suspended since the hardline Netanyahu government came to power in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been accusing Syria of holding south Lebanon as a
bargaining chip in pressing Israel to return the Golan Heights it
seized in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Highly Speaks of Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Thursday
highly spoke of the privatization it has pursued since it took
power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Ackim Nkole
said that the privatized companies are now making positive
contributions to the economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop held here to assess the impact of
privatization on the national economy, he said that though
privatization has been unpopular due to retrenchments, the
process has helped to boost the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "On surface the privatization program seems
unpopular especially in terms of retrenchments, the long term
benefits of privatization far outweighs the short term negative
effects of retrenchments."
</P>
<P>
The government is still convinced that companies would perform
much better in private hands than under government control, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the objectives of the privatization program is to
protect and create productive employment and that of resucitating
and revitalizing the operations of parastatal companies to
efficient productive levels to enable them contribute positively
to economic growth," he said.
 " Technical Director of the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA),
Stuart Cruichshank, told the workshop that the productivity has
improved in the 224 privatized companies and units.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZPA will privatize the remaining 100 companies and
units in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Nkole refuted reports that there have been many redundancies
as a result of the privatization process, saying that of the
61,000 redundancies that occurred between 1992 and 1996, only
3,000 were as a result of privatization.
</P>
<P>
According to the minsiter, 60 percent of the companies which
have been privatized in the country have been sold to Zambians.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Makes Case for More Base Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Thursday that 20 billion U.S. dollars annually could be
spent on updating America's military prowess if lawmakers approve
two new rounds of closings.
</P>
<P>
"Our need is clear and compelling. The Department of Defense
has more base capacity than is required to meet the needs of our
fighting forces," Cohen said at a Pentagon briefing for releasing
a report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that unless cuts are made, "It will effect our
capacity to have the finest military in the world."
</P>
<P>
The past four rounds of closings will save nearly 30 billion
U.S. dollars by 2003, but achieve a net savings of 25 billion U.S.
dollars after costs for the shutdowns are factored in, according
to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Two new rounds of closures could save money for purchasing
weapons that are still in the development stages, such as two
next-generation aircraft carriers, 12 of the Navy's planned
surface combat ships, or 450 Joint Strike Fighter jets for the Air
Force, he said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Egypt's Sandstorm-Related Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Strong sandstorm sweeping Egypt
early Thursday has caused a road accident that left nine people
dead and nine others injured and diverted some flights.
</P>
<P>
In Giza, the city adjacent Cairo, a mini bus collided with a
taxi because of poor visibility of about 100 meters, leaving nine
people dead and nine injured.
</P>
<P>
The storm also shut down the Cairo International Airport for
two hours, along with a series of airports southward along the
Nile river.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted EgyptAir official
Ibrahim Abderabbou as saying that seven flights destined for Cairo
were forced to divert to other airports.
</P>
<P>
The official said flights coming from Saudi Arabia bound for
Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada airports, had to return to
Jeddah, a Saudi Red Sea port city.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm with a wind velocity of about 64 kilometers per
hour, caused a rise in temperature between six and seven degrees
centigrade Celsius across the country.
</P>
<P>
Seasonal sandstorms, known as khamseen in Arabic meaning
50-day wind, batter Egypt every spring, sending sand from the
Western Desert and Libya to the country and blanketing cities and
towns with yellow sand and dust.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the sandstorms hit harder and more often than
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorms started a couple of weeks ago this year and are
expected to blow on until late April.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Establish Virtual Securities System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's provincial securities
regulators are expected to sign an agreement in the next two days
to set up a "virtual" national securities commission this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Thursday that the regulators will sign the pact in
principle in Quebec city, and then take it back to each provincial
commission for ratification.
</P>
<P>
A virtual commission would mean a national one-stop shopping
system for securities regulation, which is now under several
provincial jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Years of efforts to establish a national securities commission
in Canada have failed because of turf battles between the
provinces, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new system is made possible by new technology and voluntary
measures aimed at reducing duplication and harmonizing rules.
</P>
<P>
The system is expected to reduce costs for regulators and
public market participants.
</P>
<P>
It should also bring better enforcement and more attention to
compliance on rules such as public disclosure.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Cement Friendship With China by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhang Dacheng, Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Enjoying a cordial
relationship with China, Tanzania is keen to learn experiences
from China's social-economic reforms in order to expand
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, President Benjamin
Mkapa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"China has excelled in its policy of economic reforms and has
achieved rapid economic growth since the early 1990s" and
remained stable in the wake of the Southeast Asia financial
crisis, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua at the State House, he
said Tanzania would like to take a leaf from China's experience
in economic restructuring, especially the role of the private
sector in energizing economic growth and international trade.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa will pay a six-day official visit to China from April 8
at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is eagerly interested in fostering trade, economic
and technical cooperation with China," he said. "We are equally
keen in establishing joint ventures, attracting Chinese investors
and further strengthening education and cultural cooperation."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the first since he was elected Tanzanian
President in 1995, Mkapa said he will lead a 35-member delegation
of officials and businessmen to visit an inland province with
rich agriculture experience and a well developed Special Economic
Zone in the eastern coast which piloted the reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Remarking on the present situation of the relations between
Tanzania and China, Mkapa said the warm friendship between the
two countries has grown over more than three decades and is
nourished by a solid foundation of mutual respect, common values
and similar concerns on international issues.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed gratitude to the assistance China has
extended to Tanzania over the past 30 years, praising the 1860-km
Tanzania-Zambia Railway built under the aid of the Chinese
government in the 1970s as a monumental contribution to Tanzania,
Zambia and the region as whole.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese-aided projects, such as the Urakfiki Textile
Mill, the Ubungo Farm Implement, the Kiwira Coal Mine and the
Zanzibar-based Mahonda Sugar Factory, have also helped greatly
local economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since a visit to Tanzania by the then Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
of China in 1995, Tanzania and China have begun a process of
rehabilitating the projects by forming joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-China Friendship Textile Co. Ltd, formed in April
1997 on the basis of the 30-year-old Urakfiki Textile Mill, has
so far handed over 2.2 million US dollars in profits to the
Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, 59, who visited China as a minister in 1987 and 1993
respectively, will be the third Tanzanian President to visit
China following his predecessors Ali Hassan Mwinyi and Julius
Nyerere, the founder of the nation who established the diplomatic
relationship with late Chairman Mao Zedong of China on April 26,
1964.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Tanzania and China have endured and
prospered by regular exchange of visits not only by Tanzanian
leaders, but also by Chinese leaders including late Premier Zhou
Enlai in 1965 and the then Premier Li Peng in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trade between Tanzania and China has
developed steadily in recent years with a trade volume of 102.1
million US dollars in 1997, a 22.1 percent over the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Winds Up African Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton of the
United States Thursday left Dakar, capital of Senegal, for
Washington, ending his six-nation African tour which also took
him to Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Clinton visited the slavery island of
Goree on the Senegalese coast, one of the shipping points of the
notorious slave trade in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his Senegalese counterpart President Abudou
Diouf, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid a visit to a former
slave prison, now a museum, from where hundreds of thousands of
African slaves started the hard journey to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
Probably buoyed by a victory in a sex scandal lawsuit, the
U.S. president made a farewell speech on the shore of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
In what is described as somewhat the most emotional comment
since the beginning of his African trip 12 days ago, Clinton paid
tribute to the suffering of the slaves and to the role played
today by the 30 million Americans descended from them.
</P>
<P>
But he did not offer the U.S. apology for the slave trade as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the U.S. president spoke highly of the achievements
African people have made and said he had seen the future of
Africa in the faces of people he met during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised the U.S. would work together with Africa to
"set up a partnership based on friendship and respect" and build
"a bright common destiny whose door is open to all".
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Dakar Tuesday night, he had a discussion
with President Diouf the following day and visited the military
base in Thies, 70 km east of the capital, where U.S. military
personnel are training Senegalese troops for a proposed
all-Africa peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the African peacekeeping force seems to
be the message Clinton wanted to convey to Africa, and the world
as well, during his stay in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Democracy, education, trade and environmental protection were
the major topics of Clinton on the other lags of the 12-day trip.
</P>
<P>
In his farewell speech, Clinton did not made something new in
the economic front as widely expected, although he touched on the
trade between Africa and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, the U.S. imports as much oil from Africa
as from the entire Gulf region and exports as much to Africa as
to the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Before he went to Goree, Clinton met African political
activists who briefed him on human rights and democracy in their
countries, including Nigeria and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The presidential couple also visited Dakar's main mosque as a
gesture to the role of Islam in Senegal, a former French colony.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Central Register Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (xinhua) -- The central register of business
establishments project was launched here Thursday to assist the
central statistical office in regularly and comprehensively updating
the register so as to improve the accuracy of the economic
statistics produced.
</P>
<P>
The project is meant to be a database, holding basic information on
all formal sector business establishments in the country and is the
frame for all the economic statistics survey being undertaken at the
central statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The central register of business establishments project is to last
for two years from January this year, after which the central bureau
of statistics will be expected to sustain the activities of this
project and turn it into entirely its routine statistical activity.
</P>
<P>
Launching the German-sponsored project, Zambian Deputy Finance
Minister G. Simasiku said that the Zambian government is undertaking
various economic reform programs under the structural adjustment
program.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, some new enterprises have come up, while some have
closed down and others have gone into liquidation," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the accuracy of the economic statistics
which use the register as a sampling frame, a complete and regular
updating of the central register of business units should be
undertaken regularly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The updated basic information can be used as an indicator
of the size of the formal sector economy in Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also used for planning and policy formulation by various
users such as Zambia revenue authority, Ministry of Commerce, Trade
and Industry, NGOs," Simasiku said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe sustained their recent bullish mood and ended at fresh
record highs Thursday, driven by a strong dollar which means
cheaper exports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares finished 35.2 points
or 0.58 percent higher at 6,052.8, its second consecutive closing
record high, supported by derivatives-related trading, buying by
cash-rich institutions and a weaker-than-expected UK distributive
trade survey.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that telecom and chemical sectors were among the
most active areas.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris also staged a bullish run, lifted by
Wall Street's overnight gains and a firmer dollar, finishing the
session 52.57 points or 1.35 percent up at 3,935.88, its third
consecutive record high session.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt had a same story and closed at a
record high at 5,176.66, up 22.45 points or 0.44 percent on the
DAX-30 index.
</P>
<P>
The market was driven by the strength of the dollar and gains
in the auto and financial stocks, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Picks Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
moved up to 4.7 percent in March, the Labor Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of U.S. jobs dropped
by 36,000, the first decline since January 1996, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
The monthly unemployment rate is slightly higher than
February's 24-year-low of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the March drop in jobs to an unusual
hiring pattern when extraordinary warm weather caused by the El
Nino current in the Pacific Ocean permitted construction to
continue through the winter in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
From October through February, job growth in this country was
unusually strong, averaging 345,000 a month after seasonal
adjustment. During the period, large numbers of construction
workers normally were laid off, explained a labor official.
</P>
<P>
After four months of very strong growth, construction payrolls
shrank by 88,000 jobs in March, the worst decline in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Factory payroll figures confirmed other reports suggesting that
a drop in exports to financially troubled Asia has slowed the
expansion of production. Factories increased jobs by only 3,000 in
March and 1,000 in February after adding 169,000 positions during
the previous four months.
</P>
<P>
The average workweek declined from 42 hours in February to 41.7
hours in March and is now a half hour shorter than its post-World
War II high reached last December.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the chilly weather in March caused a 48,000-job-drop
in retailing, mostly at restaurants and bars where seasonal hiring
fell below expectations.
</P>
<P>
However, some sectors continued to increase jobs at a robust
pace, including computer and data processing, engineering and
management and social services.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the finance industry created 19,000 new jobs,
stimulated by low mortgage rates and a strong stock market.
</P>
<P>
Though the unemployment rate slightly moved up, it remained at
an unusually favorable level. It has been at or below 5 percent
since last April. Reflecting continued demand for labor, average
hourly earnings rose a moderate 4 cents to a seasonally adjusted
12.63 dollars in March after climbing 7 cents in January.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Taliban to Ease Curbs on Aid Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has urged the
authority of Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban militia to ease
conditions for U.N. aid workers to continue their work in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here Friday, Carol Bellamy, head
of the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), said
that she had asked the Taliban authority, who clamped a strict
Islamic code on Afghanistan, to honor the principles of immunities
of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"It is very essential for the U.N. aid workers to continue
their mission in Afghanistan," she said, adding "the recognition
of this principle of immunity will need to be the subject of the
memorandum of understanding between Taliban and the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF head emphasized that the Taliban authority should
respect the norms and practices governing U.N. operations
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The recent (Taliban) edict on women working in Afghanistan is
totally unacceptable," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to a recent request by the Taliban, who now
control two-thirds of Afghanistan, that Muslim women working for
the U.N. in Afghanistan be accompanied by a close family member.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the Taliban authority had assured to give
equal access to education to girls and boys, men and women.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, who is heading a 19-member delegation, paid a two-day
visit beginning Wednesday, to Taliban-controlled areas including
the capital of Kabul. She held talks with senior Taliban officials
including Mohammad Rabbani, Chairman of the Taliban's Supreme
Council, on issues concerning education and health services in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Asian, European Leaders Kick off Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from 10 Asian countries and
15 European Union (EU) member states opened the Second Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM2) here Friday, aiming at closer cooperation between
the two continents.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the current EU president, said Europe and Asia shared many
things in common and the ASEM forum could help enhance cooperation
between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
"Europe and Asia have a relationship, which day by day grows
more closely interrelated," Blair said, citing that exports from
the European Union to Asia in 1996 totaled 204 billion
U.S. dollars, more than that from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Blair said that this conference must
build on the foundations laid in Bangkok, where the first ASEM was
held, adding "We, the political leadership of Europe and Asia,
must demonstrate to our peoples that we are working together,
deepening and broadening our cooperation to improve their lives."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we are building a new partnership between Europe and
Asia for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Asian side, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
expressed the confidence that the present Asian financial crisis
can be resolved properly with joint efforts by all sides
concerned. "The economic fundamentals in Asia remain sound," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help ease the financial crisis in Asia, Blair
announced that this summit is to launch an ASEM Trust Fund under
the auspices of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Such a fund will be able to offer technical support for
financial restructuring and to look at mechanisms for mobilizing
European expertise in structural reform to provide help to the
Asian economies," said Blair, host of summit.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the opening session of ASEM2, EU Commission
President Jacques Santer voiced the 15-nation bloc's confidence in
Asian economies despite the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Santer stressed that the momentum of this ASEM partnership has
steadily increased and there is the opportunity of deepening and
consolidating this process.
</P>
<P>
"We have the obligation of demonstrating the ASEM is a solid
partnership, important for our two regions not only in good times,
but also in times of difficulty," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
"We can be sure that with the combination of sound fundamentals
and sound policies this crisis will be mastered, and Asia can
again play the dynamic role in the world economy to which we have
all become accustomed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission chief made clear the EU's attitude toward the
Asian financial crisis by saying that the message from Europe is
"encouragement, solidarity and confidence."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also delivered a
speech at the opening session, promising that Japan will take
necessary economic measures to provide assistance to some affected
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, all the participants are expected to
discuss the Asian financial crisis and Asian-European economic
cooperation. The summit is likely to issue a statement on the
financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM leaders will also exchange views on issues ranging
from new ASEM membership, environment, international crimes, drugs
and consideration of fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ASEM2 conference are China, Japan, South Korea,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the EU Commission.

<HEADLINE> European Savings Banks Oppose EU's Money Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Savings Banks Group
(ESBG) Friday opposed a draft proposal for issuance of electronic
purses by non-banks.
</P>
<P>
The group, representing interests of more than 1,200 banks,
said in a statement, "The fact remains that money is collected
from the public by these (non-bank) issuers and that their
potential failure represents a risk for both users and receivers"
of payments.
</P>
<P>
The ESBG added that integrity of the payment systems could be
threatened by such stored-value chip cards.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive
body, is drafting legislation to allow non-banks to issue chip
cards, a banned practice in some countries, such as Germany.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body has also met opposition on this issue from
European central bankers, including Bundesbank President Hans
Tietmeyer.
</P>
<P>
The central bankers, who have objection to the proposal, are
expected to state their position soon in a long-awaited report
from the European Monetary Institute.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Chinese Finding New Work In Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese workers who have lost
their jobs have turned to rural areas for work even though many
others are still reluctant to leave state-owned enterprises or are
looking to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
One of these people, Wang Wei, of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, used to work in the Stele Forest Museum in Xi'an, the
provincial capital, but lost his job. So, he dabbled in business
and even ran a restaurant but met with little success.
</P>
<P>
Then he learned by chance that raising fine breeds of pigs had
great potential, so, last year, he and four of his friends managed
to pool two million yuan (240,000 US dollars) to set up a pig
farm. They visited Beijing and Shangdong Province, east China to
learn about raising pigs when they realized that they knew
absolutely nothing about the work.

<P>
They then imported 300 fine-strain pigs from Britain and
Denmark, and invited specialists from Northwest Agricultural
University to provide information.
</P>
<P>
Now, their nearly two-hectare pig farm has a good reputation
with its ability to get pigs to add 100 kilograms of weight in
four months, versus the local pigs which need eight months to gain
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
A second-phase is in the works to double the size of the seven
existing workshops to make the farm the largest in the province,
producing 10,000 pigs annually.
</P>
<P>
Many other workers who have been laid off come to the farm to
look for jobs, and Wang said, "We would have missed a lot of
opportunities if we had stayed in the city waiting for assistance
from the state."
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that there is a parallel phenomenon, as even
better-educated urbanites turn to rural areas as well, but the
surplus laborers in the countryside continue to flood into the
cities, experts said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Members of Congress signed letters to President Clinton
urging him not to make a public presentation of a Middle East
peace proposal that Israel opposes. They said that making it
public would leave little incentive for Yasir Arafat to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
-- The House majority leader urged Republicans to reject
President Clinton's request for 18 billion dollars in financing
for the International Monetary Fund. He said the financing would
encourage an unchecked expansion of the IMF's lending practices,
cost the nation billions of dollars and weaken world financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr vowed Thursday to
continue his aggressive pursuit of alleged misconduct by President
Clinton and others related to the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit, asserting that there is "no room for white lies" in sworn
testimony even though the underlying case has been thrown out.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite a national debate on reducing youth smoking,
American teenagers continue to light up in increasing numbers.
Overall, smoking rates among high school students rose by nearly a
third between 1991 and 1997, creeping up from 27.5 percent to 36.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted the Asian
financial crisis, which some cite as proof that unfettered markets
are dangerous, is likely to hasten the global trend toward free
markets, even in "socialistic economies of Africa."
</P>
<P>
-- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its outlook for
Japan's country ceiling and domestic-currency rating for the
government to negative from stable, sending the yen falling
against the dollar early Friday in Tokyo.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A replica of the "Pride of
Baltimore II" from the American state of Maryland made port call
today at Shanghai after a four-month and 12,000-nautical-mile voyage.
</P>
<P>
The original sailboat, which was built in 1812 and was known
for its speed, is still in existence and symbolizes the state's
seafaring history.
</P>
<P>
The replica, which was built in 1988, received a grand welcome
by the Shanghai Government. During its six-day stay in Shanghai,
the boat will pay a visit to the Container Headquarters of China
Ocean Shipping (Group) Corporation, an important customer of the
Maryland state.
</P>
<P>
It will also visit Xiamen, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and
ports in Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The state of Maryland has been building trade relations with
China. Last year, the state exported 100 million US dollars worth
of goods to China and many of its companies have joint ventures in
China. Last June, the state established an office in Shanghai, the
first representative office of an American state in China.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Taliban to Ease Curbs on Aid Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has urged the
authority of Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban militia to ease
conditions for U.N. aid workers to continue their work in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here Friday, Carol Bellamy, head
of the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), said
that she had asked the Taliban authority, who clamped a strict
Islamic code on Afghanistan, to honor the principles of immunities
of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"It is very essential for the U.N. aid workers to continue
their mission in Afghanistan," she said, adding "the recognition
of this principle of immunity will need to be the subject of the
memorandum of understanding between Taliban and the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF head emphasized that the Taliban authority should
respect the norms and practices governing U.N. operations
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The recent (Taliban) edict on women working in Afghanistan is
totally unacceptable," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to a recent request by the Taliban, who now
control two-thirds of Afghanistan, that Muslim women working for
the U.N. in Afghanistan be accompanied by a close family member.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the Taliban authority had assured to give
equal access to education to girls and boys, men and women.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, who is heading a 19-member delegation, paid a two-day
visit beginning Wednesday, to Taliban-controlled areas including
the capital of Kabul. She held talks with senior Taliban officials
including Mohammad Rabbani, Chairman of the Taliban's Supreme
Council, on issues concerning education and health services in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Census Counts Number of Transient Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A survey in November of last year
showed that there were 2.86 million transient people living in
China's capital, municipal government sources reported today.
</P>
<P>
That was the first census on those people in administrative
areas or in Chinese cities who have no permanent residence, but
who make their living in Beijing. It includes people from Hong
Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, there were 10.85 million permanent
Beijing residents and people living in outskirtan counties within
Beijing's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Transient people in suburban areas account for one fifth of the
population, but a ninth of the population in urban district
areas. Many of them come from adjacent Hebei province, central
China's Henan province, east China's Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui and
Zhejiang provinces, and southwestern Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
The census also showed that males accounted for 66.1 percent of
these migrant people, and the majority of women are young and
middle-aged, and 42.1 percent of them are unmarried.
</P>
<P>
Government sources say that these people have contributed a
considerable amount to Beijing's construction and economic growth,
and that many work in construction, the textile industry,
sanitation, handling coal, mining, retail sales, and household
services.
</P>
<P>
Others work in the fields of science, technology, business, and
the arts.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Share Prices Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in Seoul slumped on
Friday as foreign investors dumped stocks on worries that South
Korean exports would be hurt by a weaker yen.
</P>
<P>
The composite stock price index dropped by 19.21 points, or 4.2
percent, to close at 434.45 -- the lowest in the past two months
-- in the wake of the plunge in the Japanese yen against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean currency, the won, also closed sharply lower
in reaction to the yen's fall. The U.S. currency closed at 1,449
won, up from the previous day's close of 1,413 won.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to a six-year high against the yen after
Moody's Investor Service indicated it may downgrade Japanese
government debt because of the country's weak economy. The
U.S. currency rose as high as 135.20 yen -- its strongest since
April 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ratings agency changed its outlook for Japan's economy to
"negative" from the previous "stable" -- a sign it may be
considering lowering its appraisal of the Japan's ability to repay
its debts.
</P>
<P>
Turnover in Friday's Seoul stock markets amounted to 475.2
billion won (about 306.98 million U.S. dollars). A total of 63.15
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said foreign investors have been a major force
in Seoul market since the end of last year but have turned sharply
bearish in the past few days.

Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported Friday.
</P>

</P>

Work of the project had already begun in 11 districts while 47
other districts would also start the program soon, he stated.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in S. Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- With no peace activities going
on, armed clashes over the control of the key positions in
Somalia's southern port town of Kismaio continued Friday between
the allied militiamen of Majerter, Ogaden and Dhulbahante on one
side and the ousted militiamen from the Marehan subclan on the
other.
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of Kismaio, 500 km south of the capital
Mogadishu, armed confrontations renewed between the warring sides
Friday afternoon. The armed clashes started in the village of
Gobwein, nine km north of Kismaio, where sources said at least
five people were killed and more than six others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to radio reports from the area, the allied
militiamen of Kismaio launched the attack at 16:00 local time in
retaliation for Monday's unprecedented attack in which more than
30 people were killed and over 70 others were wounded inside the
town of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
More than seven battle wagons mounted with anti-aircraft heavy
machine guns, mortar shells and rocket propelled grenades and
nearly 300 armed militiamen from both sides were involved in the
90-minute fighting in and outside the village of Gobwein Friday.
The ousted Marehan militiamen maintain a strong base in Gobwein.
</P>
<P>
There is no word of victory from any of the warring sides so
far. However, in their reprisal motives it is known that each
side is still planning to launch more attacks on the militia
bases of the other after the formerly neutral sides joined the
clashes, further weakening the possibility of peaceful settlement
for Kismaio's crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the town of Kismaio has been shelled by the
Marehan militiamen from outside the town. Nevertheless, there
are no reports of casualties caused by the heavy rounds of the
artillery even though the loud noise has terrorized the town
residents.
</P>
<P>
With considerable care, business activities are returning back
to normal as milk and vegetables started to reach the town.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The first assembly of Global
Environment Facility (GEF) ended here Friday after adopting the
New Delhi Statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement has recognized that the GEF is the multilateral
funding mechanism dedicated to promoting global environmental
protection within a framework of sustainable development by
providing new and additional grant and concessional funding.
</P>
<P>
It said that its beneficiaries are all people of the globe, and
that the need for the GEF is even greater as "we enter the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the GEF activities should be
country-driven and efforts should be strengthened to achieve
country ownership of GEF projects. The GEF activities should be
based on national priorities designed to support sustainable
development and the global environment.
</P>
<P>
GEF, formed in 1991, embraces 161 member countries and various
international organizations the world over. It addresses global
environmental issues that do not normally get funded through
national, bilateral and international finance. Following its
restructure and replenishment in 1994, it has emerged as the
principal international funding mechanism for the global
environment.

LOKICHOKIO, Kenya, April 3 (Xinhua) -- She looked much younger
than her nine-year-old age, short and thin, with burns in the
left face, and bandages wrapped up in the whole back and upper
legs.
</P>
<P>
She was lying prostrate, like a silent lamb, never groaning
during our nearly 20-minute stay at her bed. Her mother lies on
the next bed, suffering from a bomb wound in the head.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which blasted the house little Ayual Thiep lived in
Adet village in southern Sudan on March 19, killed her
grandmother on the spot. Ayual and her mother were flied to the
Lopiding Hospital last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tent hospital, located in dry and hot northern Kenyan town
of Lokichokio, some 25 kilometers away from southern Sudan's vast
swamp, was set up by the International Committee of Red Cross
(ICRC) in 1986 mainly to receive war-wounded Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
From 1987 to 1997, the hospital, the largest set up by the Red
Cross worldwide, has treated more than 14,000 people, most of
whom Sudanese hurt by gun shots, bombs, grenades or landmines. In
1997 alone, there were nearly 5,000 surgical operations done in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Bombing is quite frequent in my village, two or three times
within one week recently. Many people in the village lost their
family members like I did," said Ayual's mother.
</P>
<P>
"Now my home was totally destroyed. My husband and other
children have to sleep under the trees and eat leaves and tree
fruits. Maybe after Ayual and I go back, we will have to build a
new house," she went on.
</P>
<P>
It's very hard to imagine how they can go home when there is
now nothing left of their house.
</P>
<P>
"I can't feel safe until my family re-united," said the mother
in a placid tone. "Anyway, the war has lasted so long that it
becomes part of our daily life. We get used to it."
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in 1983 between the Moslem-ruled Khartoum
government in the north and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) fighting for more autonomy in the animist and
Christian-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1.3 million Sudanese have been killed by the
war and consequent famines. Another 365,000 are now living on
alien lands as refugees.
</P>
<P>
As fighting continued in Wau and Awiel, southern Sudan, in
early February this year, about 150,000 innocent civilians have
been displaced, according to the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
"The war is very bad. Everybody is bombed. Everybody is
suffering," said John Lomori bitterly. He was admitted to the
hospital on February 3 after a grenade was thrown into his house
one night late January, killing his wife and two of his seven
children. Lomori was wounded on the chin.
</P>
<P>
"I want to go home as soon as possible. My mother now looks
after my children for me. I should go back and help her," he
said. He is from the Anzara town in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Although a new round of face-to-face peace talks between the
Khartoum government and the SPLA was scheduled to be held in
Kenya's capital Nairobi late April, the dawn of peace seems only
glimmering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
"The warring sides are not ready for either negotiations or
peace. They just want to gain time," sighed Gerald Bessen, the
ICRC chief in the hospital, adding that fightings even became
heavier ahead of or during the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It was said that in Yei, a strategic town in southern Sudan,
residents dare not walk one mile away from home to cultivate
crops in fear of landmines. U.N. data estimate that at least one
million landmines are yet to blow up across southern Sudan's
extensive savanna.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, starvation begins to bite in the war-devastated
southern Sudan where tens of thousands are now surviving on wild
foods and malnutrition was rampant, said the Operation Lifeline
Sudan (OLS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A World Vision survey team said Friday that 40 children died
of hunger last month while some 200 children showed signs of
severe malnutrition in Jur River areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, bilharzia and skin diseases
also reportedly wreak havoc there due to lack of clean water and
poor sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients' wounds had been infected before they
arrived at the Lopiding hospital, said Head Nurse Toril Parelius.
She noted that it often took the wounded at least one week or
even up to two months to be taken to the hospital by rescue
planes.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most of the hospital inmates, many of whom
amputees, still yearn to return home, instead of being sent to a
refugee camp some 100 kilometers away from Lokichokio, said the
Norwegian nurse.
</P>
<P>
Usually the Red Cross sent the discharged Sudaneses back by
air. But such flights have been suspended for 15 months due to
insecurity, which has held up about 100 discharged in the tent
hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross is expecting to have the flights resumed in
mid-April with access to 14 locations inside the largest African
country, including seven in the south, if a final agreement is
reached between ICRC, Khartoum and SPLA, said Bessen.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, an organization with a history of 135 years, has a
big trace network inside Sudan and has helped 15,175 Sudanese
families reunite from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996. Several
wounded people found their family members in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The war in Sudan, with all its complexities, has dragged on
for 14 years. The Sudanese people, tortured by the seemingly
endless fightings while their pray for peace long unanswered,
have to resort to their final consolation -- to go home and unite
with their family, live or die.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on Democracy Development in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, stressed here
Friday that the development of democracy in Hong Kong must comply
with the timetable set in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Tung made these remarks at a meeting with a delegation from the
British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee led by its
Chairman Donald Anderson here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In response to reference made by the delegation to an alleged
quote from previous visitors on his views on the length of the
evolutionary process to universal suffrage, Tung clarified that he
did not, and indeed could not, specify any time frame at this
early stage.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the democratic evolutionary process was enshrined
in the Basic Law, which set forth a 10-year timetable for
respective elections of the Chief Executive and the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
"The basic Law provides that further democratic evolution after
2007 will depend on the wishes of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"Such evolution must be in the best interests of the Hong Kong
people and must preserve the factors contributing to our continued
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that while universal suffrage should "remain our
ultimate objective, we should not lose sight of other important
elements of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"Democracy includes also an accountable government, the rule of
law, the right to form political parties, and the freedom of
speech. We are very conscious of the need to uphold all these and
we are fully committed to doing so," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tung also briefed the visitors on the
latest economic developments in Hong Kong. He said since last
October, Hong Kong had met with economic challenges brought about
by the Asian financial turmoil and was fortunate to be able to
press ahead with its development projects as planned.
</P>
<P>
"We have introduced immediate measures in the Budget as a means
to stimulate local economy and assist the people in the difficult
times," Tung said.

BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, on Friday approved a package
of humanitarian aid worth 86 million ECU (100 million
U.S. dollars) for former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The aid, which will be managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will mainly support the repatriated or
displaced persons and refugees.
</P>
<P>
It will enable humanitarian organizations, such as United Nations
agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and
non-governmental organizations, to carry out a coordinated program
until the end of February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said in a statement that with the aid, it would
also continue to support the health system in the Serbian Province
of Kosovo. But it said it would maintain its readiness to
intervene should the humanitarian situation there deteriorate.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Welcomes Foreign Hotel Management Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Experts note that Hainan Province
will be required to attract foreign hotel management companies to
improve the management quality of related facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, a popular tropical tourist destination, is home to 338
high quality hotels and holiday resorts, including 224 operations
designated to serve foreign tourists. However, less than 10
percent of the hotels are managed by hotel management companies.
</P>
<P>
The lack of professional management has resulted in low profit
margins for a number of hotels and frequent management changes in
others.
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, a large number of hotels managed by
foreign companies, including US-based Westin, Mandarin of
Singapore, and Gloria and Tide of Hong Kong, are operating
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"Relying on international hotel management giants to improve
both management and service levels, and provide a competitive edge
will be extremely important for Hainan's hotel industry,"
according to hotel experts.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees with Indonesian Govt Move Not to Bail Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Indonesian government have agreed that the
government will not take over the private sector's foreign debts,
estimated at 74 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There is no intention (both from the IMF and the Indonesian
government) that the country's private sector foreign debts be
shifted to the government," IMF's First Deputy Managing Director
Stanley Fischer said here Friday after a one-and-a-half hours
meeting with President Soeharto at the latter's residence in
Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing talks between the IMF and the Indonesian
government which started on March 18, Fischer said both sides are
making progress in their talks and are close to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed on almost all issues, although some work still
needs to be done on the 74 billion U.S. dollars private sector
external debts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks centered on a model used by Mexico in the
early 1980s, which gave Mexican companies a grace period of two to
three years to repay their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
"The details are very complicated and will take time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Until December 31, 1997, Indonesia's external debts amounted to
137.424 billion U.S. dollars, with 63.462 billion dollars incurred
by the government and state-run companies, and 73.926 billion
dollars by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held that the private sector's debt was one of
the main causes for the monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar since July last year. This has
caused most state-owned and private companies to become technical
bankrupt as their foreign debts surpass their equities.
</P>
<P>
Fischer expressed the hope that a letter of intent will be
signed within next week.
</P>
<P>
An agreement between the IMF and the Indonesian government will
mean the release of the second 3 billion U.S. dollars tranche of
the IMF-led 43 billion dollars rescue package to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997, the IMF agreed to provide Indonesia a
23-billion- dollar aid package in exchange for the implementation
of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the IMF will provide 10 billion dollars,
the World Bank 4.5 billion dollars, the Asian Development Bank 3.5
billion dollars and the Indonesian government 5 billion dollars.
Many other countries have also promised to provide bilateral aid
to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the IMF disbursed the first tranche of the
aid package worth 3 billion dollars, with the second tranche
scheduled for March 15, 1998 following a review of economic
reforms carried out by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, however, was not satisfied with the reforms that have
been implemented, and has since held the funds, pending completion
of fresh talks.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss and
the Indonesian officials have been negotiating since March 18 to
review the country economic reforms. They have discussed
Indonesia's monetary policies, banking reform, state budget and
subsidy, structural reform as well as private sector overseas
debts.

<HEADLINE> UN Proposes Programs to Deal With Impact of Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
have proposed some programs to deal with forest fires in
Indonesia's east Kalimantan province and their impact on the
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer said here Friday the
programs concern how to deal with the forest fires, solve social
problems (including food problem) and prevent the fires from
spreading to other areas, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the three-month-long fires in the
province have razed more than 150,000 hectares of forest this year
and are raging out of control amid a prolonged drought. The losses
of the forest fires have reached 256 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have fallen ill from the smoke that has
blanketed the region while rare wildlife species, including the
endangered orangutan, are threatened by the fires.
</P>
<P>
To implement the programs, UNEP will also cooperate with the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) and other UN agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Food Program has pledged to make available
funds totaling 2 billion U.S. dollars to deal with the food
problem.
</P>
<P>
Topfer, who arrived here last Sunday, will stay in Indonesia
until April 16 to gather as much information as possible from
various sources regarding the condition of the fire-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed he will bring the information for discussion at a
meeting in Geneva on April 20-21 to decide further steps on how to
handle the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests were ravaged by
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia, which caused
a loss of more than 3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Suspends Power Rate Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
ordered here on Friday the suspension of the proposed hike in
power rates by the National Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the National Power Corporation's decision of
increasing power rates in Luzon, the northern Philippines,
starting in May this year will be fully reviewed by the Department
of Energy and the Energy Regulatory Board.
</P>
<P>
"The review will look at all the angles, not just financial but
also economic in general, productivity, as well as the interest of
consumers," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the National Power Corporation will raise its
power rates in Luzon by 20.4 centavos (some 50 U.S. cents) per
kilowatt-hour due to the increase in fuel prices last January and
the depreciation of the peso since last July.
</P>
<P>
Although the increase of power rates has been temporarily
shelved, Ramos, however, called on the public to understand the
situation of the National Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"It is a state agency involved in generating, transmitting and
distributing power which has a very big debt and so it would want
to increase its earnings so that it can reduce its debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also announced that starting Saturday, Petron
Corporation, one of the three major players in the Philippine oil
industry, will reduce the pump prices of its three major petroleum
products, namely premium gasoline, unleaded gasoline and diesel.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in fuel oil prices is expected to help bring down
the power rates in the country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urged PNA to Stop Inciting Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Friday urged Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to
stop inciting terror in the aftermath of Hamas activist's death.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign diplomats in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said the
PNA should stop immediately the "irresponsible" statements, which
claimed Israel was behind the killing of leading Hamas bombmaker
Muhei Eddine Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that Israel had noting to do with
Sharif 's death, noting that Sharif was killed in an accident.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was found dead Sunday night near the site of a car bomb
explosion in an industrial zone in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Sharif was killed with shots to his
chest before the explosion, accusing Israel of having carried out
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted that the car rigged with explosives was
intended by Hamas for a terror attack in Israel and Sharif was
killed by an accidental explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has vowed to carry out more terror attacks against
Israel to avenge Sharif's death. Its political leader in the Gaza
Strip said that more suicide bombing attacks were likely, noting
that "Hamas will not neglect its martyrs."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged the PNA to take measures to fight terrorism and
dismantle the infrastructure of Hamas in the territories. He also
warned that if there is a terrorist attack, Israel will hold the
PNA responsible because "it incites and inflames passions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk said
Friday that the security forces will remain on high alert
throughout the country until May for the possibility of terror
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Uganda: Smuggling Threatens Fish Export to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda fish export to Congo was
threatened by rampant smuggling, the Monitor paper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chairman of Uganda Fisheries and Fish
Conservation Association (UFFCA) Seremos Kamuturaki as saying
that smuggling immature fish at Uganda-Congo border has
jeopardized Ugandan fish export to its neighbor on the west.
</P>
<P>
Kamuturaki said that UFFCA has signed an agreement with the
Association des Vendeurs des Poissons, a potential fish buyer at
Goma in eastern Congo on exporting 10 tons of fresh Nile perch,
five tons of dried salted Nile perch, two tons of dried salted
tilapia and 1.5 tons of sun dried mukene, a local fish.
</P>
<P>
But the condition of the deal was jeopardized by smuggling
immatured fish at Uganda-Congo border, he said.
</P>
<P>
A matured Nile perch is at least some meter long and weighs
three kilograms. But it was reported that visitors have found
immature Nile perch with its length only 15 centimeters (six
inches) on the market in Ishasha, south-western Rugungiri
district.
</P>
<P>
Kamuturaki called on the government to stop the smuggling by
legal means.
</P>
<P>
In response to his appeal, C. Dhatemwa, Commissioner for
Fisheries, directed fishery officers in the concerned districts
to investigate the issue and prosecute those involved in illegal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Fish export is one of the main foreign exchange earners in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The main consumer of Uganda's fish is Spain and other European
Union countries. The main product exported to the EU countries is
frozen Nile perch.
</P>
<P>
But Uganda also exports fish products to its neighbors
including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Kenya and
Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's space technology has won
the confidence of overseas contractors after 50 rocket launches,
worldwide experts in the field and diplomats said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The experts praised the quality of the rocket's design,
technology and business arrangements.
</P>
<P>
China's latest satellite-launch was March 26, when the Long
March 3B rocket carried two iridium satellites owned by
multinational telecommunications giant Motorola into space.
</P>
<P>
International space circles had their confidence restored in
the China's space industry, which suffered early setbacks after
several failed launches. Many business people inside the industry
hoped for further cooperation and more profitable contracts with
the Chinese rocket-makers.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited at the great success achieved by the Long
March rockets," said Li Bingsheng, a senior consultant with the
U.S.-based Loral Space Systems. "China is one of the most
important business partners of Loral."
</P>
<P>
"We always trust in this kind of rocket in the Long March
family," he said, "and a new satellite from our company will also
be launched using this rocket."

<HEADLINE> Parliament of Nepal Opens Winter Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of Nepal's
parliament opened here Friday to discuss the supposed transfer of
power by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa and a number of bills.
</P>
<P>
At least 24 bills including those on decentralization, property
rights of women, political parties and financial irregularities
are expected to be tabled to this session, known as the bill
session.
</P>
<P>
Proceedings in the Lower House of parliament will be simplified
and expedited under the amended parliamentary regulations.
</P>
<P>
But what makes the session prominent will be the supposed
transfer of power by Thapa to his main ruling partner the Nepali
Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last October when Thapa took power,
he should transfer the leadership of the coalition government to
the NC within an agreed time frame. The coalition government
includes the NC, the minor Nepal Sadbhavana Party and the National
Democratic Party (RPP), to which Thapa belongs.
</P>
<P>
But Thapa's attitude remained ambiguous. Reportedly he agreed
to vacate the premiership for the NC after he survived a
no-confidence motion in February at a special session of the
parliament. In March, he said he still believed in snap polls.
Then he said he would resign only after the visit of Indian
President K. R. Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president was scheduled to visit Nepal on April
7-10, but he delayed his visit till the end of May for health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The NC has threatened to withdraw support if Thapa does not
leave his post immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nepal Sadbhavana Party said in late March that it
might withdraw from the government if Thapa steps down before
completing his nine-month agreed-upon term.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Peasants' and Workers' Party which has two MPs has
clearly stated that it will not support a government headed by the
NC.
</P>
<P>
The NC is expected to seek alliance with other parties to
muster a simple majority of 103 votes in the 205-seat Lower House
to form a coalition government under its leadership.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), major political parties
in the country, split respectively in January and March. The split
of the CPN-UML has made the NC the single largest party in
parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Commission
President Jacques Santer on Friday voiced the 15-nation bloc's
confidence in the future of Asian economies despite the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Santer told the opening session of the Second Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM2) at London's Queen Elizabeth Conference Center that
the momentum of Asia-Europe partnership has steadily increased
since the first ASEM conference held in Bangkok in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We have the opportunity of deepening and consolidating the
ASEM process and the obligation of demonstrating that ASEM is a
solid partnership in good times, but also in times of difficulty,"
Santer said.
</P>
<P>
On the financial crisis in some Asian countries, Santer said
that the Europeans were confident that this crisis is manageable,
although its impact on the global economy is significant.
</P>
<P>
"We can be sure that with the combination of sound fundamentals
and sound policies this crisis will be mastered, and Asia can
again play the dynamic role in the world economy to which we have
all become accustomed," Santer said, adding "the message of Europe
is encouragement, solidarity and confidence."
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission chief also called on all ASEM countries to
continue to play their parts in encouraging and supporting reform
efforts and in keeping their markets open.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda fish export to Congo was
threatened by rampant smuggling, the Monitor paper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chairman of Uganda Fisheries and Fish
Conservation Association (UFFCA) Seremos Kamuturaki as saying
that smuggling immature fish at Uganda-Colgo border has
jeopardized Ugandan fish export to its neighbor on the west.
</P>
<P>
Kamuturaki said that UFFCA has signed an agreement with the
Association des Vendeurs des Poissons, a potential fish buyer at
Goma in eastern Congo o*aA=IQ%910 tons of fresh Nile perch,
five tons of dried salted Nile perch, two tons of dried salted
tiLapia and 1.5 tons of sun dried mukene, a local fish.
</P>
<P>
But the condition of the deal was jeopardized by smuggling
immatured fish at Uganda-Congo border, he said.
</P>
<P>
A matured Nile perch is ad least some meter long and weighs
three kilograms. But it was reported that visitors have found
immature Nile perch with its length only 15 centimeters (six
inches) on the market in Ishasha, south-western Rugungiri
district.

Kamuturaki called on the government to stop the smuggling by
legal means.
</P>
<P>
In response to his appeal, C. Dhatemwa, Commissioner for
Fisheries, directed fishery officers in the concerned districts
to investigate the issue and prosecute those involved in illegal
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Fish export is one of the main foreign exchange earners in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The main consumer of Uganda's fish is Spain and other European
Union countries. The main product exported to the EU countries is
frozen Nile perch.
</P>
<P>
But Uganda also exports fish products to its neighbors
including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Kenya and
Tanzania. Enditeo

<HEADLINE> Tibet Works to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- All impoverished people in southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region will bid farewell to poverty by
the end of the century, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The central government has listed the region, which is subject
to a harsh plateau climate, weak agricultural base and frequent
natural distaster, as one of the areas presenting the greatest
difficulty in efforts to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Substantial central government support since 1994 has enabled
local governments in Tibet to accelerate poverty alleviation
efforts to enhance the living standards of over 480,000 Tibetan
farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
More than 270,000 Tibetans have been extricated from the jaws
of poverty, according to Bai Tao, deputy director of the region's
poverty relief and development office.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have joined the central government in efforts
to increase appropriations needed to help local residents initiate
poverty relief projects. Banks have also provided additional
poverty alleviation loans.
</P>
<P>
Funds have been used to increase production on low-yield
farmlands, reclaim barren stretchs of land, improve grasslands and
construct water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also sent officials to impoverished
areas to help local residents escape poverty at the earliest
possible date.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's February retail sales hit
230.6 billion yuan, up six percent on an annual basis, with the
range of increase ending 6.9 percentage points lower than the
figure for January, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The SSB report attributed the substantial drop in the retail
market to the aftermath of the purchasing wave in advance of this
year's Spring Festival, the beginning of the Chinese lunar year on
January 28. It also noted that consumption has also been weakened
by a slow increase in incomes.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned commercial sector suffered the most during the
market slump, with its range of increase falling 9.8 percentage
points on the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, year-on-year increases in retail sales for
individually-owned businesses and the private commercial sectors
grew by 17.1 percent on the 1997 period. However, the margin of
increase was 4.9 percentage points lower than the January level.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that rural consumers displayed a
higher consumption momentum than urban residents. Rural areas at
or below the county level registered February retail sales of 88.2
billion yuan, up 6.7 percent on an annual basis. In addition, the
associated margin of increased was 1.2 percentage points higher
than in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
SSB sources noted that a steady increase is expected in March
retail sales, with the year-on-year margin of increase projected
at nine percent.

CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tourist numbers from southeast
Asia and northeast Asia plunged 40 percent and 19.2 percent
respectively in February, according to figures released here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures
showed the number of people from southeast Asia plummeted 40.1
percent to 46,800 when compared to February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Visitor numbers from northeast Asia also fell 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The biggest fall was in tourists from South Korea, down 71.9
percent from the same month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But tourism bodies were particularly concerned by a 7 percent
fall in tourists from Japan, Australia's largest source of
overseas tourists, which Sony Corporation Chief Norio Ohga said
this week was close to economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
Overall, international tourist numbers fell 13.5 percent, with
the declines in arrivals from Asia partially offset by increases
in visitors from Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed a 5 percent rise in tourist arrivals
from the United States, Europe and Russia.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Opposition Threatens to Boycott Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's opposition Grand
National Party (GNP) announced Friday that it will boycott the
local elections in June unless the ruling parties stop destroying
it.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, GNP President Cho Soon accused the
ruling coalition government, which unites the National Congress
for New Politics and United Liberal Democrats, of masterminding
the defection of three GNP legislators.
</P>
<P>
"If the ruling camp continues to demolish the opposition party,
we will no longer abide by the agreement made by the three
parties' floor leaders in March to stop political strife by
June," said Cho, whose GNP controls 161 of the 299-seat National
Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
Three GNP lawmakers declared earlier Friday that they had
bolted their party and joined the United Liberal Democrats over
GNP policies they described not helpful for overcoming the ongoing
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The GNP president appealed to the ruling camp to respect the
results of the parliamentary by-elections on Thursday, in which
the GNP achieved a sweeping victory in all four constituencies.
</P>
<P>
News reports said some other 15 GNP lawmakers are considering
breaking away from the opposition and joining the ruling camp, but
the ruling coalition denied seeking defectors from the GNP to end
its minority status in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the breakup of the GNP is just a matter
of time because the opposition is reeling from a conflict over
whether to retain the current leadership of President Cho and
Chairman Lee Han-dong.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had faced challenge from factions following
former GNP presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang, who was defeated
by Kim Dae-jung in the 15th presidential election last December.

<HEADLINE> Border Guards Establish Open, Friendly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Russian border guards,
who formerly eyed each other cautiously through binoculars, can
now freely visit sentry posts manned by their counterparts and
tour nearby bases and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Friendship between the soldiers has blossomed along with the
reestablishment of friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The increased opening of Chinese and Russian military posts
along the Heilongjiang River in March 1997 has enabled soldiers to
exchange visits and tour facilities of the other side.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have learned a great deal each other, including
methods for effectively managing the frontier. Russian soldiers
have praised the logistical activities of the Chinese army,
including the fact that the use of plastic film provides a
year-round supply of fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Similar openness and friendship can be observed in Chinese and
Russian vessels patroling the Heilongjiang River. An agreement
calls for both sides to join rescue operations when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Chinese frontier guards at Heihe often visit Russian
soldiers with fresh vestables and the latter reciprocates with
small gifts.
</P>
<P>
"We share a common border and certainly don't want to be
enemies," according to Chinese First Lieutenant Pei Shujun.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Indonesia Agree to Continue Talks on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have expressed their desire to continue talks
on the economic reform program in the country.
</P>
<P>
The expression were made by visiting IMF Deputy Managing
Director Stanley Fischer and Indonesian President Soeharto during
their meeting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If we could reach an agreement next week, the IMF will
disburse the second 3 billion U.S. dollars tranche of its aid
package to Indonesia," Fischer told newsmen after a one-hour
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fischer met with the president to discuss the reform program
aimed at helping bail Indonesia out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said after arriving here Thursday that he was to review
the progress of talks between the IMF and the Indonesian
government on the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss has
been negotiating with Indonesian officials since March 18. They
have discussed Indonesia's monetary policies, banking reform,
state budget and subsidy, structural reform as well as private
sector overseas debt.
</P>
<P>
The review will decide whether Indonesia is eligible to receive
its second 3 billion dollars tranche disbursement from the 43
billion dollars bailout fund arranged by the IMF early this year.
The payment was originally scheduled for March 15.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF last month suspended the second tranche of
rescue package for Indonesia because of the so-called lack of
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
As a result, Indonesia has been facing with spiraling inflation,
growing unemployment and other serious economic and social
problems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia started seeking long-term loans from international
monetary institutions including the IMF and promised to conduct
wide ranging economic, financial and trade reforms.

Interest rate sensitive stocks such as bank shares were among

The total market volume increased to 261.33 million units,
valued at 338.39 million Singapore dollars (about 207.6 million
U.S. dollars). Declines continued to overwhelm advances by 284 to
72, while 232 other counters remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Debt Reaches 130.9 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's outstanding foreign debt
hit 130.9 billion US dollars for the end of 1997, up 14.68 billion
US dollars, or 12.6 percent, from the previous year, according to
figures released today by the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE).
</P>
<P>
The figures mentioned here do not include debts borrowed by
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
SAFE figures show that outstanding medium- and long-term debt
ended the year at 112.82 billion dollars, with the figure
accounting for 86.1 percent of the total outstanding
debt. Outstanding short-term debt of 18.14 billion dollars
accounted for 13.9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign debt grew by 43.1 billion dollars in 1997,
up 12.55 billion dollars, or 39.2 percent, from the previous
year. The country paid 28.72 billion dollars in debt principal
and 3.69 billion dollars in interest during the year, with the
combined figure representing an increase of 9.94 billion dollars,
up 44.2 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The net inflow of foreign debt grew by 26 percent to 10.69
billion dollars, up 2.21 billion dollars, according to SAFE.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of total outstanding foreign debt showed
sovereignty debt of 35.98 billion dollars in the form of loans
to related ministries and commissions under the State Council, up
7.4 percent from the previous year; with loans to domestic financial
institutions standing at 42.53 billion dollars, up 9.7 percent;
loans to foreign-funded enterprises hit 37.36 billion dollars,
up 50.3 percent; national enterprises borrowed funds totalling
13.29 billion dollars, up 8.1 percent; and total loans to
leasing companies reached 1.8 billion US dollars, up 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to SAFE, adopting accounting practices in accordance
with the international balance of payment standards shows that
China's 1997 foreign debt service ratio was 7.3 percent and the
actual debt ratio stood at 63.2 percent. SAFE noted that both
figures were lower than international standards and were
indicative of good foreign debt conditions.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Lilacs Found in Jietai Temple in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty lilac trees in the Jietai
Temple, a scenic spot in western Beijing, have beed identified as
the oldest of their kind in the region.
</P>
<P>
Botanical experts said the life span of a lilac averages
30 to 50 years. After careful studies, they determined the lilacs in
the temple are at least 200 years old.
</P>
<P>
"They were introduced from an imperial garden in the northwest
part of Beijing, when Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) visited the temple," monks there said.
</P>
<P>
Two 150-year-old Chinese flowering crabapples were also found
there. They have been confirmed as the oldest of the species in
north China.
</P>
<P>
The temple plans to hold a flower fair this spring jointly with
the Tanzhe Temple, 40 kilometers west of Jietai. The Tanzhe Temple
is famous for two 300-year-old magnolia trees named after two
beauties during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280).

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges to Forge New Asia-Europe Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday called on European Union (EU) countries and their Asian
partners to forge a new Aisa-Europe partnership beyond the current
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Second Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM2) held in London on Friday morning, Blair, the
current EU president, said that Europe and Asia shared many things
in common and the ASEM forum could help to enhance cooperation
between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
"Europe and Asia have a relationship, which day by day grows
more closely interrelated. Exports from the European Union to Asia
in 1996 totaled 204 billion dollars, more than U.S. exports to the
whole region," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges facing the two regions, Blair urged joint
efforts to tackle these problems, saying: "We need to respond to
those changes in such a way as to build on the opportunities they
offer, while recognizing potential threats too."
</P>
<P>
In an effort to ease the financial crisis in Asia, Blair
announced that this summit is to launch an ASEM Trust Fund under
the auspices of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Such a fund will be able to offer technical support for
financial restructuring and to look at mechanisms for mobilizing
European expertise in structural reform to provide help to the
Asian economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also noted that the ASEM process gives Europe and Asia
the opportunity to have a new and more mature political dialogue
over issues such as environment, international crime and drugs,
and fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Blair said that this conference must
build on the foundations laid in Bangkok. "We, the political
leadership of Europe and Asia, must demonstrate to our peoples
that we are working together, deepening and broadening our
cooperation to improve their lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the end of this millennium we face a
challenge. That challenge is how to build a stronger, richer,
fairer and more decent society for our people," he
said. "Together, we are building a new partnership between Europe
and Asia for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Attending the ASEM2 conference are leaders from 10 Asian
countries, 15 EU members and the EU Executive Commission.

<HEADLINE> Flu Could Kill 2000 in Australia:  Minister Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A deadly flu epidemic which could
hit Australia from July had the potential to kill more than 2,000
people, federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is potentially facing an influenza epidemic from the
so-called A-Sydney flu virus that could conceivably affect as many
as 3.5 million people and in the worst case scenario, kill 2,700
Australians," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Launching an influenza awareness program at the Monash Medical
Center, Wooldridge said those most at risk of contracting
influenza were the elderly, asthmatics, those with chronic
respiratory disorders, diabetes or chronic cardiac disorders,
Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders.
</P>
<P>
"Flu is a serious illness and if the right precautions aren't
taken, potentially life threatening situations could arise. In
some cases this does result in death due to complications," he
added.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization Deputy Director Alan Hampson said the
flu would probably hit Australia between July and September.
However, the timing could vary with weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
The A-Sydney virus was first found in Sydney and Canberra last
year and has caused severe flu outbreaks in North America, Japan
and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Trusts His Military Leaders: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has been happy with the leadership of the national
defense force, local daily the Citizen reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana was quoted as saying
that Mandela did not doubt the loyalty of the any of the members
of the armed forces who had been implicated in a military
intelligence report claiming that there was a plot against the
government.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between the president and the leadership of
the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) at his official
residence in Pretoria Thursday, Mandela told the officers that he
had never believed the allegations contained in the "flawed"
report that had been handed to him on February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The president stated that he did not doubt the loyalty of any
of the members of the leadership of the defense force, especially
those who earned their colors in the former liberation army of
the national liberation movement," Mankahlana said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said that this only referred to those implicated in
the report and did not necessarily mean that no action would be
taken against the officers who prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela was continuing with his consultations on the
next course of action arising from the report.
</P>
<P>
"The office of the president will issue a statement in this
regard as soon as, in the opinion of the president, all the
necessary consultations have been completed," Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
The report submitted to Mandela on February 5 said that a
number of politicians and senior officers of the SANDF were
plotting against the government.
</P>
<P>
Mandela rejected the report and appointed the commission last
Friday to investigate the matter.

nations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Tumble This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Weak demand and stockpile
discounting pushed wool prices to a seasonal low at this week's
sales, exporters said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the market finishing on a positive note following
significant falls early in the week, auction prices are at their
lowest level for this season following sales in Sydney, Melbourne
and Fremantle," the Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE)
said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator dropped 24 cents to 614 cents a
clean kilogram while a 12 cent fall in Fremantle pushed the
western market indicator down to 566 cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Exchange's national indicator slid 23 cents
to finish at 637 cents per kg.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said in its weekly wool report about 100,935 bales were
offered and 22.1 percent passed in.
</P>
<P>
A favorable lower Australian dollar and buyers covering orders
before the Easter recess could not overcome low demand linked to
the Asian crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The market has dropped 15 percent from its seasonal peak at
the end of September 1997 and is down 12 percent since the
resumption of sales in January of this year," the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 115,500 bales are rostered for sale in Sydney, Melbourne
and Fremantle when sales resume in the week beginning April 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Supreme Court of Pakistan Friday
dropped the contempt of court cases against Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and several parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
In his 317-page judgment, Chief Justice Ajmal Mian, who headed
the seven-judge panel, observed Friday: "We as the Pakistani
nation should learn tolerance and inculcate the habit of
appreciating the opposite point of view."
</P>
<P>
"Without an independent judiciary, neither there can be
stability in the country nor the rule of law, which are sine qua
non for a progressive state," he said.
</P>
<P>
The contempt cases against Sharif, six parliamentarians and
some journalists were filed during the four-month constitutional
confrontation involving the prime minister and the then chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah last year.
</P>
<P>
When the confrontation came to its climax, Farooq Leghari
stepped down from his post as president and Sajjad had to go on a
long leave till his retirement.
</P>
<P>
The contempt cases have been delayed to be heard until Ajmal
Mian was appointed as new chief justice in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Gain from Indonesia's Loss in Shrimp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, the world's top shrimp
exporter, is set to benefit from Indonesia's loss in shrimp
production, industrial sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's world market share may have fallen to around 5
percent from 20 percent since last December because of a sharp
drop in production as its currency crisis made it expensive to
import feed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the world's third-largest exporter of
shrimps.
</P>
<P>
India, the world's second-largest exporter, will make inroads
into the lucrative Japanese market where Indonesia previously had
a foothold, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand will fill the vacuum created in other Indonesian
markets for medium-sized shrimps such as Singapore, Hong Kong and
Taiwan. The United States, which bought 38,000 tones of Thai
shrimps last year, will remain Thailand's major buyer.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will earn 60 billion baht (1.6 billion U.S. dollars)
in foreign exchange this year as its shrimp exports are projected
to rise to 170,000 tones this year, up from 137,082 tones last
year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's shrimp farming areas are expected to expand by 10 to
15 percent this year due to rising world demand and favorable
prices.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has about 72,000 hectares of shrimp farms run by
10,000 farmers.

MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday urged Russian citizens to pay taxes, saying payment of
taxes is a person's moral duty to his country, the Itar-Tass news

</P>
<P>
In his regular radio address, Yeltsin noted that Russia's
income tax accounts for six percent of the entire tax revenue of
the treasury, as against 80 percent in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said that those who are wealthy or have achieved
successes in life should share with those who are old, poor or
cannot provide for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that more and more people pay taxes in good faith
in Russia, whose number is expected to exceed five million this
year, three times more than that in 1995.

BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai children of AIDS-infected
parents will be able to enroll in schools with exemption of
tuition fees from the 1998 academic year onwards, the Bangkok Post
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Education Minister Chumpol Silpa-Archa as
saying that he had signed a ministerial order to put this into
effect.
</P>
<P>
State schools under the Education Ministry are bound to comply
with the order.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the move was intended to help children of
AIDS-infected parents to have the opportunity to receive
education.
</P>
<P>
According to a public health ministry survey in 1997, there
were a total of 9,323 children, aged between one and 20, who were
offsprings of AIDS parents in 12 educational zones across
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The general education department has also considered
establishing a boarding school this year which will enroll only
children of AIDS-infected patients in the northern Chiang Mai
Province.
</P>
<P>
But some people argued that an exclusive school for children of
AIDS patients will pose discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Steps to Purify Coffee Strains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has decided to restrict
coffee movement in its eastern districts of Kapchorwa and Mbale,
the New Vision reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper published a direction issued by Minister of
Trade and Industry Henry Kajura to prevent adulterating Bugisu
coffee.
</P>
<P>
There are two main strains of coffee in the country, namely
Arabic coffee and Robosta coffee. The Arabic coffee is produced
in the east and is the best one. And Bugisu is the main producer
of this variety.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some unscrupulous traders were
adulterating Bugisu coffee.
</P>
<P>
Adulteration undermines the reputation of Uganda's quality
coffee in the world markets, Minister Kajura noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister also ordered a quarantine in western districts of
Bundibugyo, Rukungiri, Mbarara, Kabarole and Bushenyi.
</P>
<P>
The quarantine has come after the outbreak of trichomycosis, a
coffee wilt disease. The fungal disease attacks the leaves and
eventually kills the plant.
</P>
<P>
Trichomycosis was first reported in Bundibugyo in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is now the leading coffee producer in Africa and the
crop earns 65 percent of its foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Eight hundred Iraqi prisoners of
war (POWs) released by Iran arrived at the border post of
al-Mundhariya early Friday morning, according to a radio report.
</P>
<P>
The report said these POWs will be sent home directly, and that
in the following days, Iran will release more Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi weekly newspaper al-Zawra said on Thursday that Iran
would set free 6,000 Iraqi prisoners of war in the biggest such
kind of release since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the Iranian move marks a
major step in improvement of relations between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war from 1980 to 1988,
during which at least one million people were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing Iran of still holding about 20,000
prisoners since the release of 39,000 soldiers in 1990, though
smaller number of prisoners have been released frequently.
</P>
<P>
Iran said Iraq also holds 6,000 to 10,000 Iranian prisoners,
but Iraq has denied the claim.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian First Lady Mrs. Maryam
Abacha has called on the U.N. to adopt a resolution banning
female genital Mutilation (FGM) throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Abacha made the call Thursday in Abuja at the launch of
the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Reproductive Health
Strategy to mark this year's World Health Day, which falls on
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first lady, represented by the Minister of State for
Education, Rose Achunine, appealed to the Nigerian government to
enact a law providing stiff penalties for the perpetrators of
FGM.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO sources, FGM prevails in 27 African
countries, which accounted for over 100 of the 120 million girls
and women affected by the problem worldwide.
</P>
<P>
FGM is one of the major factors behind the high maternal
mortalities in African countries.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Bank Raises Lending Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest
commercial bank, increased its lending interest rates by 25-75
basis points, a bank official confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to be followed by other commercial banks as
the competition of raising funds is growing fiercer in the
domestic financial market.
</P>
<P>
The bank on Thursday set its new minimum lending rate at 15.5
percent, up 25 points. Minimum retail rates were increased to
16.25 percent from the previous 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minimum overdraft rates rose to 16.25 percent
from 15.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers overdue on loan payments will have their interest
rates increased to 19.75 percent, 25 points higher than before.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the increases should be attributed to higher cost
of funds in the local money market.
</P>
<P>
Higher deposit rates are also being considered, reflecting
tight competition for funds.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok bank is offering interest rates of 10-11.5 percent on
fixed accounts.
</P>
<P>
The country's central bank, Bank of Thailand, has maintained
high rates to help stabilize exchange rates and curb inflation.
Authorities say rates should ease once the baht shows greater
stability.
</P>
<P>
Large banks, including Bangkok Bank, are faced with the need to
increase loan-loss provisions. They have exploited high rates by
mobilizing deposits for relending in the money market, which
offers higher spreads and lower risks than lending to retail or
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
Many businesses complain that the banks' reluctance to extend
new credit was squeezing cashflow and delaying prospects of a
recovery of the economy.

<HEADLINE> US Predicts Collapse of ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has predicted the
collapse of the west African peace keeping force known as ECOMOG,
arguing it is only an ad hoc force for the Liberian crisis, the
Guardian reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted U.S. Senior Director for African
Affairs Joe Wilson as saying in Dakar, Senegal, Thursday that the
ECOMOG force would fizzle out once peace takes root in Liberia
and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG successfully helped bring an end to
the seven-year civil war in Liberia and restore Sierra Leone's
legitimate government to power.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea
and Liberia, under the aegis of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), resolved at their last meeting in
Conakry, Guinea, to make ECOMOG a permanent peace-keeping organ
for the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria even called for efforts to build an all-Africa peace
keeping force with ECOMOG as nucleus.
</P>
<P>
However, Wilson reckoned that ECOMOG is an ad hoc force raised
to deal specifically with the Liberian crisis beginning late
1989, adding that U.S.-sponsored African Crisis Response
Initiative (ACRI) would help handle humanitarian and peace
keeping in areas of conflict on the continent.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the deployment of ACRI to any African
country will require prior approval by the Organization of
African Unity or the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, launched by the U.S. two years ago, the
U.S. offers training and equipment to African nations seeking to
enhance their peace-keeping capability and committed to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Senegal, Uganda, Malawi, Mali, Ghana and Ethiopia have already
signed up to participate in the project, scheduled to last five
years with Washington providing 16 million U.S. Dollars in the
first year and 20 million U.S.0Dollars in the two subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
Not all African countries but those with a long-standing
democratic tradition could become participants, Wilson restated
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Also in Dakar, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the
founding of an African Center for Security Studies (ACSS), which
would be modeled after the Judge Marshal Center in Germany.
</P>
<P>
It will promote exchange of ideas and information tailored
specially for African concerns.
</P>
<P>
Clinton added that the ACSS curriculum would include a senior
executive course for military and civilian officials, as well as
an executive course for colonels and lieutenant-colonels.

<HEADLINE> Capital Goods Prices down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Domestic market prices for capital
goods continued to fall during March despite the slight
recovery of market demand compared with February.
</P>
<P>
The China Materials Information Center released the results a
survey this week showing market prices for 176 types of major
capital goods. The survey lists March price decreases for 129
types of products, or 75 percent of listed items. Price rises were
recorded for 39 items, or 22 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In terms of categories surveyed, general price cuts were
recorded for chemical raw materials and nonferrous metals, with
prices for coal remaining stable and further drops recorded for
refined oil products.
</P>
<P>
March Prices for most of the country's steel and automobile
products were lower than in February, with a continuing downward
slide in car prices. Minimal price changes were recorded for
timber, construction materials and various other materials.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that continuing declines in prices for capital
goods fully demonstrate sluggish domestic investment demand. They
note that the negative impact of the financial crisis in Southeast
Asia on China's capital goods market will continue for the
foreseeable future, and stress that the market needs time to
recover.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Observers to Witness Elections in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The nine member countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will each send
eight observers to Cambodia to witness elections in that country
to be held on July 26, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
reporting from London Friday, ABdullah said in London on the eve
of the opening of the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) that the
ASEAN countries would each bear the cost of sending their
observers to Cambodia although their participation would be under
the ASEAN auspices.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that the ASEAN countries had been invited by
Cambodia to send their observers to witness the elections in that
country.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN Foreign Ministers attending the second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in London met Thursday and were briefed
by the ASEAN troika, comprising Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand, on the Cambodian issue.
</P>
<P>
"According to the ASEAN troika spokesman (Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas), the situation in Cambodia is improving and
the conflicts between the two factions have halted. We have also
been informed that Prince Ranarridh will take part in the
election," Abdullah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian issue is an aspect of the Asian regional
political scenario to be discussed in the ASEM under the political
agenda, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The Bernama's report said that at another meeting Thursday
evening between the foreign ministers from the two continents --
Asia and Europe, the ministers from Europe also stated their
preparedness to send their observers to Cambodia as soon as they
were contacted by the United Nations Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah welcomed this and expressed the hope to see the
participation of more countries in Europe, especially countries
which signed the Paris peace accord, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"With even more observers, we can show to the people of
Cambodia that the international community really wants to see a
smooth and fair election, according to the rules, and the results
to be acceptable later," Abdullah said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Forms Committee to Probe National Grid Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has formed a five-member
inquiry committee to probe the cause of power disruption in the
national power grid Thursday, the country's newspapers reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The whole country Thursday experienced a total power outage for
35 minutes at a stretch, and some areas in the capital Dhaka had
no electricity for 10-12 hours due to national grid failure.
</P>
<P>
The power went off across the country at 10:05 a.m. and the
entire country remained without electricity till 10:40 a.m.
because of the national grid failure, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Right after the sudden country-wide power failure, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina immediately ordered the Ministry of Energy
and the Power Development Board (PDB) to restore power supply as
early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was "seriously perturbed" by the major power
failure that took place within five days of her taking over the
charge of the energy ministry. She sacked the former energy
minister on March 30 for failure to supply enough power to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many energy ministry and PDB officials rushed to the load
dispatch center and instructed the engineers and officials to
restore the power supply.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the army has been given the responsibility of
monitoring the power supply situation, and troops have been
deployed to guard power stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide power failure was caused by a technical failure
in the national grid, the reports quoted sources from the Energy
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry committee will submit its report within 10 days.

<HEADLINE> 14 People Asphyxiated in Mass Carbon Monoxide Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Carbon monoxide fumes from coal
stoves asphyxiated at least 14 people and sent a total of 1,126
people to the hospital in the mass carbon monoxide poisoning in
the north China port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
And about 100 people of the total were seriously poisoned.
</P>
<P>
But, hospital sources said that more than 1,000 victims of
carbon monoxide poisoning are reportedly out of danger after
several days in the hospital. Fewer than 100 of the 1,126 patients
are still in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The mass poisoning outbreak occurred in the early morning hours
of March 29. Low atmospheric pressure and similar indoor and
outdoor temperatures caused an inversion prohibiting the normal
discharge of carbon monoxide from the chimneys of coal-burning
stoves in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the Tianjin households still use coal stoves for
heating and cooking.
</P>
<P>
Shun Shuqing, an official with Tianjin No. 1 Central Hospital
which admitted the largest number of poisoning patients, said the
hospital "received more than 200 carbon monoxide patients on March
29-30. Apart from nine seriously poisoned victims, all the others
have been discharged."
</P>
<P>
However, Shun said, those discharged may still need treatment
in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber. In the first few days, she
added, victims had to line up and wait for the hyperbaric oxygen
chamber treatment.
</P>
<P>
All the 45 Tianjin hospitals equipped with hyperbaric oxygen
chambers admitted the victims this time and about 3,000 doctors
have taken part in the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Zhuang Gonghui and officials with the health bureau
helped arrange treatment of the victims in hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Leaves Phnom Penh for Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's deposed First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh left here Friday afternoon for
Bangkok, concluding his first home trip since last July.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Ranariddh told reporters that he felt
very happy at home and would come back soon to meet his father
King Norodom Sihanouk at Siem Reap. The King will be there on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
He said a better way for him and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
to take is to settle their differences and work together for
national democracy, liberty and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The prince, back home Monday, ended his nearly nine months
self-exile after his father King Norodom Sihanouk pardoned him.
</P>
<P>
For four days, Ranariddh held talks with diplomats and
representatives of FUNCINPEC and other organizations, including
the National Election Committee, to find out how to ensure the
coming July 26 election free, fair and credible, and how to
completely implement the peace plan sponsored by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he asked Hun Sen to request pardon from the King for
his two generals Nhiek Bun Chhay and Serey Kosal who were
convicted together with him last month by the Phnom Penh Military
Court as part of the efforts for the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also supported the King's suggestion on the
re-integration of his resistance forces into the government army
so as to gain pardon for the two generals.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that Ranariddh's popularity has risen
following his return, though there were still demonstrations
against him.
</P>
<P>
As his private representative said, Ranariddh's return this
time was a test of water to see if everything was OK for him
before ending his come-and-go period.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to increase Assistance to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland will raise its official
development assistance (ODA) for Bangladesh from the present 14
million U.S. dollars to 16 million dollars by the year 2000, press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Thursday in Dhaka by visiting Ambassador
Walter Fust, director general of the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The Swiss disbursement through the ODA would be raised to 15
million dollars in 1999 and 16 million dollars in 2000 for such
areas as rural infrastructure and transport, water supply and
sanitation, sustainable use of land, promotion in private economy
and small enterprises, and non-formal and vocational education,
the ambassador was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The disbursement of Switzerland to Bangladesh is increasing,
and Bangladesh is one of the top 10 recipient countries in our
development cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walter Fust came to Dhaka on March 24 on a two-week visit to
assess the progress of on-going SADC-aided development projects.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Drivers Urged to Reduce Auto Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's drivers have to pay
more attention to their vehicles since the city adopted
emission-control regulations on April 1.
</P>
<P>
This is only one of the steps Beijing has taken to clean up the
city's air.
</P>
<P>
Five weeks ago Beijing began to release weekly air quality
reports which show that Beijing is among the most seriously
polluted cities in China. And auto emissions are considered the
city's leading cause of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said that more
than 60 percent of 210 vehicles inspected on May 1 did not meet
emission-control standards.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has urged all local drivers to
install emission-control devices to help reduce air pollution.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) would continue to seek a way to enable
Myanmar to attend the EU-ASEAN dialogue, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Myanmar was discussed in the context of EU-ASEAN
relations at the dinner and discussions attended by ministers
attending the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in London,
Abdullah said in London on the eve of the opening of the ASEM, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah admitted that the issue was thorny due to the
difference in the stand adopted by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said: "I told them that since Myanmar became a member
of ASEAN, constructive engagement has continued between Myanmar
and ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos, joined the regional grouping in
July last year, which also comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Selling Zambia's Copper Mines Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations on sale of Zambia's
two biggest copper mines have collapsed, the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail quoted a ZCCM spokesman as saying here
Thursday that the negotiations on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana
mines have collapsed due to disagreements between the Kafue
consortium and the ZCCM privatization team.
</P>
<P>
He did not go into details on the disagreements.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said that Zambia has received
expressions of interest from a number of other parties and is
urgently exploring each of the options to successfully complete
the sale of the mines.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM negotiating team Chairman Francis Kaunda is quoted as
saying that "although the breakdown of the negotiations was a
major disappointment, the negotiating team has a duty to realize
value for the asset. We will soon open negotiations with other
interested parties."
</P>
<P>
The Kafue consortium was the leading contender for the
purchase of the two mines and it won the bid in 1997 after the
Zambian government went through a protracted process to pick the
best buyer of the two mines, which accounts for the biggest
copper production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week Falconbridge, a leading Canadian mining company
pulled out of the Konkola deep project consortium, citing lower
copper price as the reason for the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement,
Zambia's annual copper output, one of the biggest
copper-producing countries in the world, has decreased gradually
to about 300,000 tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
to attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tender for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio's Duncan Named NBA Rookie of March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- San Antonio's Tim Duncan was named
on Friday the Rookie of the Month for games played in March.
</P>
<P>
Duncan averaged 23.8 points, 12.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists and
2.25 blocked shots per game. He shot 152 for 274 from the field
and ranked second in rebounding, fifth in scoring, eighth in
blocked shots and ninth in field goal percentage among overall
league leaders and first in scoring, rebounding, shot blocking and
field goal percentage, and eighth in assists among all first-year
players.
</P>
<P>
The forward center from Wake Forest has won the Rookie of the
Month honors in each of the first five months of the season and
could join Ralph Sampson (1983-84) and David Robinson (1989-90) as
the only players even to win the award every month of their rookie
season.
</P>
<P>
The Rookie of the Month has been awarded since the 1981-82
season.
</P>
<P>
Duncan helped lead San Antonio to a 11-5 record during March by
posting double-figures in points 16 times and in rebounds 13
times. He had 13 double-doubles to increase his season total to a
league-leading 51, and led the Spurs in scoring nine times and in
rebounding 12 times.
</P>
<P>
Duncan had several standout performances including 26 points
and 21 rebounds in a 93-83 win against Phoenix on March 23, and 35
points, 17 rebounds and five blocked shots in a 90-83 loss at
Golden State on March 4.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cabbage sold well in
Yugoslavia recently during the off season for vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese cabbage found in shops of Belgrade, capital of
Yugoslavia, was imported from Italy and sold at a price of 20
dinars (3.33 U.S. dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The availability of vegetables per person in present-day China
exceeds the world average, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cabbage once dominated the meals of northern urbanities
during the winter season, but now people have the choice of a
great variety of fresh vegetables because of higher living
standards and the wide use of greenhouses.

<HEADLINE> Biological Control of Hyacinth in L. Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The biological control of the
water hyacinth weed in Lake Victoria has been broadened to
include destructive species of mites and moths, according to an
East African Standard report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted J. Mailu, Deputy Director of the Kenya
Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), as saying that the
biological control was currently restricted to the use of
beetles.
</P>
<P>
According to Mailu, two species of beetles had been imported
from South Africa, Australia, Uganda, Benin and Zimbabwe for
breeding, and mites and moths had also been imported from some of
these countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Nairobi-based International Center for Insect
Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) had agreed to join their efforts
in the biological control of hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
KARI is now working in collaboration with ICIPE at Mbita Point
in Suba District and Kobos Center in Kisumu District along the
Lake Victoria, Mailu added.
</P>
<P>
Hyacinth which has partly covered the Lake Victoria in Kenya
has seriously affected transport on the lake and fishing industry
in the lake region of Western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has agreed to
provide 70 million U.S. Dollars to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to
control the hyacinth menace through the Global Environmental
Fund.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Lowers Its Tourist Arrivals Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
revised down its foreign tourist arrivals target for this year
about 15 percent to 5.5 million from the initial projection of 6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Minister of Tourism, Art and Culture
Abdul Latief on Thursday, officials at the ministry said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said negative reports on Indonesia by foreign
media had severely tarnished the country's image and prompted many
tourists to cancel their trips.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many airlines had also reduced their flights to
Indonesia due to the decline in inbound passengers, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Observers said earlier the main reasons for the decline of the
foreign tourist arrivals in the country were forest fires and
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests were destroyed
by fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in the country. The
monetary crisis, which started in July last year, has badly hit
Indonesia, causing more than 70 percent depreciation of the
Indonesia rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the number of foreign tourist arrivals was 5.04
million, much lower than the government's target of 5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange receipts from the tourism sector were 6.62
billion U.S. dollars, or about one billion dollars below the
original target.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe riots, which took place in several parts of
the country before and after the general election last May, had
discouraged foreign tourists from visiting Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Latief did not set any income targets for this year but was
confident the country would be able to earn 15 billion U.S.
dollars a year by 2003 from tourism.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Calls for More Considerations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed Thursday said domestic environment and situation in the
country must be taken into consideration while receiving foreign
technologies, the United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Development of domestic resources cannot always be possible by
importing technologies from abroad as those technologies sometimes
do not match with country's environment," the president said while
inaugurating the central programs of the 21st national science and
technology week in Dhaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The science and technology week is aimed at enhancing
consciousness among the people and encourage the youth to devote
themselves in exercising science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Before selecting modern technologies, prevailing socio-economic
aspects in the country must be considered, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
The national progress and prosperity of Bangladesh "depends on
successful and practical implementation of science and
technology," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Terming science and technology as the main driving force for
socio-economic development, he said, "We all have to take the
responsibility to cope with the modern world for enhancing the
momentum of the national development."
</P>
<P>
The science and technology infrastructure "should be built in
the light of our demand, condition and capacity," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China to Tap Rural Market Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The vast majority of people would
find it hard to believe that a suggestion offered by a young woman
would save a factory on the verge of closing.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in 1997, the Shenyang Refrigerator Plant acted on
a suggestion presented by Hao Shujuan, a young female farmer in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, and enlarged the freezer
capacity of its refrigerators to cater to the needs of rural
families.
</P>
<P>
The plant enlarged the capacity of its freezers from a mere 30
liters to 90 liters. It also enhanced its competitiveness on the
rural market by dropping prices by 500 yuan and offering direct
delivery to customers.
</P>
<P>
The innovative approach enabled the plant to sell 30,000 units
on the rural market during 1997, with the total sales for the year
hitting 60 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The rural market offers extensive opportunities for Chinese
enterprises based on preconditions such as adjusting product mixes,
lowering production costs and guaranteeing quality," according to
a plant official.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, the vast potential of the
rural market is readily discernible because 70 percent of China's
1.2 billion people live in rural areas. The steady development of
the rural economy has also raised rural demand for both consumer
and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1997 show that the per capita income for farmers
hit 2,090 yuan last year, up 4.6 percent on the previous year. In
addition, rural retail sales rose by 10 percent to 1,044.9 billion
yuan, up ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the rural market in recent years
readily indicates the vast potential for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
However, turning the vast potential into reality will require
extensive efforts, the newspaper said, citing four major factors
hindering the process -- difficulties in increasing the income
level of farmers, slow pace of market construction, poor access to
information and inadequate rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The State Information Center forecasts that the rural consumer
goods retail sales will reach 1,354.3 billion yuan in 1998, up 13
percent on 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Group Ends Inspection of Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special group
responsible for the inspection of Iraqi presidential sites has
finished their mission "successfully," head of the group
Janayatha Dhanapala said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, commissioner of the U.N. special group of senior
diplomats and arms experts told reporters Friday morning that his
mission was finished.
</P>
<P>
"My mission is finished, it is a successful mission. I will
leave tomorrow," said Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
He said he would hold talks on Friday with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Saeed Sahhaf and hold discussions with experts of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's prohibited
weapons to finalize their reports.
</P>
<P>
The special group has to write two reports, one by senior
diplomats and the other by arms experts. The reports will be
submitted to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan through UNSCOM
Chairman Richard Butler, but Butler cannot modify the report
written by senior diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala said he would report to Annan next week on the
results of the "initial" visits to the eight Iraqi presidential
sites.
</P>
<P>
The inspection of the Sijood presidential sites in Baghdad
finished Thursday evening, and an air survey will be carried out
to the already-inspected Mosul presidential sites in northern
Iraq on Friday, said Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
The inspections of Iraqi presidential sites started last
Thursday. According to diplomatic sources, they have found
nothing, and their mission has received cooperation from the
Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed late February by Annan and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Iraq agrees to open its eight
presidential sites a U.N. special group under special procedure.
</P>
<P>
The special group comprises senior diplomats appointed by Annan
and experts drawn from the UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Agency. It should inform Iraqi side of its planned visit to
any presidential sites one day ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 cannot be lifted unless the UNSCOM verifies that it
is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Chosen to Send Cold Air to Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Trane International, an air
conditioner producer, has selected Thailand as its production base
to export home air conditioners to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company's plants in France and the United
States will be replaced, according to Friday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Trane (Thailand) General Manager Surichai Patarakitnirun told
the paper that the parent company in the U.S. began importing air
conditioners from Thailand for re-export to Latin America a few
months ago as the cost of the Thai operation is 30 percent lower
than those in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai units would remain competitive providing the baht did
not appreciate further than 32 to the dollar. The baht was trading
around 39 to the dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the baht became too strong, the company would look to
supplies from Australia and Vietnam, Surichai said.
</P>
<P>
He said Trane (Thailand) was studying the feasibility of
exports of home air conditioners to Australia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This year, sales of air conditioners in Thailand were likely to
shrink by between 15 percent and 20 percent because of reduced
buying power, Surichai said.

<HEADLINE> China Building Second West-East Trunk Railway for Coal Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of workers
are busy constructing the 588-kilometer eastern section of the
Shenmu-Huanghua railway line, China's second trunk line for
coal transport from its west to its east.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section starts in Shenchi County in north China's
Shanxi Province and ends in Huanghua City on Bohai Bay. The line
will be electrified.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section will cost more than 10 billion yuan and be
built in two stages. The first phase will be finished in the first
half of 2000 and connected to the Beijing-Kowloon railway, a
north-south trunk line, at Suning County in Hebei Province. The
second phase, from Suning to Huanghua, should be completed and put
into service in 2003, when a port will also be built in Huanghua.
</P>
<P>
The Shenmu-Huanghua railway line will run 1,029 kilometers and
consist of the Baotou-Shenmu and Shenmu-Shuozhou lines in the west
and the Shuozhou-Huanghua line in the east.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the railway will link major coal bases in west
China, including the Shenmu coal-field at the juncture of Shaanxi
Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with Huanghua
Port. It is expected to become the country's second major coal
transport railway line after the railway from Datong in Shanxi
province to Qinhuangdao Port, also on Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's four trans-century projects, the
Shenmu-Huanghua railway will be the first project to integrate
coal mines, railways, power plants, a port and an ocean-going
fleet since 1949, when New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost an investment of 90 billion yuan and will
guarantee energy supplies for east and south China upon its
completion. It is expected to spur economic development in
central, western and coastal China.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe: VIPs Urged to Clear Housing Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Local
Government and National Housing will write to debtors in the VIP
Housing Schemes for payments, the Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is owed an estimated 110 million Zimbabwean
Dollars (about 70 million U.S. Dollars) under the VIP Housing
Scheme, the daily newspaper said, though some beneficiaries,
including first lady Grace Mugabe, have already paid off their
debts.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo,
told the paper Thursday that Grace Mugabe, who was among the
first people to clear debts, had by last December paid the
ministry three to four million Zimbabwean Dollars (about 200,000
U.S. Dollars), the total cost for building her Borrowdale home on
a 10-hectare stand.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said when he took over the housing portfolio in July
last year, some debtors under the scheme had already been handed
over to the Attorney-General's Office.
</P>
<P>
In agreement with the office, the ministry is now reviewing
those cases to determine the most efficient and appropriate
manner of recovering the money.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said it was his ministry's intention to recover the
fund's money from all debtors.
</P>
<P>
There were, however, some debtors who have been servicing
their debts monthly while others have not even paid deposits.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will write to debtors who are in arrears to
demand payment.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of those who for some reason fail to pay off the
debt at once, we will negotiate a payment period which shall not
be more than six years," the minister said, adding that "We will
take into account the amount owed in negotiating the payment
period."
</P>
<P>
"In the unlikely event that the negotiations fail, we will
hand over the debtors to the Attorney-General's Office for a
civil claim in an appropriate court," Nkomo said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "I'm happy to say that some of those debtors,
including the first lady, have cleared their debts."
</P>
<P>
The VIP scheme, which is funded by the National Housing Fund
administered by the ministry, has helped a number of people, some
of whom were neither VIPs nor government employees, build houses.

China's Guo Zhengxin, who was the only one to successfully
completed quads or combined with triples, was placed 12th because
of a small error in the short program which resulted in his 14th
position.

<HEADLINE> British-Myanmar Firm to Set up Soap Factory in Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A British-Myanmar joint venture
company -- Myanmar Cole and Win Co Ltd -- will set up a soap
factory in Yangon, and 40 percent of its products will be
exported, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The factory is to be established in the Hlaingtharya Industrial
Zone in the northwest of Yangon, one of the five such zones
developed in the capital in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Under the land-lease contract signed here Thursday between the
joint venture company and the Human Settlement and Housing
Development Department of Myanmar Construction Ministry, the
company will build a soap powder and liquid factory on a
0.47-hectare plot of land in the zone to produce household toilet
requisites and chemicals to be used in manufacturing soap, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The 453-hectare Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone was initially
developed by local entrepreneurs who set up such industries as
food processing, textile, engineering, electrical goods,
chemicals, forest products and animal foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The development of the zone was later joined by multi-national
foreign firms including those from Britain, France, Japan,
Singapore and Thailand, as well as by Myanmar-foreign joint
ventures, leasing land in the zone and running dairy products,
galvanized iron sheet, and sanitary and garment factories.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to improvement of infrastructure in the zone, local
developers are applying for more industrial land, and at the same
time attracting more foreign entrepreneurs to invest in
export-oriented industries.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Cooperation Beyond 20th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders from 10 Asian countries
and the 15 European Union (EU) members will draw up a blueprint of
cooperation extending beyond the current millennium at the second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM2) scheduled for April 3-4 in London.
</P>
<P>
Since the first ASEM summit was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in
March 1996, this informal consultation group between Asia and
Europe has achieved notable progress.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM Economic Ministers' meeting in Japan last
September prepared proposals on policies and regulations to
promote trade and investment between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), which is designed to
"promote exchanges between think-tanks, peoples and cultural
groups," was set up by ASEM foreign ministers in Singapore in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
China, a staunch supporter of ASEM, has also played a positive
role in promoting Asia-Europe cooperation in various fields. The
Chinese government hosted the senior ASEM customs officials
conference in Shenzhen in 1996 and the first ASEM experts' meeting
on technological cooperation in Beijing last April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political dialogue between ASEM countries
continues. The EU foreign ministers announced in February that the
15-nation bloc would not take part in any anti-China resolution on
the human rights issue at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this breakthrough would pave the way for rapid
development of both China-Europe and Asia-Europe relationships.
</P>
<P>
On the significance of the ASEM2, British Foreign Office
Minister Derek Fatchett said at a recent press briefing that the
ASEM2, the first such meeting held in Europe, "Will be an
important landmark in the development of Europe's relationship
with Asia."
</P>
<P>
"We intend that ASEM2 will not be just another international
meeting. It will be the focus for a diverse range of activities
between Asia and Europe, all with the common objective of building
closer relations and stepping up cooperation between our two
regions," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis that hit many Asian countries late last
year will be high on the agenda of the two-day meeting. Fatchett
stressed that EU countries, with close links with Asia, are
working hard through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help
restore market confidence and economic growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The British minister expressed the hope that leaders from the
25 countries could find better means of tackling the financial
difficulties, noting: "We have a common interest in finding
solutions."
</P>
<P>
Promoting economic and trade cooperation is to be another
important topic at the London conference. Britain, the current EU
president, urged ASEM members to adopt "an Investment Promotion
Action Plan and a Trade Facilitation Action." It also called on
ASEM2 to develop a consensus on key global trade issues in advance
of the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a colorful program of cultural and arts events, the
participants will exchange views on issues ranging from the new
ASEM membership, environment, international crimes, drugs to
consideration of fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the first-ever China-EU summit will be held in
London on April 2. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, EU Commission
President Jacques Santer and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will discuss various issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett told Xinhua that the establishment of the top level
consultation group indicated the "positive and constructive"
development in the relationship between China and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Forecasting the Asia-Europe partnership in the new millennium,
Blair said: "Together we can strengthen our political and economic
cooperation, and links between our peoples, to make our citizens
and those of the rest of the world safer, healthier and more
prosperous."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Villagers Flee Unprotected Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's minority Muslim and
Tamil families living in a village in the North Central Province
of the country have begun fleeing the area due to the lack of
security following the fall of a police post to Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The police post at Kudapokuna in Polonnaruwa District was
stormed last Saturday by hundreds of rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who killed one policeman and
critically injured two others, local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although government troops repulsed the attack, police were
forced to withdraw and abandon the post.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Muslim families and 50 Tamil families have left their
village in the past two days for fear of further attacks by the
rebel Tigers.
</P>
<P>
This was the third attack on Kudapokuna village by the LTTE
rebels who have been fighting against the government for a
separate state of their own in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the rebels attacked the police post, killing
five people including civilians.
</P>
<P>
Again in early 1997, they set off a powerful landmine, killing
six civilians including two infants.
</P>
<P>
The village is situated in an area where fighting between the
government troops and the rebels is at a peak and the situation
there is highly tense. Military or police protection is considered
a must for the villagers, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans Express Train Line to Ease Traffic Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Passenger trains are expected to
become the new choice of commuters in the Chinese capital in
addition to buses, taxis and the subway, according to today's
China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Beijing's Municipal Administration of
Railways and concerned departments have worked out a plan to build
and develop urban railways.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Beijing will turn all railways idled by
rapid expansion of residential zones and the removal of factories
into an express railway linked to the city's bus and subway
systems.
</P>
<P>
The designed railway would be 42.8 kilometers long with a dozen
stops and take one hour to complete for the whole distance.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan, four to six trains would run
at speeds of 80-to-100 kilometers per hour and carry 600
passengers each. Walls would be built in residential zones to
reduce noise levels.
</P>
<P>
The paper said foreign cities such as Tokyo, London, and Paris
have built similar express railways in urban areas to ease traffic
burdens.

<HEADLINE> Reserve Bank of India Reduces Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to revitalize
India's flagging economy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has
reduced the bank rate to 10 percent from 10.5 percent, the Times
of India reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The RBI on Thursday also lowered the repurchase rate for
government securities from 8 percent to 7 percent, its prime rate
to 13.5 percent and its medium-term lending rate to 13.25 percent
from 13.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the deposit rate schedule remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The rate cuts, with an aim to squeeze liquidity in order to
calm the volatile foreign exchange markets, had been expected as
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha as well as RBI governor Bimal
Jalan were recently quoted as saying that they were in favor of
lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But it came as a surprise for several bankers as they had
expected RBI to announce further easing only in the monetary
policy for the first half of 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The RBI cut the repurchase rate from 9 percent to 8 percent on
March 17, the bank rate from 11 percent to 10.5 percent the
following day and cash reserve ratio from 10.5 percent to 10
percent in equal phases of 0.25 percent effective on March 28 and
April 11.
</P>
<P>
State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, responded
instantly last evening by cutting its prime lending rate from 14
percent to 13.5 percent and "state bank medium-term lending rate,"
the rate for advances with maturities over three years, from 13.5
percent to 13.25 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The parents of Huang Liang, an 18
year-old girl who died three years ago while undergoing an
appendectomy, have filed a lawsuit charging the hospital for its
medical malpractice, according to today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
In July, 1995, Huang Liang, a high school student living in
Yanchi County, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
entered the hospital to receive treatment for
appendicitis. Doctors listed the cause of her death as narcotics
intoxication.
</P>
<P>
Liang's parents filed a lawsuit in the county court calling
for the hospital to pay compensation totalling 260,000 yuan
(31,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The court has not as yet rendered a judgement, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Numerous media reports of medical accidents in recent months
have attracted widespread attention from both the government and
general public. The fact that many of the accidents have resulted
from medical malpractice has prompted the relatives of victims to
file lawsuits to protect their legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also carried a report on a seven year-old girl
who suffered from shock for a 10 hour period following an infusion
at a Beijing hospital. The young girl was transferred to another
hospital and was revived following six hours of intensive care.
</P>
<P>
The girl's parents have filed a medical malpractice lawsuit
asking for compensation totalling 110,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> China's Dry Province Exploiting Groundwater Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
has alleviated water shortages thanks to a special project for
exploiting subterranean water resources organized by the Ministry
of Land and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
The province began the project in 1997 in its extremely dry
eastern, central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
In Jiayuguan city, where the Great Wall ends in the west, for
example, the provincial Geological Prospecting Department sank a
well last year that now pumps 28,000 cubic meters of water daily,
an all-time high in the province.
</P>
<P>
Huachi County lacked groundwater resources, and local people
had to retain floodwater and rainfall. Last year, three wells
were dug to tap drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Another successful effort came in Shandan County. Ten wells
were dug in the Gobi desert, each providing 2,000 cubic meters of
water every day. The county increased more than 660 hectares of
irrigated farmland as a result.
</P>
<P>
The province has verified four large-scale groundwater
sources for major cities and industrial centers, with an estimated
daily capacity of 380,000 cubic meters.

<HEADLINE> China's VCD Production Capacity Catching Up With Market Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China now has 88 legal VCD
production lines with an annual capacity of 330 million video
compact discs.
</P>
<P>
This capacity is not only sufficient to meet the market demand,
but also strengthens the country's ability to combat pirate VCDs,
today's Economic Daily points out.
</P>
<P>
Due to shortfalls in VCD supply, pirate VCDs were once rampant
on markets across the country.
</P>
<P>
In the fight against VCD piracy, government watchdogs seized a
large number of underground VCD production lines. As a counter
measure, these illegal production lines have been used to set up
three VCD production centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong,
resulting in a marked rise in VCD production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the sale of VCD players and personal
computers, China now needs more than 220 million VCDs a
year. Theoretically, this demand can be met by the present
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, VCD producers in China are still constantly battling
pirate VCDs, many of which are turned out by the estimated 150
underground production lines in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The absence of a well-conceived sales network and lack of
product variety also jeopardizes legal VCD makers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese VCD producers are calling for enhanced efforts in the
fight against VCD piracy and in strengthening their production and
sales ability.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank Loan to Back Aviation Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Import and Export Bank
(Eximbank) is to lend two billion yuan to China Aviation
Technology Import and Export Corporation (Catic) to sustain the
corporation's development.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the Framework Agreement for
Extending the Export Seller's Credit Line was signed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank had already provided 890 million yuan in loans to
support Catic's exports of Y-7 transport planes, K-8 trainer
planes, Y-12 planes and other aviation products, said Gu Mingchao,
vice-governor of Eximbank.
</P>
<P>
"Aviation, as a high-tech industry, has always been a top
priority in our decisions regarding the flow of our loans, for the
development of this industry will spur the growth of related
industries and technology," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
For three years running since 1995, Catic has ranked among the
top 20 in terms of import and export values in China's foreign
trade businesses, said Yang Chunshu, general manager of Catic.
</P>
<P>
The two billion yuan is the biggest seller's credit China
Eximbank has so far provided to the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Catic is an export-oriented conglomerate mainly engaged in
importing and exporting aviation products, mechanical and
electrical products and equipment and technology in non-aviation
sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, after numerous difficulties, Catic achieved an import
and export value of 1.51 billion U.S. dollars, 690 million
U.S. dollars of which was in exports, up 14.6 percent from the
1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
As a policy bank, China Eximbank has lent steadfast support to
the export of the corporation's mechanical and electrical
products. To make the extension of the loans easier, the bank has
already simplified its ratification procedures.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Pleased with Forming of Election Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Friday that he was
very pleased that an election committee representing a wide range
of community interests has been smoothly elected.
</P>
<P>
Its 800 members will have the important task of electing 10
Legislative Council members in the coming election on May 24, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
All the 800 members of the Election Committee were determined
after 588 members were elected through the subsector elections
held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday's elections, 212 members of the Election
Committee had been decided. They were 95 members returned from
four uncontested subsectors, 77 ex-officio members and 40
representatives nominated by the Religious Subsector.
</P>
<P>
Tung described the result of Thursday's subsector elections as
encouraging as more than 32,600 voters from different community
sectors cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
"The elections were conducted in an open and fair manner," Tung
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the elections signify the beginning of a new phase in
preparing for the election of the first SAR Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"We will step up our publicity efforts to increase public
awareness about the LegCo election on May 24," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see a lively election atmosphere throughout Hong
Kong in the coming weeks," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Takes Measures Against Diarrhea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities have been pushing
for anti-diarrhea measures in a bid to improve the image of
Thailand and boost tourism under a two-year "Amazing Thailand
Campaign," Friday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong press earlier reported that some returning
tourists contracted cholera after visiting Thailand. The reports
named some tourist spots as suspected places where the tourists
developed the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration officials insisted that
the infection was not caused by food taken at the suspected
places, particularly the Damnoen Saduak floating market, about 100
kilometers south of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
To restore the tarnished reputation of the tourist areas, the
provincial authorities concerned have asked local officials to pay
special attention to improving food and environmental sanitation,
especially in tourist attraction areas.
</P>
<P>
Precautionary measures have been strengthened in the past few
weeks and will be continued particularly during and after the
upcoming Songkran (water-spraying) festival in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Health officials have been sent to detect the source of
infection and people exposed to bacteria. They will examine the
trace of bacteria especially at tourist areas and take samples of
canal water, drinking water, food and containers for laboratory
tests every week.

ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Pakistani English newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- The ruling Pakistan Muslim League parliamentary party asked
on Thursday to cancel the private power project agreements, which
the previous government had signed with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan's top official economic managers shot down a
proposal Thursday during a comprehensive discussion on economy in
the special cabinet meeting, seeking a rescheduling of foreign
loans in view of economic conditions the country is confronted
with.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim:
</P>
<P>
-- Diminishing hopes of arranging money for balance of payments
through privatization and the precarious state of economy has

land to commercial buyers in order to raise funds to meet the
current expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The Frontier Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In a major development, the Taliban militia Thursday

<HEADLINE> U.S. Report: Transition in Hong Kong Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
expressed satisfaction with the operation of Hong Kong since China
resumed its exercising of sovereignty. The May legislative
elections in the former British colony are also expected to be
fair and clean.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said in a report to Congress that the
transition process has gone smoothly since July 1, 1997, when Hong
Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty after a century or more of
British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of interference from the Chinese
government in local affairs," the report said, disproving fears by
some Americans that Beijing would tighten control over Hong Kong
following its return.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's civil service remains independent, and senior
officials, including those who have been critical of China, have
been retained," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Hong Kong continued to play an important role as
a regional finance center by actively participating in efforts to
address the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong press remains free and continues to comment
critically on the P.R.C. (People's Republic of China) and its
leaders," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Demonstrations -- often critical of the P.R.C. -- continue to
be held. Mainland Chinese companies are subject to the same laws
and prudent supervision as everyone else, and the rule of law and
the independent judiciary remain in place as guarantees of Hong
Kong's free and open society," the study noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong officials have expressed the belief that the upcoming
elections will be held fairly in accordance with the Basic Law
which governs the special administrative region.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition over Hong Kong has become an indisputable
fact in the United States over the past nine months despite some
problems, a commentator said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes 1.73 Trillion Dollar Budget for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate okayed a 1.73
trillion U.S. dollar federal budget for 1999 Thursday that
promises modest tax reductions, healthy surpluses and a small sum
for schools, child care and health.
</P>
<P>
The budget was passed by a 57-41 vote after Republican leaders
promised five conservative senators they would pursue more than 30
billion dollars in tax cuts over the five years proposed in the
fiscal blueprint.
</P>
<P>
The Senate budget projects an 8 billion dollar surplus this
year, which would be the first since the government's 3 billion
dollars in black ink in 1969. Through the 2003, surpluses would
total 153 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Like U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Senate plan would not
spend the surpluses to reduce the 5.4 trillion dollar national
debt that decades of borrowing have produced. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and some others in the Senate want to use surpluses to
create personal retirement accounts for Americans, a proposal that
would probably meet tougher opposition from the White
House.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Thursday suggested holding a referendum on whether to
allow foreign representatives to help settle the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the recommendation in his letters to Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic and to Chairman of the parliament Milomir Minic, the
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslav leaders have refused to allow foreign
representatives to participate in endeavors to solve the internal
problems of Yugoslavia, particularly the Kosovo issue, which is an
internal affair of the Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
This stance, he said, is important in order to safeguard
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic explained that he recommended the referendum since
Yugoslavia was facing a threat of renewed pressure.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and the Serbian government
have expressed support for the suggestion.

UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua)-- The United Nations is to end
the use of gratis personnel in peacekeeping operations to ensure

</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping

Phasing out gratis personnel was strongly demanded by many

</P>
<P>
Gratis personnel are provided and paid mainly by the United
States and other developed countries, but many delegates,
particularly from developing nations, doubt they work fairly in
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Miyet told the Special Committee that the plan would be
presented to the U.N. Controller and the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 106 posts in his department would be converted
to open recruitment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticism of "Buy Thai" Campaign countered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is prepared to defend
itself against the U.S. allegation that its drive against spending
on luxury goods among Thais was protectionist and discouraged
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Defending a series of campaigns including the "Buy-Thai"
campaign, Thai Prime Minister Office Minister Supatra Masadit said
Thailand has the right to drive a domestic campaign to create
awareness among Thais and help save dwindling foreign currencies
through not buying luxury goods, the Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In an economic boom, we had a lot of money to spend but now
people do not have enough to spend. So we have to save foreign
currencies and we want (foreign countries) to understand that we
have to survive ourselves," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Supatra said she was not surprised by a U.S. trade report which
criticized the "Buy-Thai" campaign as representing a trade
barrier, as it was within the rights of the U.S. to take care of
their own national interests.
</P>
<P>
She also vowed to continue with the campaigns and revealed that
the second one in the series will soon be launched.
</P>
<P>
The United States voiced its complaints in the National Trade
Estimated Report released on Wednesday on Foreign Trade Barriers,
listing Thailand among 49 countries and three trading groups, as
maintaining barriers against U.S. goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbbhand Paribatra
Thursday defended the "Buy-Thai" campaign as a symbolic gesture to
create awareness among local people to economize in times of
severe economic crises.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign was an "internal mobilization" effort
calling for national solidarity rather than aimed at building
barriers against foreign trade.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Latin American countries

MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Three people were suffocated with a
faint odor in a septic tank inside a bakery east of Manila and a
fourth was downed while they were trying to clean it overnight,
police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police said four workers of a plumbing services firm collapsed
one by one after inhaling Thursday night an obnoxious smell
emitted by the sewerage inside a six-feet deep septic tank owned
by a bakeshop in the village of San Isidro Cainta, Rizal province.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were able to revive only one worker whose three
companions, who first descended into the tank, instantly died as
they inhaled the foul gas produced by the sewerage's pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Loses Out in Yugoslavia Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is suffering huge
economic losses as it continues to enforce sanctions maintained by
the European Union (EU) against Yugoslavia, the Hungarian Foreign
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Horvath Gabor was quoted by the
daily, People's Freedom, as saying on Thursday that Hungary had no
choice but to join embargoes on Yugoslavia and bear the losses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that during sanctions over recent years,
Hungary had suffered a direct loss of up to two billion Forint
(272 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government held a meeting on Thursday focusing on
the economic loss linked to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Kiss Elemer said after the meeting that
the government was still unable to predict its further economic
loss.
</P>
<P>
Talking to People's Freedom, Horvath said Hungarian border
soldiers would, according to the name list provided by the EU,
refuse those responsible for the Kosovo issue to escape into
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The EU started to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia on February
1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Residents Lured by Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China reported continued brisk
sales of state treasury bonds as bank interest rates decline
steadily.
</P>
<P>
The country's banking system sold 105.7 billion yuan in
government treasury bonds between Feb. 20 and March 31, the
Shanghai Securities News reported today. The report was based on
the latest statistics from the People's Bank of China, the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume represented nearly 88.1 percent of China's
scheduled annual issue of 120 billion yuan in certificate bonds,
which will be offered through Oct. 31, the daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume through the end of last month included 65.7
billion yuan in three-year bonds and nearly 40 billion yuan in
five-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said falling interest rates on bank deposits have made
treasury bonds a comparatively more attractive investment choice
for Chinese residents, whose savings deposits totaled well over 4
trillion yuan by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China has cut its average bank interest rates four times since
May of 1996, with the latest on March 25.

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Guangdong-Hong Kong Cooperation Conference will provide more
opportunities for Shenzhen, one of China's five special economic
zones and a neighboring city to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Li Zibin said that the enterprise-dominated cooperation
between the two sides will be further promoted by more government
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Li outlined four areas for the effort: to extend port passage
time and facilitate the linking of port infrastructures; to join
hands in building key cross-boundary projects; to cooperate on
high-tech and new technology; and to cooperate in harnessing the
Shenzhen River.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen and Hong Kong cooperation is a major part of the
Guangdong-Hong Kong relationship. To date, Hong Kong enterprises
have opened 15,000 businesses in Shenzhen, and 65 percent of the
city's overseas investment comes from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The city reported 25 billion U.S. dollars in foreign trade last
year, 80 percent of which was done via Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A European Union assistance
program has markedly improved the buffalo breed of Dehong Dai and
Jingbo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The 13-million-yuan (1.566 million U.S. dollars) program has
helped import buffaloes from India and Pakistan to be cross-bred
with Dehong buffaloes by way of a frozen-breeding technique.
</P>
<P>
The scheme improved the Dehong buffalo and enabled it to
produce nutritious milk. Though considered one of four fine breeds
in China, the Dehong buffalo previously could only be used for
ploughing and providing meat.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is expected to end in 2001, is expected to
raise the income of local farmers.

HAVANA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto

announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and
his Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes.

<P>
The spokesman added that the appointment of a new Spanish
ambassador to Cuba would normalize diplomatic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The post has been empty for the past 16 months since the Cuban
government withdrew accreditation in December, 1996, from then
Ambassador Jose Coderch after he said he would open the doors of
the embassy to Cuban dissidents.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Prime Minister Aznar appointed Eduardo
Junco as Spain's new ambassador to Cuba on Thursday.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Sanctions Committee on Iraq has encouraged exporters to ensure
timely delivery of humanitarian goods to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Department of Public Information said on Thursday that
all states engaged in the export of humanitarian goods are
encouraged to present applications to the committee as soon as
contracts are concluded.
</P>
<P>
The attention of the exporters should be drawn to the
committee's reminder of the need to execute the contract in the
appropriate time-frame, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The committee has recently included the reminder in its
approval letters to ensure delivery by the required date as
indicated in the contracts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in 1996,
allowing Iraq to sell two billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in
every six months to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq, the
Security Council decided in February to increase the Iraqi export
of oil to 5.2 billion dollars in every six months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly complained about the delay in the delivery
of humanitarian goods.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Federal Official Seeks Leadership of Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Jean Charest, leader of Canada's
Progressive Conservative Party, bid farewell to federal politics
on Thursday for politics in his home province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of Commons, Charest told his fellow
parliamentarians that he was seeking the leadership of Quebec's
provincial Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
There has been mounting pressure across the country for Charest
to take the helm of the Quebec Liberal Party to fight separatist
forces since Daniel Johnson announced a month ago that he would
step down to give his party a better chance.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided in my turn to listen to my heart," said the
39-year-old politician from the French-speaking province.
</P>
<P>
Polls have suggested that Quebec Liberals would beat the
ruling Parti Quebecois in the next election with Charest as the
leader.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Quebec... to make sure that Quebec can soar above
the interests of political parties, so that we can set course for the
future, a future where we can share with other people in Canada who
want the same thing as Quebecers," Charest said.
</P>
<P>
Charest was first elected to the House of Commons in 1984. He
held several cabinet jobs in Brian Mulroney's government.
</P>
<P>
A unity debate during the 1995 referendum in Quebec made
Charest famous across Canada. He was widely deemed as a great
supporter of federal forces, which won a slim majority against
separatists.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus: IMF Approach Is Working in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Asia is showing "a number of
encouraging signs" of recovery from its financial crisis with help
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said IMF managing
director Michael Camdessus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Press Club in Washington that Thailand and
South Korea had made good progress with economic reforms, but
there was a lot of work to do before stability was restored in
Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief said the "encouraging signs" included the return
of market confidence in Thailand and South Korea and significant
gains in their currencies and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
However, he also pointed out that Indonesia had lost valuable
time on transforming its economy, causing its currency to
devaluate and inflation to shoot up dangerously.
</P>
<P>
"This is why it is urgently important to get Indonesia's reform
program back on track so as to strengthen the rupiah before
hyperinflation sets in," the IMF chief warned.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis rocked Asia last Summer, the
IMF-sponsored bailout program has pledged 110 billion U.S. dollars
to trouble-ridden Asian nations, of which Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea are the three hardest-hit.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said negotiations with Indonesia have been underway
and made good progress in the last two weeks. He expected an
agreement on a program of economic reforms could be concluded soon.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the U.S. Congress to approve a Clinton
administration proposal to provide the IMF with 18 billion dollars
in new funding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate approved new IMF funding last week. House
action is expected after the Easter recess.
</P>
<P>
Replying to criticism that the IMF was caught offguard by the
economic troubles in Asia, Camdessus suggested four areas where it
could work with member countries to prevent future crises.
</P>
<P>
They were making public financial information, strengthening
domestic financial systems, encouraging capital flow
liberalization and fighting corruption.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sent a satellite into
orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base to study solar activity.
</P>
<P>
The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer satellite was
transported by jet to an elevation of 39,000 feet (about 12,090
meters) over the Pacific Ocean Wednesday and then boosted on a
Pegasus XL rocket launched from the jet.
</P>
<P>
During its one year observation of the Sun, the satellite will
study the connection between the Sun's magnetic fields and the
heat of its corona.
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the mission will reveal more of the secrets of
the Sun's activities. Solar activities could endanger astronauts
and disrupt the use of orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
Intense solar activities, such as massive flaring and huge
eruptions, may occur in the coming months of the Sun's cycle.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Drops in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation dropped
markedly to 5.49 percent in March, but the figure for the first
three months of this year reached 25.13 percent, falling short of
the 20 percent target set by the government for 1998, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the fiscal year 1997/98 (ending March
31) stands at 34.22 percent, as compared to 5.17 percent in the
previous corresponding period, the official Antara News Agency
Friday quoted chief of the bureau Sugito as saying.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rates in February and January were recorded at 12.76
percent and 6.88 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Factors contributing to the relatively low March rate were
lower demand and distribution of subsidized foodstuffs by the
Logistics Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said price hikes in food (by 40 percent) and clothes (by
24 percent) were the main factors behind the inflation in March
and in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said the inflation rate for the 1997/98 fiscal year was
high because of the impact of the current economic crisis and
prolonged drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government has decided
to cut its import customs tariff to 3 percent from 5 percent as of
April 1, the Slovak news agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the past three months the country
has adjusted its import tariff. Slovakia reduced import taxes from
7 percent to 5 percent on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the decision was made at the request of
the World Trade Organization so the country could enter the
international trade organization early.
</P>
<P>
The decision was welcomed by the members of the Central Europe
Free Trade Zone and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Slovakia will reduce its revenue by 2 billion
koruna (about 60.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Slovak government has also decided to completely lift its
import customs tariff on October 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Chinese Residents Become More Reasonable With Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese residents have become
increasingly more reasonable and realistic in the distribution of
their disposable personal financial assets, according to a
national survey.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the central bank in 34 large- and
medium-size cities in late February shows that Chinese residents'
willingness to put their spare money in banks has increased, China
Securities reported today.
</P>
<P>
If bank interest rates remain unchanged, 51.9 percent of the
survey respondents said they would continue to save money. The
rate was 5.5 percentage points higher than a previous survey three
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
Only 24.5 percent of those surveyed said they would withdraw
bank deposits for shopping, down 5.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Some 23.5 percent of the respondents said they would invest
their savings in securities. That rate was almost unchanged from
the previous survey.
</P>
<P>
In response to supposed price rises, 41.1 percent of those
surveyed said they would nevertheless continue to put their money
in banks, up 3.2 percentage points from the previous survey. The
proportion of people who would withdrew money for shopping was
down 2.2 percentage points to 27.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 29.1 percent of the survey respondents expected their
income to rise in the next two years, while 15.8 percent said
their income would decline.
</P>
<P>
The survey was done before China issued its first two
securities investment funds and the latest interest rate reduction
on March 25 and, therefore, does not reflect the impact of the two
events on residents' attitudes toward their disposable money.

PRAGUE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
announced Thursday that elections for the House of Representatives
would take place in June.
</P>
<P>
A decision signed by the president confirmed the date had been
set on June 19 and 20, two years into a maximum four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The current 200-seat House of Representatives, dominated by the
Civic Democratic Party (CDP), was elected in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, since CDP Chairman Vaclav Klaus stepped down as prime
minister last year, political parties have been pressing for an
early election.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion poll shows that the biggest opposition
party, the Social Democratic Party, enjoys the highest popularity
and has a good chance of winning the most seats.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gets Loans to Boost Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen foreign banks will give the
Philippine government a club loan of 750 million U.S. dollars this
month in order to boost its shrinking gross international
reserves, the Philippine newspaper Manila Bulletin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here Thursday, each of the 15 foreign
banks will contribute 50 million dollars to the loan which is
expected to come in next week, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
Thursday the new loan confirms that foreign banks remain confident
of the country's credit worthiness.
</P>
<P>
According to Singson, the central bank wants to build its
foreign reserves to between 10 billion and 11 billion U.S. dollars
by June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Under a new program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the central bank should have 12 billion dollars of gross
international reserves which are equivalent to 1.9 months worth of
imports this year. By next year, the Philippines' foreign reserves
should be equal to its 2.3 months of imports.
</P>
<P>
The 15 foreign banks include the Bank of America, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Citibank, Deutsche Bank and Hong Kong Shanghai
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before June, the Philippines will also get 500 million dollars
from the global bonds issued Friday in London and another 331
million dollars from the IMF's last loan program to boost its
foreign reserves.

<HEADLINE> Jiuquan Launch Center Transformed Into Oasis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The natural environment of the
Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, which launched China's first
satellite in 1969, has greatly improved thanks to local
environmental protection efforts carried out over the past 40
years.
</P>
<P>
The center, located on the edge of the Badain Jaran Desert in
northwest China's Gansu Province, was built 40 years ago and is
still the largest facility of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiuquan, which features lush greenery and blooming flowers,
hosts numerous visitors, both Chinese and foreign. The only sign
of bleakness is a barren mountain which rises on the horizon in
the western outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
The center and the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences have successfully introduced 194
varieties of vegetation, completed afforestation projects covering
over 300 ha., used plants to create natural fences stretching
38,000 meters, and planted orchards covering some 85 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Local residents recalled that the region was nothing more than
an endless barren desert with occasional tufts of grass when tens
of thousands of soldiers arrived to construct the base.
</P>
<P>
Kang Xiuying, a retired kindergarten teacher who has spent most
of her life in the region, said that the salt and soda content in
the soil was formally so high that people were forced to wrap
their feet and legs with cloth to protect their skin from parching
and cracking.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that cobblestones were often hot enough to burn
one's feet, and the scorching heat sometimes penetrating the soles
of shoes. Dry air also caused chronic chapped lips and nosebleeds,
and the sun and wind turned the skin dark.

<P>
The stark reality of life in the region prompted local
residents and soldiers alike to try extend the greatest possible
efforts to improve the harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
A nature reserve covering dozens of hectares has been
established near the base, and strict regulations have been
adopted to protect diversiform-leaved poplars covering tens of
thousands of hectares surrounding the center. In addition, grazing
and logging have been banned in various parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Licorice root, an herbal Chinese medicine, grows in areas close
to the center and strict precautions have been introduced to
protect the species from excessive exploitation. Hunting has also
been banned in the region.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are taught the importance of protecting trees and
plants. Extensive forests and grasslands have been developed on
the outskirts of the town, with large tracts of farmland under
cultivation in nearby areas. A reservoir with a storage capacity
of 18 million cu.m. is surrounded by paddy and wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
Pilots formerly encountered difficulties spotting the town
which blended in with the desert due to the lack of
greenery. Today, however, the center is readily discernible due to
a 61 percent vegetation coverage.

<HEADLINE> Amicable Border Relations Help North China Province's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What a big change!" she exclaimed. "It's as if all the cities
and roads had sprung up overnight."
</P>
<P>
Natasha is not the only person amazed by the ever-changing look
of the province which shares a 3,000-kilometer border with
Russia. In less than 10 years, the border area has a dozen new
cities and the number of border ports has increased to 15 from
only three in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The development of Heilongjiang is closely tied to the relations
between China and Russia. During the 1950s the province took the
lead in the country in industrialization because of the
technological and financial aid provided by the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
However, the later deterioration of bilateral relations between
the two countries as well as the corresponding military
confrontations thwarted the province's growth.
</P>
<P>
The normalization of Sino-Russian relations has breathed new
life into the province. Since 1985, China has reduced its military
forces along the border while issuing a set of preferential
policies to attract foreign investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the boundary tablets erected along the
eastern section of the Sino-Russian borders, the province has
increased border trade with Russia and other countries in the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2.17 million tons of commodities were transported
across the border and the number of people entering or exiting the
country reached 1.38 million.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, China reopened the Beian-Heihe railway,
which has greatly boosted tourism and trade in the Sino-Russia
border region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also agreed to jointly build a bridge
over Heilongjiang, the boundary river, and have finished the field
survey work.

<HEADLINE> IMF May Amend Bailout Package to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will add important measures to its previous bailout
agreement signed in January with the Indonesian government in an
attempt to make it more "adaptable," an IMF senior official said.
</P>
<P>
IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said here
Thursday that the amended program will allow greater adaptability.
"Flexibility is not quite the right word. Adaptability probably
is."
</P>
<P>
The IMF official, who arrived here Thursday from Washington,
said negotiations between the fund and Indonesia, which have been
going on for more than two weeks, are going well.
</P>
<P>
"I came to review the progress that has been made and go
through the agreement so far, and also take advantage of the fact
that there will be some bankers here this weekend (who) will
review progress on the corporate debt issue with the private
sector as well," he said. "A lot more needs to be done."
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations are nearing conclusion. "I'm not sure
when we will conclude yet because we want to be sure that we get
all the details correct and we will take as much time as it
needs."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the IMF put on hold the second tranche of the 43
billion U.S. dollar bailout package totaling 3 billion dollars
because of Indonesia's failure to implement the reform program
signed in January.
</P>
<P>
According to a 50-point agreement signed on January 15 between
the IMF and the Indonesian government, Indonesia promised to
conduct wide ranging economic, financial and trade reforms in the
country in exchange for the IMF assistance in a bid to overcome
its monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
As a result of the crisis, Indonesia is now faced with spiralling
inflation, growing unemployment and other serious economic and
social problems.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by its Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss has
been talking with Indonesian officials since March 18 to review
the country's economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Vicenza Defeats Chelsea in First-leg Semifinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vicenza toppled Chelsea with a lonely
goal to win the first-leg semifinal of the European Cup Winners
Cup on home turf on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At Menti Stadium, midfielder Lamberto Zauli slammed home with
his left foot in the 16th minute, beating a defender and goalie Ed
de Goey from the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team dominated the first half and held off the
steady English pressure to keep its slim edge till the final
whistle for the victory.
</P>
<P>
The goal came one minute after another scoring chance, again by
the 26-year-old Zauli, was saved by the goalkeeper in a great dive.
</P>
<P>
Striker Pasquale Luiso led Vicenza's most dangerous second-half
action in the 57th, but was tipped off the bar by De Goey.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's Italian stars Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Di Matteo and
player-manager Gianluca Vialli failed to live up to their
reputation, days after its triumph in the English League Cup final
against Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
However Chelsea still was the favored team to reach the Cup
finals, as it's likely to recover the one-goal deficit in the
second leg at home on April 16.

ROME, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Italian military sources said
Thursday that amphibious forces of the North Atlantic Treaty

It was also designed to improve the ability of the forces in
coordinating with those troops already deployed in the region to

<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico exported two million tons of vegetables
to the United States in 1997, earning 2.4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

season is predicted to be 450,000 tons, a 31 percent increase over
the previous season.
</P>
<P>
The rise is attributed to the cultivated area expansion from
640,000 hectares to 830,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaraguan Vice-President Enrique Bolanos is
seeking 1.2 billion dollars in financial aid "to support the

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Romanian coach Dumitru Dumitriu was
suspended on Thursday as his AEK Athens had poor performances both
in the Greek league and European Cups.
</P>
<P>
AEK's deputy president Dimitris Tirovolas said in a brief
statement that Dumitriu was "suspended" until Saturday when AEK
president Lakis Nikolaou will return from a trip to the United
States to deal with the case.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, suspension always means dismissal for soccer
coaches.
</P>
<P>
Dumitriu has coached AEK's since June, but the club had a slump
including a 0-0 draw against Panachaiki which almost destroyed
AEK's chances for a second-place finish in the Greek league and a
berth in the European Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Besides, AEK was eliminated from the European Cup Winners Cup
on March 19 after a 2-1 loss to Lokomotive Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The club's decline started earlier this year when three of the
team's key strikers were sidelined with injuries.

BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Fredi Bobic scored the winner in the
fourth minute of injury time to pave Stuttgart for a 2-1 win over
Lokomotiv Moscow in the first leg of the European Cup Winners' Cup
semifinal in Stuttgart on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bobic connected a pass off Kriszian Listzes and beat a Russian

However, the game was mainly dominated by the Russians who
outwitted the error-prone Germans with waves of swift attacks.

In the 23rd minute, Zaza Dzhanashia opened the account from the
edge of the Stuttgart penalty area with a low shot for the early
lead for Lokomotiv Moscow.
</P>

Jonathan Akpoboriev missed a close range shot and Nigmatullin
blocked a 22-meter free-kick and a long-range shot from Krasimir
Balakov.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes before halftime, Stuttgart found the equaliser
through Akpoborie who headed in a pass off Mitko Stojkovski.

U.S. dollars) to thousands of Canadian women under a tentative
settlement reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The settlement still requires the approval of the U.S.
bankruptcy court and Ontario and Quebec courts, said reports
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It could take months before some 10,000 women in the two
provinces could receive any compensation from the U.S. company,
which was the world's largest maker of silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the United
States in 1995. It was reported to agree to settle the Canadian
class action as part of its reorganization plans.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's settlement is the third major one offered to women
in the two Canadian provinces.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. gave 28 million dollars to
5,000 women. And in February this year, Baxter Healthcare paid 22
million dollars to settle with 3,000 women.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, silicone implants have been banned in Canada
because of women's complaints that they have ruptured and caused
illnesses including autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that some 150,000 Canadian women have had breast
implants, with about one third of them suffering from various
ailments.

NEW YORK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed broadly higher
Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average up 118.32 to
8,986.64, a new high against the previous peak of 8906.43 scored
on March 20.
</P>
<P>
At one point Thursday afternoon, it almost touched the 9,000
mark with only 2.89 points away.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary figures, advancing issues led
decliners by an 11-7 margin on the New York Stock Exchange where
heavy trading was done with 669.17 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P's 500 stock list was up 10.56 to 1,118.71 and the NYSE

Some analysts say the large infusion of cash into stock mutual
funds in the first quarter is likely to push stock prices even

WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday a 198 million U.S. dollar loan to help finance the 330
million dollar federal water resources management project in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
This project will benefit 1.3 million people, or 260,000

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Expressing its concern over
the impasse in the Middle East peace process, the Security Council
Thursday urged parties concerned in the region to make efforts to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The current president of the Security Council, Hisashi Owada of
Japan, told reporters after the council was briefed by Under
Secretary-General Sir Kieran Prendergast on a recent Middle East
trip by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, "There was a widely shared
recognition that the impasse which seems to prevail in the Middle
East peace process is a source of concern and further efforts on
the part of the parties would be very much required."
</P>
<P>
"Reference was made during the council's discussion on its
resolutions concerning the Middle East, including resolution 425
adopted in 1978," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged Israel's immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The government of Israel Wednesday decided that it would
implement the resolution provided Lebanon guaranteed to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Owada told reporters resolution 425
should be implemented unconditionally.

UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is expected to report to the Security Council of the United
Nations on the sources of the conflicts in Africa on April 17,
current council President Hisashi Owada told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The council will hold a full-scale debate on the

The U.N. chief was required by the Security Council to
introduce the report at a meeting held at foreign ministers' level
on September 25, 1997 to discuss the need for promoting peace and
security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report was postponed due to Annan's preoccupation with a
number of other issues, particularly the crisis over U.N. weapons
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the United Nations has a peacekeeping
mission in Angola and it has decided to establish one in the
Central African Republic in mid-April. Besides, the United Nations
is actively involved in the development, humanitarian aid and
relief projects in Africa.

<HEADLINE> EU Assembly Outraged by Detention of Journalist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament Thursday
said that it was outraged by Turkey's detention of an Italian
journalist during its celebration of the Kurdish new year.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) assembly also said that the detention
of the journalist, Domiano Frisullo, could further hinder Turkey's
EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
It said it was "outraged by the behavior of the Turkish police
who, during the celebrations, arrested a large number of people
indiscriminately, in many cases having subjected them to arbitrary
beatings."
</P>
<P>
The Italian journalist was remanded in custody on March 21, on
charges of provoking hatred and enmity. He was first detained
during a march in the southeastern city of Diyjarbakir to mark the
Newroz, a traditional time of Kurdish protest.
</P>
<P>
"Closer cooperation between the European Union and Turkey is
conditional, first and foremost, upon full respect for human
rights," said the European Parliament, adding that Frisullo was
only exercising his basic rights of freedom of expression and
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been frustrated by the EU's refusal to begin entry
talks with it due to its human rights record.

<HEADLINE> E. African Bank Governors Hope to Keep Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- General bank governors of
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya have recommended that focus of the east
Africa region is to keep the inflation rate to less than five percent
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
They urged governments of three member states to provide
prudent fiscal policies, refrain from borrowing from central banks and
direct more resources to investment rather than consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Thursday, the governors have
also called for attaining a high and sustainable growth rate of the
real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). They have set seven percent as the
minimum target by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the first EAC Monetary Affairs
Committee meeting held in Arusha Town in north Tanzania
recently, recommended the three states put in place necessary
infrastructure and speed up privatization process in order to
facilitate growth of their economies.
</P>
<P>
It has listed roads, efficient and reliable communication and power
systems as among the critical infrastructure requiring attention of
member states.
</P>
<P>
The governors further recommended member countries build up gross
foreign reserves to a level equivalent to normal imports of six months
and raise the national savings ratio as a percentage of GDP to at
least 20 percent in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
They urged member states to pursue debt
reduction initiatives in order to reduce both domestic and foreign
indebtedness, including observing statutory borrowing limited and
strengthening of the debt management function.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the recent economic performance of the member states,
the governors said the implementation of market friendly policies has
promoted macro-economic stability of the member states.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said growth in all member states
decelerated during 1997, mainly due to adverse weather conditions.
This was accompanied by inflationary pressures, particularly in
Uganda, and also widening of current account and budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The governors noted that domestic debt is becoming a major problem
in Kenya and Tanzania while in Uganda, the government is a net
creditor.
</P>
<P>
The governors meeting was attended by Idris Rashidi (Tanzania),
Charles Kikonyongo (Uganda) and Micah Cheserem (Kenya).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Softens Travel Warning for Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Department Thursday
issued a new advisory on traveling to Iran, which signals a
softening tone as compared to the previous warning.
</P>
<P>
The new advisory recommended that Americans defer travel to
Iran rather than avoid it altogether as the previous warning did.
</P>
<P>
The new alert noted there have been some non-official exchanges
between Iranians and Americans since Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami's call for a "dialogue of civilizations" and increase in
private exchanges.
</P>
<P>
But it added there is still evidence that hostility to the
United States remains in some segments of the Iranian population
and some elements of the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The previous warning, dated last July 8, less than a month
before Khatami took office, advised all U.S. citizens against
traveling to Iran, saying the country "remains dangerous because
of the generally anti-American atmosphere and Iranian government
hostility to the United States."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that she
noted some warmth with which an American wrestling team was
received several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian wrestling team will participate in a tournament
Saturday in Oklahoma.

Thursday cleared four of U.S. President Bill Clinton's nominees
for federal judgeships, submitting them for Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 vacancies are waiting to be filled.

Democrats blame Republican opposition to what they called

at the start of the meeting that the judges wouldn't be
considered, upsetting the panel's top Democrat, Senator Patrick
Leahy.
</P>
<P>
Leahy pushed for a vote, which came at the end of the session
after the committee cleared a separate bill.
</P>
<P>
Leahy said it would be irresponsible to delay the judges. "I
think it attacks the independence of the court and I think it is
not a responsible act on the part of the United States Senate," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch 1998 Budget Deficit Forecast to Meet Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit of the
Netherlands is forecast to be narrowing down to 1.6 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) this year from 2.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said in a report that the
budget deficit was on course this year to finish a shade below
government expectations and comfortably within European Monetary
Union (EMU) norms.
</P>
<P>
"The deficit is comfortably below the EMU norm of 3 percent,"
Zalm said in a letter to parliament. The 1998 budget allows for a
1.7 percent deficit.
</P>
<P>
In his so-called "spring report," the Dutch finance minister
said inflation was lower than expected, leading to a 3.0 billion
guilder (1.4 billion U.S. dollar) reduction in the overall
spending target.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government aimed to stay within the new limit by
adjusting allowances to various ministries and encouraging pay
restraint in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Zalm said spending on social insurance and unemployment
benefits was on track but healthcare costs were above budget.
</P>
<P>
Spending on education, housing subsidies and benefits to asylum
seekers was also up. Zalm said the government was taking measures
to stem the flow of asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
He also said more money was going into higher education and
infrastructure.

According to Palestinian police Sharif was shot dead and his
body moved beside a car that blew up on Sunday in the West Bank
town of Ramallah. Hamas believed Israelis were involved in the
shooting of Sharif and vowed vengeance on Israel.

The U.S. officials said the Palestinian Authority was looking
